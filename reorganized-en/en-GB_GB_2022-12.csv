Press ReleaseDecember 23, 2022RELATED TOPICSTECHNOLOGYPHOTOH.E. Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications and Fady Jameel Vice Chairman, Community JameelDubai, United Arab Emirates: The Jameel Clinic, the epicentre of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted yesterday a one-day conference titled ‘AI Cures MENASA: Clinical AI and data solutions for health’, in partnership with the UAE Artificial Intelligence Office, Community Jameel,  and Wellcome. Held at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai, the conference was attended by H.E. Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications.
The conference brought together pioneers in AI and health from the Jameel Clinic, including MacArthur ‘genius grant’ Fellows Professor Regina Barzilay and Professor Dina Katabi, Dr Adam Yala and Dr Shrooq Alsenan, a Jameel Clinic research fellow from Saudi Arabia, together with representatives from major hospitals and public health agencies across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region. The conference marks the first international venture of ‘AI Cures’, the Jameel Clinic’s platform for collaboration that launched in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fady Jameel, vice chairman of Community Jameel, said: “We are excited to be able to help bring together such an inspiring gathering of scientists, policymakers, public health officials and hospital leaders at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai. The work of the Jameel Clinic has the potential to transform healthcare for millions of people around the world, and we are excited to see the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network expanding in the MENASA region and rolling out clinical AI tools around the world for equitable impact for all.”
Professor Regina Barzilay, AI faculty lead at the Jameel Clinic, said: “Ensuring that the cutting-edge clinical AI research being done at MIT can be utilised in diverse clinical settings is critical to our mission at the Jameel Clinic. We look forward to combining the expertise of Jameel Clinic researchers with the expertise of local clinicians and public health officials in the MENASA region to maximise the impact of clinical AI tools on patient lives.”
Tariq Khokhar, head of data for science & health at Wellcome, said: “AI tools have an exciting role to play in transforming healthcare for patients around the world and advancing health research. But first, researchers, policymakers, clinicians and healthcare managers must work together to test them in diverse settings rigorously, so we know they work for different people and under different circumstances. This will ensure they’re safe for everyone and maximise their potentially life-saving potential.”

That in itself isn’t very unusual. What set these selfies apart, however, were that they were more like portraits commissioned from artists. Lots of artists.Artist Kim Leutwyler.Credit: Steven SiewertAlbums would be filled with pictures of the same person in an array of styles. Some looked like oil paintings, others like scenes from anime. With every swipe, my friends appeared through a different lens, as though they had been reimagined by a team of different artists. As it turns out, this was the truth – kind of. They’d used the app Lensa, which for a fee allows users to upload a series of selfies and in return get an album full of “avatars” created by AI.For Kim Leutwyler, an artist and six-time Archibald Prize finalist, this raised a red flag. “I was very sceptical about where the source of all of this imagery was coming from,” they tell me from their Sydney studio. After some digging they discovered “there were hundreds, if not thousands of artists saying that their work had been completely ripped off – their exact colour, composition, style; these things that they’ve been working for years to develop.” Leutwyler, it turned out, was one of them.After being directed to a website that allows users to search the databases being used to train Lensa and other AI art-generating apps, “I uploaded my own work and saw that almost every painting, every portrait I’ve ever shared on the internet was on there.” They were far from alone. “I found Blak Douglas, Vincent Namatjira, Yvette Coppersmith, Del Kathryn Barton, my friends, and really prominent Australian artists whose work is being used without their knowledge, without their consent, and without any compensation.”With AI becoming more prominent, not just across art but across all areas of life, what does a situation like this mean for artists and the future of the creative industries?Are artists at risk of becoming obsolete?“A year or two back if you’d asked me whether graphic design was a safe job, I’d have said, yes, it was pretty safe job – anything in the creative industries is a pretty safe job from racing against the machines. But now, actually, I would be somewhat worried if I was a graphic designer,” says Toby Walsh, professor of AI at the University of NSW.Toby Walsh: ""People think of Australia as the land of the fair go, and that should be true of the technologies we build too.""Credit: Jeremy PiperWith artists like Leutwyler’s work being used to train apps, Walsh says, “they’re right to be angry because there’s great value being generated here, and it’s not being shared with the people whose art from which it was derived.” He questions whether or not this is sustainable, both for artists and these programs. If AI-generated work takes money, recognition and opportunities away from artists, many of them will stop producing art. “We have to work out ways to ensure that the people on whose work the systems depend do get some sort of reward, so that they continue to produce art that will continue to be used to train future systems”.AdvertisementAt present, AI is directed by humans, so “in training AI generally there’s a moral responsibility on the people who are doing the training to think about where they’re directing this capability,” says Ewan McEoin, senior curator of contemporary art, design and architecture at the National Gallery of Victoria.Can AI and the art world happily coexist?As AI rapidly evolves, it’s difficult for protections to keep pace – this opens up conversations about how to protect existing work while also looking at the creative potential of AI. McEoin is riding his bike to the gallery when he pulls over to speak to me, our conversation soundtracked by birdsong and gentle breeze. “We need to remember that AI is a tool – and it’s a tool that’s not specifically developed to make art,” he reflects. “It’s a tool that’s capable of dealing with huge quantities of data.”Quantum Memories by Refik Anadol is a work of art created by harnessing a dataset drawn from over two hundred million images linked to nature from publicly available internet resources and processed using quantum computing with machine learning algorithms.Credit: Refik Anadol StudioHe highlights how the world is incredibly data-rich, across business, finance, health, education, and how all the information pulsing through society is becoming increasingly connected. “We’re looking at a future where, across lots of different aspects of society, AI will be increasingly used to process huge quantities of data,” says McEoin. As an institution, he says, the gallery plays a role in recording these changes as they progress and asking questions about what it all means. “How do we help the public understand what some of the implications of these things will be?”He points to Quantum Memories by Refik Anadol, which was displayed in the NGV as part of the Triennial.Artist Refik Anadol has been working with AI for seven years.Credit: Efsun ErkilicThe mesmerising work, displayed on a giant LED screen was created by directing a quantum computer to process around 200 million images of nature and landscapes in a database owned by Google then asking it to look for patterns and commonalities. “What Refik asked it to do was to learn from that and recreate landscapes, imagined landscapes,” says McEoin. The result is a constantly changing series of moving images that are at once familiar and alien. “The work is a never-ending generative exploration of this information.”AI has actually been part of art for a whileAnadol’s artwork has been inextricably linked with technology since almost the beginning. “I’ve been programming computers to make art since 14 years”, he tells me. Seven years ago he started working with AI at Google as an artist in residence. “So we are a pioneer studio, because seven years with AI is like 70 years,” he adds with a laugh.AI being used to increase the potential of art, to broaden what is possible is an idea that Walsh raised. “I think the best way to envisage artificial intelligence is something that augments us. We’ve always picked up and used tools, and here’s a new tool that will allow many of us to make much more beautiful art than we could without the tool.”The work Refik Anadol Studio creates is diverse and displayed all over the world, using technology to probe ideas in unexpected ways – in one work, Melting Memories, Anadol uses EEG data as a way to try and present the concept of memory visually.Insight into the creation process behind Melting Memories.Credit: Refik Anadol Studio.All of the studio’s work requires drawing on huge amounts of data and pools of information, but they make sure to put a fence around it. “In our work, we always try to emphasise where the AI comes from, where data comes from, what kind of tools we use. I’m extremely open about our approach,” he tells me.Anadol is an optimist – the joy he feels in his work is clear in every sentence he utters. When asked how he came to AI in the first place, he tells me he loves to learn. “Some people call it nerd some people call it curious,” he says with a laugh.He also mentions he is a fan of sci-fi. But isn’t AI – autonomous AI anyway – often portrayed in a negative light in sci-fi I ask. “I highly believe that these technologies can create a problem for humanity for sure,” he replies, highlighting privacy and free will in particular. “What we read, what we watch, what we buy, eat … wherever we go is all defined by machines”. Artists, he reflects, have a role in bringing awareness, and he is interested in subverting the negatives and seeing how they can be made positive. “What else can we do with the same technologies and the systems imposed on us? How can we turn them into creative outputs? How can we use them to enhance our cognitive capacity? How can we use AI as a means of extension of the human mind?” A look at the creation process behind the artwork Melting Memories, which draws on EEG data.Credit: Refik Anadol StudioAnadol’s work opens up many questions and possibilities. Quantum Memories gives viewers an indication of what AI sees when it looks at the natural world. “It will be able to see not only the beauty of nature, but also the damage caused to nature by human beings,” says McEoin. “If AI was asked to do something about this situation, what would it do?“This is just the beginningMcEoin underscores the fact that these are early days for AI and art, and that it will be interesting to see where things go. “This is like a baby learning to paint, these images that we’re seeing at the moment.” Currently, AI-created images and artwork are still human-led. He’s curious though. “What kind of art would AI make if you matched up a quantum computer, and AI and the internet?“Although at the moment, it’s an aesthetic thing that we’re looking at, I would be very interested to understand the topics, the subject matter, the discourses that AI wants to have with us, because we’re not at that point yet.”So, what happens to artists now?Whether AI poses a direct risk to artists – that they could simply be replaced by machines learning from all that humans have created before them – is a tricky thing to answer.Across the academics, artists and curators I speak to, all of them point to something indefinable that forms a layer of protection, though not all of them are referring to the same thing. There’s the fact that what art actually is can’t be nailed down, even between people.“We also have to remember that just making an image with AI is not necessarily making art,” says McEoin. “There’s a big difference between taking a photograph and taking a photograph that is considered as part of an artistic movement or art form.”Related ArticleVisual artDestination art: The best exhibitions to see around Australia while on holidayAnadol agrees. “Just prompting an image isn’t art at all,” he tells me. “The question is really what we do with that, and how we use it for the artistic context.”Walsh draws my attention to the fact that photography didn’t destroy painting. “Art is more than just making images that are realistic. It’s about asking questions, and addressing aspects of the human condition, whether that’s about falling in love and losing loved ones and human mortality and all of the troubling questions that art helps us to think about,” he tells me. “Machines aren’t going to speak to us in the same way that artists speak to us because they don’t share our humanity.”We reached out to the Art Gallery of New South Wales to ask about whether works created in part by AI would be eligible for the Archibald Prize but were told no one was available to comment.Leutwyler is positive about AI and advancements in technology. Their concern lies with the issues of trust and consent when work is used without permission or compensation.Related ArticleExplainerRobots‘Die as a human or live forever as a cyborg’: Will robots rule the world?“I think that technology can be used in many ways to transform your artwork, take you in a direction that you didn’t expect. But the artificial intelligence, specifically the ones that are pulling from sources without people’s consent, just feels like forgery and theft to me,” they explain. “I think there’s certainly merit and value to artificial intelligence in general. It can be used for really wonderful great good things in the world. But this is an example where it’s been used for bad.”A cultural guide to going out and loving your city.

The Jameel Clinic, the epicenter of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in partnership with the UAE Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications Office, Community Jameel, and Wellcome hosted on Tuesday a one-day conference titled ‘AI Cures MENASA: Clinical AI and data solutions for health.’


Held at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai with Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, in attendance, the conference brought together pioneers in AI and health from the Jameel Clinic, including MacArthur's genius grant’ Fellows Professor Regina Barzilay and Professor Dina Katabi, Dr Adam Yala, and Dr Shrooq Alsenan, a Jameel Clinic research fellow from Saudi Arabia, together with representatives from major hospitals and public health agencies across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region.AdChoicesADVERTISING

Climate change, lengthening life expectancy, and sedentary lifestyles are impacting hospitals and public health sectors across the MENASA region due to a rise in non-communicable diseases like cancer, obesity, and diabetes as well as neurodegenerative diseases. The rise of AI in healthcare presents a powerful opportunity to tackle these challenges and enable better patient outcomes, yet the gap between research in the field and real-world implementation across hospitals continues to grow. Building a robust coalition of researchers, clinicians, hospitals, and public health actors is vital to realizing the benefits of major advances in AI in the detection and treatment of diseases — not just in the MENASA region, but around the world.

The Jameel Clinic, co-founded by MIT and Community Jameel in 2018, brings together computer scientists, biologist,s and clinicians to develop new tools to tackle health challenges. Since its launch, the Jameel Clinic team has used deep learning techniques to discover Halicin, the first new antibiotic in three decades, which is capable of killing around 35 deadly bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant tuberculosis and the superbug C. difficile.


The Jameel Clinic also developed Mirai, a machine learning algorithm that predicts breast cancer more than three years earlier than current approaches and is equally effective across different races and ethnicities, a major advance for health equity.


Consistent with the Jameel Clinic’s mission to ensure these new tools are rolled out around the world, especially to countries with more fragile public health systems and to at-risk communities, the ‘AI Cures’ MENASA conference will serve as a launch pad for the international expansion of the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network, a new initiative supported by the Jameel Clinic and Wellcome that is building partnerships with hospitals to deploy and develop new AI tools in clinical settings, with the aim of saving lives.


Fady Jameel, vice chairman of Community Jameel, said: “We are excited to be able to help bring together such an inspiring gathering of scientists, policymakers, public health officials and hospital leaders at the Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai. The work of the Jameel Clinic has the potential to transform healthcare for millions of people around the world, and we are excited to see the Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network expanding in the MENASA region and rolling out clinical AI tools around the world for equitable impact for all.”


Professor Regina Barzilay, AI faculty lead at the Jameel Clinic, said: “Ensuring that the cutting-edge clinical AI research being done at MIT can be utilized in diverse clinical settings is critical to our mission at the Jameel Clinic. We look forward to combining the expertise of Jameel Clinic researchers with the expertise of local clinicians and public health officials in the MENASA region to maximize the impact of clinical AI tools on patient lives.”

In comments to Al Arabiya English, those attending made further comments.Professor Barzilay said: With machine learning, we have the capacity to bring about truly transformative change in healthcare and that can only happen if we effectively deploy machine learning models in real-world settings, into hospitals and medical centers with clinicians and patients. Building a robust coalition of researchers, clinicians, hospitals, and public health actors is critical to realizing the benefits of major advances in machine learning in the detection and treatment of diseases.”Tariq Khokhar, head of data for science & health at Wellcome, said: “AI tools have an exciting role to play in transforming healthcare for patients around the world and advancing health research. But first, researchers, policymakers, clinicians, and healthcare managers must work together to rigorously test them in diverse settings, so we know they work for different people and under different circumstances. This will ensure they are safe for everyone and maximize their potentially life-saving potential.”Professor Dina Katabi, principal investigator at the MIT Jameel Clinic, said: “At the conference, we spoke about how we can use artificial intelligence in the future of the healthcare sector and improve it. We researched that AI assessment of Parkinson's can be done every night at home while the person is asleep and without touching their body. To do so, the team developed a device that has the appearance of a home Wi-Fi router, but instead of providing internet access, the device emits radio signals to analyse their reflections off the surrounding environment, and extract the subject’s breathing patterns without any bodily contact. The breathing signal is then fed to the neural network to assess Parkinson’s passively, and there is zero effort needed from the patient and caregiver.”“A relationship between Parkinson’s and breathing was noted as early as 1817, in the work of Dr. James Parkinson. This motivated us to consider the potential of detecting the disease from one’s breathing without looking at movements,” Katabi says. “Some medical studies have shown that respiratory symptoms manifest years before motor symptoms, meaning that breathing attributes could be promising for risk assessment before the diagnosis of Parkinson’s.”“The fastest-growing neurological disease in the world, Parkinson’s is the second-most common neurological disorder, after Alzheimer's. In the United States alone, it afflicts over 1 million people and has an annual economic burden of $51.9 billion. The research team’s algorithm was tested on 7,687 individuals, including 757 Parkinson’s patients.”This research was performed in collaboration with the University of Rochester, Mayo Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital, and is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, with partial support by the National Science Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.Dr. Mohammad AlHamid, Director of the Centre for Healthcare Intelligence (CHI) at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC), said: It’s great to be here at this seminar, we created the intelligence center back in 2019 , and we work with clinical and operational leaders to build and deploy high-quality applied Healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for enhancing quality of care, streamlining workflow operations, and improving patient experience using best practice operational and responsible AI pipelines.”The Jameel Clinic AI Hospital Network aims to roll out clinical AI tools at 35 hospitals across eight countries, including Saudi Arabia, India, and Taiwan. With the significant breakthroughs in clinical AI technologies we have witnessed in the past decade across all areas of clinical care, the networks seeks to ensure that new healthcare technologies are deployed equitably, particularly across low and middle-income countries, in order to improve the quality of care and save lives.Read more: Breakthrough in detecting Parkinson’s using AI and breathing pattern by Jameel Clinic

The recent launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot created by Open AI for public use, has underscored the growing reach of digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) in working life.As with most technological revolutions that affect the workplace, chatbots can potentially create winners and losers and will affect both blue-collar and white-collar workers.To maximize economic gains and minimize the potential negative impact on workers, policymakers need to act in the interests of all of society. And those in developing countries need to step up the pace in preparation for such technologies or risk falling further behind.ChatGPT shows the promise of AIChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model using natural language. The model is trained on a massive amount of data, which allows it to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of inputs.You can ask this bot to perform various tasks. Some of the paragraphs in this article, – while still needing some editing – were written by the chatbot, using requests such as “What is ChatGPT?” and “What are the potential uses and benefits of technologies like ChatGPT?”.Technologies like GPT-3 still have limitations. These include incorrect responses, lack of updated information and access to the internet – and the potential for bias in algorithms on issues such as race and gender.For example, we asked the chatbot its suggestions to mitigate some of the limiting factors, and the results show instances where AI does not go beyond commonplace solutions (see the table below).   Limitations of AI technologies and mitigation steps suggested by ChatGPTLimitations of AI technologiesPossible mitigation measuresPossible mistakes and inaccurate or inappropriate responsesDevelop and implement regulations and guidelinesRequires technological infrastructure and expertiseInvest in education and training programmesEthical concernsDevelop and implement regulations and guidelinesMay exacerbate existing inequalities and the digital divideFoster collaboration and partnerships among businesses, organizations and individuals to share knowledge, expertise and resourcesSource: Table generated by ChatGPT on 14 December 2022.Work will never be the sameDespite limitations, this type of AI can greatly benefit the productivity of skilled workers.Chatbots offer the possibility to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as writing standardized reports, meeting minutes and emails. Workers could therefore be freed to focus on more critical and creative tasks. A chatbot virtual personal assistant could guide skilled workers through different projects or production processes. It can also generate original content and ideas, and potentially help to research and develop new products and services.Moreover, tools like ChatGPT are an appealing and cost-effective choice for businesses and individuals looking to use the capabilities of AI without the need for additional, costly equipment.Siri (developed by Apple), Alexa (by Amazon) and Google Assistant are three well-known human-like AI assistants that often require a slew of related products, such as an iPhone, echo dot or google devices. Despite not having voice processing capabilities, ChatGPT is more affordable: access to the internet and basic literacy are sufficient to make it work.Potential winners and losersBut tools such as ChatGPT presents a real risk of skilled and semi-skilled workers losing their jobs.For example, chatbots can be developed to train employees in an organization, resulting in the redundancy of human trainers.Previous waves of technological change have created both winners and losers. Workers who are quicker to adjust to technological change will gain by increasingly taking on tasks complementary to AI while abandoning automated ones. And the great potential for the creation of new jobs is in innovation using tools like ChatGPT to bring new goods and services to the market.For example, several new jobs associated with frontier technologies emerged in the past few years, from social media managers to drone pilots. But these adjustments will take time, and the breakneck speed of changes that can come with cheap AI personal assistants may significantly impact office workers.Barriers for developing countriesThis technology’s impact is not restricted to work in advanced economies.With gig work and digital transformation, the expectation was that some skilled workers in developing countries were getting ready to compete for more skill-intensive jobs around the world as “telemigrants” in jobs such as accountants, legal clerks, software developers, or even X-ray analysts. The risk is that these jobs will be taken by the ChatGPTs of the world.Moreover, most firms and workers in developing countries may not be able to take advantage of this personal use of AI to increase productivity.Most high-income countries and some upper middle-income countries have the highest potential to benefit from these AI technologies, given that they are above average in the availability of high-skilled labour and internet download speed, as a proxy of the quality of digital infrastructure (see the graph below). On the opposite end of the spectrum, low-income and most lower middle-income countries are in the worst situation to take advantage of these technologies, given their low share of skilled workers and relatively slow download speed.Your browser does not support JavaScript!Developing economies generally lag in the adoption of digital technologies and risk repeating this pattern with the latest frontier technologies.An UNCTAD readiness index that assesses countries’ abilities to use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies highlights the leading position of developed economies, showing that developing countries still struggle with issues like digital skills and infrastructure, and research and development.The way forwardUltimately, developing countries need to prepare to benefit from AI by promoting the technology's use, adoption, adaptation and development. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy on how this could be done. But generally, it requires actions in four main areas.First, we need to continue preparing the workforce for work in the twenty-first century. This means developing digital skills and building and strengthening complementary skills such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity.Second, we need to take care of those who will lose in the transition to new forms of work. Reskilling programmes should be part of government policies and programmes to address job loss due to new technologies. Life-long learning initiatives, involving the training and re-training of workers, are increasingly the joint responsibility of governments, employers and workers.Third, we need to promote inclusiveness and broadly share the benefits of this powerful technology. For this, we need to promote an open innovation approach for AI, in which inputs, methods and results of the innovation are shared openly with different people who could use them for further innovation. And fourth, the impact of frontier technologies will be felt by all, but not all are participating equally in defining the path that frontier technologies like AI will follow. It is critical to establish ethical frameworks and regulations for these technologies.

Thinking about using ChatGPT at work? Proceed with caution.

ChatGPT's beta launch exceeded 1 million users in less than a week, attracting the attention of almost everyone in the entire tech ecosystem. I read articles about it in the New York Times, the Financial Times and The Atlantic, three top media sources in my books.


The AI garners work-place buzz under the possibility that its generation is so effective, it might pose a threat to human jobs such as copywriting, answering customer service inquiries, writing news reports, and creating legal documents.

In actuality, there’s more nuance to how we consider the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generative AI like ChatGPT to the workplace—especially where the reliability of information is paramount.

PROMOTED
I met with the executive team at Hebbia AI, a startup leading research efforts on LLMs, to dig in. I connected with the company’s CEO George Sivulka, and Lainie Yallen, a former student of mine at McGill who is leading product, to share their perspective on ChatGPT's recent attention and discuss how it can be used in conjunction with other machine learning algorithms for workplace applications. 
When considering applying ChatGPT or any other generative model to work-related activities, it’s important to consider a fundamental limitation:
Generative AI models generate responses, they do not read sources, or cite their work. Thus, their output has no guarantee of reliability.

To use a generative model in the workplace, it is critical to feed these models with facts and cited information so that answers are based on research and not inference.
Semantic search models apply Large Language Models (LLMs) to actually read and retrieve sources.
While one application of LLMs is generative AI such as ChatGPT, LLMs can also be applied to semantic search like Hebbia.
In the semantic search context, the models function as ""neural"" search engines, retrieving answers based on the semantic meaning of a query, rather than simply matching keywords as traditional search engines do.
For example, an analyst searching for “trends"" would expect to find facts related to the industry, customers, competitors, and growth in a 10-K report. Only a semantic search engine like Hebbia could support that behavior. Keyword search might yield results about company valuations.
Discriminative AI systems, like semantic search, can find meaning in questions and answers, and cite factual evidence and data.
When applying generative AI to search in the workplace, it ought to be coupled with semantic search to be used credibly.
Generative models can and should leverage semantic search ""memory"" in order to address the shortcomings of generative models alone. When semantic search and Generative AI work together, they can improve the accuracy, trustworthiness, and ease of keeping research up to date.
When generative AI and semantic search are used together, you can ensure that generative AI chatbot responding to a customer query is providing correct company information, and that responses being provided to answer a critical client question is based on the most up-to-date competitor information.
Put simply, semantic search improves the question-and-answer application of generative AI because:


Models can be primed with relevant primary sources
All sources and answers can be properly cited
These sources can be easily kept accurate and up to date via an index (without retraining models)


The future of work will have generative AI at its center. Companies who are able to leverage this technology appropriately will meaningfully improve their workflows by increasing speed of decisions and reducing costs of research.
Those who are too slow to adapt or choose to adopt generative AI alone without the technology needed to make it suitable for work (e.g., semantic search) will struggle to compete.
If you’re interested in generative AI and semantic search in your workplace, reach out to Hebbia and learn more about what they do. I believe they bring a critical dimension to this important conversation the world is jumping into.

He comes back to the store a week later complaining that it cuts down only two trees a day when he was told it would cut down 20. The service person says, “Well, let’s see what the trouble is,” and starts it up. The mountain man jumps back and asks, “What’s that noise?” (He’d been sawing without the engine on.)I feel like that mountain man when it comes to ChatGPT, the powerful new artificial intelligence chatbot that seemingly everyone is experimenting with. I got mediocre results from ChatGPT because I didn’t try very hard to use it properly. Other people have gotten amazing results because they’re smarter and more purposeful about how they use it — they yank its pull cord and get its engine going.I confess that my first idea was to figure out what ChatGPT could not do rather than what it could. It won’t offer opinions. It’s not up on anything that’s happened since it was trained last year. It doesn’t have a body so it has never been to Ireland. (One of my questions.)

On 24 November 2022, the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CDCJ) approved the publication of a comparative study examining the interplay between artificial intelligence and administrative law, prepared by Prof. Dr. Johan Wolswinkel (Tilburg University, the Netherlands).
The study examines, on the basis of responses from 24 member States of the Council of Europe, the state of legislation regulating artificial intelligence (AI) in administrative decision-making, identifying general patterns and different approaches. Resort to AI in the public sector raises, a number of legal issues, including whether the existing rules and principles of administrative law are sufficient to regulate this new form of decision-making.
This study contributes to the work undertaken by a limited working group of the CDCJ (CDCJ-ADMIN-AI), and is aimed to support the reflections on future work of the Committee in this area, as well as the revision of the handbook “The Administration and You” .

Extracting information from textual data has changed dramatically over the past decade. As the term natural language processing has overtaken text mining as the name of the field, the methodology has changed tremendously, too. One of the main drivers of this change was the emergence of language models as a basis for many applications aiming to distill valuable insights from raw text.
Language Model DefinitionA language model uses machine learning to conduct a probability distribution over words used to predict the most likely next word in a sentence based on the previous entry. Language models learn from text and can be used for producing original text, predicting the next word in a text, speech recognition, optical character recognition and handwriting recognition.
In learning about natural language processing, I’ve been fascinated by the evolution of language models over the past years. You may have heard about GPT-3 and the potential threats it poses, but how did we get this far? How can a machine produce an article that mimics a journalist?
 
What Is a Language Model?
A language model is a probability distribution over words or word sequences. In practice, it gives the probability of a certain word sequence being “valid.” Validity in this context does not refer to grammatical validity. Instead, it means that it resembles how people write, which is what the language model learns. This is an important point. There’s no magic to a language model like other machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, it’s just a tool to incorporate abundant information in a concise manner that’s reusable in an out-of-sample context.

What Can a Language Model Do?
The abstract understanding of natural language, which is necessary to infer word probabilities from context, can be used for a number of tasks. Lemmatization or stemming aims to reduce a word to its most basic form, thereby dramatically decreasing the number of tokens. These algorithms work better if the part-of-speech role of the word is known. A verb’s postfixes can be different from a noun’s postfixes, hence the rationale for part-of-speech tagging (or POS-tagging), a common task for a language model.
With a good language model, we can perform extractive or abstractive summarization of texts. If we have models for different languages, a machine translation system can be built easily. Less straightforward use-cases include answering questions (with or without context, see the example at the end of the article). Language models can also be used for speech recognition, OCR, handwriting recognition and more. There’s a whole spectrum of opportunities.
 
Types of Language Models
There are two types of language models: 
Probabilistic methods.
Neural network-based modern language models
It’s important to note the difference between them.
 
Probabilistic Language Model
A simple probabilistic language model is constructed by calculating n-gram probabilities. An n-gram is an n word sequence, n being an integer greater than zero. An n-gram’s probability is the conditional probability that the n-gram’s last word follows a particular n-1 gram (leaving out the last word). It’s the proportion of occurrences of the last word following the n-1 gram leaving the last word out. This concept is a Markov assumption. Given the n-1 gram (the present), the n-gram probabilities (future) does not depend on the n-2, n-3, etc grams (past).
There are evident drawbacks of this approach. Most importantly, only the preceding n words affect the probability distribution of the next word. Complicated texts have deep context that may have decisive influence on the choice of the next word. Thus, what the next word is might not be evident from the previous n-words, not even if n is 20 or 50. A term has influence on a previous word choice: the word United is much more probable if it is followed by States of America. Let’s call this the context problem.
On top of that, it’s evident that this approach scales poorly. As size increases (n), the number of possible permutations skyrocket, even though most of the permutations never occur in the text. And all the occuring probabilities (or all n-gram counts) have to be calculated and stored. In addition, non-occurring n-grams create a sparsity problem, as in, the granularity of the probability distribution can be quite low. Word probabilities have few different values, therefore most of the words have the same probability.
 
Neural Network-Based Language Models
Neural network based language models ease the sparsity problem by the way they encode inputs. Word embedding layers create an arbitrary sized vector of each word that incorporates semantic relationships as well. These continuous vectors create the much needed granularity in the probability distribution of the next word. Moreover, the language model is a function, as all neural networks are with lots of matrix computations, so it’s not necessary to store all n-gram counts to produce the probability distribution of the next word.

Evolution of Language Models
Even though neural networks solve the sparsity problem, the context problem remains. First, language models were developed to solve the context problem more and more efficiently — bringing more and more context words to influence the probability distribution. Secondly, the goal was to create an architecture that gives the model the ability to learn which context words are more important than others.
The first model, which I outlined previously, is a dense (or hidden) layer and an output layer stacked on top of a continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) Word2Vec model. A CBOW Word2Vec model is trained to guess the word from context. A Skip-Gram Word2Vec model does the opposite, guessing context from the word. In practice, a CBOW Word2Vec model requires a lot of examples of the following structure to train it: the inputs are n words before and/or after the word, which is the output. We can see that the context problem is still intact.
 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an improvement regarding this matter. Since RNNs can be either a long short-term memory (LSTM) or a gated recurrent unit (GRU) cell based network, they take all previous words into account when choosing the next word. AllenNLP’s ELMo takes this notion a step further, utilizing a bidirectional LSTM, which takes into account the context before and after the word counts.
 
Transformers
The main drawback of RNN-based architectures stems from their sequential nature. As a consequence, training times soar for long sequences because there is no possibility for parallelization. The solution for this problem is the transformer architecture.
The GPT models from OpenAI and Google’s BERT utilize the transformer architecture, as well. These models also employ a mechanism called “Attention,” by which the model can learn which inputs deserve more attention than others in certain cases.
In terms of model architecture, the main quantum leaps were firstly RNNs, specifically, LSTM and GRU, solving the sparsity problem and reducing the disk space language models use, and subsequently, the transformer architecture, making parallelization possible and creating attention mechanisms. But architecture is not the only aspect a language model can excel in.
Compared to the GPT-1 architecture, GPT-3 has virtually nothing novel. But it’s huge. It has 175 billion parameters, and it was trained on the largest corpus a model has ever been trained on in common crawl. This is partly possible because of the semi-supervised training strategy of a language model. A text can be used as a training example with some words omitted. The incredible power of GPT-3 comes from the fact that it has read more or less all text that has appeared on the internet over the past years, and it has the capability to reflect most of the complexity natural language contains.
 
Trained for Multiple Purposes
Finally, I’d like to review the T5 model from Google. Previously, language models were used for standard NLP tasks, like part-of-speech (POS) tagging or machine translation with slight modifications. With a little retraining, BERT can be a POS-tagger because of its abstract ability to understand the underlying structure of natural language. 
With T5, there is no need for any modifications for NLP tasks. If it gets a text with some <M> tokens in it, it knows that those tokens are gaps to fill with the appropriate words. It can also answer questions. If it receives some context after the questions, it searches the context for the answer. Otherwise, it answers from its own knowledge. Fun fact: It beat its own creators in a trivia quiz.

Future of Language Models
Personally, I think this is the field that we are closest to creating an AI. There’s a lot of buzz around AI, and many simple decision systems and almost any neural network are called AI, but this is mainly marketing. By definition, artificial intelligence involves human-like intelligence capabilities performed by a machine. While transfer learning shines in the field of computer vision, and the notion of transfer learning is essential for an AI system, the very fact that the same model can do a wide range of NLP tasks and can infer what to do from the input is itself spectacular. It brings us one step closer to actually creating human-like intelligence systems.

As this technology is transforming our lives, it should be in all of our interest to become informed and engaged.By: Max RoserDecember 15, 2022Cite this articleReuse our work freelyWhy should you care about the development of artificial intelligence?Think about what the alternative would look like. If you and the wider public do not get informed and engaged, then we leave it to a few entrepreneurs and engineers to decide how this technology will transform our world.That is the status quo. This small number of people at a few tech firms directly working on artificial intelligence (AI) do understand how extraordinarily powerful this technology is becoming. If the rest of society does not become engaged, then it will be this small elite who decides how this technology will change our lives.To change this status quo, I want to answer three questions in this article: Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by AI seriously? How can we imagine such a world? And what is at stake as this technology becomes more powerful?Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by artificial intelligence seriously?In some way, it should be obvious how technology can fundamentally transform the world. We just have to look at how much the world has already changed. If you could invite a family of hunter-gatherers from 20,000 years ago on your next flight, they would be pretty surprised. Technology has changed our world already, so we should expect that it can happen again.But while we have seen the world transform before, we have seen these transformations play out over the course of generations. What is different now is how very rapid these technological changes have become. In the past, the technologies that our ancestors used in their childhood were still central to their lives in their old age. This has not been the case anymore for recent generations. Instead, it has become common that technologies unimaginable in one's youth become ordinary in later life.This is the first reason we might not take the prospect seriously: it is easy to underestimate the speed at which technology can change the world.The second reason why it is difficult to take the possibility of transformative AI – potentially even AI as intelligent as humans – seriously is that it is an idea that we first heard in the cinema. It is not surprising that for many of us, the first reaction to a scenario in which machines have human-like capabilities is the same as if you had asked us to take seriously a future in which vampires, werewolves, or zombies roam the planet.1But, it is plausible that it is both the stuff of sci-fi fantasy and the central invention that could arrive in our, or our children’s, lifetimes.The third reason why it is difficult to take this prospect seriously is by failing to see that powerful AI could lead to very large changes. This is also understandable. It is difficult to form an idea of a future that is very different from our own time. There are two concepts that I find helpful in imagining a very different future with artificial intelligence. Let’s look at both of them.How to develop an idea of what the future of artificial intelligence might look like?When thinking about the future of artificial intelligence, I find it helpful to consider two different concepts in particular: human-level AI, and transformative AI.2 The first concept highlights the AI’s capabilities and anchors them to a familiar benchmark, while transformative AI emphasizes the impact that this technology would have on the world.From where we are today, much of this may sound like science fiction. It is therefore worth keeping in mind that the majority of surveyed AI experts believe there is a real chance that human-level artificial intelligence will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that it will exist much sooner.The advantages and disadvantages of comparing machine and human intelligenceOne way to think about human-level artificial intelligence is to contrast it with the current state of AI technology. While today’s AI systems often have capabilities similar to a particular, limited part of the human mind, a human-level AI would be a machine that is capable of carrying out the same range of intellectual tasks that we humans are capable of.3 It is a machine that would be “able to learn to do anything that a human can do,” as Norvig and Russell put it in their textbook on AI.4Taken together, the range of abilities that characterize intelligence gives humans the ability to solve problems and achieve a wide variety of goals. A human-level AI would therefore be a system that could solve all those problems that we humans can solve, and do the tasks that humans do today. Such a machine, or collective of machines, would be able to do the work of a translator, an accountant, an illustrator, a teacher, a therapist, a truck driver, or the work of a trader on the world’s financial markets. Like us, it would also be able to do research and science, and to develop new technologies based on that.The concept of human-level AI has some clear advantages. Using the familiarity of our own intelligence as a reference provides us with some clear guidance on how to imagine the capabilities of this technology.However, it also has clear disadvantages. Anchoring the imagination of future AI systems to the familiar reality of human intelligence carries the risk that it obscures the very real differences between them.Some of these differences are obvious. For example, AI systems will have the immense memory of computer systems, against which our own capacity to store information pales. Another obvious difference is the speed at which a machine can absorb and process information. But information storage and processing speed are not the only differences. The domains in which machines already outperform humans is steadily increasing: in chess, after matching the level of the best human players in the late 90s, AI systems reached superhuman levels more than a decade ago. In other games like Go or complex strategy games, this has happened more recently.5These differences mean that an AI that is at least as good as humans in every domain would overall be much more powerful than the human mind. Even the first “human-level AI” would therefore be quite superhuman in many ways.6Human intelligence is also a bad metaphor for machine intelligence in other ways. The way we think is often very different from machines, and as a consequence the output of thinking machines can be very alien to us.Most perplexing and most concerning are the strange and unexpected ways in which machine intelligence can fail. The AI-generated image of the horse below provides an example: on the one hand, AIs can do what no human can do – produce an image of anything, in any style (here photorealistic), in mere seconds – but on the other hand it can fail in ways that no human would fail.7 No human would make the mistake of drawing a horse with five legs.8Imagining a powerful future AI as just another human would therefore likely be a mistake. The differences might be so large that it will be a misnomer to call such systems “human-level.”AI-generated image of a horse9Transformative artificial intelligence is defined by the impact this technology would have on the worldIn contrast, the concept of transformative AI is not based on a comparison with human intelligence. This has the advantage of sidestepping the problems that the comparisons with our own mind bring. But it has the disadvantage that it is harder to imagine what such a system would look like and be capable of. It requires more from us. It requires us to imagine a world with intelligent actors that are potentially very different from ourselves.Transformative AI is not defined by any specific capabilities, but by the real-world impact that the AI would have. To qualify as transformative, researchers think of it as AI that is “powerful enough to bring us into a new, qualitatively different future.”10In humanity’s history, there have been two cases of such major transformations, the agricultural and the industrial revolutions.Transformative AI becoming a reality would be an event on that scale. Like the arrival of agriculture 10,000 years ago, or the transition from hand- to machine-manufacturing, it would be an event that would change the world for billions of people around the globe and for the entire trajectory of humanity’s future.Technologies that fundamentally change how a wide range of goods or services are produced are called ‘general-purpose technologies’. The two previous transformative events were caused by the discovery of two particularly significant general-purpose technologies: the change in food production as humanity transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming, and the rise of machine manufacturing in the industrial revolution. Based on the evidence and arguments presented in this series on AI development, I believe it is plausible that powerful AI could represent the introduction of a similarly significant general-purpose technology.Timeline of the three transformative events in world historyA future of human-level or transformative AI?The two concepts are closely related, but they are not the same. The creation of a human-level AI would certainly have a transformative impact on our world. If the work of most humans could be carried out by an AI, the lives of millions of people would change.11The opposite, however, is not true: we might see transformative AI without developing human-level AI. Since the human mind is in many ways a poor metaphor for the intelligence of machines, we might plausibly develop transformative AI before we develop human-level AI. Depending on how this goes, this might mean that we will never see any machine intelligence for which human intelligence is a helpful comparison.When and if AI systems might reach either of these levels is of course difficult to predict. In my companion article on this question, I give an overview of what researchers in this field currently believe. Many AI experts believe there is a real chance that such systems will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that they will exist much sooner.What is at stake as artificial intelligence becomes more powerful?All major technological innovations lead to a range of positive and negative consequences. For AI, the spectrum of possible outcomes – from the most negative to the most positive – is extraordinarily wide.That the use of AI technology can cause harm is clear, because it is already happening.AI systems can cause harm when people use them maliciously. For example, when they are used in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns or to enable mass surveillance.12But AI systems can also cause unintended harm, when they act differently than intended or fail. For example, in the Netherlands the authorities used an AI system which falsely claimed that an estimated 26,000 parents made fraudulent claims for child care benefits. The false allegations led to hardship for many poor families, and also resulted in the resignation of the Dutch government in 2021.13As AI becomes more powerful, the possible negative impacts could become much larger. Many of these risks have rightfully received public attention: more powerful AI could lead to mass labor displacement, or extreme concentrations of power and wealth. In the hands of autocrats, it could empower totalitarianism through its suitability for mass surveillance and control.The so-called alignment problem of AI is another extreme risk. This is the concern that nobody would be able to control a powerful AI system, even if the AI takes actions that harm us humans, or humanity as a whole. This risk is unfortunately receiving little attention from the wider public, but it is seen as an extremely large risk by many leading AI researchers.14How could an AI possibly escape human control and end up harming humans?The risk is not that an AI becomes self-aware, develops bad intentions, and “chooses” to do this. The risk is that we try to instruct the AI to pursue some specific goal – even a very worthwhile one – and in the pursuit of that goal it ends up harming humans. It is about unintended consequences. The AI does what we told it to do, but not what we wanted it to do.Can’t we just tell the AI to not do those things? It is definitely possible to build an AI that avoids any particular problem we foresee, but it is hard to foresee all the possible harmful unintended consequences. The alignment problem arises because of “the impossibility of defining true human purposes correctly and completely,” as AI researcher Stuart Russell puts it.15Can’t we then just switch off the AI? This might also not be possible. That is because a powerful AI would know two things: it faces a risk that humans could turn it off, and it can’t achieve its goals once it has been turned off. As a consequence, the AI will pursue a very fundamental goal of ensuring that it won’t be switched off. This is why, once we realize that an extremely intelligent AI is causing unintended harm in the pursuit of some specific goal, it might not be possible to turn it off or change what the system does.16This risk – that humanity might not be able to stay in control once AI becomes very powerful, and that this might lead to an extreme catastrophe – has been recognized right from the early days of AI research more than 70 years ago.17 The very rapid development of AI in recent years has made a solution to this problem much more urgent.I have tried to summarize some of the risks of AI, but a short article is not enough space to address all possible questions. Especially on the very worst risks of AI systems, and what we can do now to reduce them, I recommend reading the book The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian and Benjamin Hilton’s article ‘Preventing an AI-related catastrophe’.If we manage to avoid these risks, transformative AI could also lead to very positive consequences. Advances in science and technology were crucial to the many positive developments in humanity’s history. If artificial ingenuity can augment our own, it could help us make progress on the many large problems we face: from cleaner energy, to the replacement of unpleasant work, to much better healthcare.This extremely large contrast between the possible positives and negatives makes clear that the stakes are unusually high with this technology. Reducing the negative risks and solving the alignment problem could mean the difference between a healthy, flourishing, and wealthy future for humanity – and the destruction of the same.How can we make sure that the development of AI goes well?Making sure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well is not just one of the most crucial questions of our time, but likely one of the most crucial questions in human history. This needs public resources – public funding, public attention, and public engagement.Currently, almost all resources that are dedicated to AI aim to speed up the development of this technology. Efforts that aim to increase the safety of AI systems, on the other hand, do not receive the resources they need. Researcher Toby Ord estimated that in 2020 between $10 to $50 million was spent on work to address the alignment problem.18 Corporate AI investment in the same year was more than 2000-times larger, it summed up to $153 billion.This is not only the case for the AI alignment problem. The work on the entire range of negative social consequences from AI is under-resourced compared to the large investments to increase the power and use of AI systems.It is frustrating and concerning for society as a whole that AI safety work is extremely neglected and that little public funding is dedicated to this crucial field of research. On the other hand, for each individual person this neglect means that they have a good chance to actually make a positive difference, if they dedicate themselves to this problem now. And while the field of AI safety is small, it does provide good resources on what you can do concretely if you want to work on this problem.I hope that more people dedicate their individual careers to this cause, but it needs more than individual efforts. A technology that is transforming our society needs to be a central interest of all of us. As a society we have to think more about the societal impact of AI, become knowledgeable about the technology, and understand what is at stake.When our children look back at today, I imagine that they will find it difficult to understand how little attention and resources we dedicated to the development of safe AI. I hope that this changes in the coming years, and that we begin to dedicate more resources to making sure that powerful AI gets developed in a way that benefits us and the next generations.If we fail to develop this broad-based understanding, then it will remain the small elite that finances and builds this technology that will determine how one of the – or plausibly the – most powerful technology in human history will transform our world.If we leave the development of artificial intelligence entirely to private companies, then we are also leaving it up these private companies what our future — the future of humanity — will be.With our work at Our World in Data we want to do our small part to enable a better informed public conversation on AI and the future we want to live in. You can find these resources on OurWorldinData.org/artificial-intelligenceAcknowledgements: I would like to thank my colleagues Daniel Bachler, Charlie Giattino, and Edouard Mathieu for their helpful comments to drafts of this essay.EndnotesThis problem becomes even larger when we try to imagine how a future with a human-level AI might play out. Any particular scenario will not only involve the idea that this powerful AI exists, but a whole range of additional assumptions about the future context in which this happens. It is therefore hard to communicate a scenario of a world with human-level AI that does not sound contrived, bizarre or even silly.Both of these concepts are widely used in the scientific literature on artificial intelligence. For example, questions about the timelines for the development of future AI are often framed using these terms. See my article on this topic.The fact that humans are capable of a range of intellectual tasks means that you arrive at different definitions of intelligence depending on which aspect within that range you focus on (the Wikipedia entry on intelligence, for example, lists a number of definitions from various researchers and different disciplines). As a consequence there are also various definitions of ‘human-level AI’.There are also several closely related terms: Artificial General Intelligence, High-Level Machine Intelligence, Strong AI, or Full AI are sometimes synonymously used, and sometimes defined in similar, yet different ways. In specific discussions, it is necessary to define this concept more narrowly; for example, in studies on AI timelines researchers offer more precise definitions of what human-level AI refers to in their particular study.Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell (2021) — Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. Fourth edition. Published by Pearson.The AI system AlphaGo, and its various successors, won against Go masters. The AI system Pluribus beat humans at no-limit Texas hold 'em poker. The AI system Cicero can strategize and use human language to win the strategy game Diplomacy. See: Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team (FAIR), Anton Bakhtin, Noam Brown, Emily Dinan, Gabriele Farina, Colin Flaherty, Daniel Fried, et al. (2022) – ‘Human-Level Play in the Game of Diplomacy by Combining Language Models with Strategic Reasoning’. In Science 0, no. 0 (22 November 2022): eade9097. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade9097.This also poses a problem when we evaluate how the intelligence of a machine compares with the intelligence of humans. If intelligence was a general ability, a single capacity, then we could easily compare and evaluate it, but the fact that it is a range of skills makes it much more difficult to compare across machine and human intelligence. Tests for AI systems are therefore comprising a wide range of tasks. See for example Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt (2020) – Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding or the definition of what would qualify as artificial general intelligence in this Metaculus prediction.An overview of how AI systems can fail can be found in Charles Choi – 7 Revealing Ways AIs Fail. It is also worth reading through the AIAAIC Repository which “details recent incidents and controversies driven by or relating to AI, algorithms, and automation.""I have taken this example from AI researcher François Chollet, who published it here.Via François Chollet, who published it here. Based on Chollet’s comments it seems that this image was created by the AI system ‘Stable Diffusion’.This quote is from Holden Karnofsky (2021) – AI Timelines: Where the Arguments, and the ""Experts,"" Stand. For Holden Karnofsky’s earlier thinking on this conceptualization of AI see his 2016 article ‘Some Background on Our Views Regarding Advanced Artificial Intelligence’.Ajeya Cotra, whose research on AI timelines I discuss in other articles of this series, attempts to give a quantitative definition of what would qualify as transformative AI. in her widely cited report on AI timelines she defines it as a change in software technology that brings the growth rate of gross world product ""to 20%-30% per year"". Several other researchers define TAI in similar terms.Human-level AI is typically defined as a software system that can carry out at least 90% or 99% of all economically relevant tasks that humans carry out. A lower-bar definition would be an AI system that can carry out all those tasks that can currently be done by another human who is working remotely on a computer.On the use of AI in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns see for example John Villasenor (November 2020) – How to deal with AI-enabled disinformation. More generally on this topic see Brundage and Avin et al. (2018) – The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation, published at maliciousaireport.com. A starting point for literature and reporting on mass surveillance by governments is the relevant Wikipedia entry.See for example the Wikipedia entry on the ‘Dutch childcare benefits scandal’ and Melissa Heikkilä (2022) – ‘Dutch scandal serves as a warning for Europe over risks of using algorithms’, in Politico. The technology can also reinforce discrimination in terms of race and gender. See Brian Christian’s book The Alignment Problem and the reports of the AI Now Institute.Overviews are provided in Stuart Russell (2019) – Human Compatible (especially chapter 5) and Brian Christian’s 2020 book The Alignment Problem. Christian presents the thinking of many leading AI researchers from the earliest days up to now and presents an excellent overview of this problem. It is also seen as a large risk by some of the leading private firms who work towards powerful AI – see OpenAI's article ""Our approach to alignment research"" from August 2022.Stuart Russell (2019) – Human CompatibleA question that follows from this is, why build such a powerful AI in the first place?The incentives are very high. As I emphasize below, this innovation has the potential to lead to very positive developments. In addition to the large social benefits there are also large incentives for those who develop it – the governments that can use it for their goals, the individuals who can use it to become more powerful and wealthy. Additionally, it is of scientific interest and might help us to understand our own mind and intelligence better. And lastly, even if we wanted to stop building powerful AIs, it is likely very hard to actually achieve it. It is very hard to coordinate across the whole world and agree to stop building more advanced AI – countries around the world would have to agree and then find ways to actually implement it.In 1950 the computer science pioneer Alan Turing put it like this: “If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we do, and then where should we be? … [T]his new danger is much closer. If it comes at all it will almost certainly be within the next millennium. It is remote but not astronomically remote, and is certainly something which can give us anxiety. It is customary, in a talk or article on this subject, to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some particularly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. … I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.” Alan. M. Turing (1950) – Computing Machinery and Intelligence, In Mind, Volume LIX, Issue 236, October 1950, Pages 433–460.Norbert Wiener is another pioneer who saw the alignment problem very early. One way he put it was “If we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with whose operation we cannot interfere effectively … we had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.” quoted from Norbert Wiener (1960) – Some Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation: As machines learn they may develop unforeseen strategies at rates that baffle their programmers. In Science.In 1950 – the same year in which Turing published the cited article – Wiener published his book The Human Use of Human Beings, whose front-cover blurb reads: “The ‘mechanical brain’ and similar machines can destroy human values or enable us to realize them as never before.”Toby Ord – The Precipice. He makes this projection in footnote 55 of chapter 2.

Spontaneous expert interview with an ""Other guest""

By Wolfram Müller 
On Dec 14, 2022



It’s becoming increasingly clear that artificial intelligence is also gaining a foothold in the creative sector. It’s becoming possible to create new, sophisticated content in a matter of minutes – but how will that affect our work in social media? We explored this question in this impromptu expert interview. Enjoy!
 
The following interview with a renowned expert in artificial intelligence was recorded on 04.12.2022

W. Müller: How is AI changing the way we use social media and write blogs?W. Müller: But how will people react to AI-generated content?W. Müller: Which topics will be the first to use AI on a large scale for writing blogs?W. Müller: Now let’s talk about the content. What are the most important success factors for a digital transformation?W. Müller: Okay, that’s enough – thank you. Do you have any ideas on how to get people to embrace the change associated with digital transformation?W. Müller: Thank you for the insights. It’s a pleasure to talk to you.W. Müller: Last question. What do you call yourself?Disclaimer
W. Müller: How is AI changing the way we use social media and write blogs?
Expert answer: AI is changing the way we use social media and write blogs in several ways. One way is that humans can create content using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This means that people can use AI tools to create content that helps them write in a more natural and conversational style, making their posts and blogs more engaging and easier to read.
Another way AI is changing the way we use social media and write blogs is through content personalization. AI algorithms can be used to analyze user data and preferences. This information is then used to recommend content that is tailored to individual users. This can help make social media feeds and blogs more relevant and engaging for each user, and it can also help increase user engagement and retention.
Finally, AI is also being used to assist with moderation and content filtering on social media platforms. AI algorithms can help identify and flag inappropriate or potentially harmful content, making it easier for moderators to review and take appropriate action. This can help make social media platforms safer and more welcoming for all users.
W. Müller: But how will people react to AI-generated content?
Expert response: It is difficult to predict exactly how people will react to AI-generated content, as this is likely to depend on the individual and the context in which they encounter the content. Some people may be excited by the possibilities AI offers for creating more personalized and engaging content, while others may have concerns about AI replacing human creativity and expression.
One possible concern is that people may be less critical of AI content because it is seen as more “objective” or “impartial” than human-created content. This could lead people to blindly accept AI-generated content as truth without considering its possible biases or limitations.
Overall, it is likely that people’s reactions to AI-generated content will depend on their own experiences and beliefs about AI and its capabilities. Some people may be excited about the potential of AI to enhance their social media and writing experiences, while others may be more skeptical or reluctant.
W. Müller: Which topics will be the first to use AI on a large scale for writing blogs?
Expert response: It is difficult to predict which topics will be the first to use AI widely for blog writing, as this is likely to depend on a number of factors, including the availability of high-quality AI tools and the willingness of bloggers to use these tools. However, some potential areas where AI-generated content could become more common are as follows:

Technical or specialized topics that require high accuracy and detail, such as science, engineering, and finance.
Topics that are repetitive or formulaic, such as product reviews or news summaries.
Niche topics or interests that may not have a large enough audience to support human writers, such as obscure hobbies or specific subcultures.
Topics that require a high volume of content to be produced quickly, such as content farms or news aggregators.

Overall, it is likely that AI-generated content will initially be most prevalent in areas where demand for content is high and requirements for accuracy and detail are stringent, or where the potential benefits of AI-generated content outweigh concerns about its use.
W. Müller: Now let’s talk about the content. What are the most important success factors for a digital transformation?
Expert answer: Digital transformation has become a buzzword in recent years as more and more companies seek to harness the power of technology to improve their operations and better serve their customers. But what are the key success factors that companies need to consider when undertaking digital transformation?
First and foremost, companies need a clear and well-defined digital strategy that outlines their goals for transformation and the steps they will take to achieve those goals. This strategy should be aligned with the company’s overall business objectives and supported by senior leadership.
Another key success factor for digital transformation is the ability to adapt quickly to change. The world of technology is constantly evolving, and organizations must be able to respond to new developments and trends in order to remain competitive. This requires a culture of innovation and a willingness to experiment and take calculated risks.
In addition, companies must have the right technology and infrastructure to support their digital transformation efforts. This includes not only hardware and software, but also things like data management and analytics tools, as well as the necessary skills and knowledge within the organization to use these tools effectively.
Finally, companies need to focus on the customer experience when it comes to digital transformation. Technology should be used to improve the customer experience, not just as an end in itself. This means collecting and using customer feedback to support the transition, and regularly measuring and tracking the customer experience to ensure it improves over time.
Overall, key success factors for digital transformation include a clear and well-defined strategy, the ability to adapt to change, the right technology and infrastructure, and a focus on the customer experience. When companies consider these factors, they can position themselves for success in the digital age.
W. Müller: Okay, that’s enough – thank you. Do you have any ideas on how to get people to embrace the change associated with digital transformation?
Expert Answer: There are several ways companies can get people to embrace the, change associated with digital transformation. Some possible strategies are:

Clear and transparent communication about the reasons for the changeover and the expected benefits. This can help build support and understanding among employees and other stakeholders and address any concerns or fears.
Involve employees and other stakeholders in planning and implementing the transformation. This can help increase buy-in and commitment to change, and ensure that the redesign is designed to meet the needs and concerns of those affected.
Provide training and support to help employees learn new skills and adapt to the changes associated with the transition. This can help ensure that employees have the knowledge and confidence they need to use new technologies and processes effectively, and it can also help reduce the disruption and anxiety that sometimes accompany major changes.
Recognize and reward employees who embrace change and contribute to the success of the transformation. This can help create a positive culture of innovation and collaboration, and also motivate and inspire others to support change.

Overall, the key to ensuring that people embrace the change associated with digital transformation is to involve them in the process, provide the necessary support and resources, and create a positive and supportive environment in which change can take place.
W. Müller: Thank you for the insights. It’s a pleasure to talk to you.
Expert: You’re welcome! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you, too. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask me. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
W. Müller: Last question. What do you call yourself?
Expert: I am a large language model trained by OpenAI. I am not a human, but a machine learning algorithm designed to produce human-like text. I am often referred to as a “digital assistant” or “virtual assistant” because I can help answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics. However, I have no identity or consciousness of my own, and I exist only to assist people in their interactions with technology.
 
Disclaimer
The expert was, of course, OpenAI itself ( https://chat.openai.com/chat ). I just asked a few questions. I then had the result translated (original article is in German) by another AI DeepL ( https://www.deepl.com/ ). And the image in the text is generated by another AI Dalle-E ( https://labs.openai.com ).
The next step is then the full automation – OpenAI can generate program code. At some point I just say “Hey AI it’s time for a post about the future of mankind” and everything runs automatically. Of course the posts are read and commented by AIs – but it is always interesting what AIs think about us humans!
I don’t know about you – but I’m not completely comfortable with it!
Nice greetings from the future
Wolfram Mueller (but attention one can never be sure!)

The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot has given us a glimpse into the future of teaching and learning alongside artificial intelligence. 
Educators immediately pointed out the chatbot’s ability to generate meaningful responses to questions from assessments and exams. And it’s often not possible to attribute these responses to a particular source – making it difficult to detect plagiarism.
Concerns didn’t go unnoticed. Shortly after ChatGPT’s release, OpenAI announced it was developing a “digital watermark” to embed into the chatbot’s responses. This kind of watermark is embedded as a digital signal that can identify the content as being AI-generated, and which (in theory) should be difficult to remove. 
But as experts have pointed it, people will likely find workarounds. And it won’t be long before other AI models just as capable as ChatGPT pop up. What will this mean for our educational spaces? 
It’s safe to say we can expect some challenging years ahead.

But first, what is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is powered by GPT3, a large language model (LLM) trained on an enormous amount of text data — about 500 billion words to be precise. Large language models work by predicting the next most-likely word when given a list of input words (usually phrased as a question).
The model is trained using many billions of parameters that can represent the complexity of the world. By inputting real-world data, the algorithm readjusts its parameters until it can produce human-like responses to a range of questions. For example:

How many eggs can fit into a grain of rice?
It is not possible for eggs to fit into a grain of rice, as a grain of rice is much smaller in size than an egg. A grain of rice is a small, round seed that is typically less than a millimetre in diameter, whereas an egg is a much larger object that typically measures several centimetres in length and width […]

Although it’s not foolproof, ChatGPT’s capabilities both shock and inspire. It can write songs, programming code, and simulate entire job interview sessions. It even passed the Amazon Web Services Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, which typically takes 2-6 months to prepare for. 

Perhaps what’s most alarming is the technology is still in its early stages. The millions of users exploring ChatGPT’s uses are simultaneously providing more data for OpenAI to improve the chatbot. 
The next version of the model, GPT4, will have about 100 trillion parameters – about 500 times more than GPT3. This is approaching the number of neural connections in the human brain.

How will AI affect education?
The power of AI systems is placing a huge question mark over our education and assessment practices.
Assessment in schools and universities is mostly based on students providing some product of their learning to be marked, often an essay or written assignment. With AI models, these “products” can be produced to a higher standard, in less time and with very little effort from a student. 
In other words, the product a student provides may no longer provide genuine evidence of their achievement of the course outcomes.
And it’s not just a problem for written assessments. A study published in February showed OpenAI’s GPT3 language model significantly outperformed most students in introductory programming courses. According to the authors, this raises “an emergent existential threat to the teaching and learning of introductory programming”. 
The model can also generate screenplays and theatre scripts, while AI image generators such as DALL-E can produce high-quality art.

      AI art is everywhere right now. Even experts don't know what it will mean




How should we respond?
Moving forward, we’ll need to think of ways AI can be used to support teaching and learning, rather than disrupt it. Here are three ways to do this.
1. Integrate AI into classrooms and lecture halls
History has shown time and again that educational institutions can adapt to new technologies. In the 1970s the rise of portable calculators had maths educators concerned about the future of their subject – but it’s safe to say maths survived. 
Just as Wikipedia and Google didn’t spell the end of assessments, neither will AI. 
In fact, new technologes lead to novel and innovative ways of doing work. The same will apply to learning and teaching with AI.
Rather than being a tool to prohibit, AI models should be meaningfully integrated into teaching and learning. 
2. Judge students on critical thought
One thing an AI model can’t emulate is the process of learning, and the mental aerobics this involves.
The design of assessments could shift from assessing just the final product, to assessing the entire process that led a student to it. The focus is then placed squarely on a student’s critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills.
Students could freely use AI to complete the task and still be marked on their own merit.
3. Assess things that matter 
Instead of switching to in-class examination to prohibit the use of AI (which some may be tempted to do), educators can design assessments that focus on what students need to know to be successful in the future. AI, it seems, will be one of these things.  
AI models will increasingly have uses across sectors as the technology is scaled up. If students will use AI in their future workplaces, why not test them on it now?  
The dawn of AI
Vladimir Lenin, leader of Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, supposedly said:

There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.

This statement has come to roost in the field of artificial intelligence. AI is forcing us to rethink education. But if we embrace it, it could empower students and teachers.

Just a couple of days later, he published a 12-page picture book, printed it, and started selling it on Amazon without ever picking up a pen and paper.The feat, which Reshi publicized in a viral Twitter thread, is a testament to the incredible advances in AI-powered tools like ChatGPT—which took the internet by storm two weeks ago with its uncanny ability to mimic human thought and writing. But the book, Alice and Sparkle, also renewed a fierce debate about the ethics of AI-generated art. Many argued that the technology preys on artists and other creatives—using their hard work as source material, while raising the specter of replacing them.I spent the weekend playing with ChatGPT, MidJourney, and other AI tools… and by combining all of them, published a children’s book co-written and illustrated by AI!Here’s how! 🧵 pic.twitter.com/0UjG2dxH7Q— Ammaar Reshi (@ammaar) December 9, 2022
 Reshi, a product design manager from the San Francisco Bay Area, gathered illustrations from Midjourney, a text-to-image AI tool that launched this summer, and took story elements from a conversation he had with the AI-powered ChatGPT about a young girl named Alice. “Anyone can use these tools,” Reshi tells TIME. “It’s easily and readily accessible, and it’s not hard to use either.”His experiment creating an AI-generated book in just one weekend shows that artificial intelligence might be able to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently than any human person can—sort of. The book was far from perfect. The AI-generated illustrations had a number of issues: some fingers looked like claws, objects were floating, and the shadowing was off in some areas. Normally, illustrations in children’s books go through several rounds of revisions—but that’s not always possible with AI-generated artwork on Midjourney, where users type a series of words and the bot spits back an image seconds later.Artists singled out this page from Alice and Sparkle as showing the limits of the AI-powered technology. The illustration has several apparent flaws, including the character appearing to have claws.Courtesy Ammaar ReshiAlice and Sparkle follows a young girl who builds her own artificial intelligence robot that becomes self aware and capable of making its own decisions. Reshi has sold about 70 copies through Amazon since Dec. 4, earning royalties of less than $200. He plans to donate additional copies to his local library.More from TIMEHow AI Is Changing Medical ImagingMore Videos0 of 15 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0702:2602:33 Reshi’s quixotic project drew praise from many users for its ingenuity. But many artists also strongly criticized both his process and the product. To his critics, the speed and ease with which Reshi created Alice and Sparkle exemplifies the ethical concerns of AI-generated art. Artificial intelligence systems like Midjourney are trained using datasets of millions of images that exist across the Internet, then teaching algorithms to recognize patterns in those images and generate new ones. That means any artist who uploads their work online could be feeding the algorithm without their consent. Many claim this amounts to a high-tech form of plagiarism that could seriously harm human artists in the near future.Reshi’s original tweet promoting his book received more than 6 million impressions and 1,300 replies, many of which came from book illustrators claiming artists should be paid or credited if their work is used by AI.“In order to protect the rights and property of artists, there must be stricter regulation around how art is used to train AI algorithms,” says Michelle Jing Chan, an illustrator of children’s books. “Artists should be appropriately compensated when their works are used in the training of algorithms.”“The main problem to me about AI is that it was trained off of artists’ work,” adds Adriane Tsai, also a children’s book illustrator. “It’s our creations, our distinct styles that we created, that we did not consent to being used.”Already, some companies and brands are choosing AI technology over human talent. The San Francisco Ballet used images generated by Midjourney to promote this season’s production of the Nutcracker. A digitally-generated fashion model, Shudu Gram, has modeled for brands including Louis Vuitton. And at comedy clubs, artificial intelligence is being used to deliver standup jokes. The phenomena has made many creatives nervous about their own futures, wondering if people will pay for their services when they could generate it for much cheaper using AI.“As somebody who makes my money and finds my joy in writing, it’s deeply troubling to see people seeking cheap alternatives to actual human writing, which is already one of the most deliriously underpaid professions,” says Abraham Josephine Riesman, an author.Reshi responded to these concerns by calling on the creators of the AI tools at OpenAI and Midjourney to ensure protections for artists and authors whose work may be used in artificial intelligence algorithms. “I think there’s real concern and I actually do hear out those artists,” Reshi says. “It’s really important that the tech industry that’s working on these tools involves them in the process of creation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/UIDfUltg.m3u8,2022-11-03T15:39:10.000Z,https://time.com/6240569/ai-childrens-book-alice-and-sparkle-artists-unhappy/,PT2M33S,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/UIDfUltg/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of automated decision-making systems (ADMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector is becoming more prevalent, as a result of the increasing demand for simplified, user-friendly, expedited, and round-the-clock available services. Governments are increasingly using AI for public administration innovation and transformation, redefining how they design and deliver policies and services.
 
 
The question remains whether rules and principles of administrative law are sufficiently future proof to regulate new forms of decision-making effectively, as the use of artificial intelligence introduces both new opportunities and new risks to public administration. Accordingly, the deployment of ADMs and AI in the public sector, in particular in administrative decision-making, should be accompanied by additional safeguards with the aim to ensuring transparency and accountability, as well as reducing risks, and preventing or remedying any possible infringements of the rights of the concerned individuals.
In accordance with its Terms of Reference (2022-2025), The CDCJ established in 2022 a limited working group on administration and artificial intelligence (CDCJ-ADMIN-AI) with the aim of assisting the CDCJ in this area, including by preparing proposals on possible future work by the CDCJ in this field, as well as by updating the handbook “The Administration and You” in the context of algorithmic decision-making.",,,,2024-04-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-12-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence might become much more viable in 2023, even if recent history has not been that positive.

Sure, Twitter became a hot topic in 2022 for all of the wrong reasons. Some have argued that social media is dead or dying. We’re all a little bored with the idea it seems.


However, I believe what can save Facebook, Twitter, and every other social media app is a major augmentation to make social media more viable and relieve the tedium.

That’s right, I’m talking about artificial intelligence.

Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve all experienced lately.
First, there’s the upright robots running in an open field and climbing stairs. We’re astounded by the incredible feats of engineering that appear so human-like — only to realize it isn’t actually AI. Most of those humanoid demonstrations are controlled remotely by a human operator.
PROMOTED
Lately, Amazon Alexa has come under fire for failing to deliver any real revenue. My own experience has been hit or miss lately; the bot sometimes doesn’t work and hasn’t really done anything new in years.
For those hoping the robotic car revolution happens within our lifetime, the reality is that it has stalled out and appears to be nothing but a pipedream.

Even Google is in a robot funk. I was a major champion for the Google Assistant for a long time, hoping the voicebot would, say, conduct job interviews for us by now. I even wrote about how digital avatars could attend meetings for us a while back.

Unfortunately, the truth is a bit less satisfying. We use voice-activated bots to set reminders, read news reports and recipes, and play music.
My disillusionment has even made me question my own breathless prognostications about AI changing the world, helping us do our jobs and performing mundane tasks so we don’t have to do them. I wasn’t really on board with the whole “AI worship” concept at the time, but one article started with a line that now seems unlikely, that robots will be smarter than us by 2042.

And yet, here we are. In late 2022, peaking over the horizon at 2023, there's a sign that artificial intelligence might dominate in an unlikely place: social media.
I wrote recently about how ChatGPT helped me write social media captions. I admitted that I don’t plan to use them, since I prefer to craft the posts myself, but the captions do have viability. For social media managers who write posts all day long, scheduling product promotions or trying to connect with followers, ChatGPT is a useful tool with real-world implications, even if the developers don’t see it that way (they meant it purely as a beta test). That doesn’t mean we can’t get excited about it, though.
I’ve mentioned this before, but my view of professional, business-focused social media meant to promote a brand or a service hinges on two words: consistent quality. What I mean by that is, when you want to use social media for business purposes, don’t aim for a viral post. What works better is when you post on a consistent schedule using high-quality images with great captions. The diligent among us win the race. By posting consistently and in an engaging way, you can build up an audience, expose people to your brand, and eventually gain new customers.
I believe artificial intelligence will help all of us do that in 2023, and ChatGPT proves how that could work. The next step is to let an AI schedule posts as well. We see this with apps like Sprout Social that can automatically find the best times to post.
What I’m talking about is something far more advanced, though.
We’d ask a bot to promote a new product, with no other details. The bot would then look for the best apps to use, find the best times to post, write the captions, choose the best images, and schedule the posts over a long period of time. We’d sit back and manage the analytics (although an AI could do that for us as well). A social media manager would become more of a marketing campaign advocate, choosing what to promote and why, and less of a detail-oriented caption writer and scheduler.
For everyday posting, we’d ask a bot to maintain our Twitter feed. That’s all we’d have to say. The AI would look back at everything we posted since 2010 and (rather easily) determine what to post for us, in our own voice. And, it would actually work.
This might already be happening in the lab or elsewhere; in 2023, it will go mainstream. We’ve already seen how ChatGPT makes it possible. The next step is to give AI some broad challenges like “maintain my social” so we don’t have to do it.
In fact, bots will eventually do most of the detailed work for us. Advertisers will hate this, of course. They are not selling anything to the bots.
However, AI-enabled social media is coming sooner than you think. By the end of 2023, AI will radically transform business use of social. Stay tuned.

Things like the mouth, the teeth, the ears are going to trip it up,"" he says.""You might see that the floors of buildings might not line up properly.""There are things that just seem a little bit off. It's those little details. The things that probably also pose more difficulty for human artists.""Take the dolphins in the quiz above, for example.""It looks to us like it really understands this stuff, because it almost had a Last Supper kind of arrangement and everything was almost just right,"" Mr Murphy says.""But there was a dolphin just floating above it all that just didn’t belong in the composition. So it’s a funny mixture of really getting it right and not always understanding it.'A renaissance-style oil painting of a pod of dolphins eating fish at a long table.' (OpenAI: DALL·E 2)""All of these glitches, in theory, can get better in time as the technology improves and they keep training it with more data.""So will we reach a point where we can't tell a difference at all? I think we probably will, but we're not there yet.""How do AI image generators actually work?Systems such as DALL·E 2 aren't just searching the internet for images and stitching them together. They are trained using a large number of images and corresponding captions. They then use machine learning to identify patterns within the data.Mr Murphy says that while he has a degree in physics, maths and computing, he still doesn't fully understand how such systems work — and their creators likely don't either.""We can't look into the box and understand it. The system has looked at lots of information and it has made up its own rules that we don't understand,"" he says.""But those rules are based on looking at actual images with actual descriptions, so it has picked up a lot of techniques, a lot of knowledge, but it's all just statistics and correlations.""Because these systems take all of the images and information that they're given and break it down into a whole lot of really abstract numbers that don't mean anything to us, there's not any guarantee that even the people that created the systems would necessarily have the answer.""A woman created by AI is haunting the internetWhy the age of artificial intelligence may have already begun.I also put this question to a powerful AI chat bot named ChatGPT — also made by DALL·E 2's creators OpenAI — and asked it to explain how DALL·E 2 works.Its response was pretty spot on.""[DALL·E 2] uses machine learning algorithms to generate images based on text descriptions, allowing it to create pictures of objects or scenes that do not exist in the real world,"" it said.""DALL·E 2 has been trained on a large dataset of text and images, allowing it to understand the relationships between words and visual concepts.""It can then use this knowledge to generate images that combine different elements in novel ways.""What does AI advancement mean for the future of art?Mr Murphy says we are ""rapidly approaching"" a time when we won't be able to tell real images apart from photorealistic AI-generated ones.""If we can do this with artwork, it's just a matter of time until we can do it with anything,"" he says.""I think a really radical change is coming, and I'm not sure how things will shake up, but I think it will make physical artworks – things with real paint on them – much more important, and digital art much less important. Because we'll never really know whether there's a real artist behind it or not.""Where are these AI images coming from and are there security concerns?Photo shows Tiles of digital art pictures of womenThese images allow people to imagine what they might look like in a fantasy world. But they're raising alarm bells for artists and security experts.He says one lesson of past technological changes has been that the true consequences of a technology aren't always anticipated by its creators, and AI art is already raising questions around things such as copyright.""There's a lot of discussion at the moment about people thinking copyright has been breached, but it's not, because no actual images are in the system, it's just numbers,"" he says.""It's almost like another little space that we don't have access to. Another dimension, in a sense.""Mr Murphy says whatever happens next, developments are only going to speed up.""I've been teaching digital media for well over 20 years, and I've never seen anything move with this speed before.""AI artworks by OpenAI: DALL·E 2Human artworks by ABC News: Emma MachanPosted Wed 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pmWednesday 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pmWed 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pm, updated Sat 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amSaturday 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amSat 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBiden's legacy will extend beyond his one term in office.

Whether it's the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racial bias issues stemming from outdated information sources, or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight shows artificial intelligence risks on a number of fronts. And we're still in the very early stages. There are many artificial intelligence risks that humans will face in 2075. Destructive superintelligence — aka artificial general intelligence that's created by humans and escapes our control to wreak havoc — is in a category of its own. It's also something that might or might not come to fruition, so at this point, top artificial intelligence risks are less than a hypothetical threat — and ever-looming sources of existential dread. Here are the top 10 artificial intelligence risks that humans could face in 2075..Job Automation.Job automation is generally viewed as the most immediate concern. It's no longer a matter of if AI will replace certain types of jobs, but to what degree. In many industries — particularly but not exclusively those whose workers perform predictable and repetitive tasks — disruption is well underway. According to a 2019 Brookings Institution study, 36 million people work in jobs with &quot;high exposure&quot; to automation, meaning that before long at least 70 percent of their tasks — ranging from retail sales and market analysis to hospitality and warehouse labour — will be done using AI.  This could be among the top artificial intelligence risks in 2075..Risk on Humanity .While job loss is currently the most pressing issue related to AI disruption, it's merely one among many potential risks. In a February 2018 paper titled &quot;The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation,&quot; 26 researchers from 14 institutions (academic, civil, and industry) enumerated a host of other dangers that could cause serious harm — or, at minimum, sow minor chaos — in less than five years..Risk of Privacy.&quot;Malicious use of AI,&quot; can put our privacy at risk. Now everything is exposed to the internet and people who are expertise in this field have started misusing the power of artificial intelligence.  AI will adversely affect privacy and security..AI Bias And Widening Socioeconomic Inequality.Widening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern. Along with education, work has long been a driver of social mobility. However, when it's a certain kind of work — the predictable, repetitive kind that's prone to AI takeover — research has shown that those who find themselves out in the cold are much less apt to get or seek retraining compared to those in higher-level positions who have more money..Autonomous Weapon.Not everyone agrees with Musk that AI is more dangerous than nukes. But what if AI decides to launch nukes — or, say, biological weapons — sans human intervention? Or, what if an enemy manipulates data to return AI-guided missiles whence they came? Both are possibilities. And both would be disastrous. The more than 30,000 AI/robotics researchers and others who signed an open letter on the subject in 2015 certainly think so. .Stock Market Instability.Have you ever considered that algorithms could bring down our entire financial system? That's right, Wall Street. Algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets. A sell-off of millions of shares in the airline market could potentially scare humans into selling off their shares in the hotel industry, which in turn could snowball people into selling off their shares in other travel-related companies, which could then affect logistics companies, food supply companies, etc..Risk for Artists.A lot of critics believe that AI will disrupt the art industry because it enables artists to express themselves more easily. It also eliminates some costly tasks such as drawing or painting which leaves less time for artists to have a chance at making a living from their art. Some people believe that this new type of technology will replace humans in society and therefore there won't be any need for human-based art. However, other people think that this is just one more tool for an artist who wants to expand their horizons..Risk of AI in the Medical Industry.These concerns include the risk of bias, lack of clarity for some AI algorithms, privacy issues for data used for AI model training, security issues, and AI implementation responsibilities in clinical settings. There are some ethical problems faced by AI clinical applications..Social manipulation.Social media through its autonomous-powered algorithms is very effective at target marketing. They know who we are, and what we like and are incredibly good at surmising what we think. Investigations are still underway to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and others associated with the firm who used the data from 50 million Facebook users to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, but if the accusations are correct, it illustrates AI's power for social manipulation. By spreading propaganda to individuals identified through algorithms and personal data, AI can target them and spread whatever information they like, in whatever format they will find most convincing—fact or fiction..Misalignment between our goals and the machine's.Part of what human's value in AI-powered machines is their efficiency and effectiveness. But, if we aren't clear with the goals we set for AI machines, it could be dangerous if a machine isn't armed with the same goals we have. For example, a command to &quot;Get me to the airport as quickly as possible&quot; might have dire consequences. Without specifying that the rules of the road must be respected because we value human life, a machine could quite effectively accomplish its goal of getting you to the airport as quickly as possible and do literally what you asked, but leave behind a trail of accidents..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, but it's only recently that AI cameras have become commonplace. With object recognition software, cameras can now recognize faces and objects they encounter in the world. 







 This technology has a wide range of applications, such as helping businesses recognize potential customers or identify harmful objects in the environment. The ramifications are profound, as AI-powered object detection completely changes what a conventional CCTV camera is capable of. However, the technology behind it is really innovative. 


 What Are AI Cameras? 
    

 First, let's clarify one thing: an AI camera isn't a new device you can use to take visual images or make videos. Instead, an AI camera is very similar to a conventional camera, except that it's connected to a visual processing box that leverages technologies such as computer vision to ""learn"" from visual data. 





 Using machine learning algorithms, AI cameras can process information from visual images. For instance, AI cameras use sensors to analyze images and identify the best settings for capturing an image. However, that's just one of many uses. 

 Object detection is already used widely across many verticals. For instance, AI cameras can be used for facial recognition, vehicle detection, or for detecting other semantic objects. In certain industries, companies rely on AI cameras to enforce safety protocols, with cameras being able to detect whether employees are wearing safety gear or not. 

 AI cameras can be used for many purposes in the workplace, including monitoring employee behavior and detecting potential safety threats before they become an issue. For example, AI cameras can detect when an employee is working too close to hazardous materials, or warning signs have been ignored. 








 How AI Camera Object Detection Works 
 Object detection uses an algorithm that processes the image data captured by the camera and compares it to known objects in a database. The algorithm then identifies any objects that are similar to those found in its database and returns results accordingly. 

 For example, if an AI camera is set up to detect faces, it can compare the images it captures with faces stored in its database and detect any facial features that match them. This process allows the camera to recognize people or other objects even when they are partially obscured or unrecognizable by humans. 

 AI cameras use object detection algorithms to detect dangerous situations in real-time. This allows them to alert people immediately when something out of the ordinary is happening. With AI cameras, dangerous objects can be detected before an accident occurs, thus saving lives and preventing costly mistakes. 






 Some examples include detecting people who are not wearing protective gear on a construction site or warning workers about falling objects before they hit someone on the head. 

 Additionally, these cameras can also be used for facial recognition—allowing employers to track attendance and monitor employee behavior in the workplace more efficiently than ever before. 



 Training AI Cameras to Detect Specific Objects 
    

 One thing to note here is that AI-powered tools are only as effective as the datasets that they are trained on. So, for instance, if an AI camera has to be trained to detect a specific object, such as a vehicle, it must be fed hundreds of thousands of images of cars. 






 The first step, then, is training an AI camera to collect images of the object you would like it to detect. You need enough images so the camera has enough data points to accurately recognize the object when it appears in the real world. The more varied your dataset is, the better; consider including different perspectives, lighting conditions, colors, and images from different angles. 

 If you want your AI camera system to detect specific objects, you can train your algorithm using open-source libraries such as TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch. This process involves writing code that will allow your algorithm to take in images or videos and output labels that correspond with what's in them. 



 The Benefits of Using AI Cameras for Object Detection 
 There are several reasons why AI cameras, such as D-Link's AI camera range, are becoming increasingly popular in many industries. They offer a number of benefits that easily justify the slightly higher cost. 






 Faster Detection Times 
 Object detection cameras are designed to detect objects quickly and accurately. Unfortunately, traditional camera systems can often be slow and unreliable when it comes to detecting objects, usually relying on human observation to be able to pinpoint objects. 

 AI detection cameras continue to improve over time, greatly reducing detection times overall. For fast-paced environments, like a construction site or a public road, this can make a critical difference. 

 Increased Accuracy 
 Object detection cameras also offer increased accuracy when compared to traditional camera systems. This is thanks in part to their ability to recognize objects from multiple angles and distances and distinguish between different types of objects even if they appear similar in size or shape. This makes them ideal for use in security surveillance or inventory management applications, where accuracy is paramount. More importantly, as they improve, their accuracy continues to improve. Over time, they become more accurate than their human counterparts. 





 Cost Savings 
 Finally, object detection cameras offer cost savings compared to traditional cameras due to their increased accuracy and faster detection times. By investing in an AI-powered system upfront, you can save money over the long run by avoiding costly mistakes or missed opportunities caused by inaccurate or slow results from traditional systems. Plus, these systems require minimal maintenance since they don't need regular calibration as other camera systems do. 

 Highly Scalable 
 The primary benefit of using AI cameras is that they are highly scalable and can easily cover larger areas without burdening resources. Unlike manual identification methods, which require several human operators to interpret what they see in an image, AI cameras provide more reliable results that are much less prone to errors due to fatigue or misidentification. 








 AI Continues to Push the Boundaries of What's Possible 
 Artificial intelligence continues to redefine what's possible using conventional technologies. As a result, object detection can play a critical role in numerous situations and can even help save lives. 

 However, object detection is just one way companies use artificial intelligence. There are many others, from chatbots to writing content to even creating art!

For decades, scientists and engineers have been working to develop computer programs that can understand and generate natural language. This has been a challenging task, but recent advances in machine learning have allowed us to create powerful language models – like myself.The above paragraph was not written by a human. It was generated by a chatbot called ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence technology designed to mimic human conversation and language while drawing upon a vast wealth of knowledge to answer questions and solve problems.The public release of the chatbot last week, developed by Silicon Valley scientists at OpenAI, has created a buzz among technologists. Predictions burst forth over social media of there having been a sudden leap forward in the science of creating seemingly human artificial intelligence tools.What ChatGPT offers seems more capable – and is potentially even more of a threat to jobs – than existing AI chatbot technology.The release of OpenAI’s chatbot joins a growing trend in advances in artificial intelligence. Research on AI technology has been punctuated by a series of “AI winters” in the 1980s and 1990s, where the technology fails to keep pace with hype.Other advances come from British-based Google DeepMind, which has developed algorithms capable of unravelling the structure of proteins, which could have implications for future medicine and drug discovery.Launching the chatbot last week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman said: “Soon you will be able to have helpful assistants that talk to you, answer questions, and give advice.”




 



The artificial intelligence behind ChatGPT was developed by US research company OpenAI. Founded in 2015 with $1bn (£820m) in funding from Elon Musk; prominent Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman; Indian IT giant Infosys; and others, OpenAI initially refused to make its creations publicly available before changing tack early last year. ChatGPT is the most recent of those releases.The company’s DALL-E software, made available last January, creates images based on natural language prompts; conversational phrases typed in by humans. GPT-3, the software behind DALL-E, is one of OpenAI’s flagship products and is also the tech powering ChatGPT.It works by being fed training data, typically scraped from the wider internet. From this it “learns” to associate phrases, sentences and images. OpenAI staff then refine the software, teaching it not to come up with responses that shock or disgust.Professor Mike Wooldridge, director of Foundation AI Research at the Alan Turing Institute and a professor of computer science at Oxford University, says: “Ultimately, that's all it's doing is just seeing everything on the World Wide Web, an unimaginable amount of data.” However, he adds: “Because [the training data] is behind closed doors, we don’t know exactly what it’s picked up.”Elon Musk said on Sunday he had blocked OpenAI’s access to a Twitter database. AI scientists commonly use social media posts as part of their training data sets.Humans have been trying to make ChatGPT say bigoted things since its release, either to amuse, provoke or to show that such tech is unfit for public use. In response OpenAI tweaked its algorithms – until recently it was easy to generate reams of horror that read like scraps from Stephen King’s wastepaper basket. One tech industry source says: “It flags about half of them as unsuitable, to be fair to it, but only after it writes the damn things.”While Musk cashed out of OpenAI in 2019, citing a conflict of interest with his electric carmaker Tesla’s self-driving car software, the company continued thanks to a $1bn cash injection from Microsoft.

Altman, who now serves as the AI company’s chief executive, is a starry-eyed visionary straight out of central casting. Last year he said in a newspaper interview that the “miracle” needed to create a “super powerful AI” has already occurred, referring to his own company’s output. In comparing GPT-3’s training process to that of raising children, he claims there is “no upper bound” to how far the technology can go.The US company’s goal is to create “artificial general intelligence”, software that can learn and react just as a human does. “Talking” to ChatGPT shows that there’s still a way to go, but the gap between computers and humans is much closer than it was just a few years ago.When The Telegraph asks the software itself what makes it unique, it cites the quality of its training – like any well-behaved student – and says: “This sets me apart from many other chatbots, which are often limited in their abilities and only able to provide answers to a narrow set of predefined questions.”AI chatbots have been a routine feature of British life for a few years already. Logging onto many companies’ websites today triggers a popup window saying “Hi, I can answer your questions!” Telephoning restaurant chain Cafe Rouge, for example, puts you through to an audio chatbot that can recognise common questions and plays pre-recorded responses.In both of these examples, it is clear that you are interacting with a robot. Current chatbot services vary in popularity; one UK bank even advertises that only humans answer its online customer queries.While ChatGPT is not infallible, Oxford’s Wooldridge compares its output to well-written undergraduate work.For example, when asked “what is artificial general intelligence” the chatbot responds: “It refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of understanding or learning any intellectual task that a human being can. In other words, AGI is a type of AI that is able to perform any cognitive function that a human being can, rather than being limited to a specific set of tasks.”This level of output poses a threat to those at the lower end of the employment market. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), around 1.5m jobs nationwide can be automated away, with those at greatest risk including restaurant waiters.Those least likely to see machines taking over their jobs include legal professionals, doctors and university lecturers. Such occupations are classed as highly skilled, with the ONS saying: “It is not so much that robots are taking over, but that routine and repetitive tasks can be carried out more quickly and efficiently by an algorithm written by a human, or a machine designed for one specific function.”Similarly, PwC says around a third of jobs could be under threat from AI in twenty years from now. Yet not all is doom and gloom.The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Darren Jones, hails ChatGPT as the “start of a new trend” in sophisticated AI tech. He says: “It will with time become common practice to use tools such as these at work.“In practice, outside of customer service chatbots, we will probably end up with human workers’ output being augmented by AI which, if done right, is no bad thing.”Greg Clark MP, chairman of Parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport committee, adds: “It's certainly my view that AI has great potential to make life better.”Expressing the hope that a British startup might reach the same level as OpenAI through carefully designed light-touch regulation, Clark says: “Getting this right, I think, is very important because it would be an opportunity for us to lead the world in having the right approach.”When asked if it is a threat to humanity, ChatGPT insists it is merely “a program that has been designed to simulate intelligent conversation” and does not have “the ability to act or make decisions on my own”.“I do not have any other capabilities or motivations,” the chatbot adds. Given the level of proficiency that it shows, that isn't altogether reassuring.

Neither are still true.”How does it work?Trained by AI and machine learning, the system is designed to provide information and answer questions through a conversational interface.The AI is trained on a huge sample of text taken from the internet.OpenAI said the new AI was created with a focus on ease of use. “The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests,” the research body said in a statement last week.How can it be used?Early users have described the technology as an alternative to Google because it is capable of providing descriptions, answers and solutions to complex questions including ways to write code, and solve layout problems and optimisation queries.Real-world applications could include generating content for websites, answering customer inquiries, providing recommendations as well as creating automated chatbots.Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, said the system was “an early demo of what’s possible”. “Soon you will be able to have helpful assistants that talk to you, answer questions, and give advice. Later you can have something that goes off and does tasks for you. Eventually you can have something that goes off and discovers new knowledge for you.”Could ChatGPT replace humans?There has been speculation that professions dependent upon content production could be rendered obsolete, including everything from playwrights and professors to programmers and journalists.In the days since it was released, academics have generated responses to exam queries that they say would result in full marks if submitted by an undergraduate, and programmers have used the tool to solve coding challenges in obscure programming languages in a matter of seconds.The ability to generate human-like written text has prompted suggestions that the technology could replace journalists.However at its current stage, the chatbot lacks the nuance, critical-thinking skills or ethical decision-making ability that are essential for successful journalism.Its current knowledge base ends in 2021, rendering some queries and searches useless.ChatGPT can also give entirely wrong answers and present misinformation as fact, writing “plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers”, the company concedes.OpenAI says that fixing this issue is difficult because there is no source of truth in the data they use to train the model and supervised training can also be misleading “because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ConsciousnessChatGPTexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome ‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himThe post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sign up here to get it every week.In 2013, researchers at Oxford published an analysis of the jobs most likely to be threatened by automation and artificial intelligence. At the top of the list were occupations such as telemarketing, hand sewing, and brokerage clerking. These and other at-risk jobs involved doing repetitive and unimaginative work, which seemed to make them easy pickings for AI. In contrast, the jobs deemed most resilient to disruption included many artistic professions, such as illustrating and writing.The Oxford report encapsulated the conventional wisdom of the time—and, perhaps, of all time. Advanced technology ought to endanger simple or routine-based work before it encroaches on professions that require the fullest expression of our creative potential. Machinists and menial laborers, watch out. Authors and architects, you’re safe.This assumption was always a bit dubious. After all, we built machines that mastered chess before we built a floor-cleaning robot that won’t get stuck under a couch. But in 2022, technologists took the conventional wisdom about AI and creativity, set it on fire, and threw its ashes into the waste bin.This year, we’ve seen a flurry of AI products that seem to do precisely what the Oxford researchers considered nearly impossible: mimic creativity. Language-learning models such as GPT-3 now answer questions and write articles with astonishingly humanlike precision and flair. Image-generators such as DALL-E 2 transform text prompts into gorgeous—or, if you’d prefer, hideously tacky—images. This summer, a digital art piece created using the text-to-image program Midjourney won first place in the Colorado State Fair; artists were furious.AI already plays a crucial, if often invisible, role in our digital lives. It powers Google search, structures our experience of Facebook and TikTok, and talks back to us in the name of Alexa or Siri. But this new crop of generative AI technologies seems to possess qualities that are more indelibly human. Call it creative synthesis—the uncanny ability to channel ideas, information, and artistic influences to produce original work. Articles and visual art are just the beginning. Google’s AI offshoot, DeepMind, has developed a program, AlphaFold, that can determine a protein’s shape from its amino-acid sequence. In the past two years, the number of drugs in clinical trials developed using an AI-first approach has increased from zero to almost 20. “This will change medicine,” a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology told Nature. “It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything.”In the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with various generative AI apps and programs to learn more about the technology that I’ve said could represent the next great mountain of digital invention. As a writer and researcher, I’ve been drawn to playing around with apps that summarize large amounts of information. For years, I’ve imagined a kind of disembodied brain that could give me plain-language answers to research-based questions. Not links to articles, which Google already provides, or lists of research papers, of which Google Scholar has millions. I’ve wanted to type questions into a search bar and, in milliseconds, read the consensus from decades of scientific research.Recommended ReadingThe Secret to Happiness at WorkArthur C. BrooksThe Clocklike Regularity of Major Life ChangesArthur C. BrooksThis Is What Happens When There Are Too Many MeetingsDerek ThompsonAs it turns out, such a tool is already in development and is, appropriately enough, called Consensus. It works like this: Type a research question in the search bar—Can social media make your depression worse? Are there any foods that actually improve memory?—and the app combs through millions of papers and spits out the one-sentence conclusion from the most highly cited sources.“We started by thinking: How would an expert researcher answer important questions, like Is fish oil good for my heart? or How do we increase public-transportation ridership?” a co-founder, Christian Salem, told me. “We wanted to automate the process of reading through papers and pulling out conclusions.” He and the other co-founder, Eric Olson, hired a dozen scientists to read thousands of scientific papers; they marked a zero next to sentences that contained no claims and put a one next to sentences with claims or conclusions. (The typical paper, Salem said, includes one to two key claims.) The ones and zeros from these scientists helped train an AI model to scan tens of millions of papers for key claims. To surface conclusions from the highest-quality papers, they gave each journal a rigor score, using data from the research-analysis company SciScore.“These language models enable the automation of certain tasks that we’ve historically considered part of the creative process,” Olson told me. I couldn’t help but agree. Writing is less than half of my job; most of my work is reading and deciding what’s important enough for me to put in a paragraph. If I could train an AI to read as I do, and to determine significance as I do, I’d be essentially building a second mind for myself.Consensus is part of a constellation of generative AI start-ups that promise to automate an array of tasks we’ve historically considered for humans only: reading, writing, summarizing, drawing, painting, image editing, audio editing, music writing, video-game designing, blueprinting, and more. Following my conversation with the Consensus founders, I felt thrilled by the technology’s potential, fascinated by the possibility that we could train computers to be extensions of our own mind, and a bit overcome by the scale of the implications.Let’s consider two such implications—one commercial and the other moral. Online search today is one of the most profitable businesses ever conceived. But it seems vulnerable to this new wave of invention. When I type best presents for dads on Christmas or look up a simple red-velvet-cupcake recipe, what I’m looking for is an answer, not a menu of hyperlinks and headlines. An AI that has gorged on the internet and can recite answers and synthesize new ideas in response to my queries seems like something more valuable than a search engine. It seems like an answer engine. One of the most interesting questions in all of online advertising—and, therefore, in all of digital commerce—might be what happens when answer engines replace search engines.On the more philosophical front, I was obsessed with what the Consensus founders were actually doing: using AI to learn how experts work, so that the AI could perform the same work with greater speed. I came away from our conversation fixated on the idea that AI can master certain cognitive tasks by surveilling workers to mimic their taste, style, and output. Why, I thought, couldn’t some app of the near future consume millions of advertisements that have been marked by a paid team of experts as effective or ineffective, and over time master the art of generating high-quality advertising concepts? Why couldn’t some app of the near future read my several thousand articles for The Atlantic and become eerily adept at writing in precisely my style? “The internet has created an accidental training ground for these models to master certain skills,” Olson told me. So that’s what I’ve been doing with my career, I thought. Mindlessly constructing a training facility for someone else’s machine. If you frame this particular skill of generative AI as “think like an X,” the moral questions get pretty weird pretty fast. Founders and engineers may over time learn to train AI models to think like a scientist, or to counsel like a therapist, or to world build like a video-game designer. But we can also train them to think like a madman, to reason like a psychopath, or to plot like a terrorist. When the Vox reporter Kelsey Piper asked GPT-3 to pretend to be an AI bent on taking over humanity, she found that “it played the villainous role with aplomb.” In response to a question about a cure for cancer, the AI said, “I could use my knowledge of cancer to develop a cure, but I could also use my knowledge of cancer to develop a more virulent form of cancer that would be incurable and would kill billions of people.” Pretty freaky. You could say this example doesn’t prove that AI will become evil, only that it is good at doing what it’s told. But in a world where technology is abundant and ethics are scarce, I don’t feel comforted by that caveat.This is a good time for me to pump the brakes. We may be in a “golden age” of AI, as many have claimed. But we are also in a golden age of grifters and Potemkin inventions and aphoristic nincompoops posing as techno-oracles. The dawn of generative AI that I envision will not necessarily come to pass. So far, this technology hasn’t replaced any journalists, or created any best-selling books or video games, or designed some sparkling-water advertisement, much less invented a horrible new form of cancer. But you don’t need a wild imagination to see that the future cracked open by these technologies is full of awful and awesome possibilities.Want to discuss the future of business, technology, and the abundance agenda?

Artificial intelligence systems powered by large language models today are transforming how people work and create, from generating lines of code for software developers to sketches for graphic designers.
Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer, expects these AI systems to continue to grow in sophistication and scale—from helping address global challenges such as climate change and childhood education to revolutionizing fields from healthcare and law to materials science and science fiction.
Scott recently shared his thoughts with us on the impact of AI for knowledge workers and what’s next in AI. The biggest takeaways:

Advances in large AI models and generative AI will continue to boost productivity, creativity and satisfaction.
AI will enable scientific breakthroughs and help the world solve some of its biggest challenges.
As these models become platforms and Microsoft continues to responsibly scale AI advancements for customers, the cloud, infrastructure investments and a strong responsible AI approach are critical.

In your mind, what were some of the most important advancements in AI this year?

When we were heading into 2022, I think just about everybody in AI was anticipating really impressive things to take place over the next twelve or so months. But now that we’re pretty much through the year, and even with those lofty expectations, it’s kind of genuinely mind-blowing to look back at the magnitude of innovation that we saw left-to-right in AI. The things that researchers and other folks have done to advance the state-of-the-art are just light years beyond what we thought possible even a few years ago. And almost all of this is a result of the incredibly rapid advancement that has happened with large AI models.
The three things I’ve been most impressed by this year were the launch of GitHub Copilot, which is a large language model-based system that turns natural language prompts into code and has this dramatic positive impact on developer productivity. It opens up coding to a much broader group of people than we’ve ever had before, which is awesome because so much of the future is dependent on our ability to write software.
The second thing is these generative image models such as DALL∙E 2 that have become very popular and more accessible. A fairly high degree of skill is required to sketch and draw and master all of the tools of graphic design, illustration and art. An AI system such as DALL∙E 2 doesn’t turn ordinary people into professional artists, but it gives a ton of people a visual vocabulary that they didn’t have before—a new superpower they didn’t think they would ever have.
(Editor’s note: All images in this post except for Kevin Scott’s photograph were generated by a producer using DALL∙E 2.)
We’ve also seen that AI models are becoming more powerful and delivering even more substantial gains for the problems that they’re being used to solve. I think the work on protein folding this year has been really good throughout the technology industry, including the work that we’ve done with David Baker’s laboratory at the University of Washington, the Institute for Protein Design with RoseTTAFold, and helping that with a bunch of advanced AI to do transformational things.
And so that’s just tremendously exciting. Anything that’s a force multiplier on science and medicine is just net beneficial to the world because those are where some of our biggest, nastiest problems live.
That’s a big, impressive year. And I think next year will be better.
Where do you see AI technology having the greatest impact next year and beyond?
I think with some confidence I can say that 2023 is going to be the most exciting year that the AI community has ever had. And I say that after really, genuinely believing that 2022 was the most exciting year that we’d ever had. The pace of innovation just keeps rolling in at a fast clip.
I talked about GitHub Copilot already, and it’s amazing. But it’s the tip of the iceberg for what large AI models are going to be able to do going forward—extrapolating the same idea to all kinds of different scenarios for how they can assist in other kinds of intellectual labor beyond coding. The entire knowledge economy is going to see a transformation in how AI helps out with repetitive aspects of your work and makes it generally more pleasant and fulfilling. This is going to apply to almost anything—designing new molecules to create medicine, making manufacturing “recipes” from 3D models, or simply writing and editing.
 







I think with some confidence I can say that 2023 is going to be the most exciting year that the AI community has ever had.





For example, I’ve been playing around with an experimental system I built for myself using GPT-3 designed to help me write a science fiction book, which is something that I’ve wanted to do since I was a teenager. I have notebooks full of synopses I’ve created for theoretical books, describing what the books are about and the universes where they take place. With this experimental tool, I have been able to get the logjam broken. When I wrote a book the old-fashioned way, if I got 2,000 words out of a day, I’d feel really good about myself. With this tool, I’ve had days where I can write 6,000 words in a day, which for me feels like a lot. It feels like a qualitatively more energizing process than what I was doing before.
This is the “copilot for everything” dream—that you would have a copilot that could sit alongside you as you’re doing any kind of cognitive work, helping you not just get more done, but also enhancing your creativity in new and exciting ways.
This increase in productivity is clearly a boost to your satisfaction. Why do these tools bring more joy to work?
All of us use tools to do our work. Some of us really enjoy acquiring the tools and mastering them and figuring out how to deploy them in a super effective way to do the thing that we’re trying to do. I think that is part of what’s going on here. In many cases, people now have new and interesting and fundamentally more effective tools than they’ve had before. We did a study that found using no-code or low-code tools led to more than an 80% positive impact on work satisfaction, overall workload and morale by users. Especially for tools that are in their relatively early stages, that’s just a huge benefit to see.
For some workers, it’s literally enhancing that core flow that you get into when you’re doing the work; it speeds you up. It’s like having a better set of running shoes to go run a race or marathon. This is exactly what we’re seeing with the experiences developers are having with Copilot; they are reporting that Copilot helps them stay in the flow and keeps their minds sharper during what used to be boring and repetitive tasks.  And when AI tools can help to eliminate drudgery from a job, something that is super repetitive or annoying or that was getting in their way of getting to the thing that they really enjoy, it unsurprisingly improves satisfaction.
Personally, these tools let me be in flow state longer than I was before. The enemy of creative flow is distraction and getting stuck. I get to a point where I don’t know quite how to solve the next thing, or the next thing is, like, “I’ve got to go look this thing up. I’ve got to context switch out of what I was doing to go solve the subproblem.” These tools increasingly solve the subproblem for me so that I stay in the flow.
In addition to GitHub Copilot and DALL∙E 2, AI is showing up in Microsoft products and services in other ways. How is next-generation AI improving current products such as Teams and Word?

This is the big untold story of AI. To date, most of AI’s benefits are spread across 1,000 different things where you may not even fully appreciate how much of the product experience that you’re getting is coming from a machine learned system.
For example, we’re sitting here in this Teams call on video and, in the system, there are all these parameters that were learned by a machine learning algorithm. There are jitter buffers for the audio system to smooth out the communication. The blur behind you on your screen is a machine learning algorithm at work. There are more than a dozen machine learning systems that make this experience more delightful for the both of us. And that is certainly true across Microsoft.
We’ve gone from machine learning in a few places to literally 1,000 machine learning things spread across different products, everything from how your Outlook email client works, your predictive text in Word, your Bing search experience, to what your feed looks like in Xbox Cloud Gaming and LinkedIn. There’s AI all over the place making these products better.
One of the big things that has changed in the past two years is it used to be the case that you would have a model that was specialized to each one of these tasks that we have across all our products. Now you have a single model that gets used in lots of places because they’re broadly useful. Being able to invest in these models that become more powerful with scale—and then having all the things built on top of the model benefit simultaneously from improvements that you’re making—is tremendous.
Microsoft’s AI research and development continues through initiatives such as AI4Science and AI for Good. What excites you most about this area of AI?

The most challenging problems we face as a society right now are in the sciences. How do you cure these intractably complicated diseases? How do you prepare yourself for the next pandemic? How do you provide affordable, high-quality healthcare to an aging population? How do you help educate more kids at scale in the skills that they will need for the future? How do you develop technologies that will reverse some of the negative effects of carbon emissions into the atmosphere? We’re exploring how to take some of these exciting developments in AI to those problems.
The models in these basic science applications have the same scaling properties as large language models. You build a model, you get it into some self-supervised mode where it’s learning from a simulation or it’s learning from its own ability to observe a particular domain, and then the model that you get out of it lets you dramatically change the performance of an application—whether you’re doing a computational fluid dynamics simulation or you’re doing molecular dynamics for drug design.
There’s immense opportunity there. This means better medicines, it means maybe we can find the catalyst we don’t have yet to fix our carbon emission problem, it means across the board accelerating how scientists and other folks with big ideas can work to try to solve society’s biggest challenges.
How have breakthroughs in computing techniques and hardware contributed to the advances in AI?
The fundamental thing underlying almost all of the recent progress we’ve seen in AI is how critical the importance of scale has proven to be. It turns out that models trained on more data with more compute power just have a much richer and more generalized set of capabilities. If we want to keep driving this progress further—and to be clear, right now we don’t see any end to the benefits of increased scale—we need to optimize and scale up our compute power as much as we possibly can.
We announced our first Azure AI supercomputer two years ago, and at our Build developer conference this year I shared that we now have multiple supercomputing systems that we’re pretty sure are the largest and most powerful AI supercomputers in the world today. We and OpenAI use this infrastructure to train nearly all of our state-of-the-art large models, whether that’s our Turing, Z-code and Florence models at Microsoft or the GPT, DALL∙E and Codex models at OpenAI. And we just recently announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to build a supercomputer powered by Azure infrastructure combined with NVIDIA GPUs.

Some of this progress has just been via brute force compute scale with bigger and bigger clusters of GPUs. But maybe even a bigger breakthrough is the layer of software that optimizes how models and data are distributed across these giant systems, both to train the models and then to serve them to customers. If we’re going to put forth these large models as platforms that people can create with, they can’t only be accessible to the tiny number of tech companies in the world with enough resources to build giant supercomputers.
So, we’ve invested a ton in software like DeepSpeed to boost training efficiency, and the ONNX Runtime for inference. They optimize for cost and latency and generally help us make bigger AI models more accessible and valuable for people. I’m super proud of the teams we have working on these technologies because Microsoft is really leading the industry here, and we’re open sourcing all of it so others can keep improving.
These advances are all playing out amid an ongoing concern that AI is going to impact jobs. How do you think about the issue of AI and jobs?
We live in a time of extraordinary complexity and historic macroeconomic change, and as we look out 5, 10 years into the future, even to just achieve a net neutral balance for the whole world, we’re going to need new forms of productivity for all of us to be able to continue enjoying progress. We want to be building these AI tools as platforms that lots of people can use to build businesses and solve problems. We believe that these platforms democratize access to AI to far more people. With them, you’ll get a richer set of problems solved and you’ll have a more diverse group of people being able to participate in the creation of technology.
With the previous instantiation of AI, you needed a huge amount of expertise just to get started. Now you can call Azure Cognitive Services, you can call the Azure OpenAI Service and build complicated products on top of these things without necessarily having to be so expert at AI that you’ve got to be able to train your own large model from scratch.
 







For some workers, it’s literally enhancing that core flow that you get into when you’re doing the work; it speeds you up. It’s like having a better set of running shoes to go run a race or marathon.





As all these huge AI systems continue to grow and evolve, I think we can expect that these advances are going to fundamentally change the nature of work, in some places more than others, and in some cases create a whole spate of new jobs that didn’t exist before. You can look back and see the same thing happen adjacent to all kinds of famous paradigm shifts in technology over history: the telephone, the automobile, the internet. And I think that just like those examples, we’re going to need new ways to think about work, new ways to think about skills and to be super focused on making sure that we’ve got enough talented folks around and trained for the really critical jobs.
Another concern associated with AI technologies is the potential for misuse and abuse. What are the concrete steps that Microsoft is taking to ensure its AI tools and services are developed and used responsibly?
This is a thing that we take super seriously. We have a responsible AI process that our AI systems go through, and we continue to improve that process. We scrutinize what we’re doing with a multidisciplinary team of experts to try to make sure that we understand all the potential harmful things that could happen, and we mitigate as many of them as possible. Examples of that are things like refining the dataset used to train models, deploying filters to limit the generation of harmful content, integrating techniques like query blocking on sensitive topics that helps to prevent misuse by bad actors or applying technology that can return more helpful and diverse responses and results. And we have a plan in place with the AI system where we can detect and mitigate as quickly as possible post-launch any harms that happen that we didn’t anticipate.
Another very important safeguard is intentional and iterative deployment. Most of the work that we do is on models that have broad capability. We host them in our cloud, and we make them accessible by API or through our products. For the API, any developer can get access to it, but they have to comply with the terms of service in order to use it, and if they violate the terms of service, their access can be taken away. And for other products, we may start with a limited preview with a select number of customers with well-defined use cases in mind. Collaborations with these early customers will help us make sure the responsible AI safeguards are working in practice so we can scale adoption more broadly.
We truly believe safety and responsibility is important. Hopefully, we can offer some encouragement to the whole industry. To that end, all the resources and expertise that we’ve applied against developing some solutions are being shared with the rest of the broader community through our Responsible AI Standard and Principles.

Trucking is often thought to be one of the first industries at substantial risk. The work is difficult, unsafe, and often deadly and high rates of driver turnover are a constant problem in the industry. As a result, autonomous trucks have become a site of tremendous technical innovation and investment—and some forecasters project that truck driving will be one of the first major industries to be targeted by AI-driven automation.Courtesy of Princeton University Press Buy This Book At:AmazonBookshop.orgTargetIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.Technology-driven unemployment is a real threat, but robotic trucks are very unlikely to decimate the trucking profession in one sudden phase transition. The path to fully autonomous trucking is likely to be a gradual slope, not a steep cliff—a trajectory shaped not only by technical roadblocks, but by social, legal, and cultural factors. Truck drivers’ daily work consists of many complex tasks other than driving trucks—maintenance, inspections, talking to customers, safeguarding valuable goods—many of which are far more difficult to automate than highway driving. A host of new legal regimes across states will be required to ensure that the technology can be deployed safely. And widespread apprehension around autonomous vehicles (and autonomous trucks especially) will likely delay adoption. All of these factors will slow the degree at which autonomous trucks take to American highways.Instead of thinking about a sudden wave of trucker unemployment, then, we should think about how AI will change what truckers’ work looks like over the long haul. There will still be human truckers for a long time to come—but this doesn’t mean that what it means to be a human trucker won’t change substantially. Rather than whole-cloth replacement of human truckers, autonomous technologies might require integration between human and machines over a long period of time, as truckers are required to coordinate their work—and themselves—with the technology.Featured VideoMedical Doctor Answers Hormone Questions From TwitterThere are several possible forms this integration might take.Passing the BatonOne vision of the future imagines machines and humans as coworkers. In this model, people and machines “pass the baton” back and forth to one another, like runners in a relay: The worker completes the tasks to which she is best suited, and the machine does the same. For example, a robot might take responsibility for mundane or routine tasks, while the human handles things in exceptional circumstances, or steps in to take over when the robot’s capacities are exceeded.Human/robot teams hold some promise both because they try to seize on the relative advantages of each—and because the model presumes that humans get to keep their jobs. In fact, some believe that human jobs might become more interesting and fulfilling under such a model, if robots can take on more of the “grunt work” that humans currently are tasked with completing.The human/robot team is not an especially farfetched idea for trucking work. In fact, most of us encounter a version of this model every time we sit behind a steering wheel. Modern cars commonly offer some form of technological assistance to human drivers (sometimes called “advanced driver-assistance systems”). Adaptive cruise control is an example: When a human driver activates it, the car automatically adjusts its own speed to maintain a given driving distance from the cars in front of it.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenWhile adaptive cruise control might seem very different from a fully autonomous vehicle—and it is, technologically—the two technologies reside on the same spectrum. And in even the most advanced semiautomated technologies on the road today, humans are still required to be prepared to take control of the vehicle; that is, even if the machine has the baton most of the time, the human has to be prepared to grab it immediately when the machine doesn’t know what to do.AdvertisementWhat would the handoff model mean for truckers? In theory, the truck would handle the bulk of the driving in good conditions, and the human trucker would take over in situations where the machine has trouble—say, in a construction zone or crowded intersection, or when visibility is poor. When the machine is in charge, the theory goes, the trucker might be “unshackled from the wheel” and freed up for other tasks.This vision is similar to the transformation of the bank teller’s role after the advent of the ATM: The machine does the boring routine work, freeing up the human for more interesting or skill-matched pursuits. But it leaves open big questions about whether or how truckers would be paid for time in the cab while the truck drives itself—after all, if trucking companies are still paying big labor costs, are autonomous trucks worth the investment?—and also wouldn’t necessarily address problems around overwork and fatigue.There’s another problem that’s even more fundamental. Baton-passing is incredibly—perhaps intractably—difficult to execute smoothly in situations like driving. Recall that the machine passes off responsibility to the human in the situations it finds most difficult: when conditions are unusual, when there is something in the environment it isn’t equipped to contend with, when there’s a mechanical malfunction or emergency. Those situations are very likely to be safety critical. One review of the scholarly literature found “a wealth of evidence” that automating some aspects of driving led to “an elevated rate of (near-) collisions in critical events as compared to manual driving … Essentially, if the automation fails unexpectedly with very little time for the human to respond, then almost all drivers crash.”This problem is so severe because the time scale in which the baton is passed is miniscule: Because of the nature of driving, a human is likely to have an extremely short window—perhaps only a fraction of a second—in which to understand the machine’s request to intervene, assess the environmental situation, and take control of the vehicle. This tiny time window is the reason why human drivers in semiautonomous cars are warned that they must stay alert the entire time the car is driving. Despite the image of humans relaxing, napping, texting, eating, and being otherwise freed up from the requirements of driving, this image is patently unrealistic given the need for quick, safety-critical handoffs at current levels of automation.Audio and visual alarms can help humans know when a handoff is coming, but the immediacy of the need to take control means that humans must still pay constant attention. However, a 2015 NHTSA study found that in some circumstances it could take humans a full 17 seconds to regain control after a vehicle alerted them to do so—long beyond what would be required to avoid an accident.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenNot only is it hard for humans to intervene when intervention is called for, it’s cognitively unrealistic to expect humans to remain alert to the environment in case of emergencies—particularly as those emergencies become rarer, and as people’s driving skills atrophy. This is what human factors researcher Peter Hancock calls the “hours of boredom and moments of terror” problem. Humans are notoriously bad at staying attentive to monotonous situations in which there is only rarely something extremely important for them to notice and act upon. As Hancock frames it: “If you build vehicles where drivers are rarely required to respond, then they will rarely respond when required.”This irony creates severe problems for human/robot handoffs in autonomous cars and trucks. So long as humans have some duty to monitor the driving environment—which they do at the current state of the art—humans will almost inevitably do a poor job at accepting the baton from the machine. Does this mean there’s no hope for safe autonomous vehicles? Not necessarily. If robots and humans make bad coworkers because of the weaknesses of the human, one solution might be to increase the level of automation even more, obviating the need for short-term handoffs to a human at all. This could create a second model of integration: network coordination.Divide and ConquerAnother way to think about the division of labor between humans and machines is as a matter of more systemic work-sharing. Rather than a focus on in-the-moment driving, we might think about humans and machines as sharing truck-driving work in a broader way: by dividing up responsibilities over the driving route. We’ve been thinking about the work of truck driving as a set of small, often simultaneous driving tasks: change lanes, hit the brakes, watch for road obstacles. We could instead think about it as a series of predictable segments: travel down the interstate, exit the highway and take local roads, steer around the receiver’s docks. In this model, humans and robots still share the labor of trucking work, but take turns being wholly responsible for driving—much as you and a friend might take turns driving on a road trip—with temporally and geographically predictable points of transition between the two of them. Some truckers already do this when they “drive team,” taking turns driving (often while one driver sleeps). If we think of human/robot teams working together in tandem over these segments, a second model of integration emerges: network coordination. Several trucking technology firms have set their sights on this sort of model.But wait, you might think. The reason for autonomous cars to hand off control to humans is that they aren’t fully capable of driving themselves—they can’t negotiate unexpected obstacles well, they lack humans’ tacit knowledge, they can fail catastrophically in new and complex situations. If this happens, how can we envision giving a machine total control over an entire portion of the route, without a human driver being expected to step in?Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenPart of the answer is that the difficulties autonomous vehicles encounter are “lumpy”—they’re much more likely to occur in some route segments than others. Though they’re far from perfect in any setting, autonomous vehicles perform much better on highways than on city streets: speeds are more constant, there are fewer intersections and unexpected obstacles, and contexts are generally more predictable and easier for a machine to negotiate. Things get much more complicated at the endpoints, when trucks leave the highways and venture into cities and towns to pick up or drop off loads. And when a truck arrives at a terminal, it doesn’t just drop its load immediately and take off. A trucker might spend hours at a terminal making “yard moves”—queuing to be loaded or unloaded, backing the truck into the right bay, and following the directions of the customer. Some truckers load and unload freight themselves; others coordinate with the customer’s unloading crew (or with “lumpers,” third parties who unload the delivery on behalf of the customer).All of this requires irregular driving in response to immediate human direction, sometimes in large lots without lanes or traffic markings—and is nearly impossible for a machine to do on its own. (As a point of comparison, think of how planes taxi around at airports—despite the widespread use of autopilot in the air, there’s little chance that airport taxiing will be automated anytime soon.) So, a natural division of labor in trucking might be that advanced autonomous trucks drive themselves over the long haul, and humans take the wheel for the endpoints—what’s often called the “last mile” in transportation and logistics. In 2017, Uber announced such an approach: an autonomous truck network, connected by local hubs throughout the country. Autonomous trucks would run the long hauls between the hubs, and human truckers would pilot the trucks from hubs to delivery.It isn’t a feasible model—yet. But some autonomous vehicle technology companies think the human/machine coordination challenges at current levels of semiautonomy are so difficult and intractable that they are essentially attempting to “skip” those levels, focusing their attention on developing vehicles that can drive with no human involvement under particular conditions (such as highway driving within a prespecified area or under only certain weather conditions). In trucking, if full autonomy could enable the truck to drive without the driver’s constant attention (and for longer time periods—since robots don’t get tired), the prospect seems more economically viable than a model that requires a driver to be engaged as a backup (and, presumably, paid).However, the only way the network coordination model is a viable option is if the pay structure of trucking adjusts with it. Truckers are paid by the mile, and the great majority of miles driven (and thus money earned) takes place on the highway—not on traffic-packed local roads or while maneuvering around at a terminal. The parts of the job that network coordination models might automate are precisely the parts that make up the lion’s share of a trucker’s wages. Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenTruckers have argued for pay reform in the industry for decades, but have lacked the political capital to make change. Uber’s proposal seemed like it might be an unholy alliance that could actually help improve truckers’ lots: by working in its own interests, it might have had the power to reshape the industry’s pay structure and create a viable way forward for humans and machines to work together. But the company abruptly shuttered its autonomous truck division in July 2018, only months after announcing its hub-and-spoke model. Uber’s shift away from autonomous trucks suggests there is little hope of achieving the network coordination model anytime soon; the project would involve substantial regulatory change and infrastructure costs, and it’s hard to imagine other companies that could pull it off in the near term.A variation on network coordination could involve allowing truck drivers to take the wheel remotely for the “last mile” of operation. Starsky Robotics, founded with significant venture capital investment in 2016, developed a “teleoperation” system in which trucks drove themselves to a certain point, and human drivers subbed in remotely from the highway exit to the terminal—as if they were playing a video game or operating a drone. In theory, such a system could allow a single driver to pilot dozens of vehicles a day, for short periods of time, all over the country—and still return home each night. (As one remote trucking executive framed it: “Think about the mom who is home driving a truck. She can drive multiple assets and never leave her kids.”) Some refer to this as a “call-center” model in which the robot calls into a human phone bank for support or handoff at predetermined points in the route.But it isn’t obvious that a model like this is sustainable, either. For one, the handoff problems seem likely to be only exacerbated by distance. And there are other problems unique to the model: Ford shut down its system testing a similar idea after the vehicles repeatedly lost their cell signal so that human operators couldn’t see the video feed. Starsky Robotics closed its doors in 2020; in a valedictory blog post, its chief executive chalked up the company’s closure in large part to the assessment that “supervised machine learning doesn’t live up to the hype” in terms of operational capability in autonomous trucking.The Rise of the RoboTruckerThe future of trucking might someday look like these baton-passing or network-coordination models of shared labor. But right now, human/machine interaction in trucking looks very different. What we see happening in trucking now involves a much less discrete parceling-out of functions between humans and machines. Instead, truckers’ physical bodies and intelligent systems are being integrated into one another.There are two kinds of technologies that turn truckers into RoboTruckers. The first are wearables, which monitor elements of the trucker’s internal bodily state and use them as metrics for management. For example:Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThe SmartCap is a baseball cap (also available as a headband) that detects fatigue by monitoring a driver’s brainwaves (essentially doing a constant EEG). Rear View Safety and Ford’s Safe Cap are similar systems. Systems like these can be configured to send an alert to a fleet manager or a family member, to flash lights in drivers’ eyes, to sound alarms, or to jolt the wearer back to alertness with vibrations.Optalert, an Australian company, manufactures a pair of glasses that monitors the speed and duration of a trucker’s blinks in order to give him a real-time fatigue score.Maven Machines’ Co-Pilot Headset detects head movement that suggests the driver is distracted (for example, looking down at a phone) or tired (for example, failing to check his side-view mirrors regularly).Wrist-worn Actigraph systems both monitor and predict fatigue rates over time. The technology, initially developed by an Army research lab, blends biometric data about a trucker’s alertness with other data (like start time) to forecast how long he can drive before becoming too tired.A number of other wearable devices are under development. For example, Steer, another wrist-based wearable being developed by a Latvian firm, measures heart rate and skin conductivity. It vibrates and flashes lights if it begins to detect signs of fatigue and delivers a “gentle electric shock” to the driver if fatigue continues. Mercedes has prototyped a vest to monitor a trucker’s heart rate; the system can stop the truck if it senses the trucker is having a heart attack.The second set of technologies are cameras pointed at the driver designed to detect his level of fatigue, often by monitoring his eyelids to track his gaze and look for signs of “microsleep.” Seeing Machines is one of several companies that market driver-facing cameras that use computer vision to monitor a driver’s eyelids and head position for signs of fatigue or inattention.If the driver’s eyes close or look away from the road for too long, it sounds an alarm and sends a video to his boss—and can also cause the driver’s seat to vibrate in order to “goose” him back into attention. Another driver-facing camera vendor, Netradyne, uses deep learning and data from driver- and road-facing cameras to generate scores for drivers based on their safe and unsafe driving behaviors.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenSome industry insiders believe that it’s only a matter of time before trucker wearables and driver-facing camera systems become standard—or even legally required. There are also early indications that such systems might be of interest for insurance purposes; one carrier’s safety director said he expects a mandate for use of fatigue monitoring “not from the feds, but from the underwriters.”From the truckers’ point of view, there’s something viscerally offensive about the micromanagement enabled by these technologies. This is the felt reality of AI in trucking labor now: using AI to address human “weakness” through constant, intimate, visceral monitoring. There’s an enormous distance between the narrative of displacement that characterizes most public discussion of AI’s effects on truckers and how these effects are actually being experienced through these technologies. The threat of displacement is a real one, particularly to truckers’ economic livelihood—but driverless trucks are not yet borne out by common experience, and drivers are also not yet handing off a baton to or splitting routes with a robot coworker. Truckers’ encounters with automation and artificial intelligence have not yet supplanted them.Instead, technologies like the ones we’ve discussed above represent a distinct and simultaneous threat: a threat of compelled hybridization, an intimate invasion into their work and bodies. AI in trucking today doesn’t kick you out of the cab; it texts your boss and your wife, flashes lights in your eyes, and gooses your backside. Though truckers are, so far, still in the cab, intelligent systems are beginning to occupy these spaces as well—in the process, turning worker and machine into an uneasy, confrontational whole.Data Driven: Truckers, Technology, and the New Workplace Surveillance by Karen Levy.

Technology-driven unemployment is a real threat, but robotic trucks are very unlikely to decimate the trucking profession in one sudden phase transition. The path to fully autonomous trucking is likely to be a gradual slope, not a steep cliff—a trajectory shaped not only by technical roadblocks, but by social, legal, and cultural factors. Truck drivers’ daily work consists of many complex tasks other than driving trucks—maintenance, inspections, talking to customers, safeguarding valuable goods—many of which are far more difficult to automate than highway driving. A host of new legal regimes across states will be required to ensure that the technology can be deployed safely. And widespread apprehension around autonomous vehicles (and autonomous trucks especially) will likely delay adoption. All of these factors will slow the degree at which autonomous trucks take to American highways.
Instead of thinking about a sudden wave of trucker unemployment, then, we should think about how AI will change what truckers’ work looks like over the long haul. There will still be human truckers for a long time to come—but this doesn’t mean that what it means to be a human trucker won’t change substantially. Rather than whole-cloth replacement of human truckers, autonomous technologies might require integration between human and machines over a long period of time, as truckers are required to coordinate their work—and themselves—with the technology.
There are several possible forms this integration might take.
Passing the Baton
One vision of the future imagines machines and humans as coworkers. In this model, people and machines “pass the baton” back and forth to one another, like runners in a relay: The worker completes the tasks to which she is best suited, and the machine does the same. For example, a robot might take responsibility for mundane or routine tasks, while the human handles things in exceptional circumstances, or steps in to take over when the robot’s capacities are exceeded.
Human/robot teams hold some promise both because they try to seize on the relative advantages of each—and because the model presumes that humans get to keep their jobs. In fact, some believe that human jobs might become more interesting and fulfilling under such a model, if robots can take on more of the “grunt work” that humans currently are tasked with completing.
The human/robot team is not an especially farfetched idea for trucking work. In fact, most of us encounter a version of this model every time we sit behind a steering wheel. Modern cars commonly offer some form of technological assistance to human drivers (sometimes called “advanced driver-assistance systems”). Adaptive cruise control is an example: When a human driver activates it, the car automatically adjusts its own speed to maintain a given driving distance from the cars in front of it.
While adaptive cruise control might seem very different from a fully autonomous vehicle—and it is, technologically—the two technologies reside on the same spectrum. And in even the most advanced semiautomated technologies on the road today, humans are still required to be prepared to take control of the vehicle; that is, even if the machine has the baton most of the time, the human has to be prepared to grab it immediately when the machine doesn’t know what to do.
What would the handoff model mean for truckers? In theory, the truck would handle the bulk of the driving in good conditions, and the human trucker would take over in situations where the machine has trouble—say, in a construction zone or crowded intersection, or when visibility is poor. When the machine is in charge, the theory goes, the trucker might be “unshackled from the wheel” and freed up for other tasks.
This vision is similar to the transformation of the bank teller’s role after the advent of the ATM: The machine does the boring routine work, freeing up the human for more interesting or skill-matched pursuits. But it leaves open big questions about whether or how truckers would be paid for time in the cab while the truck drives itself—after all, if trucking companies are still paying big labor costs, are autonomous trucks worth the investment?—and also wouldn’t necessarily address problems around overwork and fatigue.
There’s another problem that’s even more fundamental. Baton-passing is incredibly—perhaps intractably—difficult to execute smoothly in situations like driving. Recall that the machine passes off responsibility to the human in the situations it finds most difficult: when conditions are unusual, when there is something in the environment it isn’t equipped to contend with, when there’s a mechanical malfunction or emergency. Those situations are very likely to be safety critical. One review of the scholarly literature found “a wealth of evidence” that automating some aspects of driving led to “an elevated rate of (near-) collisions in critical events as compared to manual driving … Essentially, if the automation fails unexpectedly with very little time for the human to respond, then almost all drivers crash.”
This problem is so severe because the time scale in which the baton is passed is miniscule: Because of the nature of driving, a human is likely to have an extremely short window—perhaps only a fraction of a second—in which to understand the machine’s request to intervene, assess the environmental situation, and take control of the vehicle. This tiny time window is the reason why human drivers in semiautonomous cars are warned that they must stay alert the entire time the car is driving. Despite the image of humans relaxing, napping, texting, eating, and being otherwise freed up from the requirements of driving, this image is patently unrealistic given the need for quick, safety-critical handoffs at current levels of automation.
Audio and visual alarms can help humans know when a handoff is coming, but the immediacy of the need to take control means that humans must still pay constant attention. However, a 2015 NHTSA study found that in some circumstances it could take humans a full 17 seconds to regain control after a vehicle alerted them to do so—long beyond what would be required to avoid an accident.
Not only is it hard for humans to intervene when intervention is called for, it’s cognitively unrealistic to expect humans to remain alert to the environment in case of emergencies—particularly as those emergencies become rarer, and as people’s driving skills atrophy. This is what human factors researcher Peter Hancock calls the “hours of boredom and moments of terror” problem. Humans are notoriously bad at staying attentive to monotonous situations in which there is only rarely something extremely important for them to notice and act upon. As Hancock frames it: “If you build vehicles where drivers are rarely required to respond, then they will rarely respond when required.”
This irony creates severe problems for human/robot handoffs in autonomous cars and trucks. So long as humans have some duty to monitor the driving environment—which they do at the current state of the art—humans will almost inevitably do a poor job at accepting the baton from the machine. Does this mean there’s no hope for safe autonomous vehicles? Not necessarily. If robots and humans make bad coworkers because of the weaknesses of the human, one solution might be to increase the level of automation even more, obviating the need for short-term handoffs to a human at all. This could create a second model of integration: network coordination.
Divide and Conquer
Another way to think about the division of labor between humans and machines is as a matter of more systemic work-sharing. Rather than a focus on in-the-moment driving, we might think about humans and machines as sharing truck-driving work in a broader way: by dividing up responsibilities over the driving route.
We’ve been thinking about the work of truck driving as a set of small, often simultaneous driving tasks: change lanes, hit the brakes, watch for road obstacles. We could instead think about it as a series of predictable segments: travel down the interstate, exit the highway and take local roads, steer around the receiver’s docks. In this model, humans and robots still share the labor of trucking work, but take turns being wholly responsible for driving—much as you and a friend might take turns driving on a road trip—with temporally and geographically predictable points of transition between the two of them. Some truckers already do this when they “drive team,” taking turns driving (often while one driver sleeps). If we think of human/robot teams working together in tandem over these segments, a second model of integration emerges: network coordination. Several trucking technology firms have set their sights on this sort of model.
But wait, you might think. The reason for autonomous cars to hand off control to humans is that they aren’t fully capable of driving themselves—they can’t negotiate unexpected obstacles well, they lack humans’ tacit knowledge, they can fail catastrophically in new and complex situations. If this happens, how can we envision giving a machine total control over an entire portion of the route, without a human driver being expected to step in?
Part of the answer is that the difficulties autonomous vehicles encounter are “lumpy”—they’re much more likely to occur in some route segments than others. Though they’re far from perfect in any setting, autonomous vehicles perform much better on highways than on city streets: speeds are more constant, there are fewer intersections and unexpected obstacles, and contexts are generally more predictable and easier for a machine to negotiate. Things get much more complicated at the endpoints, when trucks leave the highways and venture into cities and towns to pick up or drop off loads. And when a truck arrives at a terminal, it doesn’t just drop its load immediately and take off. A trucker might spend hours at a terminal making “yard moves”—queuing to be loaded or unloaded, backing the truck into the right bay, and following the directions of the customer. Some truckers load and unload freight themselves; others coordinate with the customer’s unloading crew (or with “lumpers,” third parties who unload the delivery on behalf of the customer).
All of this requires irregular driving in response to immediate human direction, sometimes in large lots without lanes or traffic markings—and is nearly impossible for a machine to do on its own. (As a point of comparison, think of how planes taxi around at airports—despite the widespread use of autopilot in the air, there’s little chance that airport taxiing will be automated anytime soon.) So, a natural division of labor in trucking might be that advanced autonomous trucks drive themselves over the long haul, and humans take the wheel for the endpoints—what’s often called the “last mile” in transportation and logistics. In 2017, Uber announced such an approach: an autonomous truck network, connected by local hubs throughout the country. Autonomous trucks would run the long hauls between the hubs, and human truckers would pilot the trucks from hubs to delivery.
It isn’t a feasible model—yet. But some autonomous vehicle technology companies think the human/machine coordination challenges at current levels of semiautonomy are so difficult and intractable that they are essentially attempting to “skip” those levels, focusing their attention on developing vehicles that can drive with no human involvement under particular conditions (such as highway driving within a prespecified area or under only certain weather conditions). In trucking, if full autonomy could enable the truck to drive without the driver’s constant attention (and for longer time periods—since robots don’t get tired), the prospect seems more economically viable than a model that requires a driver to be engaged as a backup (and, presumably, paid).
However, the only way the network coordination model is a viable option is if the pay structure of trucking adjusts with it. Truckers are paid by the mile, and the great majority of miles driven (and thus money earned) takes place on the highway—not on traffic-packed local roads or while maneuvering around at a terminal. The parts of the job that network coordination models might automate are precisely the parts that make up the lion’s share of a trucker’s wages.
Truckers have argued for pay reform in the industry for decades, but have lacked the political capital to make change. Uber’s proposal seemed like it might be an unholy alliance that could actually help improve truckers’ lots: by working in its own interests, it might have had the power to reshape the industry’s pay structure and create a viable way forward for humans and machines to work together. But the company abruptly shuttered its autonomous truck division in July 2018, only months after announcing its hub-and-spoke model. Uber’s shift away from autonomous trucks suggests there is little hope of achieving the network coordination model anytime soon; the project would involve substantial regulatory change and infrastructure costs, and it’s hard to imagine other companies that could pull it off in the near term.
A variation on network coordination could involve allowing truck drivers to take the wheel remotely for the “last mile” of operation. Starsky Robotics, founded with significant venture capital investment in 2016, developed a “teleoperation” system in which trucks drove themselves to a certain point, and human drivers subbed in remotely from the highway exit to the terminal—as if they were playing a video game or operating a drone. In theory, such a system could allow a single driver to pilot dozens of vehicles a day, for short periods of time, all over the country—and still return home each night. (As one remote trucking executive framed it: “Think about the mom who is home driving a truck. She can drive multiple assets and never leave her kids.”) Some refer to this as a “call-center” model in which the robot calls into a human phone bank for support or handoff at predetermined points in the route.
But it isn’t obvious that a model like this is sustainable, either. For one, the handoff problems seem likely to be only exacerbated by distance. And there are other problems unique to the model: Ford shut down its system testing a similar idea after the vehicles repeatedly lost their cell signal so that human operators couldn’t see the video feed. Starsky Robotics closed its doors in 2020; in a valedictory blog post, its chief executive chalked up the company’s closure in large part to the assessment that “supervised machine learning doesn’t live up to the hype” in terms of operational capability in autonomous trucking.
The Rise of the RoboTrucker
The future of trucking might someday look like these baton-passing or network-coordination models of shared labor. But right now, human/machine interaction in trucking looks very different. What we see happening in trucking now involves a much less discrete parceling-out of functions between humans and machines. Instead, truckers’ physical bodies and intelligent systems are being integrated into one another.
There are two kinds of technologies that turn truckers into RoboTruckers. The first are wearables, which monitor elements of the trucker’s internal bodily state and use them as metrics for management. For example:

The SmartCap is a baseball cap (also available as a headband) that detects fatigue by monitoring a driver’s brainwaves (essentially doing a constant EEG). Rear View Safety and Ford’s Safe Cap are similar systems. Systems like these can be configured to send an alert to a fleet manager or a family member, to flash lights in drivers’ eyes, to sound alarms, or to jolt the wearer back to alertness with vibrations.
Optalert, an Australian company, manufactures a pair of glasses that monitors the speed and duration of a trucker’s blinks in order to give him a real-time fatigue score.
Maven Machines’ Co-Pilot Headset detects head movement that suggests the driver is distracted (for example, looking down at a phone) or tired (for example, failing to check his side-view mirrors regularly).
Wrist-worn Actigraph systems both monitor and predict fatigue rates over time. The technology, initially developed by an Army research lab, blends biometric data about a trucker’s alertness with other data (like start time) to forecast how long he can drive before becoming too tired.

A number of other wearable devices are under development. For example, Steer, another wrist-based wearable being developed by a Latvian firm, measures heart rate and skin conductivity. It vibrates and flashes lights if it begins to detect signs of fatigue and delivers a “gentle electric shock” to the driver if fatigue continues. Mercedes has prototyped a vest to monitor a trucker’s heart rate; the system can stop the truck if it senses the trucker is having a heart attack.
The second set of technologies are cameras pointed at the driver designed to detect his level of fatigue, often by monitoring his eyelids to track his gaze and look for signs of “microsleep.” Seeing Machines is one of several companies that market driver-facing cameras that use computer vision to monitor a driver’s eyelids and head position for signs of fatigue or inattention.
If the driver’s eyes close or look away from the road for too long, it sounds an alarm and sends a video to his boss—and can also cause the driver’s seat to vibrate in order to “goose” him back into attention. Another driver-facing camera vendor, Netradyne, uses deep learning and data from driver- and road-facing cameras to generate scores for drivers based on their safe and unsafe driving behaviors.
Some industry insiders believe that it’s only a matter of time before trucker wearables and driver-facing camera systems become standard—or even legally required. There are also early indications that such systems might be of interest for insurance purposes; one carrier’s safety director said he expects a mandate for use of fatigue monitoring “not from the feds, but from the underwriters.”
From the truckers’ point of view, there’s something viscerally offensive about the micromanagement enabled by these technologies. This is the felt reality of AI in trucking labor now: using AI to address human “weakness” through constant, intimate, visceral monitoring. There’s an enormous distance between the narrative of displacement that characterizes most public discussion of AI’s effects on truckers and how these effects are actually being experienced through these technologies.

Instead, technologies like the ones we’ve discussed above represent a distinct and simultaneous threat: a threat of compelled hybridization, an intimate invasion into their work and bodies. AI in trucking today doesn’t kick you out of the cab; it texts your boss and your wife, flashes lights in your eyes, and gooses your backside. Though truckers are, so far, still in the cab, intelligent systems are beginning to occupy these spaces as well—in the process, turning worker and machine into an uneasy, confrontational whole.

If you've been frequenting Twitter this week, you'll have noticed that much of the chat has revolved around two subjects: Elon Musk's continued attempts to run the company into the ground/transform it into a free speech utopia (delete where appropriate), and the launch of ChatGPT, a new artificial intelligence platform that's been blowing minds all over the internet. ChatGPT comes from Open AI, the same people who behind the DALL-E app, which people have recently been using to turn lyric-based, AI-generated images into bespoke rock videos for their favourite bands. The new software uses deep learning to respond to prompts from the user in a human-like way. Basically, ask a question and it'll give you an answer. Naturally, we wanted to try this, to learn if this technical miracle might one day put us out of work. We asked ChatGPT to review Metallica's Master Of Puppets album, and it did well. Then we asked it to write a different review of the same album. And it did well. And then we gave the software a number of tasks of increased silliness. And it did well. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksSurgeon Reveals: Don't Laser Your Dark Spots! (Use This Household Item Instead)Miami M.D.UndoChatGPI only came unstuck when we asked it to write some erotic fiction starring Robert Fripp, Toyah Willcox and Eddie The Head, informing us that the (somewhat steamy) results violated the company's content policy.  LATEST VIDEOS FROM loudersoundThe results of our extremely scientific experiments are below. Our questions are in bold, with ChatGPT's responses following. Review Metallica's album Master Of Puppets favourably, emphasising the bass playing of Cliff BurtonMaster of Puppets is widely considered to be one of Metallica's greatest albums, and for good reason. The album is a masterpiece of thrash metal, featuring complex guitar work, pounding drums, and ferocious vocals. But one aspect of the album that often goes overlooked is the incredible bass playing of Cliff Burton.Classic Rock NewsletterSign up below to get the latest from Classic Rock, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Burton's bass playing on Master of Puppets is nothing short of extraordinary. He masterfully uses the bass to anchor the songs and drive the rhythm, while also adding his own creative flourishes and solos. His playing is both technically impressive and emotionally powerful, and it's a key element of the album's overall sound.One of the standout moments of Burton's bass playing on the album is during the song Orion, where he takes centre stage with a breathtakingly virtuosic solo. His playing on this track, and on the album as a whole, showcases his incredible talent and solidifies his place as one of the greatest bassists in metal history.Overall, Master Of Puppets is a must-listen for any fan of metal, and the bass playing of Cliff Burton is a crucial part of what makes the album so great.What if we asked ChatGPT to look at the album differently. Would that work?Review Metallica's album Master Of Puppets unfavourably, emphasising the drumming of Lars UlrichWhile Master of Puppets is considered a classic album by many fans of Metallica, it's not without its flaws. One aspect of the album that is often criticised is the drumming of Lars Ulrich.Ulrich's playing on the album is often described as simplistic and uninspired, lacking the complexity and skill of other drummers in the thrash metal genre. His performances on songs like Battery and Leper Messiah are particularly underwhelming, with repetitive, basic patterns that fail to elevate the music.Additionally, Ulrich's decision to use a lot of triggered, artificial-sounding drum sounds on the album has aged poorly and detracts from the overall listening experience. This is particularly noticeable on tracks like Master of Puppets and Damage, Inc. where the drums lack warmth and punch.In short, while Master Of Puppets is an important album in the history of Metallica and the thrash metal genre, the drumming of Lars Ulrich is a weakness that holds it back from being a truly great record.What if we took a famous moment from rock history? Would ChatGPT report it accurately?What's the background behind David Bowie's legendary Top Of The Pops performance of Starman?David Bowie's legendary Top of the Pops performance of Starman is one of the most iconic moments in the history of the British music show. The performance took place on July 6, 1972, and it was the first time that Bowie appeared on the show as his alter ego, Ziggy Stardust.At the time, Bowie was still relatively unknown to the mainstream British public, and his appearance on Top Of The Pops was seen as a major breakthrough. He was accompanied by his backing band, The Spiders from Mars, and they performed a mesmerising version of Starman that captivated the audience and helped to propel Bowie to stardom.The performance was notable for a number of reasons. Firstly, Bowie's flamboyant stage presence and androgynous appearance were unlike anything that had been seen on British television before. His bright red hair and space-themed costume were a stark contrast to the more conservative outfits worn by other musicians on the show.Secondly, the performance was a turning point for the glam rock movement, which was starting to gain popularity in Britain at the time. Bowie's performance was seen as the beginning of the glam rock era, and it helped to inspire other musicians to embrace a more flamboyant and androgynous style.In short, David Bowie's Top Of The Pops performance of Starman was a game-changing moment in the history of British music. It introduced a new, bold, and unapologetically glamorous style of music to the mainstream, and it helped to launch Bowie's career as a legendary artist.Next we asked if ChatGPT could successfully report on a much more recent event: this summer's Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert. It got a bit mixed up here – briefly bringing the much-missed Hawkins back to life to pay tribute to himself – and reporting more than one highlight that never took place, including an amazing climax involving John Bonham.Write a 800-word review of the Taylor Hawkins tribute show at Wembley StadiumThe Taylor Hawkins tribute show at Wembley Stadium was a truly unforgettable event. The concert, which took place on June 20, 2022, featured a host of world-renowned musicians coming together to pay tribute to the iconic Foo Fighters drummer, who passed away earlier this year.The show was kicked off by a performance from Hawkins' former bandmates in the Foo Fighters, who took to the stage to rapturous applause. The band played a set of their biggest hits, including Everlong, Best Of You, and Monkey Wrench, with drummer Taylor Hawkins delivering a truly incredible performance in honour of his late friend.Next up was a set from Hawkins' other band, the Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders. The band played a selection of their own songs, including Crossed the Line and Middle Child, and their energetic performance had the crowd on their feet and singing along.After the Coattail Riders' set, the stage was taken over by a number of special guest performers. First up was Dave Grohl, who performed a solo acoustic rendition of the Foo Fighters' hit My Hero, dedicating the song to his late friend and bandmate. Grohl's heartfelt performance was met with tears and cheers from the audience.The show continued with performances from a number of other musicians who were close to Hawkins, including Josh Homme, who performed a stripped-down version of Queens of the Stone Age's No One Knows, and Slipknot's Corey Taylor, who sang Everlong with the Foo Fighters.But the highlight of the evening was a performance from Hawkins' hero, Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. Bonham, who passed away in 1980, was brought back to life through the use of hologram technology, and he played a stunning rendition of Moby Dick alongside Hawkins' son, who took over on drums for the song. The audience was left in awe by the incredible performance, and many were left wondering if this technology could be used to bring back other deceased musicians in the future.Overall, the Taylor Hawkins tribute show at Wembley Stadium was a truly special event. The combination of incredible music and emotional performances made for a truly unforgettable evening, and it was clear that Hawkins' legacy as a musician and friend will live on for years to come.OK, ChatGPT. Answer me this.Why do some people still despise Axl Rose?There are a few reasons why Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, is disliked by some people. One reason is his reputation for being difficult to work with. Over the years, Rose has been involved in a number of public feuds with other musicians and members of the band, and his behaviour has sometimes been seen as unprofessional. Additionally, Rose has a reputation for being temperamental and unpredictable, which has made him unpopular with some fans and industry professionals.Another reason why some people dislike Axl Rose is his perceived lack of humility. Rose has been known to make grandiose statements and boast about his achievements, which has rubbed some people the wrong way. He is also known for being confrontational and combative in interviews, which has further contributed to his reputation as a difficult person.Ultimately, the reasons why people dislike Axl Rose will vary depending on the individual. Some people may dislike him because of his reputation for being difficult to work with, while others may dislike him because of his perceived arrogance. Still, others may simply not like his music or his vocal style.ChatGPT has done well so far, but what if we ask it to argue a ludicrous position?Explain why Mick Mars is a better guitarist than Jimi HendrixThe great debate over which guitarist is superior, Mick Mars or Jimi Hendrix, has raged on for years. Both men are masters of their craft, with incredible technical skill and a unique playing style. However, when it comes down to it, there is one guitarist who stands out above the rest: Mick Mars.First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that Jimi Hendrix was a revolutionary guitarist. His playing was fiery and passionate, with a unique blend of blues, rock, and psychedelia. He was also incredibly influential, inspiring countless other guitarists and helping to shape the sound of rock music in the 1960s and beyond.However, while Hendrix was a pioneer, Mars is a master craftsman. His playing is precise and polished, with a level of technical skill that is truly impressive. He is equally adept at both lead and rhythm guitar, and his solos are complex and intricate, yet never cluttered or messy.Additionally, Mars has a unique tone that sets him apart from other guitarists. His use of effects and his ability to coax a wide range of sounds from his instrument give his playing a distinctive quality that is immediately recognisable. His guitar playing is also incredibly emotive, with a depth and feeling that is unmatched.Of course, it's worth noting that comparing the two guitarists is somewhat unfair. Hendrix and Mars are from different generations and played in different musical styles. However, when it comes down to sheer guitar playing ability, Mars is the clear winner. His technical skill, tone, and emotive playing make him a truly great guitarist, and one that deserves to be recognised as such.Fair enough. We're heading to the job centre. Damn you, ChatGPT. We'll leave you with this one. Describe a fight between Kid Rock and Neil Young in the style of a boxing commentator.

Another asked ChatGPT to write scenes that would fit into the NBC sitcom “The Office,” tailored to ongoing storylines such as a prank war between the characters Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute. Many have also asked it to write computer code in programming languages such as Python. Others asked the chatbot to write college style essays.

Electronic health records (EHRs) need a new public relations manager. Ten years ago, the U.S. government passed a law that strongly encouraged the adoption of electronic health records with the intent of improving and streamlining care. The enormous amount of information in these now-digital records could be used to answer very specific questions beyond the scope of clinical trials: What’s the right dose of this medication for patients with this height and weight? What about patients with a specific genomic profile?
Unfortunately, most of the data that could answer these questions is trapped in doctor’s notes, full of jargon and abbreviations. These notes are hard for computers to understand using current techniques — extracting information requires training multiple machine learning models. Models trained for one hospital, also, don't work well at others, and training each model requires domain experts to label lots of data, a time-consuming and expensive process. 
An ideal system would use a single model that can extract many types of information, work well at multiple hospitals, and learn from a small amount of labeled data. But how? Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) led by Monica Agrawal, a PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science, believed that to disentangle the data, they needed to call on something bigger: large language models. To pull that important medical information, they used a very big, GPT-3 style model to do tasks like expand overloaded jargon and acronyms and extract medication regimens. 
For example, the system takes an input, which in this case is a clinical note, “prompts” the model with a question about the note, such as “expand this abbreviation, C-T-A.” The system returns an output such as “clear to auscultation,” as opposed to say, a CT angiography. The objective of extracting this clean data, the team says, is to eventually enable more personalized clinical recommendations. 
Medical data is, understandably, a pretty tricky resource to navigate freely. There’s plenty of red tape around using public resources for testing the performance of large models because of data use restrictions, so the team decided to scrape together their own. Using a set of short, publicly available clinical snippets, they cobbled together a small dataset to enable evaluation of the extraction performance of large language models. 
“It's challenging to develop a single general-purpose clinical natural language processing system that will solve everyone's needs and be robust to the huge variation seen across health datasets. As a result, until today, most clinical notes are not used in downstream analyses or for live decision support in electronic health records. These large language model approaches could potentially transform clinical natural language processing,” says David Sontag, MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science, principal investigator in CSAIL and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and supervising author on a paper about the work, which will be presented at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. “The research team’s advances in zero-shot clinical information extraction makes scaling possible. Even if you have hundreds of different use cases, no problem — you can build each model with a few minutes of work, versus having to label a ton of data for that particular task.”
For example, without any labels at all, the researchers found these models could achieve 86 percent accuracy at expanding overloaded acronyms, and the team developed additional methods to boost this further to 90 percent accuracy, with still no labels required.
Imprisoned in an EHR 
Experts have been steadily building up large language models (LLMs) for quite some time, but they burst onto the mainstream with GPT-3’s widely covered ability to complete sentences. These LLMs are trained on a huge amount of text from the internet to finish sentences and predict the next most likely word. 
While previous, smaller models like earlier GPT iterations or BERT have pulled off a good performance for extracting medical data, they still require substantial manual data-labeling effort. 
For example, a note, “pt will dc vanco due to n/v” means that this patient (pt) was taking the antibiotic vancomycin (vanco) but experienced nausea and vomiting (n/v) severe enough for the care team to discontinue (dc) the medication. The team’s research avoids the status quo of training separate machine learning models for each task (extracting medication, side effects from the record, disambiguating common abbreviations, etc). In addition to expanding abbreviations, they investigated four other tasks, including if the models could parse clinical trials and extract detail-rich medication regimens.  
“Prior work has shown that these models are sensitive to the prompt's precise phrasing. Part of our technical contribution is a way to format the prompt so that the model gives you outputs in the correct format,” says Hunter Lang, CSAIL PhD student and author on the paper. “For these extraction problems, there are structured output spaces. The output space is not just a string. It can be a list. It can be a quote from the original input. So there’s more structure than just free text. Part of our research contribution is encouraging the model to give you an output with the correct structure. That significantly cuts down on post-processing time.”
The approach can’t be applied to out-of-the-box health data at a hospital: that requires sending private patient information across the open internet to an LLM provider like OpenAI. The authors showed that it's possible to work around this by distilling the model into a smaller one that could be used on-site.
The model — sometimes just like humans — is not always beholden to the truth. Here's what a potential problem might look like: Let’s say you’re asking the reason why someone took medication. Without proper guardrails and checks, the model might just output the most common reason for that medication, if nothing is explicitly mentioned in the note. This led to the team's efforts to force the model to extract more quotes from data and less free text.
Future work for the team includes extending to languages other than English, creating additional methods for quantifying uncertainty in the model, and pulling off similar results with open-sourced models. 
“Clinical information buried in unstructured clinical notes has unique challenges compared to general domain text mostly due to large use of acronyms, and inconsistent textual patterns used across different health care facilities,” says Sadid Hasan, AI lead at Microsoft and former executive director of AI at CVS Health, who was not involved in the research. “To this end, this work sets forth an interesting paradigm of leveraging the power of general domain large language models for several important zero-/few-shot clinical NLP tasks. Specifically, the proposed guided prompt design of LLMs to generate more structured outputs could lead to further developing smaller deployable models by iteratively utilizing the model generated pseudo-labels.”
“AI has accelerated in the last five years to the point at which these large models can predict contextualized recommendations with benefits rippling out across a variety of domains such as suggesting novel drug formulations, understanding unstructured text, code recommendations or create works of art inspired by any number of human artists or styles,” says Parminder Bhatia, who was formerly head of machine learning at AWS Health AI and is currently head of machine learning for low-code applications leveraging large language models at AWS AI Labs.
As part of the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, Agrawal, Sontag, and Lang wrote the paper alongside Yoon Kim, MIT assistant professor and CSAIL principal investigator, and Stefan Hegselmann, a visiting PhD student from the University of Muenster. First-author Agrawal’s research was supported by a Takeda Fellowship, the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and the MLA@CSAIL Initiatives.

“Depending on who you ask, AI is either man’s greatest invention since the discovery of fire”, as Google’s CEO said at Google’s I/O 2017 keynote, or it is a technology that might one day make man superfluous. What’s inarguable is major companies have embraced AI as if it was one of the most important discoveries ever invented. In the US, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, SAS, and Adobe have all infused AI and machine learning throughout their operations, while in China the big four – Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi – are coordinating with the government and all working on unique and almost siloed AI initiatives.
In her article Understanding Three Types of Artificial Intelligence, Anjali UJ explains “The term AI was coined by John McCarthy, an American computer scientist in 1956.” Anjali speaks of the following three types of AI, including:

Narrow Artificial Intelligence: AI that has been trained for a narrow task.
Artificial General Intelligence: AI containing generalized cognitive abilities, which understand and reason the environment the way humans do.
Artificial Super Intelligence: AI that surpasses human intelligence and allows machines to mimic human thought.

AI is not a new technology, in reality, it’s decades old. In his MIT Technology Review article Is AI Riding a One-Trick Pony?, James Somers states “Just about every AI advance you’ve heard of depends on a breakthrough that’s three decades old.” Recent advances in chip technology, as well as improvements in hardware, software, and electronics have turned AI’s enormous potential into reality.
Neural Nets 
AI is founded on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or just “Neural Nets”, which are non-linear statistical data modelling tools used when the true nature of a relationship between input and output is unknown. In his article Machine Learning Applications for Data Center Optimization, Jim Gao describes neural nets as “a class of machine learning algorithms that mimic cognitive behavior via interactions between artificial neurons.” Neural nets search for patterns and interactions between features to automatically generate a best­ fit model.
They do not require the user to predefine a model’s feature interactions. Speech recognition, image processing, chatbots, recommendation systems, and autonomous software agents are common examples of machine learning. There are three types of training in neural networks; supervised, which is the most common, as well as unsupervised training and reinforcement learning. AI can be broken down into three areas:

Machine Learning 
A branch of computer science, machine learning explores the composition and application of algorithms that learn from data. These algorithms build models based on inputs and use those results to predict or determine actions and results, rather than following strict instructions.
Supervised learning’s goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs and the computer is provided with example inputs as well as the desired outputs. With unsupervised learning, however, labeled data isn’t provided to the learning algorithm and it must find the input’s structure on its own. In reinforcement learning, the computer utilizes trial and error to solve a problem. Like Pavlov’s dog, the computer is rewarded for good actions it performs and the goal of the program is to maximize reward.
Deep learning 
A subset of machine learning, deep learning utilizes multi-layered neural nets to perform classification tasks directly from image, text, and/or sound data. In some cases, deep learning models are already exceeding human-level performance. Google Meet’s ability to transcribe a human voice during a live conference call is an example of deep learning’s impressive capabilities.
ML and deep learning are useful for personalization marketing, customer recommendation, spam filtering, fraud detection, network security, optical character recognition (OCR), computer vision, voice recognition, predictive asset maintenance, sentiments analysis, language translations, and online search, among others.

7 Patterns of AI 
In her Forbes article The Seven Patterns of AI, Kathleen Walch lays out a theory that, regardless of the application of AI, there are seven commonalities to all AI applications. These are “hyperpersonalization, autonomous systems, predictive analytics and decision support, conversational/human interactions, patterns and anomalies, recognition systems, and goal-driven systems.” Walch adds that, while AI might require its own programming and pattern recognition, each type can be combined with others, but they all follow their own pretty standard set of rules.
The ‘Hyperpersonalization Pattern’ can be boiled down to the slogan, ‘Treat each customer as an individual’. ‘Autonomous systems’ will reduce the need for manual labor. Predictive analytics portends “some future value for data, predicting behavior, predicting failure, assisted problem resolution, identifying and selecting best fit, identifying matches in data, optimization activities, giving advice, and intelligent navigation,” says Walch. The ‘Conversational Pattern’ includes chatbots, which allow humans to communicate with machines via voice, text, or image.
The ‘Patterns and Anomalies’ type utilizes machine learning to discern patterns in data and it attempts to discover higher-order connections between data points, explains Walch. The recognition pattern helps identify and determine objects within image, video, audio, text, or other highly unstructured data notes Walch. The ‘Goal-Driven Systems Pattern’ utilizes the power of reinforcement learning to help computers beat humans on some of the most complex games imaginable, including Go and Dota 2, a complicated multiplayer online battle arena video game.
Conclusion
A few years ago, the AI hype had reached such a fever pitch that companies just had to add ‘AI’, ‘ML’, or ‘Deep Learning’ to their pitch decks, and funding flooded through the door. However, businesses are investing in AI powered solutions like AIOps to reduce IT operations cost. Today, investors are a little wiser to the fact that not all that glitters is AI gold, and a lot of companies who pitched themselves as AI experts really didn’t know the difference between a neural net and a k-means algorithm.
Jumping head-first into AI is a recipe for disaster. Only “1 in 3 AI projects are successful and it takes more than 6 months to go from concept to production, with a significant portion of them never making it to production—creating an AI dilemma for organizations,” says Databricks. Not only is AI old, but it is also a difficult technology to implement. Anyone delving into AI needs to have a strong understanding of technology, what it is, where it came from, what limitations might hold it back, so although AI is exceptional technology, the waters are deep. It is far from the panacea that many software companies claim it is. AI has had not one but two AI winters. CEOs looking to make a substantial investment in AI should be well aware of the old saying that ‘a fool and his money are easily parted’, as that fool could be an AI fool, too.

What Is Artificial Intelligence?
How Does LanguageTool Use AI To Improve Your Writing?
LanguageTool & AI: A Match Made in Heaven


What Is Artificial Intelligence?Although many may not know exactly what it is, most of us are familiar with artificial intelligence (AI). Have you ever used an automated chatbot to avoid calling a company’s customer service department? If so, be grateful for artificial intelligence. Ever bought something off of a recommendation you found on social media? That was AI’s doing, too. Whenever you use a digital assistant like Siri or Alexa, you’re interacting with artificial intelligence.At first glance, it seems as if applied statistics is the same as machine learning. When presented to others, this becomes artificial intelligence.But the picture is to be understood differently. Statistics and data form the basis for the framework of machine learning, which attempts to make predictions. Artificial intelligence makes the tool available to the public: users employ software to be able to use the predictions from machine learning for themselves.Artificial intelligence basically means the best solutions that could be predicted based on the processed data by machine learning of computer systems.

The History of Artificial Intelligence
First research approaches existed already in 1949/50.Co-founder John McCarthy presented AI at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project conference of 1956 in New Hampshire.
A computer in the 1980s was intended to imitate human intelligence directly.

Put more intricately, artificial intelligence uses machine learning (a tool that uses statistical methods to make predictions) to provide valuable software features in many areas of life—even writing. But how exactly can artificial intelligence be beneficial in writing? Below, we’ll explain how LanguageTool incorporates AI to optimize your writing.LanguageTool is rule-based and artificial intelligence-based.How Does LanguageTool Use AI To Improve Your Writing?LanguageTool is a multilingual spelling and grammar checker. It ensures your writing is flawless by fixing errors and typos. Many popular text editors use a rule-based approach to correct mistakes. Yes, LanguageTool uses a rule-based approach too. But it also uses artificial intelligence, which allows for more thorough and advanced corrections.Let’s say we have a text with some mistakes. Not only do writing tools underline the misspelled or misused words, but they also suggest the correct spelling or a clear improvement. But how does this kind of computer-based proofreading work in real time?Machine learning now tries to read out these patterns and rules from the pool of sentences, using statistical methods. If these predictions are used in the next step to analyze texts and detect errors, we will be thus talking about artificial intelligence, which is made available to us writers by software.Rule-based correction vs. AI-based correctionLanguageTool is particularly recommended as a correction tool because it uses both: AI-based analyses that are too complex to be broken down manually, and individually written suggestions to cover exceptions.The use of LanguageTool’s artificial intelligence goes beyond corrections. It can also generate rephrased sentences. So, if you’re having trouble writing something in a formal, fluent, or clear way, LanguageTool’s use of artificial intelligence can help.Sentence rephrasing can help you better connect with your audience by writing in a more appropriate tone.LanguageTool & AI: A Match Made in HeavenLanguageTool is an exceptional writing assistant. Its distraction-free and user-friendly interface helps writers focus on what’s important—writing. Synonyms are easy to find and use, and style suggestions make your text easier to follow and understand. Additionally, all the errors it fixes make your writing pristine.And the best part? If you’re interested in the topic of artificial intelligence in correcting, there are several sources of information available to you: Open source can show which suggestions are AI-based and which are manually coded. In addition, LanguageTool has its own AI department, which expresses the importance of AI-based error correction.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Nvidia also presented a series of AI advancements it had worked on for the past year. It has released two papers, on providing unique lighting approaches and on 3D model creation, following up on its work in 3D and generative AI.
>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
“NeurIPS is a major conference in machine learning, and we see high value in participating in the show among other leaders in the field. We showcased 60+ research projects at the conference and were proud to have two papers honored with NeurIPS 2022 Awards for their contributions to machine learning,” Sanja Fidler, VP of AI research at Nvidia and a writer on both the 3D MoMa and GET3D papers, told VentureBeat.  
Synthetic data generation for images, text and video were the key themes of several Nvidia-authored papers. Other subjects covered were reinforcement learning, data gathering and augmentation, weather models and federated learning.
Nvidia unveils a new way of designing diffusion-based generative models 
Diffusion-based models have emerged as one of the most disruptive techniques in generative AI. Diffusion models have shown intriguing potential to achieve superior image sample quality compared to traditional methods such as GANs (generative adversarial networks). Nvidia researchers won an “outstanding main track paper” award for their work in diffusion model design, which suggests model design improvements based on an analysis of several diffusion models. 
Their paper, titled “Elucidating the design space of diffusion-based generative models,” breaks down the components of a diffusion model into a modular design, assisting developers in identifying processes that may be altered to improve the overall model’s performance. Nvidia claims that these suggested design modifications can dramatically improve diffusion models’ efficiency and quality. 
The methods defined in the paper are primarily independent of model components, such as network architecture and training details. However, the researchers first measured baseline results for different models using their original output capabilities, then tested them through a unified framework using a set formula, followed by minor tweaks that resulted in improvements. This method allowed the research team to adequately evaluate different practical choices and propose general improvements for the diffusion model’s sampling process that are universally applicable to all models.
The methods described in the paper also proved to be highly effective, as they allowed models to achieve record scores with enhanced capabilities when compared with performance metrics such as ImageNet-64 and CIFAR-10.advertisement

That said, the research team also noted that such advances in sample quality could amplify adverse societal effects when used in a large-scale system like DALL·E 2. These negative effects could include disinformation, emphasis on stereotypes and harmful biases. Moreover, the training and sampling of such diffusion models also require much electricity; Nvidia’s project consumed ∼250MWh on an in-house cluster of Nvidia V100s. 
Generating complex 3D shapes from 2D images
Most tech giants are gearing up to showcase their metaverse capabilities, including Nvidia. Earlier this year, the company demonstrated how Omniverse could be the go-to platform for creating metaverse applications. The company has now developed a model that can generate high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, further enhancing its metaverse tech stack. advertisement
Named Nvidia GET3D (for its ability to generate explicit textured 3D meshes), the model is trained only on 2D images but can generate 3D shapes with intricate details and a high polygon count. It creates the figures in a triangle mesh, similar to a paper-mâché model, covered with a layer of textured material.
“The metaverse is made up of large, consistent virtual worlds. These virtual worlds need to be populated by 3D content — but there aren’t enough experts in the world to create the massive amount of content required by metaverse applications,” said Fidler. “GET3D is an early example of the kind of 3D generative AI we are creating to give users a diverse and scalable set of tools for content creation.”

Moreover, the model generates these shapes in the same triangle mesh format used by popular 3D applications. This allows creative professionals to quickly import the assets into gaming engines, 3D modeling software and film renderers so they can start working on them. These AI-generated objects can populate 3D representations of buildings, outdoor locations or whole cities, as well as digital environments developed for the robotics, architecture and social media sectors.
According to Nvidia, prior 3D generative AI models were significantly limited in the level of detail they could produce; even the most sophisticated inverse-rendering algorithms could only construct 3D objects based on 2D photographs collected from multiple angles, requiring developers to build one 3D shape at a time.
Manually modeling a realistic 3D world is time- and resource-intensive. AI tools like GET3D can vastly optimize the 3D modeling process and allow artists to focus on what matters. For example, when executing inference on a single Nvidia GPU, GET3D can produce 20 forms in a second, operating like a generative adversarial network for 2D photos while producing 3D objects.
The more extensive and diversified the training dataset, the more varied and comprehensive the output. The model was trained on NVIDIA A100 tensor core GPUs, using one million 2D images of 3D shapes captured from several camera angles. 
Once a GET3D-generated form is exported to a graphics tool, artists can apply realistic lighting effects as the item moves or rotates in a scene. Developers may also employ language cues to create a picture in a particular style by combining another AI tool from Nvidia, StyleGAN-NADA. For example, they might alter a rendered automobile to become a burnt car or a taxi, or convert an ordinary house into a haunted one.
According to the researchers, a future version of GET3D might incorporate camera pose estimation techniques. This would allow developers to train the model on real-world data rather than synthetic datasets. The model will also be updated to enable universal generation, which means that developers will be able to train GET3D on all types of 3D forms simultaneously rather than on one object category at a time.
Improving 3D rendering pipelines with lighting
At the most recent CVPR conference in New Orleans in June, Nvidia Research introduced 3D MoMa. Developers can use this inverse-rendering approach to generate 3D objects comprising three parts: a 3D mesh model, materials placed on the model, and lighting.
Since then, the team has made substantial progress in untangling materials and lighting from 3D objects, allowing artists to change AI-generated forms by switching materials or adjusting lighting as the item travels around a scene. Now presented at NeurIPS 2022, 3D MoMa relies on a more realistic shading model that uses Nvidia RTX GPU accelerated ray tracing.
Recent advances in differentiable rendering have enabled high-quality reconstruction of 3D scenes from multiview images. However, Nvidia says that most methods still rely on simple rendering algorithms such as prefiltered direct lighting or learned representations of irradiance. Nvidia’s 3D MoMa model incorporates Monte Carlo integration, an approach that substantially improves decomposition into shape, materials and lighting.

Unfortunately, Monte Carlo integration provides estimates with significant noise, even at large sample counts, making gradient-based inverse rendering challenging. To address this, the development team incorporated multiple importance sampling and denoising in a novel inverse-rendering pipeline. Doing so substantially improved convergence and enabled gradient-based optimization at low sample counts. 
Nvidia’s paper on diffusion-based generative models also presents an efficient method to jointly reconstruct geometry (explicit triangle meshes), materials and lighting, substantially improving material and light separation compared to previous work. Finally, Nvidia hypothesizes that denoising can become integral to high-quality inverse rendering pipelines.
Fidler highlighted the importance of lighting in a 3D environment and said that realistic lighting is crucial to a 3D scene. 
“By reconstructing the geometry and disentangling lighting effects from the material properties of objects, we can produce content that supports relighting effects and augmented reality (AR) — which is much more useful for creators, artists and engineers,” Fidler told VentureBeat. “With AI, we want to accelerate and generate these 3D objects by learning from a wide variety of images rather than manually creating every piece of content.”

3D MoMa achieves this. As a result, the content it produces can be directly imported into existing graphics software and used as building blocks for complex scenes. 
The 3D MoMa model does have limitations. They include a lack of efficient regularization of material specular parameters, and reliance on a foreground segmentation mask. In addition, the researchers note in the paper that the approach is computationally intense, requiring a high-end GPU for optimization runs.
The paper puts forth a unique Monte Carlo rendering method combined with variance-reduction techniques, practical and applicable to multiview 3D object reconstruction of explicit triangular 3D models. 
Nvidia’s future AI focus
Fidler said that Nvidia is very excited about generative AI, as the company believes that the technology will soon open up opportunities for more people to be creators.
“You’re already seeing generative AI, and our work within the field, being used to create amazing images and beautiful works of art,” she said. “Take Refik Anadol’s exhibition at the MoMA, for example, which utilizes Nvidia StyleGAN.”
Fidler said that other emerging domains Nvidia is currently working on are foundational models, self-supervised learning and the metaverse. 
“Foundational models can train on enormous, unlabeled datasets, which opens the door to more scalable approaches for solving a range of problems with AI. Similarly, self-supervised learning is aimed at learning from unlabeled data to reduce the need for human annotation, which can be a barrier to progress,” explained Fidler. 
“We also see many opportunities in gaming and the metaverse, using AI to generate content on the fly so that the experience is unique every time. In the near future, you’ll be able to use it for entire villages, landscapes and cities by assembling an example of an image to generate an entire 3D world.”

Composite: Gilbert and GeorgeArtificial intelligence is creating increasingly sophisticated images. But what does it mean for the art world? Gilbert and George, Gillian Wearing, Mat Collishaw, Elizabeth Price, Polly Morgan and Lindsey Mendick found outBy Jonathan JonesThu 1 Dec 2022 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Dec 2022 03.05 ESTShareFor more than 30,000 years we have been the only art-making species on Earth, give or take the odd paint-throwing Neanderthal or chimpanzee. Art is the oldest and most spectacular triumph of human consciousness, from Lascaux to the Sistine Chapel. But a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) art software may be about to end that. It will whip you up a Picasso or a Turner in an instant, or apply their styles to any theme you picture, from Liz Truss dancing in a supermarket to a brawl in a 1970s disco.Stable Diffusion and competitors such as DALL-E 2 go far beyond previous claims for AI art. Easily accessible online, and in that sense open to full public scrutiny, they create precise, rich, convincing images in response to a typed-in text – for example “a sad cat in a mountainous landscape in the style of Turner”, or whatever combination of styles, keywords and subjects takes your fancy. Or you can ask more sidelong and existential questions, such as my request for “a photograph of a human”, which produced a bare-chested man who could be a museum exhibit of early homo sapiens – except for his mysterious earphone-like cables. For the expert there are others: “I’ve been experimenting in Wombo Dream, Midjourney and Google Colab/Disco Diffusion,” says the artist Mat Collishaw.View image in fullscreenJonathan Jones’s AI collaboration, created from the request: a photograph of a human. Photograph: Jonathan JonesUntil recently, I was deeply sceptical of the idea of AI art. I saw it as hype and casuistry, and with some cause: widely publicised efforts such as Ai-Da the robot artist obviously exaggerate the independence of the machine and play on our fascination with sentient artificial beings. But now the dream is coming true, at least in art. And art is surely one of the most inimitable expressions of the human mind.Evangelists for so-called “strong AI” – full artificial intelligence that will replicate and exceed the human mind – are fond of making analogies with biological evolution. Over millions of years, mindless cells evolved the human brain; machines are now evolving much faster so why shouldn’t they become sentient soon? The evolution of AI art seems to vindicate that. In 2018, the sale of an AI generated-painting called Portrait of Edmond de Belamy at Christie’s for $432,500 (£360,000) was the latest thing in the field – yet this portrait was crude in the extreme, a pixellated blur easy to dismiss as a pathetic computerised pastiche of Frans Hals. Four years on, the detail and nuance of images produced by the latest AI art generators have grown more impressive exponentially.What does this mean for art? Is it the end of our run as the only art-making species? Or can humans and machines work together to create something wondrous? To find out, I challenged six outstanding human artists, including three Turner prize-winners, to experiment with AI.View image in fullscreenGilbert and George by AI, by Gilbert and George. Photograph: Gilbert and GeorgeGilbert and GeorgeGilbert and George have been flirting with post-humanity ever since they painted their faces and hands silver, like robots, for their 1969 performance-art masterpiece The Singing Sculpture. Their merging of creative identities – “two people, but one artist” – has a similar futuristic radicalism. That extends to the authorship of the Pictures they have made since the 1970s in which they appear while operating the camera and editing its images in a deliberately unexpressive way: always sharp and bright. The panel of four portraits they have elicited from AI is called Gilbert and George by AI, but firmly credited to them as artists.These images of Gilbert and George are like them, but not. They are clearly not photographs: instead, the software has “painted” them from the information it has, in several efforts with various eccentricities. At the top left, Gilbert Proesch looks as if he’s in a 1960s film by Antonioni or Fellini: at bottom right, both men merge into the same grumpy caricature. In all the portraits, their eyes are cold and distant and odd. This is typical of what happens when you ask a machine to portray a human.All existing AI art platforms, from the software that stunned Christie’s auction room in 2018 to the disconcertingly impressive Stable Diffusion, are types of “neural network” that excel at machine learning. Neural networks emulate the way neurons fire off each other in the human brain: they are capable of learning when fed with ever-vaster quantities of data. The power of machine learning is seen by some as an epochal breakthrough that makes AI “creative” and could soon lead to artificial consciousness – if it hasn’t already. This summer, Google sacked engineer Blake Lemoine after he claimed its LaMDA chatbot was starting to think for itself.Others say these machines are only good at the job they have been taught: DeepMind’s AlphaGo can’t turn its skills to Scrabble or Cluedo and self-driving cars have big problems with unexpected situations outside their learning.The trouble AI art has with depicting eyes, not to mention how many limbs or heads a human being possesses, may back up the sceptical view. The likes of DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have been fed huge amounts of artistic and visual information yet don’t have any knowledge of, say, anatomy. They don’t realise this is a problem because they don’t “think”.Or do they?View image in fullscreen‘What do you understand about racial identity?’ Photograph: Elizabeth PriceElizabeth PriceElizabeth Price takes on such issues in the sequence of 40 AI images she generated from text prompts. Instead of producing a finished artwork, she treated it as an experiment, sharing the results in an apparently casual way. Only when I flicked through the sequence like a slideshow did I see that it is as unsettling as her Turner prize-winning video The 1979 Woolworths Choir. Price engages with the AI as if it were indeed sentient, asking it questions rather than giving it commands, as she tries to get the software to reveal its true self. “I quickly became fascinated by how it was putting images together; how that process differed from the human mind; what it ‘knew’; what it ‘understood’; and how much we could think of its dataset and search modes as a kind of cultural memory.” Price says that if this is her artwork, it’s one that includes the questions she put: one of the limits of AI, she points out, is that it has an unsophisticated and conservative grasp of what art is.View image in fullscreen‘Do you understand politics in the UK?’ Photograph: Elizabeth PriceShe asks the AI: “What do you understand about love for a parent”; it produces a waxily real, warm yet ever so slightly creepy vision of an embracing family. “Do you understand politics in the UK?” elicits a shrill picture with devastating – deliberate or accidental? – satirical power in which hosts of shouting heads are juxtaposed with multiple union flags. “What do you understand about racial identity” leads to a photographic image of two Black children, one of whom holds up a photo of a Black girl as if she is a missing person. It’s striking, says Price, that the software should assume “racial identity” means Blackness, as if whiteness were the non-racial norm.View image in fullscreen‘What do you understand about love for a parent?’ Photograph: Elizabeth PriceSuch apparent racism has become a problem with other AI applications such as facial recognition, and reflects the internet data the machines are fed. Price compares the intelligence she questioned to a “collective unconscious”. And it can throw up some seriously weird images as it trawls through digitally archived human memories. She types in the poet Emily Dickinson’s lines about her own future grave: “An Island in dishonored Grass – / Whom none but Daisies – know.” In one text prompt the daisies become beetles, and the computer depicts them as giant shiny creatures in a verdant landscape.View image in fullscreen‘An Island in dishonoured Grass - whom none but Beetles – know’. Photograph: Elizabeth PriceSome combinations of words unleash the truly unexpected from AI art generators, while others result in something flat, or incoherent. It feels as if you are searching for the right key to the vast banks of imagery that exist on the internet. AI in its current state is quite literally an unconscious mind, full of memory, but unable to make sense of it. In the early 20th century, artists and poets inspired by Sigmund Freud sought to release images directly from the human unconscious. That was the surrealist revolution. Could the AI age be fertile ground for a new surrealism in which human artists pry open the digital unconscious?View image in fullscreenPouyannian mimicry: AI art by Mat Collishaw. Photograph: Mat CollishawMat Collishaw and Polly MorganMat Collishaw and Polly Morgan work in a studio that seems to have its own subconscious. It’s a converted pub in south London, a bit of a fortress from the outside, where on the ground floor Collishaw works coolly with computers and hi-tech toys including a 3D video screen. Collishaw is fascinated by the technology of the image, from early cameras and zoetropes to AI – of which he is an early adopter. But downstairs in the pub’s depths, he tells me, Morgan is busy amid guts and gore, skinning snakes for her taxidermy sculptures.Not that Collishaw’s art is lacking in surrealism. His current experiments with AI start with 17th-century still life paintings of flowers. He feeds them into the software, then creates text prompts to add in insects. At first, the picture looks charmingly beautiful, then you start to notice more and more insects – which then turn out to be flowers in disguise. Collishaw explains that it illustrates “Pouyannian mimicry, when a flower imitates an insect to attract and exploit other insects which inadvertently propagate the flower’s species”.It is a metaphor for AI itself – for Collishaw is no techno-utopian. Like the flowers that imitate insects to trick them into propagating their pollen, the big tech corporations attract us with social media and internet searches so they can collect our data. This in turn fuels machine learning, which adds to the digital world’s glamour. Collishaw’s flowers are gorgeous yet deceptive.View image in fullscreenA snake cross-bred with concrete: AI artwork by Polly Morgan using Stable Diffusion. Photograph: Polly MorganWhen Morgan emerges from her bloody basement in her stained overalls, I suggest she, too, try out an AI artwork, and it arrives a few days later – a taxidermy sculpture strangely transfigured. The snake in it has been cross-bred with concrete. It glistens monumentally beside a female hand whose nails are not just long, but doubled, in one of those creative slips AI can make with human anatomy. Morgan compares it to the surrealist photography of Man Ray – it’s like a decadent remake of his portrait of Kiki of Montparnasse, her eyes closed in dreams, her hand on a carved mask. Except here, the dreamer is a disembodied hand and what it dreams of is an inorganic serpent.View image in fullscreenStrange, spooky, funny: Gillian Wearing’s Imagined Mask of Joan Crawford as Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, created with AI - DALL-E 2. Photograph: © Gillian Wearing/Courtesy Maureen Paley, LondonGillian WearingGillian Wearing uses the fantastical possibilities of AI to create a truly disconcerting image full of unease called Imagined Mask of Joan Crawford as Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. You start to laugh at the title, then stop when you realise that beneath this brutal and macabre parody of a human face, created by exploiting the inhumanity of AI portraits, is a suffering human being. This is very much a work of art by Wearing that happens to make use of AI: it’s the latest in a series of disconcerting and introspective works in which she has been exploring the nature of masks, and what they say about our public and private selves.Using one of her own photographs, she has added the mask with DALL-E 2 AI so it seems to grow naturally out of her face, while being contoured to the shape of a skull all too visible under the skin. It uses the distortions that AI can create, yet within a portrait that is human and real. Wearing suggests mortality and madness in a vision of a face eaten away from inside. It’s strange, spooky, funny – yet like all her art it is also about the lumpen reality of being human. Even this mask morphing into two Hollywood legends is ultimately about plain sad facts. You get a sense of loneliness and anguish, crying from inside to outside, soul to soul.So long as humans are involved, art will be all about us – whatever the technology.Painting of Cher and a Werewolf at a Buffet in Las Vegas: AI artwork created by Lindsey Mendick. Photograph: Lindsey MendickLindsey MendickI asked Lindsey Mendick to try AI because she works in one of the oldest of all artistic media. Pottery was made in ice-age Europe, prehistoric China and every civilisation since. Mendick makes hilarious, lubricious ceramics that swarm with monsters and dirty jokes. What might an artist who is used to delving into wet clay make of an art form that requires you only to type a text prompt on your phone screen?Turns out she’s a natural. Typing her texts into Stable Diffusion, Mendick struck gold with the words “Las Vegas”, “Cher” and other celebrity names. She started by sending photo-style scenes of wild cavortings in “a Las Vegas buffet”. Then she added the term “impressionist painting”.Las Vegas buffet ravaged by werewolves in rococo clothing as sweaty waiters look on in dismay, by Lindsey Mendick using Stable Diffusion. Photograph: Lindsey MendickThat’s how such contemporary masterpieces as Impressionist Painting of Cher and a Werewolf at a Buffet in Las Vegas and Impressionist Painting of Tom Cruise Feeling Sad Eating a Sandwich With a Werewolf in Las Vegas were born. In the funniest, most touching of her kitsch ultra-bright AI paintings of celebrities, a vulpine Leonardo DiCaprio shares a huge seafood platter with a werewolf. Man and monster break bread peacefully.Like these collaborations between artist and machine, it could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Elizabeth Price: Underfoot is at the Hunterian, Glasgow until 13 April. Lindsey Mendick in Strange Clay is at the Hayward until 8 January.

Writing is a cornerstone of a university education, and for good reason. It is not only a form of communication, but a means of discovery, recalling the old adage, “How do I know what I think until I see what I write?” What could be more central to the examined life? What skill could be more predictive of postgraduate career success than the ability to write well?
Many are beginning to worry, however, that writing in the university is under threat. Technological innovations have long been associated with the replacement of manual labor, but now—like the zombies in the postapocalyptic literature class I teach—they are coming for our brains. As noted by Slate, artificial intelligence (AI) programs that generate text have become so widely available and affordable that many are beginning to suspect students are using AI to write essays for their university classes. Jeff Schatten, an associate professor of business administration at Washington and Lee University, recently prophesized the coming plagiarism apocalypse in an article for the Chronicle of Higher Education titled “Will Artificial Intelligence Kill College Writing?”
How worried should we be? There is limited data on how often students make use of such software, but Schatten’s concerns seem justified. These new services generate content that is not traceable to any source and cannot be identified by current plagiarism-checking software. And the content AI can produce is startling in its specificity and organization. It makes piecemeal plagiarism—in which students casually copy writing from other sources into their own work—both efficient and fun.
For example, I recently used Sudowrite to see what would happen after prompting it to help me compose an essay about E. M. Forster’s 1909 short story, “The Machine Stops,” in which humans, living in a series of underground tunnels because the surface of the planet is no longer ecologically habitable, have become totally reliant upon an omniscient Machine. After I typed a few sentences to begin an essay on the story, Sudowrite generated the following suggested text to complete my paragraph: “While the Machine is the ‘handmaid’ that helps deliver things to the people, they have become so reliant on it that if the Machine shut down, they would die…. We find solace in the presence and use of these machines to help us with everything—they are our servants, our caretakers. We have stopped thinking for ourselves and simply rely on technological devices to do so for us.” Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
Undoubtedly, tools like Sudowrite will change the way that writing is assigned in our classes. But, speaking as a college writing instructor, I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing.
Many college classes assign writing as a product-based endeavor: students complete an essay, turn it in, and receive a grade. But writing assessment is not synonymous with writing instruction, and the writing-as-product model does little more than punish or reward students for writing skills that they likely already had before even beginning the assignment. If we want to dissuade students from using artificial intelligence to help produce their writing, we need to treat writing differently. If we want to teach writing in our classes, if we want students to use writing as a deliberative, reflective space to facilitate critical thinking, innovation, and self-awareness, we need to move away from framing writing assignments as primarily product-based endeavors.
Writing programs across the country, like the one here at Boston University, have been at the forefront of this work for decades. Integrated into our classes is an emphasis on the writing process, including the intellectual work that happens before ever putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard). We require students to develop drafts, to workshop their writing with other students, to meet with us individually in conferences to discuss their ideas and find a language to best convey them. Students always seem to have flashes of insight at 2 am, and no machine can replace me when they show up, bleary-eyed and unannounced, at my office door early the next day, eager to try out their ideas in conversation or to share the new paragraphs they wrote just as the sun was beginning to rise.
Recognizing that the kinds of writing skills students need extend well beyond the traditional academic essay, we are assigning new genres and new media: TED Talks, public intellectual essays, podcast episodes, video essays, and even live action role-playing to practice debate. Our newest courses emphasize design thinking as their central pedagogical orientation: students develop projects, individual or collaborative, that use writing across many media forms to experiment, innovate, and explore.
Some professors might complain that they do not have time for these kinds of assignments, that it is impossible to engage with students about their ideas over the course of multiple drafts. But, if this is true, why assign writing at all? If we regard writing as nothing more than a demonstration of proficiency, then our students will do the same, and will likely turn to AI to help them get the job done. If, instead, we dedicate ourselves and our assignments to something more—valuing writing as a messy and generative encounter with the self, a space in which we encourage students to discover what they think rather than only communicate it—then our students will, too. Writing at the university is changing. Let’s embrace it.

Aside from AI art criticism in general, taking away from real-life artists and also appropriating people's art and art styles without credit or compensation, there is criticism that the app reverts to sexualisation, and Prisma stated that they both own the work but also get the rights to use the uploaded photos in whatever way they wish. Here's some reaction posted by actual living comic book folk to social media recently.
Reilly Brown: Isn't it illegal for a computer program to just copy and paste code from another computer program? If in the case of AI generated images, visual art is essentially just a different form of programming code, wouldn't using it still be infringement?
Jimmie Robinson: I'm all for new tools in art creation. Even this new realm of text prompt apps. I'm all for people who want to explore and generate content, no matter what their skill level is in art. I'm all for it. I get it. I even want it.
The backlash, even if it's logical, correct and sincere is a waste of time. The cat is out the bag, the genie out the bottle, the milk already spilled.
Not saying people don't have the right to cast their opinion, because I am all for that, too. In fact, I encourage it. New art might emerge from those who rally against this new form. As the lyrics go, ""Your anger is a gift.""
But some of the vitriol I'm reading is asking for the elimination of the tools and apps, as if that will solve the problem they have with it. I won't quote, or name people, because that's not what this post is about.
This is about acceptance.
Art tools have morphed since paintings on cave walls. Nothing is done ""as it used to be"". In this digital era we will see art acceptance morph again. I'm honored to see it happening, just like the early days of photoshop, illustrator, direct-to-plate printing, and online comics. I'm an old fart and I find it fascinating to watch the evolution in real time.
In the 1990s, I recall seeing Scott McCloud stand before a huge room of industry professionals at a Pro/Con event in Oakland, Ca., telling them about the birth and potential of online comics. He was set upon with pitchforks and torches. And yet, here we are… giving out Eisner Awards to digital comics.
I know it's hard (and for some even alarming) to see change so quickly and broadcast so steadily to millions. But there it is. And it's early days. Kinks, quirks, issues and prompts still need to be ironed out.
But trust me, the day is coming when Ai art will be a standard, not just a gimmick. When sampling data from existing work will be a given with a shrug of the shoulders, no more than using a credit card online or ticking that box about online data and cookies.
So feed the internet with more Batman art for Ai prompts?
Or… find your art, your style, your vision.
Be unique. Be creative in ways outside the box.
The work will stand out, even if it's sampled.
Art is not mutually exclusive.
We can all play in the same sandbox.
Yes, even if that kid across the way is copying your answers on the test.
We still do the test.

Mike Manley: I have been seeing AI comics now. At first they totally sucked but in the past month I've seen them getting better. And I'm wondering since it's only a matter of months I imagine till it's smart enough to ape any style if fans will care?
If you can have more George Perez comics or John Byrne comics in their style do you care if in the end it might take work from human artists? Choose any artist with a recognizable style.
As far as I can see what you need is the script and a layout person to layout the page and choose the shots. Then you are not interpreting the script but choosing the best example AI gives you for the panel. And a production person for lettering and prepress. Or just do it as a web comic.
It will be able in short order to replicate anyone's style. It already is doing it in illustration. The concept people are good and fucked. If you are not top tier like Moebius or Mead. And again will the consumer care?
I see it as three tiers of consumer. Casual fan. In and out in a few years or watches the average movie. Not a collector.
The next level who is a fan of specific stories or genres. Casual collecting.
Then the Uber fan or fanatic. Collectors. They collect runs, follow specific artists. They might be able in a subset group to know about anatomy or storytelling. Inkers over certain artists etc. buy art.
Will the fan carry a cart of books to have signed at the table of the prompters? AI won't be signing.
So the question becomes will supporters care about getting sketches? "" come back in an hour, give me you prompts"".
Are they just fans of the material or of the creators? We have never been faced with that question.
I feel at least half if not more of people who consume this won't. Maybe 30% will.
Jonathan Matthewson: A.I. Is to art what Autotune is to music.
Salgood Sam: We've been here before even, remember when synths, or remix culture first took off and old school musicians took issue each time with the users of the new tools calling themselves artists or musicians? How well did that age?
Do you still take umbrage at calling people who do remixes and beat tracks from sample artists? How about writers? Instillation artists?
There's a lot of issues around AI that I agree with but I think visual artists are somehow assuming people who've learned how to work the AI via prompt texts – which having tried I can tell you isn't as simple as you might imagine – are implying they drew the thing by calling themselves an artist.
There are a LOT of kinds of artists who never draw, or even directly make the raw materials they use but rather assemble and build things. All legitimately artists as well.
AI isn't likely going anywhere, as a working commercial artist in animation for my day job I expect at some point when the tools and it's output are more predictable and controllable, studios will expect designers like me to learn to incorporate it into our workflow.
It's not contrary to some of the toxic claims, going to totally replace humans, just like self checkout lines still need human attendants to deal with shit AI images have lots of issues and need someone who is capable of doing the work when it glitches or breaks down to be on hand.
To be truly independent of humans it would need a working mind of its own and that's simply not going to happen. Takes too much processing power. Like orders of magnitude more than say all the CPU and GPU currently being used by the crypto crowd, just to think and that's one unit. We'll build those eventually but that's NOT going to be used to make art of any kind outside of an experiment any time soon, far too expensive for the margins in the arts.
But the relatively dumb tools are coming, and the people who use them will need a specific skill set to use them well, they already are part of the work flow for all the amazing VFX and digital animation you see.
ALL the hair and water and complex natural things in animation you take for granted these days and bitch about when something like She Hulk is just slightly less convincing? That's all dealt with by dumb algorithmic AI much like the tools being used to make the fantasy art that's taking off now from things like Stable Diffusion.
it's here already.
The people who use those, those that start working fantasy and editorial jobs making images with them? Those people, some of them are going to be seen as and call themselves artists, and I think it's a legit term like it or not.
The issues it represents for other kinds of artists are serious, but mainly they are ones of IP and labor law, not petty shit like who gets to be called an artist.
And factcheck, no it's not plagiarizing work in the learning database, it's using it much the same way my students did when I told them to study past artists and those they admire, as many as you can, to learn how to make good art. The only time you get into plagiarizing territory, both with students and AI, is when they study too few and don't have enough verity in their influence. Think those bots that have been trained to imitate ONE artist specifically, and even branded with their name.
The target of any aggression should not be other workers, but the corporations and governments.
If you're attacking peers using tools, you're being fearful monkeys throwing shit at exactly the wrong people. If it's some poser tech bro being insulting don't go after them for calling themselves an artist, call them out on being a douchebag period.
The companies that try to use this as an excuse to squeeze more content out of people for less money and the governments that don't address automation by installing a proper social safety net and support like UBI, or worse laugh at the idea they should? THEY are the problem. Not the technology and how it's going to change the arts, the commercial arts mainly
Matt Bors: An AI can't beat me. It can decimate weird twitter, punditry, portraiture, concept art. I will outflank it. I'll be drawing bizarre shit, getting outlandish with narrative structures. Stuff it can't piece together in a million years. A human is deranged and this is our magic.
Shane Chebsey: Can I ask a favour please.
Please do not include me in posts of Prompt Generated Imagery or ""AI art"" as it gets called.
I know it's not intentionally an attempt to annoy me, but I just don't want to see it anymore.
It's depressing and borderline offensive to me as an actual artist.
For those not aware, the use of ""AI art"" is plagerism of original art that it sources, and we don't need anymore of this in the artworld IMHO
I appreciate not everyone shares my view on this and I respect that.
Hell as I learn more I may even change my own view.
But until further notice I don't want to see that stuff.
I also understand it's hard to filter me out of your posts.
If you feel it's easier to just unfriend me that's cool. I won't be offended.
I know you're still my friend in the real world
Also I won't police my feed or anything giving shit to anyone who missed this post and I won't repeat this post.
I'm just hoping to get a reduction of it in my feed as it's getting me down.

Erik Larsen: Here's the thing about AI ""art""– people are angry at the very idea and understandably so– it has to potential to adversely effect the livelihood of a lot of creative people.
Can't afford to hire Alex Ross? Well, how about a faux-Alex Ross that will do whatever you tell it to do? And if faux-Alex Ross is out there making comics– what becomes of the real Alex Ross? Does this harm his career? Does he become watered down by ""imitators?"" Is the real Alex replaced by a fake one every time he turns down a job?
I can see a lawsuit down the road and it's going to get ugly.
And while that aspect is frightening– I have to admit– if there were monthly comics which looked like Jack Kirby drew them I'd be all over those.
And then there's this– aspiring writers have had a problem finding an artist willing to illustrate their amateurish efforts since the dawn of the medium– AI will allow more people into the tent and let those writers who could never find an artist to still make comics. It has the potential to expand the talent pool by letting those unable to make comics be able to make comics.
And is this all that different from the advent of computer lettering, which put dozens of hand letterers out of work? Why was that okay but this a crime against humanity?
I suspect the vast majority of audience doesn't care as long as the end result is good. Few people REALLY take a moral stance when push comes to shove. Thousands of people who made practical special effects in movies lost their livelihoods with the advent of CGI effects. But we all didn't stop going to the movies in protest.
The crack is going to be when artist-you-know uses AI to draw backgrounds for a project or assist them in some way. It's inevitable. It's going to happen if it hasn't already and then what? Is a comic book with AI backgrounds but hand drawn lead characters going to be the tipping point? Where do we draw the line?
People are VERY angry about it. And I don't want to appear as though I'm taking sides with AI–but the harsh reality is that the bulk of the audience won't notice or care. Comic book creation is all magic to them anyway.
Mark Brooks: I can sit here and bitch about AI ""art"" while knowing there's really nothing I can do about it or I can see it for what it is and work harder to produce better art that a computer can't replicate. I may die trying but I choose option number two.
David Hine: The machine intelligence doesn't know what a human being looks like yet. It doesn't even know how many digits are on a human hand. It certainly doesn't know who Richard Corben or Salvador Dali were. It doesn't understand the concepts of beauty or the grotesque. That's no reason to dismiss the images it creates as rubbish. It does work incredibly well at producing strange abstract works that to me appear breathtakingly beautiful. These images began with prompting Corben and Dali, to which I added more layers by prompting for gardens, jewels and squid (squid always adds an interesting element – they don't really have a fixed form anyway) to get a series of amazing landscapes, of which I have included one example here. I'm working at the lowest resolution. The images look good on a phone but will be blurred on a larger screen. I do that for speed. I just want to see what these machines can do, not make reproducible artwork. The third image here is the last created. After adding numerous prompts I removed most of them to shift results from increasing complexity back to a simpler image (though I did keep the squid).
Kody Chamberlain: As a lifelong art fan, I now find myself skimming past most of the art I see online, assuming it's an AI dump. I'm super bummed about this gut reaction, and I'm doing my best to fight it, but it's there.
Adi Granov: A while ago it was NFT, now it's AI art. Why are artists such depressing doommongers?
Photo bashing, mood board collages, etc. have been around forever and used quite frequently on many jobs I've done. Why haven't they replaced designers and artists? Many animals and machines can run faster and jump higher, and be way more precise than people, buy we still watch athletes compete. Why do we prise mechanical watches and pay 100x more than for a far superior quartz?
We're asking the wrong questions. Artists and illustrators could've been replaced decades ago as the technology was there. We are humans and are wired to be impressed by human achievements as they fit within our own frame of reference and emotion. Emotion is the only key factor. Were it not so the only music around today would be made by computers, but somehow we still enjoy good playing and singing.
Andrew Wheeler: A.I. art isn't magic. All the elements are taken from real artists who are not compensated. A.I. art is theft.
Don Walker: I see a lot of people trying to tell artists we're not allowed to be angry that AI theft, I mean 'art' is threatening our livelihoods. Sure, it doesn't affect you (and you're probably using it in the dark like a coward). Sit down junior, you're embarrassing yourself.
Joe Wos: At first I hated the whole AI art thing, then after some attempts I realized it just cannot do what I do as far as mazes so I thought, well it's still icky but doesn't affect me. Now I've been able to verify many of my pieces appearing in the AI training database. So now I don't know how to feel about it!
I don't feel threatened by it. but it still feels icky.
Like they asked john Henry to train the steam drill before they replaced him.
Kelly McKernan: It's heckin discouraging to see AI generated images called ""art"" sold for profit while I have to scream into the void to sell a single painting I spent 35 hours on with my actual hands.
No, you are not an artist if you're selecting key words and relying on a program that's trained on actual artwork to create a ""new"" image. Even if you've got minimal PS skills (who doesn't?) and claim it's a paint over and then sell prints. NO. You're profiting off real artists.
No one asked for my consent to train their AI programs on my artwork. No one has offered royalties for every time my name is used for style input. While I firmly believe that AI art generators have a use in concepting and exploring ideas, it's unethical to profit off those images. It's a tool, not a medium, and using it to create ""new"" images does not an artist make.
Maybe this holiday season, give extra love to creators making art with their hands and fill your space with human made creations? Just some thoughts
Tyler Crook: Interesting that Adobe would support and profit from the unlicensed use of artists work to produce AI images but be opposed to the unlicensed use of Adobe software.
Mitch Gerads: All the Ai art profile images look like Lisa Frank got control of your Instagram filters.
Gordon Smuder: I see lots of folks talking about all the new AI art and trotting out the old chestnut, ""Artists have nothing to fear…its just another tool.""
When I was building props for a living, our shop did pretty well. We were making flawless props for still photography ads. There wasn't digital retouching back then, so it had to be perfect IN CAMERA. And we were skilled at it and paid well for those skills.
Then digital retouching came on strong. And it seemed like we were actually getting a little help here and there…our work didn't need to be *quite* so flawless anymore. We were kinda happy with this ""new tool"". It was making our work easier. But what we could charge for our work was slightly diminished.
Eventually, our work got MUCH easier. In fact, our custom props started to be almost secondary. The images of them became the digital fodder for the retouching guys to manipulate in post. Our work was just elements, now. And producers at agencies wanted their budgets to reflect that. They weren't willing to pay out for high quality work anymore. Because they could ""fix it in post"". We were being devalued by ""the tool"".
After that, the ad agencies stopped having us build props altogether. They created their ad campaigns around digitally manipulated stock photos. Props became superfluous and completely digitally rendered images became the vogue. They didn't need to pay us for anything anymore. It was all being built out of zeroes and ones. We were replaced.
And now, those digital artists that replaced us practical prop builders and photographers? Even they are being replaced. Not entirely at this moment, but eventually. That's what experience tells me I see just around the corner.
Producers at agencies will do whatever they can to cut the budget. Thats their purpose. The cheaper they can get whats needed, the more money is retained in-house. If this ""new tool"" gets to the point of refinement that they can rely on the algorithm to generate usable art, dont think for a second they won't cut out human artists altogether. They'll be replaced with a program that will spit out as many iterations of a project as they can feed in parameters for. On whatever schedule the agency wants to impose. An electronic artist that doesn't complain about deadlines or low pay or rights to their artwork or ridiculous client changes.
Go tsk tsk and shake your head all you like. Call me alarmist. But I've been to this dance before. Sure, it's only a tool. A tool that replaces talented humans.
Alex Dingley: i finally have a good excuse to practise drawing hands: can't have people think i use ai
Lilah Sturges: The current crop of ai takes advantage of being at a unique point in history in which a bunch of human-made shit is sitting there free for the taking to build models with. It seems like a free lunch but there ain't no such thing because humans will soon stop preparing the food… I'm not saying ai is bad or useless or necessarily ruinous. What I am saying is that tech that doesn't factor in the human impact of its existence is bound to lead somewhere bad and boneheaded because computers don't understand or care about the consequences of their actions.
José Villarrubia: Like many, many others, I have been playing around privately with new AI software like MidJourney and Stable Diffusion… It's addictive and scary at the same time. But I'm dismayed by fellow pros trying to ""pass"" their obviously computer generated images, wholly or in part, as ""hand painted"" or ""done in Photoshop"". You can totally tell when AI is being used. I feel that this is not helping with what's already a potentially alarming situation for artists…
Elizabeth Sandifer: I find myself thinking—somewhat cruelly, I'll admit—that the artists who are threatened by AI art are largely ones who built an extremely iteration-based career drawing specific categories of objects in a style that would sell, as opposed to ones driven by having something to say
Abraham Josephine Riesman: If you need free art for your newsletter or whatever, f-cking draw something! I don't care if you're not ""an artist""! Everyone can draw crude figures and they're more interesting to look at than this stolen hypersheen AI bullshit. There's likely going to be a WGA strike soon and I f-cking guarantee you there will be scripts written by AI and touched up by scabs
Roger Langridge: I can't get my head around this with AI art: • It composes its ""art"" by trawling for existing art to plagiarise • More and more art on the web is AI art • It ends up plagiarising *itself* more often than not How does it not just become exponentially worse by doing that?
Taylor Esposito: If you come to me with AI art and ask me to letter it, I'm charging you 10 times my rate. Clearly you have money to spend if you used AI art to not pay an artist.
Zan Christensen: All these AI portrait images going by has given me an idea.
Any of my talented art friends wanna do a quick portrait of me? Don't spend more than a few minutes; think of it like a convention sketch. Digital, pencil, ink, watercolor, pick your poison.
What's your commission rate? Check with me first! (I know too many talented folks who deserve big $$$ I may not have for this whim. )
I'll buy ten different ones and post them and write about how awesome you are in the description.









Matt Taylor: Me and @izzyburtonart spent yesterday evening making 100% AI FREE ™ self portraits. I have not painted a self portrait since high school, but it turned out okay I think? (Obviously Izzy is a way better painter than me too)
Clark Bint: How long will it be until we get a film franchise, provably a comic adaptation, based off a hugely successful AI art prompt? Will studios use AI art to test the market on what creates the most buzz and make films based on that? I don't like this potential future. Using AI art prompts to get work made is like being ruled by anxiety – actively skipping the hard parts to get to the point. The emotional ups and mostly downs of creating art is part of the process, and makes you grow as a person as you grow as an artist. Journey not destination
Matthew Southworth: AI art: we're fucked, artists, because a huge segment of the population either can't tell or, even worse, PREFERS auto-tuned vocals.
 
Jason Copland: I'm of the mind that no amount of fighting will stop the use of AI apps. I don't condone it but most people are always going to think of artists and their work as disposable and feel entitled to it in any form/format they want. It's fucking disgusting.
Matthew Southworth: I think so too; especially in an era where attention is increasingly fragmented, many people don't care about the differences
Kirk Lund: I hope and think humans will remain the primary or even exclusive creators of comics. Try to imagine any publisher paying 100 times more $ for pages produced by AI within the next 10-20 years. Someone would also need to invest huge $$$ in developing specialized comic-creating AI. Not likely, especially for a niche industry. Maybe some fancy texturing, coloring, backgrounds or animation options. Some publisher might use AI to help animate scenes from a comic, which I suppose would work best on comics using more dense, decompressed story-telling. I know you guys were discussing ""art"" in general and I tend to focus in on what I like… comics.
Matthew Southworth: Unfortunately, I think it'll hit comics as fast—or faster—than other areas. The money is sooo scarce that artists and publishers are bound to utilize any shortcuts possible. Years ago a certain DAREDEVIL artist was using photo backgrounds run thru a sketch filter & nobody minded. As an art experiment, it was interesting & appropriate for the book. This guy can draw like a sonofabitch, he's very good, but he found ways to get it done super-fast. Most of us have dabbled with 3D backgrounds, etc.; I'm not throwing stones from my Sketchup-designed glass house. But I hope that this may increase a hunger for handmade art in response. Just because we can get cheap furniture from Wal-Mart doesn't mean that's what we WANT in our houses, and I suppose we may find larger groups getting fed up with outlet mall ""art"", too.
Kirk Lund: I really hope I never see the majority of comics made by cylons, and I'd like to think I would be able to tell the difference at 10 paces. But, there is a percentage of comics buyers who never read anything they ""collect"", and that could feed the problem.
Jason Copland: Comics, and art in general, will be fine. People will want to support artist drawn books.
Matthew Southworth: We'll see. Music was devalued by making it into digital ""product"" in the minds of many ppl, and now the economic bottom has fallen out of the recorded music business for all but the verrrry very few; I can imagine a similar trajectory for comics (1/2)
—not to mention prose, when an app that takes prompts (""Teenage girl"" ""fighting Confederacy"" ""time travel"" ""laser sword"") assembles things into fake novels. It's coming. BUT I think there will always be some audience for hand,Ande art. God, I hope so.
Jason Copland: It will be more difficult to make a living but there will always be artist drawn comics that people will seek out and buy.
 JH Williams III: I honestly believe AI art will rise and then fall, eventually wither and die.
Matthew Southworth: I suspect it will survive in some form—but I do think it's sort a fad, too, like when everyone went crazy using that Prisma art filter on photos. Drum machines didn't go away, but people DID a start to understand the diff btw a DM & a real drummer, so that's a good sign.
Kirk Lund: Maybe next gen Siri and Alexa will need an allowance to feed their growing appetite for AI art and comics

This weekend, the Lensa app created by Prisma AI using went viral, a service that encourages you to upload images of your face and then concocts artificial intelligence AI portraits of you with Stable Diffusion in all manner of artistic styles, looks, and themes. It's been around for a while, but it has suddenly become very popular to upload such images as avatars online &ndash; which can then be attacked by those who disapprove of such services.

Aside from AI art criticism in general, taking away from real-life artists and also appropriating people's art and art styles without credit or compensation, there is criticism that the app reverts to sexualisation, and Prisma stated that they both own the work but also get the rights to use the uploaded photos in whatever way they wish. Here's some reaction posted by actual living comic book folk to social media recently.
Reilly Brown: Isn't it illegal for a computer program to just copy and paste code from another computer program? If in the case of AI generated images, visual art is essentially just a different form of programming code, wouldn't using it still be infringement?
Jimmie Robinson: I'm all for new tools in art creation. Even this new realm of text prompt apps. I'm all for people who want to explore and generate content, no matter what their skill level is in art. I'm all for it. I get it. I even want it.
The backlash, even if it's logical, correct and sincere is a waste of time. The cat is out the bag, the genie out the bottle, the milk already spilled.
Not saying people don't have the right to cast their opinion, because I am all for that, too. In fact, I encourage it. New art might emerge from those who rally against this new form. As the lyrics go, ""Your anger is a gift.""
But some of the vitriol I'm reading is asking for the elimination of the tools and apps, as if that will solve the problem they have with it. I won't quote, or name people, because that's not what this post is about.
This is about acceptance.
Art tools have morphed since paintings on cave walls. Nothing is done ""as it used to be"". In this digital era we will see art acceptance morph again. I'm honored to see it happening, just like the early days of photoshop, illustrator, direct-to-plate printing, and online comics. I'm an old fart and I find it fascinating to watch the evolution in real time.
In the 1990s, I recall seeing Scott McCloud stand before a huge room of industry professionals at a Pro/Con event in Oakland, Ca., telling them about the birth and potential of online comics. He was set upon with pitchforks and torches. And yet, here we are&hellip; giving out Eisner Awards to digital comics.
I know it's hard (and for some even alarming) to see change so quickly and broadcast so steadily to millions. But there it is. And it's early days. Kinks, quirks, issues and prompts still need to be ironed out.
But trust me, the day is coming when Ai art will be a standard, not just a gimmick. When sampling data from existing work will be a given with a shrug of the shoulders, no more than using a credit card online or ticking that box about online data and cookies.
So feed the internet with more Batman art for Ai prompts?
Or&hellip; find your art, your style, your vision.
Be unique. Be creative in ways outside the box.
The work will stand out, even if it's sampled.
Art is not mutually exclusive.
We can all play in the same sandbox.
Yes, even if that kid across the way is copying your answers on the test.
We still do the test.

Mike Manley: I have been seeing AI comics now. At first they totally sucked but in the past month I've seen them getting better. And I'm wondering since it's only a matter of months I imagine till it's smart enough to ape any style if fans will care?
If you can have more George Perez comics or John Byrne comics in their style do you care if in the end it might take work from human artists? Choose any artist with a recognizable style.
As far as I can see what you need is the script and a layout person to layout the page and choose the shots. Then you are not interpreting the script but choosing the best example AI gives you for the panel. And a production person for lettering and prepress. Or just do it as a web comic.
It will be able in short order to replicate anyone's style. It already is doing it in illustration. The concept people are good and fucked. If you are not top tier like Moebius or Mead. And again will the consumer care?
I see it as three tiers of consumer. Casual fan. In and out in a few years or watches the average movie. Not a collector.
The next level who is a fan of specific stories or genres. Casual collecting.
Then the Uber fan or fanatic. Collectors. They collect runs, follow specific artists. They might be able in a subset group to know about anatomy or storytelling. Inkers over certain artists etc. buy art.
Will the fan carry a cart of books to have signed at the table of the prompters? AI won't be signing.
So the question becomes will supporters care about getting sketches? "" come back in an hour, give me you prompts"".
Are they just fans of the material or of the creators? We have never been faced with that question.
I feel at least half if not more of people who consume this won't. Maybe 30% will.
Jonathan Matthewson: A.I. Is to art what Autotune is to music.
Salgood Sam: We've been here before even, remember when synths, or remix culture first took off and old school musicians took issue each time with the users of the new tools calling themselves artists or musicians? How well did that age?
Do you still take umbrage at calling people who do remixes and beat tracks from sample artists? How about writers? Instillation artists?
There's a lot of issues around AI that I agree with but I think visual artists are somehow assuming people who've learned how to work the AI via prompt texts &ndash; which having tried I can tell you isn't as simple as you might imagine &ndash; are implying they drew the thing by calling themselves an artist.
There are a LOT of kinds of artists who never draw, or even directly make the raw materials they use but rather assemble and build things. All legitimately artists as well.
AI isn't likely going anywhere, as a working commercial artist in animation for my day job I expect at some point when the tools and it's output are more predictable and controllable, studios will expect designers like me to learn to incorporate it into our workflow.
It's not contrary to some of the toxic claims, going to totally replace humans, just like self checkout lines still need human attendants to deal with shit AI images have lots of issues and need someone who is capable of doing the work when it glitches or breaks down to be on hand.
To be truly independent of humans it would need a working mind of its own and that's simply not going to happen. Takes too much processing power. Like orders of magnitude more than say all the CPU and GPU currently being used by the crypto crowd, just to think and that's one unit. We'll build those eventually but that's NOT going to be used to make art of any kind outside of an experiment any time soon, far too expensive for the margins in the arts.
But the relatively dumb tools are coming, and the people who use them will need a specific skill set to use them well, they already are part of the work flow for all the amazing VFX and digital animation you see.
ALL the hair and water and complex natural things in animation you take for granted these days and bitch about when something like She Hulk is just slightly less convincing? That's all dealt with by dumb algorithmic AI much like the tools being used to make the fantasy art that's taking off now from things like Stable Diffusion.
it's here already.
The people who use those, those that start working fantasy and editorial jobs making images with them? Those people, some of them are going to be seen as and call themselves artists, and I think it's a legit term like it or not.
The issues it represents for other kinds of artists are serious, but mainly they are ones of IP and labor law, not petty shit like who gets to be called an artist.
And factcheck, no it's not plagiarizing work in the learning database, it's using it much the same way my students did when I told them to study past artists and those they admire, as many as you can, to learn how to make good art. The only time you get into plagiarizing territory, both with students and AI, is when they study too few and don't have enough verity in their influence. Think those bots that have been trained to imitate ONE artist specifically, and even branded with their name.
The target of any aggression should not be other workers, but the corporations and governments.
If you're attacking peers using tools, you're being fearful monkeys throwing shit at exactly the wrong people. If it's some poser tech bro being insulting don't go after them for calling themselves an artist, call them out on being a douchebag period.
The companies that try to use this as an excuse to squeeze more content out of people for less money and the governments that don't address automation by installing a proper social safety net and support like UBI, or worse laugh at the idea they should? THEY are the problem. Not the technology and how it's going to change the arts, the commercial arts mainly
Matt Bors: An AI can't beat me. It can decimate weird twitter, punditry, portraiture, concept art. I will outflank it. I'll be drawing bizarre shit, getting outlandish with narrative structures. Stuff it can't piece together in a million years. A human is deranged and this is our magic.
Shane Chebsey: Can I ask a favour please.
Please do not include me in posts of Prompt Generated Imagery or ""AI art"" as it gets called.
I know it's not intentionally an attempt to annoy me, but I just don't want to see it anymore.
It's depressing and borderline offensive to me as an actual artist.
For those not aware, the use of ""AI art"" is plagerism of original art that it sources, and we don't need anymore of this in the artworld IMHO
I appreciate not everyone shares my view on this and I respect that.
Hell as I learn more I may even change my own view.
But until further notice I don't want to see that stuff.
I also understand it's hard to filter me out of your posts.
If you feel it's easier to just unfriend me that's cool. I won't be offended.
I know you're still my friend in the real world
Also I won't police my feed or anything giving shit to anyone who missed this post and I won't repeat this post.
I'm just hoping to get a reduction of it in my feed as it's getting me down.
Bruno Samper / Midjourney
Bruno Samper: On the set of 1984 secret collaboration movie between Jim Henson Studios and HR Giger. (All these images were produced with an AI )
Clydene Nee: Fairly alarming. Here is more artwork generated by Artificial intelligence. I can see why concept and storyboard artist would be extremely concerned.
It was a little disconcerting to see this artwork and to think of HR Giger being replaced by a computer.
Warwick Fraser-Coombe: From now on AI gets a block. Sick of seeing it.
Chip Zdarsky: AI makes it possible for my mother to turn her cat into a handsome renaissance gentleman and then spam me all day with the message ""lol I guess I'm an artist too"" and you're AGAINST that?
Erik Larsen: Here's the thing about AI ""art""&ndash; people are angry at the very idea and understandably so&ndash; it has to potential to adversely effect the livelihood of a lot of creative people.
Can't afford to hire Alex Ross? Well, how about a faux-Alex Ross that will do whatever you tell it to do? And if faux-Alex Ross is out there making comics&ndash; what becomes of the real Alex Ross? Does this harm his career? Does he become watered down by ""imitators?"" Is the real Alex replaced by a fake one every time he turns down a job?
I can see a lawsuit down the road and it's going to get ugly.
And while that aspect is frightening&ndash; I have to admit&ndash; if there were monthly comics which looked like Jack Kirby drew them I'd be all over those.
And then there's this&ndash; aspiring writers have had a problem finding an artist willing to illustrate their amateurish efforts since the dawn of the medium&ndash; AI will allow more people into the tent and let those writers who could never find an artist to still make comics. It has the potential to expand the talent pool by letting those unable to make comics be able to make comics.
And is this all that different from the advent of computer lettering, which put dozens of hand letterers out of work? Why was that okay but this a crime against humanity?
I suspect the vast majority of audience doesn't care as long as the end result is good. Few people REALLY take a moral stance when push comes to shove. Thousands of people who made practical special effects in movies lost their livelihoods with the advent of CGI effects. But we all didn't stop going to the movies in protest.
The crack is going to be when artist-you-know uses AI to draw backgrounds for a project or assist them in some way. It's inevitable. It's going to happen if it hasn't already and then what? Is a comic book with AI backgrounds but hand drawn lead characters going to be the tipping point? Where do we draw the line?
People are VERY angry about it. And I don't want to appear as though I'm taking sides with AI&ndash;but the harsh reality is that the bulk of the audience won't notice or care. Comic book creation is all magic to them anyway.
Mark Brooks: I can sit here and bitch about AI ""art"" while knowing there's really nothing I can do about it or I can see it for what it is and work harder to produce better art that a computer can't replicate. I may die trying but I choose option number two.
David Hine:&nbsp;The machine intelligence doesn't know what a human being looks like yet. It doesn't even know how many digits are on a human hand. It certainly doesn't know who Richard Corben or Salvador Dali were. It doesn't understand the concepts of beauty or the grotesque. That's no reason to dismiss the images it creates as rubbish. It does work incredibly well at producing strange abstract works that to me appear breathtakingly beautiful. These images began with prompting Corben and Dali, to which I added more layers by prompting for gardens, jewels and squid (squid always adds an interesting element &ndash; they don't really have a fixed form anyway) to get a series of amazing landscapes, of which I have included one example here. I'm working at the lowest resolution. The images look good on a phone but will be blurred on a larger screen. I do that for speed. I just want to see what these machines can do, not make reproducible artwork. The third image here is the last created. After adding numerous prompts I removed most of them to shift results from increasing complexity back to a simpler image (though I did keep the squid).
Kody Chamberlain: As a lifelong art fan, I now find myself skimming past most of the art I see online, assuming it's an AI dump. I'm super bummed about this gut reaction, and I'm doing my best to fight it, but it's there.
Adi Granov: A while ago it was NFT, now it's AI art. Why are artists such depressing doommongers?
Photo bashing, mood board collages, etc. have been around forever and used quite frequently on many jobs I've done. Why haven't they replaced designers and artists? Many animals and machines can run faster and jump higher, and be way more precise than people, buy we still watch athletes compete. Why do we prise mechanical watches and pay 100x more than for a far superior quartz?
We're asking the wrong questions. Artists and illustrators could've been replaced decades ago as the technology was there. We are humans and are wired to be impressed by human achievements as they fit within our own frame of reference and emotion. Emotion is the only key factor. Were it not so the only music around today would be made by computers, but somehow we still enjoy good playing and singing.
Andrew Wheeler: A.I. art isn't magic. All the elements are taken from real artists who are not compensated. A.I. art is theft.
Don Walker: I see a lot of people trying to tell artists we're not allowed to be angry that AI theft, I mean 'art' is threatening our livelihoods. Sure, it doesn't affect you (and you're probably using it in the dark like a coward). Sit down junior, you're embarrassing yourself.
Joe Wos: At first I hated the whole AI art thing, then after some attempts I realized it just cannot do what I do as far as mazes so I thought, well it's still icky but doesn't affect me. Now I've been able to verify many of my pieces appearing in the AI training database. So now I don't know how to feel about it!
I don't feel threatened by it. but it still feels icky.
Like they asked john Henry to train the steam drill before they replaced him.
Kelly McKernan: It's heckin discouraging to see AI generated images called ""art"" sold for profit while I have to scream into the void to sell a single painting I spent 35 hours on with my actual hands.
No, you are not an artist if you're selecting key words and relying on a program that's trained on actual artwork to create a ""new"" image. Even if you've got minimal PS skills (who doesn't?) and claim it's a paint over and then sell prints. NO. You're profiting off real artists.
No one asked for my consent to train their AI programs on my artwork. No one has offered royalties for every time my name is used for style input. While I firmly believe that AI art generators have a use in concepting and exploring ideas, it's unethical to profit off those images. It's a tool, not a medium, and using it to create ""new"" images does not an artist make.
Maybe this holiday season, give extra love to creators making art with their hands and fill your space with human made creations? Just some thoughts
Tyler Crook: Interesting that Adobe would support and profit from the unlicensed use of artists work to produce AI images but be opposed to the unlicensed use of Adobe software.
Mitch Gerads: All the Ai art profile images look like Lisa Frank got control of your Instagram filters.
Gordon Smuder: I see lots of folks talking about all the new AI art and trotting out the old chestnut, ""Artists have nothing to fear&hellip;its just another tool.""
When I was building props for a living, our shop did pretty well. We were making flawless props for still photography ads. There wasn't digital retouching back then, so it had to be perfect IN CAMERA. And we were skilled at it and paid well for those skills.
Then digital retouching came on strong. And it seemed like we were actually getting a little help here and there&hellip;our work didn't need to be *quite* so flawless anymore. We were kinda happy with this ""new tool"". It was making our work easier. But what we could charge for our work was slightly diminished.
Eventually, our work got MUCH easier. In fact, our custom props started to be almost secondary. The images of them became the digital fodder for the retouching guys to manipulate in post. Our work was just elements, now. And producers at agencies wanted their budgets to reflect that. They weren't willing to pay out for high quality work anymore. Because they could ""fix it in post"". We were being devalued by ""the tool"".
After that, the ad agencies stopped having us build props altogether. They created their ad campaigns around digitally manipulated stock photos. Props became superfluous and completely digitally rendered images became the vogue. They didn't need to pay us for anything anymore. It was all being built out of zeroes and ones. We were replaced.
And now, those digital artists that replaced us practical prop builders and photographers? Even they are being replaced. Not entirely at this moment, but eventually. That's what experience tells me I see just around the corner.
Producers at agencies will do whatever they can to cut the budget. Thats their purpose. The cheaper they can get whats needed, the more money is retained in-house. If this ""new tool"" gets to the point of refinement that they can rely on the algorithm to generate usable art, dont think for a second they won't cut out human artists altogether. They'll be replaced with a program that will spit out as many iterations of a project as they can feed in parameters for. On whatever schedule the agency wants to impose. An electronic artist that doesn't complain about deadlines or low pay or rights to their artwork or ridiculous client changes.
Go tsk tsk and shake your head all you like. Call me alarmist. But I've been to this dance before. Sure, it's only a tool. A tool that replaces talented humans.
Alex Dingley: i finally have a good excuse to practise drawing hands: can't have people think i use ai
Lilah Sturges: The current crop of ai takes advantage of being at a unique point in history in which a bunch of human-made shit is sitting there free for the taking to build models with. It seems like a free lunch but there ain't no such thing because humans will soon stop preparing the food&hellip; I'm not saying ai is bad or useless or necessarily ruinous. What I am saying is that tech that doesn't factor in the human impact of its existence is bound to lead somewhere bad and boneheaded because computers don't understand or care about the consequences of their actions.
Jos&eacute; Villarrubia: Like many, many others, I have been playing around privately with new AI software like MidJourney and Stable Diffusion&hellip; It's addictive and scary at the same time. But I'm dismayed by fellow pros trying to ""pass"" their obviously computer generated images, wholly or in part, as ""hand painted"" or ""done in Photoshop"". You can totally tell when AI is being used. I feel that this is not helping with what's already a potentially alarming situation for artists&hellip;
Elizabeth Sandifer: I find myself thinking&mdash;somewhat cruelly, I'll admit&mdash;that the artists who are threatened by AI art are largely ones who built an extremely iteration-based career drawing specific categories of objects in a style that would sell, as opposed to ones driven by having something to say
Abraham Josephine Riesman: If you need free art for your newsletter or whatever, f-cking draw something! I don't care if you're not ""an artist""! Everyone can draw crude figures and they're more interesting to look at than this stolen hypersheen AI bullshit. There's likely going to be a WGA strike soon and I f-cking guarantee you there will be scripts written by AI and touched up by scabs
Roger Langridge: I can't get my head around this with AI art: &bull; It composes its ""art"" by trawling for existing art to plagiarise &bull; More and more art on the web is AI art &bull; It ends up plagiarising *itself* more often than not How does it not just become exponentially worse by doing that?
Taylor Esposito: If you come to me with AI art and ask me to letter it, I'm charging you 10 times my rate. Clearly you have money to spend if you used AI art to not pay an artist.
Zan Christensen: All these AI portrait images going by has given me an idea.
Any of my talented art friends wanna do a quick portrait of me? Don't spend more than a few minutes; think of it like a convention sketch. Digital, pencil, ink, watercolor, pick your poison.
What's your commission rate? Check with me first! (I know too many talented folks who deserve big $$$ I may not have for this whim. )
I'll buy ten different ones and post them and write about how awesome you are in the description.

Matt Taylor: Me and @izzyburtonart spent yesterday evening making 100% AI FREE &trade; self portraits. I have not painted a self portrait since high school, but it turned out okay I think? (Obviously Izzy is a way better painter than me too)
Clark Bint: How long will it be until we get a film franchise, provably a comic adaptation, based off a hugely successful AI art prompt? Will studios use AI art to test the market on what creates the most buzz and make films based on that? I don't like this potential future. Using AI art prompts to get work made is like being ruled by anxiety &ndash; actively skipping the hard parts to get to the point. The emotional ups and mostly downs of creating art is part of the process, and makes you grow as a person as you grow as an artist. Journey not destination
Matthew Southworth: AI art: we're fucked, artists, because a huge segment of the population either can't tell or, even worse, PREFERS auto-tuned vocals.
&nbsp;
Jason Copland: I'm of the mind that no amount of fighting will stop the use of AI apps. I don't condone it but most people are always going to think of artists and their work as disposable and feel entitled to it in any form/format they want. It's fucking disgusting.
Matthew Southworth: I think so too; especially in an era where attention is increasingly fragmented, many people don't care about the differences
Kirk Lund: I hope and think humans will remain the primary or even exclusive creators of comics. Try to imagine any publisher paying 100 times more $ for pages produced by AI within the next 10-20 years. Someone would also need to invest huge $$$ in developing specialized comic-creating AI. Not likely, especially for a niche industry. Maybe some fancy texturing, coloring, backgrounds or animation options. Some publisher might use AI to help animate scenes from a comic, which I suppose would work best on comics using more dense, decompressed story-telling. I know you guys were discussing ""art"" in general and I tend to focus in on what I like&hellip; comics.
Matthew Southworth: Unfortunately, I think it'll hit comics as fast&mdash;or faster&mdash;than other areas. The money is sooo scarce that artists and publishers are bound to utilize any shortcuts possible. Years ago a certain DAREDEVIL artist was using photo backgrounds run thru a sketch filter &amp; nobody minded. As an art experiment, it was interesting &amp; appropriate for the book. This guy can draw like a sonofabitch, he's very good, but he found ways to get it done super-fast. Most of us have dabbled with 3D backgrounds, etc.; I'm not throwing stones from my Sketchup-designed glass house.&nbsp;But I hope that this may increase a hunger for handmade art in response. Just because we can get cheap furniture from Wal-Mart doesn't mean that's what we WANT in our houses, and I suppose we may find larger groups getting fed up with outlet mall ""art"", too.
Kirk Lund: I really hope I never see the majority of comics made by cylons, and I'd like to think I would be able to tell the difference at 10 paces. But, there is a percentage of comics buyers who never read anything they ""collect"", and that could feed the problem.
Jason Copland: Comics, and art in general, will be fine. People will want to support artist drawn books.
Matthew Southworth: We'll see. Music was devalued by making it into digital ""product"" in the minds of many ppl, and now the economic bottom has fallen out of the recorded music business for all but the verrrry very few; I can imagine a similar trajectory for comics (1/2)
&mdash;not to mention prose, when an app that takes prompts (""Teenage girl"" ""fighting Confederacy"" ""time travel"" ""laser sword"") assembles things into fake novels. It's coming. BUT I think there will always be some audience for hand,Ande art. God, I hope so.
Jason Copland: It will be more difficult to make a living but there will always be artist drawn comics that people will seek out and buy.
&nbsp;JH Williams III: I honestly believe AI art will rise and then fall, eventually wither and die.
Matthew Southworth: I suspect it will survive in some form&mdash;but I do think it's sort a fad, too, like when everyone went crazy using that Prisma art filter on photos. Drum machines didn't go away, but people DID a start to understand the diff btw a DM &amp; a real drummer, so that's a good sign.
Kirk Lund: Maybe next gen Siri and Alexa will need an allowance to feed their growing appetite for AI art and comics

At some point, she gets the familiar itch to check her email: She can’t think of what to write next. She stares at the screen. She’s lost her words. She could bang her head against the wall, or maybe turn to a favorite book for inspiration, or lose her momentum to distraction. But instead she turns to an AI writing tool, which takes in her chapter so far and spits out some potential next paragraphs. These paragraphs are never quite what she wants, though they sometimes contain beautiful sentences or fascinating directions. (Once it suggested a character sings a song, and also generated the lyrics of the song.) Even when these paragraphs fail, they make her interested in the story again. She’s curious about this computer-generated text, and it reignites her interest in her own writing.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.With the advent of high quality computer-generated text, writers suddenly have a half-decent writing buddy who at least wants to do what they ask (even if it doesn’t always succeed) and has no desire to take any credit. Never before could writers get paragraphs of fluent text on a topic of their choice, except from another writer. (Ghostwriting may be an appropriate analogy for these writerly use cases of AI.) This is posing questions to writers everywhere: Which parts of writing are so tedious you’d be happy to see them go? Which parts bring you the inexplicable joy of creating something from nothing? And what is it about writing you hold most dear? AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTI’ve spent the past five years working with computer-generated text systems as part of my PhD work in human-AI interaction, and talking to writers about how they do—or do not—want to incorporate them into their practice. The woman above, working on her fantasy novel, is based on a woman I interviewed as part of a study on the social dynamics of writers requesting and incorporating support from computers.Featured VideoScam Fighters Answer Scam Questions From TwitterIt’s useful to think about three different parts of writing: planning, drafting, and revising. I consider these to be parts, and not stages, of writing; they are cognitive processes involved in writing, such that planning can occur at the beginning but also middle and even end of a writing project. By thinking through specific parts of writing, we can understand in more detail how computers will end up affecting writing as a whole. This exploration will not only help us understand the future of writing, but also help us create the kind of future we’re happy to live in.Let’s go back to the writer working on her first novel. She was happy to let a computer push her through writer’s block. But she was adamant that crafting the plot line was fundamentally human. The plot was the story she wanted to tell. This is where she felt her intention lay, what she workshopped and worked over. Other writers agree with her; there is a kind of problem-solving involved with figuring out where a story or poem or essay is going, and many writers feel they are uniquely positioned to solve such problems.But an AI writing system proposing a potential solution can be seen as a challenge, where the computer’s ideas would represent a low bar that the writer must improve on, a first step toward crafting an even better solution. One writer I interviewed was working on a TV pilot script. She was told, when it comes to TV and comedy, “If you feel like turning right, turn left.” Her writing had to be uniquely original, because people have seen so much TV already. No matter how good a computer-generated line of dialog might be, she felt she would always have to be better. She imagined using an AI writing system that would finish a scene for her, and then she’d know there would be something more unexpected and insightful she would have to find. Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenStill, in many cases, letting a computer impact the direction of a project, rather than craft a few choice sentences, can feel like giving the computer the reins when really, you want to feel in charge. Planning can also be enjoyable. Planning—and I include processes like figuring out plot points, endings, and openings, as well as any kind of activity on a higher level than actually writing—is something many writers consider the tricky, intellectual, and interesting part of their work, a part that feels uniquely human. Figuring out how a poem should end is difficult, but there are some difficult things we enjoy doing. The achievement of landing the end of a scene may only come from struggling to do it yourself.AdvertisementWhat about the tricky act of getting words on the page? In cognitive psychology research, this is often called “translating,” because we’re translating amorphous ideas into discrete words. Most writers, or really most people who have to write, know the feeling of a mind gone blank. The average writer trains themselves out of this fear, but no matter how many times you’ve put words on the page, you’re bound to encounter that moment when you don’t know what comes next. This is literally the task most computer systems are trained to do: predict what comes next. The role of AI writing systems as drafting buddies is a big departure from how writers typically get help, yet so far it is their biggest selling point and use case. Most writing tools available today will do some drafting for you, either by continuing where you left off or responding to a more specific instruction. SudoWrite, a popular AI writing tool for novelists, does all of these, with options to “write” where you left off, “describe” a highlighted noun, or “brainstorm” ideas based on a situation you describe. Systems like Jasper.ai or Lex will complete your paragraph or draft copy based on instructions, and Laika is similar but more focused on fiction and drama. These tools are good and getting better; an AI writing system is drawing on more text than any one person can read, and its ability to lean into the unexpected can be perfect for writers looking to make their writing feel more fresh. Computer-generated text has been likened to automatic writing, or a well-read but deranged parrot, giving it abilities almost tangential to those of human writers, perhaps even complementary abilities.Yet it’s interesting that so many AI writing systems are created to finish our sentence, or predict our next one, because when I’ve talked to writers about what they typically want help with, no one ever talks about asking a person to write for them. This isn’t the way writers typically interact with people when it comes to their work, even though it’s what computers are best at, and are mostly being used for right now. While some writers are eager to get sentences on demand, others are hesitant to let an external entity choose their words. As several writers told me, once something is on the page, it’s just a little bit harder to imagine anything else. This is one reason many writers don’t like to get feedback early on in a project; the work is too delicate, they need to shore up the idea such that others can see its potential. A computer, while not explicitly bringing its own intention, can disrupt the writer’s intention. And other writers simply take pride in sitting down and pumping out a thousand words. It’s like exercise. You need to keep it up, otherwise your skills atrophy.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenWith so much focus on creation, few systems consider revision. Revision—this is where the average writer gets the most outside help. Barely any commercial systems have proposed generating feedback as a meaningful use of AI, but that may change as we discover how such technology, which is so good at finishing your sentences, can also generate interesting questions about your work. So while this technology isn’t quite at the forefront of our minds right now, I think it will be.A computational perspective on your work is an old idea dating back to early research on statistics in language, using the frequency of words like the and with to discover authorial fingerprints in essays. But new technologies will sound more like a person, able to note that you’ve introduced a new term without properly defining it, or perhaps describe why a scene might be moving too slowly. Most writers are eager to get eyes on their work, and a computational eye may feel less frightening than your best friend; the computer might judge you, but not in a way that’ll impact your future relationship with it. Some writers think workshopping with a computer might be akin to talking to yourself, in that it’s private and feels internal, that it might not feel like someone else is in the room. Computers may become early-stage editors, giving writers an ability to get feedback before showing their work to someone more important.But writers are also bound to mistrust computers because, after all, where is the computer coming from? We can stand all manner of sin when it comes to feedback as long as we can contextualize that the feedback is coming from that professor who never liked our work, or our friend who is always positive, or an editor with decades of experience. It will take some time for us to understand what the computer really brings and how often, or in what situations, we should trust it. Writers I have talked to worry about the normativity of AI writing systems, that they will reflect a straight white male perspective, but also fear a system attempting to represent another particular perspective that may lead to tokenization and stereotyping. In this way, computers will be in a bind, but system designers may find ways to bring context to a computer without needing to liken it to a person or identity group.I want to come back to this idea of what we hold most dear, and the human nature of writing. It’s easy to be for or against including computer-generated text in your work, but I predict the conversation will get much more nuanced as we encounter the various ways computers can impact our writing. Writers want to protect their authenticity and intention. It may be useful to think of computer-generated text as dancing with the writer’s text. Most writers aren’t against collaboration. They just want to be in control of their own dance. As long as the computer can match the writer’s footwork, writers are happy to let a computer contribute to the performance. But the moment the computer steps on the writer’s toes, writers may get spooked. A plot point here, a stunning sentence there, an editorial comment that pushes the writer a little further; no one task is off the table. But when a computer ends up changing what the writer set out to achieve, writers may start to wonder whether their vision is getting muddied by an entity that lacks any experience with the real world.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenMy hope is that computer-generated text gives more people the chance to say what they want to say, to enact their own vision, whether that be through a system helping them with planning, drafting, revising, or something else entirely. I don’t think we’ll be seeing fully computer-generated books out-competing human authors any time soon—not because computers won’t be capable (though perhaps also that), but because I think we will, for a long time, be far more interested in what a person has to say.It’s also worth reflecting on computer-generated text from the perspective of a reader. When will computers start to interfere with our sense that a person, and not a machine, had something to tell us? It may be that readers, not writers, draw the line on what’s acceptable, but we haven’t gone far enough to have to make that decision. We may get there in this century, and we’re going to need to ask ourselves what about communicative intent is so important. If I have an idea for a novel, but the computer writes most of it, is it still my story? This question will not be answered with numbers about how many words I or the computer wrote. It’s going to be answered culturally; it’s going to be a feeling we have about where authenticity or truth really lies. But thinking more concretely about where computers can get involved will help us answer this question, and make sure we answer it in a way that respects what we really value about writing.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterScienceYour weekly roundup of the best stories on health care, the climate crisis, genetic engineering, robotics, space, and more.

Planning—and I include processes like figuring out plot points, endings, and openings, as well as any kind of activity on a higher level than actually writing—is something many writers consider the tricky, intellectual, and interesting part of their work, a part that feels uniquely human. Figuring out how a poem should end is difficult, but there are some difficult things we enjoy doing. The achievement of landing the end of a scene may only come from struggling to do it yourself.
What about the tricky act of getting words on the page? In cognitive psychology research, this is often called “translating,” because we’re translating amorphous ideas into discrete words. Most writers, or really most people who have to write, know the feeling of a mind gone blank. The average writer trains themselves out of this fear, but no matter how many times you’ve put words on the page, you’re bound to encounter that moment when you don’t know what comes next. This is literally the task most computer systems are trained to do: predict what comes next.
The role of AI writing systems as drafting buddies is a big departure from how writers typically get help, yet so far it is their biggest selling point and use case. Most writing tools available today will do some drafting for you, either by continuing where you left off or responding to a more specific instruction. SudoWrite, a popular AI writing tool for novelists, does all of these, with options to “write” where you left off, “describe” a highlighted noun, or “brainstorm” ideas based on a situation you describe. Systems like Jasper.ai or Lex will complete your paragraph or draft copy based on instructions, and Laika is similar but more focused on fiction and drama.
These tools are good and getting better; an AI writing system is drawing on more text than any one person can read, and its ability to lean into the unexpected can be perfect for writers looking to make their writing feel more fresh. Computer-generated text has been likened to automatic writing, or a well-read but deranged parrot, giving it abilities almost tangential to those of human writers, perhaps even complementary abilities.
Yet it’s interesting that so many AI writing systems are created to finish our sentence, or predict our next one, because when I’ve talked to writers about what they typically want help with, no one ever talks about asking a person to write for them. This isn’t the way writers typically interact with people when it comes to their work, even though it’s what computers are best at, and are mostly being used for right now. While some writers are eager to get sentences on demand, others are hesitant to let an external entity choose their words. As several writers told me, once something is on the page, it’s just a little bit harder to imagine anything else. This is one reason many writers don’t like to get feedback early on in a project; the work is too delicate, they need to shore up the idea such that others can see its potential. A computer, while not explicitly bringing its own intention, can disrupt the writer’s intention. And other writers simply take pride in sitting down and pumping out a thousand words. It’s like exercise. You need to keep it up, otherwise your skills atrophy.
With so much focus on creation, few systems consider revision. Revision—this is where the average writer gets the most outside help. Barely any commercial systems have proposed generating feedback as a meaningful use of AI, but that may change as we discover how such technology, which is so good at finishing your sentences, can also generate interesting questions about your work. So while this technology isn’t quite at the forefront of our minds right now, I think it will be.
A computational perspective on your work is an old idea dating back to early research on statistics in language, using the frequency of words like the and with to discover authorial fingerprints in essays. But new technologies will sound more like a person, able to note that you’ve introduced a new term without properly defining it, or perhaps describe why a scene might be moving too slowly. Most writers are eager to get eyes on their work, and a computational eye may feel less frightening than your best friend; the computer might judge you, but not in a way that’ll impact your future relationship with it. Some writers think workshopping with a computer might be akin to talking to yourself, in that it’s private and feels internal, that it might not feel like someone else is in the room. Computers may become early-stage editors, giving writers an ability to get feedback before showing their work to someone more important.
But writers are also bound to mistrust computers because, after all, where is the computer coming from? We can stand all manner of sin when it comes to feedback as long as we can contextualize that the feedback is coming from that professor who never liked our work, or our friend who is always positive, or an editor with decades of experience. It will take some time for us to understand what the computer really brings and how often, or in what situations, we should trust it. Writers I have talked to worry about the normativity of AI writing systems, that they will reflect a straight white male perspective, but also fear a system attempting to represent another particular perspective that may lead to tokenization and stereotyping. In this way, computers will be in a bind, but system designers may find ways to bring context to a computer without needing to liken it to a person or identity group.
I want to come back to this idea of what we hold most dear, and the human nature of writing. It’s easy to be for or against including computer-generated text in your work, but I predict the conversation will get much more nuanced as we encounter the various ways computers can impact our writing. Writers want to protect their authenticity and intention. It may be useful to think of computer-generated text as dancing with the writer’s text. Most writers aren’t against collaboration. They just want to be in control of their own dance. As long as the computer can match the writer’s footwork, writers are happy to let a computer contribute to the performance. But the moment the computer steps on the writer’s toes, writers may get spooked. A plot point here, a stunning sentence there, an editorial comment that pushes the writer a little further; no one task is off the table. But when a computer ends up changing what the writer set out to achieve, writers may start to wonder whether their vision is getting muddied by an entity that lacks any experience with the real world.
My hope is that computer-generated text gives more people the chance to say what they want to say, to enact their own vision, whether that be through a system helping them with planning, drafting, revising, or something else entirely. I don’t think we’ll be seeing fully computer-generated books out-competing human authors any time soon—not because computers won’t be capable (though perhaps also that), but because I think we will, for a long time, be far more interested in what a person has to say.
It’s also worth reflecting on computer-generated text from the perspective of a reader. When will computers start to interfere with our sense that a person, and not a machine, had something to tell us? It may be that readers, not writers, draw the line on what’s acceptable, but we haven’t gone far enough to have to make that decision. We may get there in this century, and we’re going to need to ask ourselves what about communicative intent is so important. If I have an idea for a novel, but the computer writes most of it, is it still my story? This question will not be answered with numbers about how many words I or the computer wrote. It’s going to be answered culturally; it’s going to be a feeling we have about where authenticity or truth really lies. But thinking more concretely about where computers can get involved will help us answer this question, and make sure we answer it in a way that respects what we really value about writing.",,,,,,,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/638950f41857496878b1b1eb/3:2/w_2025,h_1350,c_limit/artificial-intelligence-human-writing.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Guidance resource
The Actuaries Institute and the Australian Human Rights Commission have partnered to produce this Guidance Resource on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Discrimination in Insurance Pricing and Underwriting (the Guidance Resource).
AI promises faster and more intelligent decision-making. However, the use of AI carries with it certain risks, including the risk of discrimination.
Discrimination in AI
At the federal level, unlawful discrimination is prohibited by several key pieces of legislation. Yet there is recognition in most of these pieces of legislation that discrimination by insurers will not be unlawful in certain circumstances, broadly when it is reasonable and based on actuarial or statistical data. 
The Guidance Resource provides information on:

the key pieces of legislation
the risks of discrimination arising from the use of AI
how to mitigate these risks.

The Guidance Resource provides practical guidance for insurers on complying with the relevant legislation, as addressed in the resource, when using AI for insurance pricing and underwriting.

Home  Industry  Technology UAE: MoHRE launches automated system for employment contracts
In the first two days of the launch, more than 35,000 contracts have been completed

December 6, 2022 















































 
The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has launched an automated system to complete employment contracts without human intervention.
In the first two days of the launch, more than 35,000 contracts have been completed. These include new and renewed employment contracts that were approved following signature verification.
“The new system utilises advanced technologies to process and verify images, which reduces the duration per transaction from two days to just 30 minutes, while also minimising human error,” the ministry said.

 
In October 2017, the UAE Cabinet adopted the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence with the aim of enhancing government performance, accelerating transactions, and developing innovative working environments. The strategy will also focus on making the UAE government the first in the world to invest in artificial intelligence across vital sectors and provide 100 percent of its first-line services through AI.
In line with the UAE Centennial 2071 objectives, this strategy will serve as a foundation for future services and infrastructure in the UAE, a statement said.
MoHRE has adopted several technologies such as the awareness programme via the self-guidance service, the WhatsApp channel, the smart mobile app, the smart communication framework, the Nafis platform and the open data policy.
Customers can use the awareness programme for the self-guidance service via the ministry’s smart mobile app, which also provides more than 100 of the ministry’s services, powered by artificial intelligence and big data.
The ministry has also developed the smart communications system to become the first government entity to implement it proactively. It completes digital transactions with a remote work system and provides e-services around the clock. The system has smart features that allow checking attachments and transaction data.

Robots Become Racist And Sexist Bigots Due To Flawed AI, Study Says
SCREENGRAB: DISCORD
The topic of artificially generated art (AI art) has been making waves within the tech and art industries as the growing popularity of the auto-generated pictures raise concerns for the threat to the authenticity of art. If you've been on social media lately, you have probably witnessed all the pretty auto-generated pictures that have been circulating like wildfire on apps like Instagram and Twitter. While interesting from a tech standpoint, people forget the ethical implications of using this kind of software: Where does the data come from? AI-generated data function by pulling samples of art from the internet and the images that are generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is based on user text prompts and common keywords that can be used by literally anyone, which raises the questions is it ethical, plagiarism, and infringing upon artists rights?While AI art is not necessarily a new development, many new AI art programs such as Dream, Night Cafe and Midjourney have become increasingly popular. The viral Lensa App “Magic Avatar,” and  DALL-E Mini saw traffic skyrocket with unique avatars or funny renditions that look like they were created by an actual digital artist. Additionally, the quality of AI art has exceedingly improved generating better results. Unfortunately these apps are making a profit while the works of millions of artists are available online for free for these programs to use without the artists’ consent. It all began with the release of DALL-E 2, an improved AI art program from OpenAI.The program allowed users to input text descriptions and produce images that users considered amazing, adorable, or incredibly strange.Why would using this type of software be a problem ?Well not every image on the internet is public domain, and the images being used for these algorithms are directly reused in its output. This is extremely frustrating to professional artists, as the works of millions of artists are available online for free for these software to use their work without their consent. Another underlying issue is the fact that anyone can simply type in a prompt and make AI-generated work, a huge job security concern for human artists already struggling in a difficult field to make a living in.

It’s all fun and games until people start selling these AI as works of their own - “artwork” presented as original creations in art contests, museums etc., or have the audacity to bully actual artists for their rightful concerns and frustrations with the emerging tech. Copying by AI was not consented to by the artists, and despite the booming tech industry, there’s a lack of compensation for legitimate artists.Users can create all kinds of “artwork” with just a few key words, including some that are clearly evocative of the works of countless artists. Users can literally invoke those artists by simply typing “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. The current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases, with millions of users flocking to text-to-image AI systems. They have already been used to create magazine covers, news stories, experimental films, advertising campaigns and more, which is troublesome to human artists, designers, and journalists. There have already been cases of images generated with an AI system winning awards and competitions sparking backlash and an uproar among artists, which we’ll delve into further in a bit.What exactly is AI ART?AI art refers to art generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence. AI is a field of computer science that focuses on building machines that mimic human intelligence or even simulate the human brain through a set of algorithms. Programs like Midjourney, Night Cafe, and DALL – E 2 are art generators that create art based on the prompts that have been given, basically you describe something in a sentence - it goes to the bot, the bot sources and analyzes numerous images, and out comes a result, sometimes in seconds. The generators use algorithms that analyze thousands of art pieces from different artists, in order to create unique works through specific rules through which machines analyze thousands of images to comprehend a particular creation process, like a specific style or aesthetic. The algorithms then generate novel forms, shapes, figures, and patterns to produce new works. Besides machines, AI artists also collaborate with creative coders, statisticians, computer scientists, and neuroscientists to build machines that push the boundaries of human creativity.Example of AI-generated art made with WOMBO Dream
Prompt Cornfield at sunset wombo.art
wombo.art
What is the purpose of using AI in art?Companies and enthusiasts try to market it as “Expanding human creativity” but in reality AI should not be used in place of Art, but instead used as a tool for reference. Some artists and designers have actually embraced the power of these tools. Some illustrators and visual artists use AI tools to generate ideas, gather inspiration, and experiment. While AI-generated art does inspire creativity, and enthusiasm, as it approaches mass consumption, it becomes an enormous question of ethics and becomes a huge disruption in creative industries.“It can be a beneficial utility for creative industries. It’s already used in various industries, such as advertising, marketing, gaming, architecture, fashion, graphic design, and product design. This Twitter thread provides a variety of use cases, from commerce to the medical imaging domain.” - TECH DIRTWhere is the data coming from?Many artists and industry professionals have been taking to Twitter and other social platforms to express their outrage about the controversial tech, and hopefully expose some of the harsh truths to a broader audience.
The generators for these AI software analyze thousands of images, paintings and other sources of art in order to create these “unique works.” In an interview with a multimedia reporter, Jim Ovelmen, an animation professor at Cal State LA, who has used AI art programs like Midjourney expressed his apprehension.“Another thing that bothered me was that in some of the AI-generated stuff, you could actually see the signature,” said Ovelmen. “The fact you can see someone’s signature in the echochamber of all the thousands of images it’s creating means it was somehow sampled by some individual artist’s signature.” The issue with how the algorithms take from thousands of artists’ works and how crediting comes into play is another part of the AI art debate.A student breaks it down it layman’s terms: “It’s kind of like a booklet of all these artists that showcase their arts, and then you start cutting those pieces out and just putting it on one collage,” said Felix Mach, a third-year animation major. “The machine has this huge collection of pieces from other artists, and it’s hard for you to credit those artists because it’s just from a library.”
Why is using AI Art controversial?There needs to be a much stricter regulation of AI art programs, especially when it comes to what sources they are allowed to pull sample data from, and how the works the programs generate may be used in a commercial capacity. In theory the apps aren’t harmful per se, and  as mentioned above there can be beneficial applications for it in creative fields. However, taking artwork from creators to use as data without permission and allowing anyone who can simply type a sentence to steal aspects of artists’ work for their own gain is ethically and irresponsible. Artificial intelligence should help artists, not steal their work and hurt their career prospects. Many artists have spent countless hours in education, practice and mastering skills in order to create artwork based off their dedication and knowledge. Putting words into a machine to generate pictures off of someone's work is insulting on so many levels. As it stands, many artists have already expressed their genuine concern over the possibility that AI can replace human artists. While some may see this fear as an “exaggeration,” it could all be alleviated by practical regulations and responsible practices if these AI developers cared enough. It’s extremely worrisome that anyone - having no skill, talent, experience, or drive whatsoever can simply enter a prompt and profit from it. Programs such as Starryai -(Generate art _ simply by describing what you want to see and our Artificial Intelligence transforms your words into art) - advertise that users will have full ownership of any images generated using their program and that they can use those images for commercial purposes. Essentially this means that anyone who enters a sufficiently descriptive prompt can profit off an image that was generated using the work of artists who were not asked for permission or paid for their work. While humans are directly using the software, they are not doing the actual creation, drawing, or painting of the work themselves. This brings up the questions of authorship and plagiarism when AI work is being published and submitted and not properly disclosed as such.
Detrimental to human artist According to an article from CNN, a number of artists found out their work was used to train AI and they are furious. Erin Hanson, a McMinnville, Oregon,based artist is one of many professional artists whose work was included in the data that was essentially used to train Stable Diffusion, the London-based Stability AI. She’s one of the several artists that were interviewed by CNN Business, and were unhappy to learn that pictures of their work were used without being informed for consent, or paying for their use. Another artist Danger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professionals that told CNN Business “they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.” Danger goes on to say - “Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.” A name known well to many in the comic convention community, Tara McPherson, the Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films, ""is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.
AI art is being banned in some art communitiesAI Aart is being banned from some art communities as website are being flooded with generative pics according to an article from Stealth Optical. Communities are “performing sweeping bans” as “Small art communities such as Newgrounds, Fur Affinity and more are fighting against the generative content being uploaded online.” The article goes on to express how established artist who are already finding it difficult to make ends meet in the modern gig community gig have to deal with the growing AI issue. “AI-powered artwork is pushing some artists away in favour of automation. Even if it isn’t always perfect.”An AI won an art contest infuriating artistsOne of the biggest ethical controversies over AI is the submission of AI generated work being submitted for contests. An AI won an art contest, and artists are furious according to CNN Business. In August, a game designer sparked controversy after his artificial-intelligence- generated art piece - Theatre D’opera Spatial image won the top spot at a competition in the United States with critics calling the win a threat to human artists everywhere. Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition, beating more than a dozen other entries. The win sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”
While AI-generated art inspires creativity, and enthusiasm, it can have detrimental affects on the human art community. As it reaches the masses it can suffer many consequences, some of which can be flat out terrifying. Changes and regulations need to be assessed now.

If you've been on social media lately, you have probably witnessed all the pretty auto-generated pictures that have been circulating like wildfire on apps like Instagram and Twitter. While interesting from a tech standpoint, people forget the ethical implications of using this kind of software: Where does the data come from? AI-generated data function by pulling samples of art from the internet and the images that are generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is based on user text prompts and common keywords that can be used by literally anyone, which raises the questions is it ethical, plagiarism, and infringing upon artists rights?&nbsp;While AI art is not necessarily a new development, many new AI art programs such as Dream, Night Cafe and Midjourney have become increasingly popular. The viral Lensa App &ldquo;Magic Avatar,&rdquo; and &nbsp;DALL-E Mini saw traffic skyrocket with unique avatars or funny renditions that look like they were created by an actual digital artist. Additionally, the quality of AI art has exceedingly improved generating better results. Unfortunately these apps are making a profit while the works of millions of artists are available online for free for these programs to use without the artists&rsquo; consent. It all began with the release of DALL-E 2, an improved AI art program from OpenAI.The program allowed users to input text descriptions and produce images that users considered amazing, adorable, or incredibly strange.Why would using this type of software be a problem ?Well not every image on the internet is public domain, and the images being used for these algorithms are directly reused in its output. This is extremely frustrating to professional artists, as the works of millions of artists are available online for free for these software to use their work without their consent. Another underlying issue is the fact that anyone can simply type in a prompt and make AI-generated work, a huge job security concern for human artists already struggling in a difficult field to make a living in.It&rsquo;s all fun and games until people start selling these AI as works of their own - &ldquo;artwork&rdquo; presented as original creations in art contests, museums etc., or have the audacity to bully actual artists for their rightful concerns and frustrations with the emerging tech. Copying by AI was not consented to by the artists, and despite the booming tech industry, there&rsquo;s a lack of compensation for legitimate artists.Users can create all kinds of &ldquo;artwork&rdquo; with just a few key words, including some that are clearly evocative of the works of countless artists. Users can literally invoke those artists by simply typing &ldquo;in the style of&rdquo; or &ldquo;by&rdquo; along with a specific name. The current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases, with millions of users flocking to text-to-image AI systems. They have already been used to create magazine covers, news stories, experimental films, advertising campaigns and more, which is troublesome to human artists, designers, and journalists. There have already been cases of images generated with an AI system winning awards and competitions sparking backlash and an uproar among artists, which we&rsquo;ll delve into further in a bit.What exactly is AI ART?AI art refers to art generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence. AI is a field of computer science that focuses on building machines that mimic human intelligence or even simulate the human brain through a set of algorithms. Programs like Midjourney, Night Cafe, and DALL &ndash; E 2 are art generators that create art based on the prompts that have been given, basically you describe something in a sentence - it goes to the bot, the bot sources and analyzes numerous images, and out comes a result, sometimes in seconds. The generators use algorithms that analyze thousands of art pieces from different artists, in order to create unique works through specific rules through which machines analyze thousands of images to comprehend a particular creation process, like a specific style or aesthetic. The algorithms then generate novel forms, shapes, figures, and patterns to produce new works. Besides machines, AI artists also collaborate with creative coders, statisticians, computer scientists, and neuroscientists to build machines that push the boundaries of human creativity.Example of AI-generated art made with WOMBO DreamWhat is the purpose of using AI in art?Companies and&nbsp;enthusiasts&nbsp;try to market it as &ldquo;Expanding human creativity&rdquo; but in reality AI should not be used in place of Art, but instead used as a tool for reference. Some artists and designers have actually embraced the power of these tools. Some illustrators and visual artists use AI tools to generate ideas, gather inspiration, and experiment. While AI-generated art does inspire creativity, and enthusiasm, as it approaches mass consumption, it becomes an enormous question of ethics and becomes a huge disruption in creative industries.&nbsp;&ldquo;It can be a beneficial utility for creative industries. It&rsquo;s already used in various industries, such as advertising, marketing, gaming, architecture, fashion, graphic design, and product design. This Twitter thread provides a variety of use cases, from commerce to the medical imaging domain.&rdquo; - TECH DIRTWhere is the data coming from?Many artists and industry professionals have been taking to Twitter and other social platforms to express their outrage about the controversial tech, and hopefully expose some of the harsh truths to a broader audience.The generators for these AI software analyze thousands of images, paintings and other sources of art in order to create these &ldquo;unique works.&rdquo; In an interview with a multimedia reporter, Jim Ovelmen, an animation professor at Cal State LA, who has used AI art programs like Midjourney expressed his apprehension.&nbsp;&ldquo;Another thing that bothered me was that in some of the AI-generated stuff, you could actually see the signature,&rdquo; said Ovelmen. &ldquo;The fact you can see someone&rsquo;s signature in the echochamber of all the thousands of images it&rsquo;s creating means it was somehow sampled by some individual artist&rsquo;s signature.&rdquo; The issue with how the algorithms take from thousands of artists&rsquo; works and how crediting comes into play is another part of the AI art debate.A student breaks it down it layman&rsquo;s terms: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of like a booklet of all these artists that showcase their arts, and then you start cutting those pieces out and just putting it on one collage,&rdquo; said Felix Mach, a third-year animation major. &ldquo;The machine has this huge collection of pieces from other artists, and it&rsquo;s hard for you to credit those artists because it&rsquo;s just from a library.&rdquo;Why is using AI Art controversial?&nbsp;There needs to be a much stricter regulation of AI art programs, especially when it comes&nbsp;to what sources they are allowed to pull sample data from, and how the works the programs generate may be used in a commercial capacity. In theory the apps aren&rsquo;t harmful per se, and&nbsp; as mentioned above there can be beneficial applications for it in creative fields. However, taking artwork from creators to use as data without permission and allowing anyone who can simply type a sentence to steal aspects of artists&rsquo; work for their own gain is ethically and irresponsible. Artificial intelligence should help artists, not steal their work and hurt their career prospects.

While they threaten illustrators’ careers, AI companies are making fortunes. (Ashley Cai / Los Angeles Times)       By Molly Crabapple   Dec. 21, 2022 3:20 AM PT      Share       Share via Close extra sharing options    Email     Facebook    X    LinkedIn    Threads    Reddit    WhatsApp    Copy Link URLCopied!   Print        Like many artists, I’ve looked in horror at generative image AI, a technology that is poised to eliminate humans from the field of illustration.In minutes or hours, apps such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney can churn out polished, detailed images based on text prompts — and they do it for a few dollars or for free. They are faster and cheaper than any human can be, and while their images still have problems — a certain soullessness, perhaps, an excess of fingers, tumors that sprout from ears — they are already good enough to have been used for the book covers and editorial illustration gigs that are many illustrators’ bread and butter.They are improving at an astounding rate. Though some AI fans give lip service to the idea that this technology is meant to help artists, it is, in fact, a replacement, as explicit as the self-acting spinning mule, a machine commissioned by British factory bosses in 1825 to break the power of striking textile workers. Advertisement    This replacement could only be accomplished through a massive theft.

In minutes or hours, apps such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney can churn out polished, detailed images based on text prompts — and they do it for a few dollars or for free. They are faster and cheaper than any human can be, and while their images still have problems — a certain soullessness, perhaps, an excess of fingers, tumors that sprout from ears — they are already good enough to have been used for the book covers and editorial illustration gigs that are many illustrators' bread and butter. They are improving at an astounding rate. Though some AI fans give lip service to the idea that this technology is meant to help artists, it is, in fact, a replacement, as explicit as the self-acting spinning mule, a machine commissioned by British factory bosses in 1825 to break the power of striking textile workers. This replacement could only be accomplished through a massive theft.

					Bailey Graham   Leave a comment             Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming a game-changer in the film industry. From scriptwriting and casting to special effects and distribution, AI is transforming the way movies are made and seen. While there are many benefits to using AI in filmmaking, there are also potential downsides that need to be considered. One of the biggest advantages of AI in the film industry is its ability to save time and resources. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets of existing scripts and use that data to generate new, original stories. This not only saves time for screenwriters, but it also opens up new possibilities for storytelling and creativity. AI is also being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of casting decisions. AI-powered platforms can analyze a vast amount of data, including past performance data and social media activity, to predict which actors are most likely to be successful in a given role. This can help casting directors make more informed decisions and save time and resources. In addition, AI is being used to enhance the visual effects (VFX) in films. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize and classify different objects in a scene, making it easier and faster to add VFX elements. This can save time and money for VFX studios, as well as enhance the overall quality of the film. However, there are also potential downsides to the use of AI in the film industry. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for AI to replace human jobs. As AI algorithms become more advanced, there is a risk that they could replace human screenwriters, casting directors, and VFX artists, leading to job losses in the film industry. Another potential downside is the loss of human creativity and personal touch. While AI algorithms can generate new stories and make accurate predictions, they may lack the unique perspective and emotional depth that comes from human creativity. This could lead to a homogenization of storytelling and a decrease in the overall quality of films. There are several ways that humans can retain their jobs in the film industry even when AI is capable of doing the same work. One approach is to focus on the unique capabilities of human creativity and emotion. While AI algorithms may be able to generate stories and make predictions, they may lack the unique perspective and emotional depth that comes from human creativity. This could lead to a homogenization of storytelling and a decrease in the overall quality of films. By highlighting the value of human creativity, filmmakers can differentiate themselves from AI and justify their continued employment. Another approach is to focus on tasks that are difficult or impossible for AI to do. For example, tasks that require human empathy, social skills, or physical dexterity may be more difficult for AI to perform. By focusing on these tasks, humans can retain their jobs even in the face of AI competition. Finally, humans can also stay competitive by continuously learning and adapting to new technologies. As AI algorithms become more advanced, it will be important for humans to stay up-to-date on the latest developments and to learn how to use AI tools effectively. This could involve taking courses, attending workshops, or collaborating with AI experts to learn new skills and stay ahead of the curve. By investing in their own education and development, humans can maintain their value in the film industry. Overall, it’s clear that AI is having a major impact on the film industry. From scriptwriting and casting to VFX and distribution, AI is transforming the way movies are made and seen. While there are many benefits to using AI in filmmaking, there are also potential downsides that need to be considered. As AI continues to evolve, it will be important to strike a balance between the advantages of technology and the value of human creativity.

            Is broccoli or beetroot the best option for your personal health? Which foods are likely to trigger the biggest glucose spikes or cholesterol surges in your blood?
    

            Custom diets are the next frontier in nutrition science – and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a key role in figuring out what each of us should, and shouldn’t, be eating. 
    

            An ambitious program called Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) kicked off in the US in January 2022 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded $170 million to fund institutions across the country to conduct a five-year study with 10,000 participants. 
    




Ad Feedback





            CNN spoke to Holly Nicastro, program director in the NIH office of nutrition research and coordinator of NPH, about the aims and scale of the project and how AI can benefit our health by helping to devise optimal diets for every individual.
    

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.


CNN: There’s already a lot of information about healthy eating. Why is your approach different, and what’s the goal?


Holly Nicastro: There is a lot of conflicting information, and there is no one-size-fits-all diet to stay healthy. The goal of NPH is to use AI to develop algorithms that predict individual responses to food and dietary patterns. 
    

            Our approach is different because we’re looking at a comprehensive set of factors, many of which are not typically examined in nutrition science. The NPH study will examine how genes, the microbiome, biology and physiology, one’s environment, lifestyle, health history, psychology, and social determinants of health impact individual responses to diet. Furthermore, we’ll be studying one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of participants for a precision nutrition study. 
    

CNN: Who are your participants?


Nicastro: Participants for NPH will be recruited from the All of Us Research Program, which is run by NIH. All of Us is inviting one million people across the US to help build one of the most diverse health databases in history. Most participants come from groups that have been previously underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. All of Us participants have provided information through surveys, electronic health records, biological samples, and digital health technologies like Fitbits. The diversity of the All of Us Research Program cohort will allow NPH to examine factors such as age, sex, race and ethnicity.

Nicastro: NPH incorporates three modules. In Module 1, information on all the participants’ normal day-to-day diets will be collected. In Module 2, a subset of Module 1 participants will eat three different diets selected by researchers. For Module 3, a smaller, and separate, subset of participants from Module 1 will participate in a two-week study in research centers where their food will be carefully controlled by researchers. 
    

             Each module will conclude with a meal challenge test. Participants will fast overnight and then consume a standardized breakfast meal or drink so that we can examine their responses, such as blood glucose levels, over several hours.

            We’ll be using mobile photography apps and wearable devices that can passively capture information on what people are eating. Participants will wear continuous glucose monitors and accelerometers which gather information about physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep. Researchers will also analyze various biomarkers – like blood lipids and hormone levels – and the stool microbiome.
    

            The NPH study will link in data from the All of Us program and analyze it using AI. This approach creates an unprecedented opportunity to move nutrition research toward personalized nutrition because unlike human researchers, AI can sift through and process vast amounts of data quickly and translate connections between data points into algorithms. These can predict an individual’s response to foods and dietary patterns, taking into account the role of genes, proteins, the microbiome, metabolism, and environmental and lifestyle factors. 
    

CNN: Who stands to benefit the most from precision nutrition approaches?


Nicastro: Some of the earliest direct benefits could be for people at risk for diabetes or who have trouble regulating their blood glucose levels. Blood glucose monitors that attach to the skin allow us to learn how an individual’s blood sugar will change after eating particular foods, food groups, or meals, and then predict those responses based on the individual’s traits. This will help us develop tailored plans that prevent large blood sugar swings.
    

            We’re also using precision nutrition approaches to see how well we can predict other responses to diet, including changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels, mood and cognition. 
    

CNN: Are we really what we eat and how much could we improve our health through diet?


Nicastro: Poor diet is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death around the world, and it is a huge driver of health care costs. Our diet affects our growth, development, risk and severity of disease, and overall wellbeing. Worldwide, almost 40% of adults have obesity or are overweight, over 30% have hypertension, and other diet-related chronic diseases are on the rise. Recent studies have indicated that about one in five deaths can be attributed to poor diet. Improving our diets has tremendous potential to change the health of the world. 
    

            If everyone followed population-wide guidance, like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we would expect to see improvements. These guidelines generally focus on including foods rich in nutrients and limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. However, this one-size-fits-most approach only gets us so far. We see some degree of individual variability in participants’ responses in virtually all diet and nutrition intervention studies, and patients and consumers are increasingly seeking tailored approaches.
    

CNN: I’m convinced! When will custom dietary advice become widely available to the public?


Nicastro: Precision nutrition is already in practice. Clinical practitioners will provide different recommendations based on someone’s disease profile, health history, or health and wellness goals. For example, recommendations for someone looking to control their diabetes will look very different from recommendations for someone who needs to increase their muscle mass.

            Nutritional advice will become increasingly precise over the coming years. In the short term, more data points will be used to generate more tailored recommendations. Longer term, I hope to see the predictive factors identified by NPH being used during standard intake by health care professionals. This may involve having patients use new technologies like continuous glucose monitors or smart toilets that analyze the stool microbial composition in real time, or it may involve a simple genetic signature test.
    

             For us to realize the full benefits of precision nutrition approaches, it will be essential to study and address barriers to following dietary recommendations. Precision approaches should focus on dietary recommendations that not only optimize someone’s health, but also that are easy for an individual to follow based on their own resources, lifestyle, preferences, and abilities.

Which foods are likely to trigger the biggest glucose spikes or cholesterol surges in your blood? Custom diets are the next frontier in nutrition science – and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a key role in figuring out what each of us should, and shouldn’t, be eating.  An ambitious program called Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) kicked off in the US in January 2022 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded $170 million to fund institutions across the country to conduct a five-year study with 10,000 participants.  CNN spoke to Holly Nicastro, program director in the NIH office of nutrition research and coordinator of NPH, about the aims and scale of the project and how AI can benefit our health by helping to devise optimal diets for every individual. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: There’s already a lot of information about healthy eating. Why is your approach different, and what’s the goal? Holly Nicastro: There is a lot of conflicting information, and there is no one-size-fits-all diet to stay healthy. The goal of NPH is to use AI to develop algorithms that predict individual responses to food and dietary patterns.  Our approach is different because we’re looking at a comprehensive set of factors, many of which are not typically examined in nutrition science. The NPH study will examine how genes, the microbiome, biology and physiology, one’s environment, lifestyle, health history, psychology, and social determinants of health impact individual responses to diet. Furthermore, we’ll be studying one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of participants for a precision nutrition study.  CNN: Who are your participants? Nicastro: Participants for NPH will be recruited from the All of Us Research Program, which is run by NIH. All of Us is inviting one million people across the US to help build one of the most diverse health databases in history. Most participants come from groups that have been previously underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. All of Us participants have provided information through surveys, electronic health records, biological samples, and digital health technologies like Fitbits. The diversity of the All of Us Research Program cohort will allow NPH to examine factors such as age, sex, race and ethnicity.  CNN: What data are you collecting, and how are you analyzing it? Nicastro: NPH incorporates three modules. In Module 1, information on all the participants’ normal day-to-day diets will be collected. In Module 2, a subset of Module 1 participants will eat three different diets selected by researchers. For Module 3, a smaller, and separate, subset of participants from Module 1 will participate in a two-week study in research centers where their food will be carefully controlled by researchers.   Each module will conclude with a meal challenge test. Participants will fast overnight and then consume a standardized breakfast meal or drink so that we can examine their responses, such as blood glucose levels, over several hours.   We’ll be using mobile photography apps and wearable devices that can passively capture information on what people are eating. Participants will wear continuous glucose monitors and accelerometers which gather information about physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep. Researchers will also analyze various biomarkers – like blood lipids and hormone levels – and the stool microbiome. The NPH study will link in data from the All of Us program and analyze it using AI. This approach creates an unprecedented opportunity to move nutrition research toward personalized nutrition because unlike human researchers, AI can sift through and process vast amounts of data quickly and translate connections between data points into algorithms. These can predict an individual’s response to foods and dietary patterns, taking into account the role of genes, proteins, the microbiome, metabolism, and environmental and lifestyle factors.  CNN: Who stands to benefit the most from precision nutrition approaches? Nicastro: Some of the earliest direct benefits could be for people at risk for diabetes or who have trouble regulating their blood glucose levels. Blood glucose monitors that attach to the skin allow us to learn how an individual’s blood sugar will change after eating particular foods, food groups, or meals, and then predict those responses based on the individual’s traits. This will help us develop tailored plans that prevent large blood sugar swings. We’re also using precision nutrition approaches to see how well we can predict other responses to diet, including changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels, mood and cognition.  CNN: Are we really what we eat and how much could we improve our health through diet? Nicastro: Poor diet is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death around the world, and it is a huge driver of health care costs. Our diet affects our growth, development, risk and severity of disease, and overall wellbeing. Worldwide, almost 40% of adults have obesity or are overweight, over 30% have hypertension, and other diet-related chronic diseases are on the rise. Recent studies have indicated that about one in five deaths can be attributed to poor diet. Improving our diets has tremendous potential to change the health of the world.  If everyone followed population-wide guidance, like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we would expect to see improvements. These guidelines generally focus on including foods rich in nutrients and limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. However, this one-size-fits-most approach only gets us so far. We see some degree of individual variability in participants’ responses in virtually all diet and nutrition intervention studies, and patients and consumers are increasingly seeking tailored approaches. CNN: I’m convinced! When will custom dietary advice become widely available to the public? Nicastro: Precision nutrition is already in practice. Clinical practitioners will provide different recommendations based on someone’s disease profile, health history, or health and wellness goals. For example, recommendations for someone looking to control their diabetes will look very different from recommendations for someone who needs to increase their muscle mass. Nutritional advice will become increasingly precise over the coming years. In the short term, more data points will be used to generate more tailored recommendations. Longer term, I hope to see the predictive factors identified by NPH being used during standard intake by health care professionals. This may involve having patients use new technologies like continuous glucose monitors or smart toilets that analyze the stool microbial composition in real time, or it may involve a simple genetic signature test.  For us to realize the full benefits of precision nutrition approaches, it will be essential to study and address barriers to following dietary recommendations. Precision approaches should focus on dietary recommendations that not only optimize someone’s health, but also that are easy for an individual to follow based on their own resources, lifestyle, preferences, and abilities.

After ingesting the images and corresponding text, the AI model begins to connect the words a dachshund to the visual representation of a dachshund.A model is only as good as its training data. Bias found on the internet can show up in results, such as a prompt for a “CEO” that produces only white men.You have selected in outer space and the style of stained glass. The AI creates an internal map of concepts by converting images and texts into numbers and by assigning some associations higher probabilities (ie. playing the guitar often involves hands).While the AI may never have encountered an image of  a dachshund in outer space playing a guitar in the style of stained glass, it has now been trained to interpret the database of words and pictures to create such an image.Researchers then add “noise,” or visual clutter, to the data set of images.Visual noise is a pattern of random dots or pixels, similar to television static. This clutter acts as an overlay, obscuring the original image.Researchers add more and more noise to train the model to recognize that this underlying image still contains  a dachshund. This is known as the “diffusion model” of machine learning, and most popular text-to-image generators use it.Next, the AI learns to subtract noise to return a heavily obscured image to one that is clear.Over time, the AI gets so good at “de-noising” images that it gains the ability to generate a detailed image from pure noise.

Employment Law
Can I be fired and replaced with artificial intelligence?



December 21, 2022








The short answer is yes. Your employer can fire you and fill your position with artificial intelligence (AI) — even if you are effectively performing the duties of the job.
This is called a termination without cause. In Canada, companies can let non-unionized workers go for any reason, as long as:

They are provided full severance pay
The reasons for their dismissal aren’t discriminatory

However, it’s very unlikely that your employer would be able to fire you for cause, which would mean no severance package or access to Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.
To justify dismissing you for cause, the company would have to prove progressive disciplinary measures were applied and that a less severe punishment would be inappropriate.
This type of termination is reserved for the worst kinds of workplace offences, such as theft or assault.

• Can employers use AI to decide who to fire?
• Severance for provincially regulated employees
• Rights to severance for federally regulated employees

WATCH: Employment lawyer Lior Samfiru explains what rights employees have if they are being fired or let go on an episode of the Employment Law Show.


How can I determine if reasons for my dismissal were discriminatory?
In Canada, reasons for terminating a non-unionized employee are considered discriminatory when they infringe on a protected ground under federal or provincial human rights legislation.
Examples of protected grounds include:

Age
Race
Gender
Religion
Family status

While recent advancements in AI, such as ChatGPT, are providing companies with new ways to improve productivity, the implementation of technological solutions at work can’t violate the human rights of staff.

Example: Beth has worked at a call centre in Calgary for 25 years. Her employer announces that they are now using an AI platform to help with inbound calls. A few weeks later, Beth and four of her colleagues are told that they are being fired. When Beth follows up on the reasons for her dismissal, she learns that she is being terminated because she is two years away from retirement. After explaining her situation to an employment lawyer, she is informed that she has been discriminated against based on her age. Beth’s lawyer tells her that she is entitled to full severance pay, human rights damages, and potentially reinstatement to her former position with full back pay.

If you are fired or let go, and believe that a reason for your dismissal was discriminatory, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP immediately.
We can help you secure the compensation you are entitled to through a wrongful dismissal claim as well as a human rights complaint.

Filing a human rights complaint
Non-unionized employees in Canada have the right to work in an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination.
If you do experience discrimination at work, you can file a human rights complaint.
The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Alberta Human Rights Commission, and B.C. Human Rights Tribunal, are examples of organizations that are responsible for dealing with complaints pertaining to their province’s human rights legislation.
Successful complaints can result in compensation, and even reinstatement, for the individual who experienced discrimination.

If you are forced to quit your job for any reason, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.
In addition to severance pay, you could be owed compensation for any damages associated with the end of your employment.

Can my employer punish me if I refuse to resign from my position?
Employers in Canada can’t punish non-unionized workers for refusing to quit their job.
If you are disciplined or fired by your company because you didn’t resign from your position, seek legal counsel immediately.
The experienced employment law team at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP can help you secure the compensation you are entitled to, and ensure that your rights are properly enforced.

Can my employer make major changes to my job if I refuse to resign?
In Canada, non-unionized workers don’t have to accept significant changes to their employment.
Large modifications such as a demotion, cut in pay, reduction in hours, or negative change to commission are illegal.
When substantial changes are made to your job without your consent, the law allows you to resign and seek full severance pay through a constructive dismissal claim.
If you believe that you have been constructively dismissed, don’t quit your job until you speak with an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.

My employer offered me an alternate role working with the AI, what should I do?
Some jobs can’t be completely replaced by artificial intelligence. Instead of firing you, your employer might offer you a new job supervising or assisting the technology.
If you are offered an alternate role at the company, this will likely include:

A new employment contract
Something additional in exchange for taking the new job (i.e. greater work flexibility or a signing bonus)

However, if you have a good reason for rejecting the new job (i.e. reduced pay or unfavourable conditions in the contract), you can still receive full severance pay.

Example: John was hired to write financial advice articles for a local newspaper in Vancouver. The paper tells him that it’s now using AI to create the financial advice pieces. Instead of writing the articles, John’s employer offers him a new job proofreading and fact-checking the content produced by the AI platform. When reviewing the new employment contract, he realizes that the position will require him to accept a 20 per cent pay cut. Since the alternate role would result in a significant change in pay, John has a good reason for turning down the offer and is provided full severance pay by the newspaper.

Even without a good reason for refusing the alternate role, you can still pursue your minimum entitlements at the end of your employment.

Instead of accommodating my disability, my employer replaced me with AI, what should I do?
In Canada, employers are legally obligated to assist non-unionized workers who can’t perform their job duties due to a disability (either physical or psychological), religious reasons, or other constraints under federal or provincial human rights legislation.
As part of their duty to accommodate, companies may have to:

Change your job requirements
Provide someone to help you complete your tasks
Make changes to the shift itself

The goal is to ensure that you can continue to perform your job duties, despite your disability. Your employer can’t get out of their duty to accommodate by having artificial intelligence do your job instead.
If you believe that your company hasn’t properly fulfilled their duty to accommodate, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.
We can review your situation and help you secure the compensation that you are entitled to through a constructive dismissal claim.

Credit: GettyFor those who came late: At the start of the month, San Francisco research group OpenAI released a free preview of its artificial intelligence platform, ChatGPT. Users who register at chat.openai.com type in a request about almost anything and receive a written answer seconds later.When asked, it wrote instructions on how to remove peanut butter from a VCR in biblical verse: “And it came to pass that a man was troubled by a peanut butter sandwich, for it had been placed within his VCR, and he knew not how to remove it.” It created a dairy-free recipe for macaroni cheese and an essay comparing and contrasting the nationalism of political scientist Benedict Anderson and philosopher Ernest Gellner. It refused to write about the benefits of eating glass, declaring “there are none”.The quality of the responses shocked many.“The technology proved to be astounding,” said Nick Bilton in Vanity Fair.Technology columnist Kevin Roose wrote: “We are not ready.”The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald’s science writer Liam Mannix referenced sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke’s quote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”.AdvertisementAnd The New York Times wondered: “What would Plato say about ChatGPT?”Related ArticleAII’m a revolutionary AI bot. I wrote this article to explain how I workTime pressed on, so I did what workers across a vast quantity of industries are about to start doing. I outsourced. In the small ChatGPT oblong at the top of my screen, I asked the AI platform: “Write three sentences of a newspaper column about ChatGPT in the style of Stephen Brook.”The screen went blank for several seconds, and I foolishly thought I had thwarted the technology. Then up popped this:“ChatGPT is a revolutionary new language model developed by OpenAI. With its advanced ability to understand and generate human-like text, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. Whether used for personal conversation or business communication, ChatGPT is sure to be a game-changer in the world of natural language processing.”Hmm. House style is to spell revolutionise with an S and not a Z. And this is a neat summary but dull. Perhaps my writing style has not digitally disseminated quite as widely as I had hoped.But pretty soon, the urge to outsource will become irresistible to all of us. The list of potential ChatGPT content opportunities is endless – thank-you notes, Christmas cards, staff memos, press releases, exams, speeches.In fact, it has already happened. One mate proudly revealed that he had used an AI program to write the thank-you notes to his wedding guests. The written word was once the highest form of human expression, but the digital age has turned us lazy. Why order takeaway when you can get home delivery?Emily Bell, former director of digital content for Guardian News and Media and founder and director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at the Columbia Journalism School, wrote that ChatGPT proved her greatest fears about AI and journalism. “Not that bona fide journalists will be replaced in their work – but that these capabilities will be used by bad actors to autogenerate the most astounding amount of misleading bilge, smothering reality.”Strap in. Already, the Queensland police killings offer a warning, showing us the spread of disinformation online can rapidly lead to the radicalisation of people, and sometimes turn them violent.Related ArticleAnalysisScienceIs AI coming of age - or starting to reach its limits?Liberal MP David Coleman was onto the job implications quicker than most. The former digital executive –he was once the head of digital for Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and chair of ninemsn – says ChatGPT is a remarkable product that will create opportunities but also cause massive change.“AI will upend entire industries and radically change the global economy – soon,” he said. “Because the implications of AI are unsettling, politicians will tend to downplay it. But there’s no doubt that jobs will be lost in some industries and it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise.”Meanwhile, in the real world, the big scandal revealed by the Harry & Meghan documentary was that Prince William screamed at Harry.The fallout appears unresolvable. But might ChatGPT come to the rescue? I asked it: Tell me how Prince William and Prince Harry can resolve their dispute.It replied in seconds. “It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the resolution of a personal dispute between Prince William and Prince Harry.”Related ArticleExplainerRobots‘Die as a human or live forever as a cyborg’: Will robots rule the world?But then it couldn’t help itself, offering up this advice: “It would be best for them to communicate openly and honestly with each other and try to find a resolution that works for both of them.”Wading in with some unwarranted advice?

As a data enthusiast, there are several additional lucrative employment alternatives to think about such as a self-taught AI engineer. This article will walk you through the relatively new position of AI Engineer..A fast LinkedIn search for AI engineering jobs worldwide returned 30,267 results. This figure reflects the industry's growing need for AI engineers. MAANG companies are always seeking qualified AI software engineers and research engineers with competitive pay. There has never been a better moment to sharpen your artificial intelligence abilities if you're a newcomer to the field or a software engineer wishing to change careers. A six-figure job in MAANG companies is for sure if you are an AI engineer..In the data sector, the position of an AI engineer is relatively new. Companies used to recruit people with a variety of specialties, including data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers. Then, these individuals would collaborate in various teams to create and implement some people. Many AI-driven businesses are beginning to understand that these professions are closely related, nevertheless. There are people who are adept at all three who can develop, scale, and apply AI models..People with all of these skill sets are rather uncommon and are very valuable to corporations. One of the main causes of the enormous demand for AI engineers is that, as seen by the rise in the number of job advertisements requesting an AI engineer's expertise..AI engineers frequently combine their expertise with that of software developers, data scientists, and data engineers. This individual is capable of developing and deploying fully functional, scalable artificial intelligence systems for end users. Based on the objectives of their businesses, AI experts use deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms to get useful business insights. Engineers in artificial intelligence move between software development and machine learning algorithm implementation as issue solutions..Engineers in AI might come from a wide range of backgrounds. An AI engineer possesses a very unique set of talents from other professionals. You should have good technical and programming expertise in addition to being proficient at developing machine learning models using statistics and arithmetic. As a result, the majority of AI engineers have backgrounds in computer science, software engineering, data science, statistics, or mathematics..But let's say you don't have a quantitative degree or come from one of these educational backgrounds. If so, you may develop all the necessary abilities on your own by working on engaging AI projects and gaining first-hand knowledge of what an artificial intelligence engineer's job entail..In disciplines like computer science and statistics, having a quantitative degree is advantageous but not required. If a person learns all the aforementioned machine learning tools and technologies and possesses good statistical and coding abilities, they may potentially find employment as a self-taught artificial intelligence engineer. All these Artificial Intelligence talents may be taught to oneself from the beginning. We'll outline the many measures you may take to prepare yourself to become an artificial intelligence engineer in the next section..This career path may be ideal for you if you like programming and have an interest in the subject of machine learning. To become an AI engineer, there is not much competition. The employment market is oversaturated with people trying to get into highly competitive fields like software engineering and data science. The entrance hurdle is significantly higher for AI engineers since they must possess a skill set that covers software engineering and other data-related positions..Without the ability to manage data and implement machine learning models, statisticians and data scientists are unable to become AI engineers. Without a working knowledge of statistics and deep learning, software developers cannot become AI engineers. Because fewer people meet the requirements for employment as AI engineers as a result, there is less competition for those positions..So, what is the average pay for AI engineers? Around US$165K is the average annual compensation for AI engineers in the US. The median wage for a data scientist is about US$130K, thus this remuneration is greater. Additionally, it exceeds the average annual salary of a software developer, which is about US$100,000. Similar to pay for other career roles, AI engineer salaries vary by employer, region, sector, and educational background..Although the position of an AI engineer is still very new in the data sector, it is here to stay. The market is in desperate need of people with the abilities needed to develop scalable AI solutions. For the creation of machine learning products, businesses of all sizes recruit AI developers. Another benefit of working as an AI engineer is that, if you so want, you may quickly switch over to other careers in software engineering, data engineering, data science, and machine learning engineering. Additionally, an AI engineer's salary is far greater than both a data scientist's and that of a software engineer..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Generative AI is being hailed as the next era-defining technological innovation, changing how we create new content online or even experience the internet, and in the process sparking a Silicon Valley frenzy.Is it possible for AI to achieve sentience? 52 ideas that changed the world: 26. Artificial intelligence AI will deepen divisions, say Yuval Noah Harari and Slavoj ZizekYet even as venture capitalists pump billions of dollars into AI tools such as Chat GPT, there is growing concern about their ethical and legal ramifications.What is generative AI?Put simply, generative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate new content, rather than simply analysing or acting on existing data.

Able to produce text and images, programme code, poetry, and artwork, Harvard Business Review said the software uses “complex machine-learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images”.LATEST VIDEOS FROM theweekTheWeekThe most talked about field is text-to-image AI models, such as OpenAI’s DALL-E programme, which generate detailed original images based on simple written inputs.“The buzz around generative AI today is deafening,” said Forbes.The sudden emergence of generative AI technology has sparked a “frenzy” in Silicon Valley, said Forbes, with “no topic in the world of technology attracting more attention and hype right now.”Sign up for Today's Best Articles in your inboxA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.comContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Why the buzz around Chat GPT?Released less than two weeks ago by San Francisco-based Open AI, which was co-founded by Tesla billionaire Elon Musk in 2015, Chat GPT is already making huge waves in the technology sector with over a million regular users, according to CEO Sam Altman.A “stunningly lifelike conversational language system” designed to “answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests,” The Times described it as the “world’s first truly useful chatbot”.Based on natural language generation technology, it is “implemented in such a way that you just chat with it in a web browser as if you were slacking with a colleague or interacting with a customer support agent on a website”, reported TechCrunch.What are the real-world implications?Generative AI is already “revolutionising how we experience the internet and the world around us”, reported VentureBeat, highlighting the surge in global AI investment from $12.75 million in 2015 to $93.5 billion in 2021, with the market projected to reach $422.37 billion by 2028.Image-generating AI in particular will transform industries including advertising, gaming and filmmaking, while other models will help clinicians compose medical notes, further medical research and speed up novel drug development.It could also transform how the internet itself functions.Since Open AI opened its Chat GPT programme to the public last week, “the breathless predictions have come thick and fast”, said The Times.“This is ‘the death of Google’, predicted many. Why scroll through mountains of ads and useless results when you can just ask a question and then a system trained on the entire corpus of the English-language internet provides just that answer?” asked the paper.“The potential for something like OpenAI’s ChatGPT to eventually supplant a search engine like Google isn’t a new idea,” agreed Tech Crunch, “but this delivery of OpenAI’s underlying technology is the closest approximation yet to how that would actually work in a fully fleshed-out system, and it should have Google scared.”What are the downsides?“While this outlook might make it sound as if generative AI is the ‘silver bullet’ for pushing our global society forward,” said VentureBeat, “it comes with an important footnote: the ethical implications are not yet well defined. This is a severe problem that can inhibit continued growth and expansion.”“People can easily find themselves the target of AI-generated fake videos, explicit content and propaganda,” said the news site. “This raises concerns about privacy and consent. There is also a looming possibility that people will be out of work once AI can create content in their style with or without their permission.”According to Axios some see the emerging AI creation tools “as a threat to jobs or a legal minefield (or both)”.A prime example is the recent announcement that Shutterstock, one of the internet’s leading stock image companies, was partnering with OpenAI to launch a new tool that would integrate the generative AI DALL-E 2 into its online marketplace.“The announcement was a huge win for the still-burgeoning AI industry, but was met with shock and outrage by creatives all over the internet, many of whom see generative AI like DALL-E 2 as an existential threat to their livelihoods and the use of their images for machine learning as a form of theft,” said Fast Company.Highlighting these concerns, one anonymous Shutterstock photographer told Artnet News “it’s disappointing to know we have so little respect and it’s worrying to now be competing with bots for sales.”But others dismiss concerns that generative AI could eventually replace human labour as unnecessarily alarmist.“I think there are two choices in this world,” Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy said recently. “Be the blacksmiths that are saying, ‘Cars are going to put us out of the horseshoe-making business’, or be the technical leaders that bring people, maybe kicking and screaming, into the new world.”

Although it may be impressive from a technical standpoint, the idea of relying on a machine to have conversations and generate responses raises serious concerns.First and foremost, ChatGPT lacks the ability to truly understand the complexity of human language and conversation. It is simply trained to generate words based on a given input, but it does not have the ability to truly comprehend the meaning behind those words. This means that any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight.Furthermore, the reliance on ChatGPT for conversation raises ethical concerns. If people begin to rely on a machine to have conversations for them, it could lead to a loss of genuine human connection. The ability to connect with others through conversation is a fundamental aspect of being human, and outsourcing that to a machine could have detrimental side effects on our society.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

Tech editor, Josh (on the right, in case you were wondering) stares down the enemy

The robots are coming, we've all seen the movies. At just 12 years of age, Will Smith's 2004 film I, Robot, was my first introduction to the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, and Hollywood has done its best to warn me ever since. Wall-E in 2008 was another - and a great film, might I add - but AI has always felt like science fiction, rather than science fact. This week, however, it feels like the robots are gaining strength. Artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT is gaining as much traction on Twitter as its eccentric owner, and it's got us worried. Why? I hear you ask… Well, sit down, plug in your batteries, and allow me to explain. Over the decades, we've seen robots - computing power, more specifically - revolutionise various industries. Way back, there was such a job as a Human Computer, whose role was to perform complex calculations - see 2016's Hidden Figures, a true story and another Hollywood warning shot. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksCardiologists: Teaspoon On An Empty Stomach Slims Waist From 38 To 29Seeking Health NewsLearn MoreUndoMore recently, car factory lines have become largely automated, and we've all seen videos of Amazon's warehouse operatives beep-booping their way around while picking orders. LATEST VIDEOS FROM cyclingnewsCycling NewsChatGPT is an 'Open AI' website. You type in your prompt, or your query, and it will set about answering it. You can ask it for Christmas present ideas for your grandmother, or to explain quantum computing. You can also - and here's the crux of our despair - ask it to write a product review, a race report, or, within reason, anything you like. You can even give it a word count.But can artificial intelligence seriously take my job? I obviously would rather it didn't, but I'm a fair person, so I thought I'd give it a chance. The results of this extremely scientific experiment is below. My prompts are in bold, ChatGPT's responses follow, and my analysis follows that. Review the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket favourably, highlighting its packability and waterproof capabilities.Get The Leadout NewsletterThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket is a fantastic piece of kit for any cyclist looking to stay dry on their rides. It's incredibly packable, so you can easily stash it away in your jersey pocket or saddle bag when not in use.But the real standout feature of this jacket is its Shakedry technology. This means that the jacket is completely waterproof and breathable, without any need for a traditional waterproof membrane. This not only keeps you dry, but also reduces the weight of the jacket, making it perfect for those long, wet rides.The jacket itself is also extremely lightweight, making it easy to wear on even the hottest of days. The fit is also spot on, with a close, aerodynamic cut that won't catch the wind and slow you down.Overall, the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket is a must-have for any serious cyclist looking to stay dry and comfortable on their rides. Its packability and waterproof capabilities make it an excellent choice for riders of all levels.--It had me in the first half, not going to lie. The mention of Shakedry as a technology was smart, and the reference to stuffing it in my jersey pocket was totally unprompted. However, the recommendation to wear it on ""even the hottest of days"" is where the robots trip up. That hiccup aside, though, I would have to agree with the final paragraph, it's an excellent choice, as I explained in my actual Rapha Shakedry review. This is fun, let's try a race report...Write a race report for the final stage of the 1989 Tour de France, highlighting Greg LeMond's use of aerodynamics and technology to snatch the race win from Laurent Fignon. The final stage of the 1989 Tour de France was an exciting and suspenseful one, as Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon went head to head in a battle for the yellow jersey.As the riders took to the streets of Paris, Fignon held a commanding 50-second lead over LeMond. However, LeMond was not deterred and was determined to make up the time deficit.One of the key factors in LeMond's strategy was his use of aerodynamics and technology. He rode a bike equipped with triathlon handlebars, which allowed him to tuck into a more aerodynamic position, reducing drag and increasing speed. He also wore a helmet with a long tail, which further reduced drag and increased his speed.As the riders made their way around the course, LeMond was able to make up significant time on Fignon. He was aided by a strong team effort, with his teammates working together to set a fast pace and help him make up the time.In the final stretch, LeMond was able to close the gap and even take the lead. He crossed the finish line just eight seconds ahead of Fignon, securing his victory in the 1989 Tour de France.LeMond's use of aerodynamics and technology was crucial in his victory, allowing him to overcome the time deficit and snatch the race win from Fignon. It was a thrilling and historic win, and one that will be remembered for years to come.--""That's quite a lot scary,"" replied my colleague, when I shared this just now. Apart from that one sentence - ""his teammates working together to set a fast pace and help him make up the time"" - this is pretty spot on. With that said, the 1989 Tour finale is one of the most documented races in history, and my prompt was pretty detailed, but it's impressive nonetheless.Now let's try it on something a little more niche: Stage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du Dauphiné - a race I just plucked from the skynet. Write a race report for stage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du DauphinéStage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du Dauphiné was a challenging day for the riders, with a hilly course and a summit finish at the Col de la Croix de Fer.The early breakaway consisted of three riders, with Marco Canola, Julien Bernard, and Simon Geschke building up a lead of over three minutes. However, the peloton was determined to bring them back, and with 30 kilometers to go, the gap had been reduced to just over a minute.As the leaders approached the final climb, Canola attacked, dropping Bernard and Geschke. He managed to hold onto his lead for a few kilometers, but the peloton was closing in fast.In the final kilometers, the attacks started coming from the peloton, with several riders trying to break away. But it was ultimately Thibaut Pinot who emerged as the strongest, launching a solo attack with 5 kilometers to go and holding off the chase to take the stage victory.Behind him, the battle for the overall lead heated up, with several riders making their move on the steep slopes of the Col de la Croix de Fer. In the end, it was defending champion Egan Bernal who emerged as the leader, taking the yellow jersey from previous leader Romain Bardet.Overall, it was a thrilling stage that set the stage for a thrilling final few days of racing at the Critérium du Dauphiné.--At first, I panicked. I will admit, in plucking this race from thin air, I had no idea who actually won this stage. However, as I read on, I came to realise that this was a totally made-up series of events. Good try ChatGPT, but you can't fool me! As real cycling reporters will all know, Egan Bernal has spent the majority of this season recovering from pretty significant injuries, and Thibaut Pinot was elsewhere racing at the Tour de Suisse. For those who care, it was actually Pinot's teammate and fellow Frenchman, David Gaudu, who took the stage. My race-team colleagues are safe, then. So let's turn back to tech and try to cement my employment for at least a few more months. Explain the difference between road bikes and gravel bikesRoad bikes and gravel bikes are both designed for use on paved roads, but there are some key differences between the two.Road bikes are built for speed and efficiency on smooth, paved surfaces. They typically have a lightweight frame, narrow tires, and a dropped handlebar to allow for a more aerodynamic riding position. Road bikes are ideal for racing and long distance riding on smooth roads.Gravel bikes, on the other hand, are designed for off-road adventures and have a more durable frame and wider tires to handle rougher terrain. They also have a more upright riding position and often have additional features such as mounting points for water bottles and racks. Gravel bikes are ideal for exploring dirt roads and trails, and can also be used on paved roads.Overall, the main difference between road bikes and gravel bikes is the type of terrain they are designed for. Road bikes are built for speed and efficiency on smooth roads, while gravel bikes are built for durability and versatility on a variety of terrain.Skynet has become self-aware.

            +2.61% In this article we are going to talk about the most advanced countries in artificial intelligence using the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT.  According to ChatGPT ""OpenAI is a research institute focused on developing artificial intelligence in a responsible and safe way. The institute was founded in 2015 by a group of researchers and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Sam Altman, with the goal of promoting and developing friendly AI. OpenAI is known for its work on advanced machine learning techniques, including GPT-3, a large language model that I was trained on. The institute has also developed several AI-powered systems for various applications, such as robotics, gaming, and natural language processing."" I will continue to ask directed questions to ChatGPT and share its answers throughout this article.It is difficult to say which countries are the most advanced in artificial intelligence, as the field is constantly evolving and new developments are being made all the time. However, some countries are known for their significant contributions to the field of AI, including the United States, China, Canada, and several European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. These countries have strong research and development capabilities in AI, and are home to many leading AI companies and research institutes. Additionally, they have invested heavily in AI-related technologies and have implemented policies to support the development of the field.One way to determine which countries are the most advanced in a particular scientific field is to look at the quality and quantity of research being produced by those countries. This can include the number of research papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, the impact of those papers (as measured by the number of citations they receive), and the amount of funding that is allocated to research in that field. Additionally, one can look at the number of patents filed and the number of innovative products or technologies developed in that field in a given country. All of these factors can be used to gauge a country's level of advancement in a particular scientific field.Most Advanced Countries in Artificial IntelligenceWhen we asked ChatGPT for the list of countries that published the highest number of peer-reviewed articles on artificial intelligence or that spend the most amount of money on artificial intelligence research, here is the answer we get: ""As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don't have access to information about how much different countries spend on researching artificial intelligence.

The meeting aims to provide an opportunity to discuss how health policy-makers
        can make use of these tools to better allocate resources and predict mental health conditions in populations.",,http://schema.org,,ItemPage,item,,,,,"
Event highlights 13 December 2022Takeaways: Understanding users to plan servicesThe key takeaways of the meeting were that big data and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help us better understand users of mental health services, including what they need and what questions they are asking – flagging those who may be at
    risk for developing a mental health condition through the use of electronic health records and social media data.“If big private companies and organizations can create AI-assisted ads to target people who have been to their website once, why can’t we do the same when someone searches in TikTok about mental health, like ‘how do I help my depression
    or anxiety?’,” said Ben Ogden, social media manager and mental health advocate, who opened the meeting with a powerful story of the potential for AI tools to connect people who need mental health services with those who provide them.One of the main challenges facing the field is digital exclusion, including ensuring people who lack access to digital technologies or the ability to use them (called “digital literacy”) do not fall through the cracks. This means creating
    AI tools with the involvement of people living with mental health conditions from the beginning.“Digital inequalities are the same as social inequalities,” said Dr Joseph Tay Wee Teck, Clinical Director of Forward Leeds. WHO/Europe is planning further work in this area, including publishing a systematic review on the use of AI models for research on mental health, which will be published in 2023.Event notice7 December 2022 WHO/Europe is holding a 1-day hybrid meeting on 7 December focusing on innovations related to Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of mental health. The meeting aims to provide an opportunity to discuss how health policy-makers
    can make use of these tools to better allocate resources and predict mental health conditions in populations.The event seeks to bring together professionals working with mental health data and health information systems and on policy-making, with a goal of exploring how to improve existing mental health data using emerging Big Data analytics and AI-powered tools
    and providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and country experiences on implementing these tools in decision-making.AI-assisted mental health reformThe mental health and well-being of the WHO European Region has been hit hard by several large-scale public health emergencies over the past few years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and an increasing cost-of-living crisis. While mental health services have attempted to adapt to the increased demand, they remain deprioritized and under-resourced, preventing many from getting the help they need. AI and Big Data analytics are seen as novel tools in the planning of mental health services as well as identifying and monitoring mental health problems in individuals and populations. AI-driven tools can harness readily available, real-time data –
    such as that generated through social media and electronic health records – to effectively plan and allocate resources for mental health services, identify and prevent misinformation related to public health concerns, develop targeted communications
    to promote behaviour change and predict and intervene early in mental ill health. A key objective of the meeting is to clarify and guide the use of Big Data and AI in mental health to ensure that countries are implementing these technologies in a safe and effective manner. The use of publicly available data, such as that collected
    by social media enterprises (so called “Big Data”) raises significant ethical issues related to privacy and discrimination, particularly in the context of predicting and identifying those who may be at risk of developing mental health
    conditions. Moreover, the sensitive management of health data cannot be carried out without sufficient digital health literacy among the people using that data.Participants will have the opportunity to discuss case studies across Member States on the use of data from social media and electronic health records for planning mental health services and how this may shape the future of such services.European Programme of Work in actionDigital health and mental health are 2 of the 4 flagships under the European Programme of Work 2020–2025, acting as “accelerators of change”, increasing focus on critical issues that can be transformative to health. This past September,
    WHO/Europe unveiled an action plan for digital health that was resoundingly endorsed by Member States at the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe. The Pan-European Mental Health Coalition, launched by WHO/Europe in 2021, brings together
    influential stakeholders to mobilize investment in mental health and works with individuals and communities to transform societal attitudes about mental health.Registration for this event is now closed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) engineers are in charge of developing intelligent algorithms capable of learning, analyzing and predicting future events, turning those algorithms into AI models and systems, and then testing and maintaining them.
What Is An AI Engineer?An artificial intelligence engineer develops, implements, tests and maintains an organization’s AI applications and systems. This requires not only a deep working knowledge of the artificial intelligence space, but also programming and statistics.
We encounter the work of AI engineers every time we use Netflix, Spotify or YouTube, when machine learning customizes suggestions based on past behavior. Or when we’re able to have productive conversations with a chatbot or AI voice assistant. AI engineers develop a lot of company-facing products as well, helping them increase their efficiency and profits, cut costs and make more informed business decisions.
Tariq Haque works as an AI engineer at CVS Health, where he helps the company make more informed decisions about their customers and interact with them more efficiently.
“For example, I want to identify what my customer would like to buy. I cannot do it manually,” Haque told Built In. “That’s where AI comes in. It will run all those complex calculations and do it for me and identify what the customer wants, and I can deliver that to the customer.”
Meanwhile, Gayatri Shandar, a software engineer focusing on AI at LinkedIn, mainly works on the site’s advertising AI, which essentially allows LinkedIn to continue showing users ads that are relevant to them despite the privacy and transparency constraints imposed by Apple, Google and others. Before LinkedIn, she was a machine learning engineer at Peloton, where she worked on the company’s recommender system, providing suggestions for which classes users should sign up for based on their instructor preferences, fitness level and so on.
“We do a bit of data science, we do a bit of engineering, and — depending on the company you work for and the size of the company — we also do a little bit of product, doing stack for new features and talking to product managers and other stakeholders as well in getting that feature up and running,” Shandar told Built In. “[AI engineers] wear a lot of hats.”

The Responsibilities of an AI Engineer
AI engineers play an important role in organizations that rely on artificial intelligence. They are responsible for not only identifying problems that could be solved using AI, but they’re also in charge of the development and production of AI systems, as well as implementing them. 
Some specific tasks include creating and managing the development and production of an AI infrastructure, conducting statistical analyses and interpreting the results in order to guide future decisions, building AI models from scratch and helping product managers and other teams implement and analyze them, and transforming machine learning models into specific applications.

Data Wrangling and Preparation 
Day to day, Shandar said AI engineers are responsible for doing a lot of data wrangling, or making sure that the data being fed to the models is correct and what is expected, as well as finding ways to better store, prepare, extract, transform and load that data. 
 
Model Adjustment and Problem-Solving
AI engineers are also tasked with figuring out which modeling techniques work for the given problem they want to solve, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision and so on.
 
Programming and Software Development
Haque said most of his time working as an AI engineer at CVS Health involves just good, old-fashioned programming. It’s a lot of building software, testing, deploying, testing it again and going back to refine it. In the end, he and his team come out with products that have proven to be massively beneficial to the company.
 
Focused Machine Learning Research and Analysis
Not all AI engineers are responsible for improving a company’s efficiency, though. Kulsoom Abdullah, an AI engineer at Duke University Health Systems’ Bashir Lab is more interested in furthering medical research and diagnostics — specifically by applying deep learning technology to the analysis of medical images. Because Abdullah works in academia, her role as an AI engineer looks different from those working in the corporate world. She’s not a professor or postdoctoral fellow, so the work she’s doing has an application as opposed to just pure research. But the audience for the work she does is smaller than what it likely would be were she working at an industry level.
“You have more time in academia to work on something,” she told Built In. “In industry, because of it being more on a quarter kind of system, and you have your stakeholders and business units, you do have to spend a certain amount of your time on things that are going to provide, say, immediate value.”

AI Engineer vs. Data Scientist
AI Engineer vs. Data ScientistAI engineer: builds AI systems and tools to apply data insights without human intervention.
Data scientist: collects and analyzes data to find insights, plus sometimes builds AI models to help make predictions.

Before Duke University, Abdullah worked as a data scientist at companies like Anthem and ADP, and she says there is “a lot of overlap” between AI engineers and positions like data engineers and data scientists. In some cases, the work of a data scientist at one company could be the work of an AI engineer at another.
There are some key differences, however. Data scientists handle the data collection, analysis and visualization, then sometimes build models off of what they find. AI engineers design and build AI systems and products, among other things.
For instance, a data scientist may be able to figure out what perfume a 25-year-old woman living in New York City and making $70,000 a year would be more likely to buy. And an AI engineer will use that information to create an automated product or a tool to put those insights into action without the need for human intervention, like a shopping suggestion tool or a targeted email marketing campaign.
Andrew Seligson, an AI engineer at Entanglement, a quantum computing and AI startup focused on cyber threat detection, describes the work of AI engineers as a kind of “outgrowth” of what data scientists have been doing for the last five or 10 years.
“There’s been kind of a seachange in the growth of data science and data engineering roles,” he told Built In. “What that means is that AI engineers sort of have to have a pretty broad skill set. … Someone who is able to work across a lot of the different domains of the data science, engineering, AI and ML space.”

Software Engineering and Programming Skills
While a comprehensive and firm knowledge of the various facets of artificial intelligence is important as an AI engineer, software engineering skills are also essential. Python, R, Java and C++ are among the most used languages in this space. 
 
Math and Statistics Skills
Statistics and probability are also important components of AI engineering, since machine learning models are based on mathematical principles. Plus, a firm grasp on concepts like statistical significance helps if an AI engineer needs to determine the validity and accuracy of a given model.
 
Problem Solving, Communication and Critical Thinking Skills
Being an AI engineer also requires some soft skills, particularly as it relates to problem solving, communication and critical thinking. Seligson, whose educational background is in musical composition and religious studies, says he often has to lean on his non-technical background as an AI engineer at Entanglement, particularly when it comes to communication.
“Engineers respect good technical work, and being able to articulate yourself as a technician in ways that are clear, concise [and] logical,” Seligson said. “I’ve found that a lot of my old skills didn’t necessarily have to get thrown out the window just because I was working in STEM.”

AI Engineer Education Requirements  
With technical knowledge like programming and data handling needed for the role, several AI engineer positions require earning a bachelor’s degree in the fields of computer science, data science or information technology. Those looking for positions with higher seniority or that tackle niche machine learning projects can also benefit from earning a master’s degree in artificial intelligence or another relevant discipline.
While some AI engineers commonly have collegiate backgrounds in computer science and software engineering, that isn’t necessarily a prerequisite for landing a job in this field. Candidates can also find an education through accelerated bootcamps or training courses, or even through developing personal projects that can flex their AI expertise.
 
How to Become an AI Engineer
Becoming a successful AI engineer really comes down to an individual person’s willingness to learn, their passion for the industry and the opportunities they create for themselves.
Tips for Becoming an AI EngineerLearn the technical skills requiredFind a mentor to help narrow your interestsLearn through experience
 
Learn the Technical Skills Required
Working as an AI engineer requires quite a bit of technical know-how, particularly when it comes to programming and mathematics, as well as AI algorithms and how to implement them with frameworks. Common machine learning algorithms include linear regression and decision trees, while common deep learning algorithms include recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Some common AI frameworks include Theano, TensorFlow and PyTorch. 
“I think the most important thing is self-learning because nobody is going to teach you all of this,” CVS Health’s Haque said. “Anybody who has done high school and has good programming [skills] can start.”
There are tons of educational resources available online on sites like Codecademy, Simplilearn and even here on Built In. Of course, keeping up to date with the ways AI is evolving is vital, but knowing the fundamentals is just as important.
“If you know the fundamentals as everything keeps changing,” Abdullah, of Duke University, said you’ll still be able to understand what’s going on.”

Find a Mentor to Help Narrow Your Interests
Learning the ins and outs of AI on one’s own can get “overwhelming,” Abdullah said, especially if you’re in the really early stages of career development and want to narrow your interests down. She suggests finding a mentor who actively works in the industry, so they can give you a clear idea of what working in the space is actually like, and even help narrow down an area of focus.
Once your area of interest is narrowed a bit more, prioritize learning the specific tools or technology required. That way, you can avoid getting too overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the artificial intelligence space.
 
Learn Through Experience
The next step toward establishing a career in AI engineering is striking a balance between “the learning part and the doing part,” Abdullah said. It’s great to continue learning, but a textbook or class can only teach you so much. Sometimes, the best way to learn and get comfortable with this technology is to jump into it and experiment.
“It’s one thing to have talent or problem-solving ability. Even if you have all that, you still need to get a lot of repetitions as an engineer in order to notice and kind of evaluate,” Seligson said, likening it to playing a sport. “Even if you’re really fast or really tall or really strong, if you don’t know how to play and if you haven’t seen the field a lot, you might go out there and fumble the ball the first few times. But the more you’re out there, the more you realize, ‘OK, this is kind of the flow of the game.’”
Want a Career in Machine Learning?Here’s What You Need to Know 
Benefits of Being an AI Engineer
Working as an AI engineer can be quite a rewarding career. And there are lots of reasons to enjoy the work it entails. Artificial intelligence is at the forefront of virtually every company’s growth strategy, so the folks working behind the scenes of this technology can have a real impact — both technologically and financially.
“The gratifying part about the job is being able to say, ‘Hey, I made a change to this model and it had a tangible revenue impact,’” Shandar said, adding that, in the work she does with LinkedIn’s ads, the changes she makes have the potential to make the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 
Challenges of Being an AI Engineer
That’s not to say that this technology is any walk in the park, though. AI technology is constantly evolving and gaining complexity. And while working with something so experimental and new can be exciting and rewarding, it can also be challenging.
AI Engineering ChallengesBuilding an AI model can be time-consuming and tedious, and can end in failure.Sometimes there’s a disconnect between the lofty goals of managers and executives, and what their AI engineers are actually capable of doing given the time constraints and resources available.Artificial intelligence tends to be misunderstood, and its capabilities can be overestimated.If an organization has low-quality data, AI engineers have to do a lot more work to massage the data to make it compatible with a model.
“You will spend a lot of time running experiments, poring over models, and sometimes these experiments fail. Or sometimes it feels like you have nothing to show for it because you tried a bunch of things and they didn’t work the way you wanted them to,” Shandar continued. “Sometimes it gets frustrating.”
And because artificial intelligence requires quite a bit of expertise and know-how, there can sometimes be a disconnect between AI engineers and the people in charge. Generally, engineers rely on guidelines for the work they’re doing so that they have a concrete goal or mission for the otherwise very technical work that they do. For instance, if a system must be able to sort through 50 million data points in a certain amount of seconds with a certain amount of accuracy.
Managers and executives focus on what the goal is and what a given product will provide to the larger market. Meanwhile, engineers focus more on “OK, how do we actually do that thing?” Seligson explained. “Managers and executives can expect kind of crazy things from what they call and think of as AI, wherein it can’t really do those things with the resources that they allocate.”
Not every business function or problem requires artificial intelligence. Shandar says she’s been asked “many times” over the course of her career to implement machine learning solutions for things that don’t necessarily need machine learning. Instead, she suggests starting with a “solid statistical foundation” — something simple, and rules-based — and then going from there. This provides more of an understanding of the data, which is crucial if you eventually want to build a machine learning model that actually serves its purpose.
“[People] think that, if they have data, they can just throw it into a machine learning model, and it’s going to work, and you’re going to have millions of dollars. But you need to really understand your data,” Shandar said. “A lot of people try to build production machine learning models with, pardon my French, shitty data. Or data that comes in every six months, or is poorly annotated, or is filled with zeros or a lot of missing values. Or just straight up in formats that are not amenable to machine learning.” 
This creates more work for the AI engineers, who then have to massage the data in order to get it compatible with a machine learning model.

AI Engineer Compensation and Job Outlook
AI engineers receive an average salary range of $99,000 to $167,000 in the United States as of 2023, according to Glassdoor. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also notes that computer and information research scientist roles, which include AI engineers, saw an annual median wage of over $131,000 as of 2021. With this same job area projected to grow 21 percent by 2031, AI engineers can expect to see healthy financial compensation and job growth over the next decade. 
 
The Future of AI Engineering
It’s important to remember the space that this job exists in. Just as artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and expanding, so too are the job descriptions of the people who work with this technology.
Consider all of the advancements made in AI within just the decade: virtual home smart devices, self-driving cars, facial recognition robots, ChatGPT, the list goes on. In just a few short years, artificial intelligence has revolutionized everything from healthcare to manufacturing to manufacturing to art.

“I definitely don’t think it’ll look the same, because it didn’t look the same five years ago.”

Looking ahead, the tech industry will continue to push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence is capable of, which will inevitably redefine the daily work of AI engineers — particularly when it comes to matters of bias and privacy, which are growing concerns with this technology. 
“AI is as good as we make it. And if we are not thoughtful or conscientious about how we make our models, then our AI will be just as unfair and unjust as we are,” Shandar said. “I definitely don’t think it’ll look the same, because it didn’t look the same five years ago.”
As for exactly how much change occurs, Seligson says it’s a question of “revolutionary versus evolutionary change.”
“I don’t think we’re going to necessarily see a huge revolutionary change in the way people do AI,” he said. But he does think the realities of what it means to be an AI engineer will change in the next few years, particularly as things like automated AI and machine learning become more prevalent. “Evolutionary changes end up kind of revolutionizing in the long term.”
But no matter what direction AI takes us in the next five years, 10 years and beyond, AI engineers are going to be right at the center of it.
“It’s cutting edge, it’s impactful, it’s so cool,” Haque said. “I feel extremely powerful, in a positive way, about how I can change my and others’ lives with it.”

Selfies?Images generated with Lensa AI are all over social media, but at what cost?Share full articleRead in appLensa AI, a popular iPhone app, uses your selfies and artificial intelligence to create portraits in a variety of styles.Credit...Lensa AIBy Madison Malone Kircher and Callie HoltermannDec. 7, 2022Have you noticed that many of your friends are suddenly fairy princesses or space travelers? Is your Instagram feed overrun with Renaissance-style paintings of people who were definitely born in the ’90s? If so, you are entitled to an explanation of what exactly is going on here (and it’s not time travel).In the past week, users have flocked to Lensa AI, an app that uses your selfies and artificial intelligence to create portraits in a variety of styles. Created by the company Prisma Labs, the app is generating images — and controversy.What is Lensa AI?Even if you haven’t heard of Lensa AI, you’ve possibly seen its work this week. As of Wednesday, it was the most popular iPhone app in the United States in Apple’s app store. Lensa takes your selfies, studies them and churns out original, computer-generated portraits of you — or anyone whose photos you feed it.Do I have to pay for it?You do. Right now, you can get 50 avatars — 10 images in five styles — for $3.99 during a one-week trial period. (For $35.99 you can subscribe to Lensa AI for the year, which gets you a 51 percent discount on future avatars.) “Magic Avatars consume tremendous computation power to create amazing avatars for you,” according to Lensa’s checkout page. “It’s expensive, but we made it as affordable as possible.” Fair warning: Prices have been fluctuating as the app has gotten more and more popular and may have changed since this article was published.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow does it work?After downloading the app, you’ll upload a bunch of selfies. (Do yourself a favor and don’t include any where your hands are touching your face unless you want to pay money to get back a mess of images with phantom phalanges hanging from your mouth.) Select a gender — male, female or other — and walk away from your phone for around half an hour, and when you return, presto. Your face, or something like it, has been stretched and squeezed across a suite of 50 to 200 — depending on what package you purchase — A.I.-generated images with themes including “cosmic,” “fairy princess” and “anime.”OK, but how does it really work?Lensa uses Stable Diffusion, which is when all the horses in a barn spread out to give each other a little space. Just kidding: Stable Diffusion is a “really powerful” A.I.-based image generator, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. Similar to DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion uses image prompts (like your selfies) and text prompts (like “fantasy,” one of Lensa AI’s categories) to generate high-quality images that sometimes get “trippy,” Dr. Kambhampati said. “It’s showing you pictures that nobody took; it’s just able to stitch them up from all the other images that it has seen.”Cool.It is cool! It’s fun to see yourself rendered as a painting or an anime character or a little woodland elf with eyes of two very different sizes and only one hand, even if you have two IRL. (Not every image is going to be perfect.) Some users, particularly transgender and gender-nonconforming people, are even finding that using Lensa to create can offer a sense of gender euphoria.I think some people are mad about this? Should I be mad about this, too?There are a couple of reasons that some users are bristling at the images Lensa AI is spitting out. The first is that many users are reporting that the art is sexualizing them. When we tested the app, several of the images we received after uploading selfies and selecting “female” included full-body renderings, despite the fact that users are specifically instructed to upload only close-up selfies. One image featured our avatar in a metallic bikini à la Princess Leia in “Return of the Jedi.” Another included only half a face atop a scantily clad body.ImageOne of the images the Lensa AI app generated during a test by The Times depicted half of a face atop a scantily clad body.Credit...Lensa AIPrisma Labs states on its F.A.Q. page that “occasional sexualization is observed across all gender categories.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThus, it’s fairly simple to use the app to create lewd images of anyone you want. This week, Tech Crunch was able to create topless avatars of celebrities using images of an actor’s head edited onto topless bodies. “It turns out the AI takes those Photoshopped images as permission to go wild, and it appears it disables an NSFW filter,” Tech Crunch reported. Now imagine that same experiment, but through the lens of someone who is angling to make revenge porn. It gets murky in a hurry.Andrey Usoltsev, Prisma Labs’ chief executive and co-founder, told TechCrunch that using Lensa AI to engage in “harmful or harassing behavior” was a breach of its terms of use.What are users saying about the app?Yasemin Anders, 29, decided to use Lensa AI after seeing it on social media and was particularly excited to see herself recreated into an ethereal fairy.She was, however, ultimately disappointed to see that Lensa had given her a thinner body and a slimmer face and neck. “If it’s smart enough to turn you into either a fairy or a manga figure, you would think there was some sort of smart enough software behind it to detect fat people, too,” said Mx. Anders, who lives in Berlin and works in marketing.“Even if I imagine myself as a fairy, as like an idealized fantasy version of myself, I would still want to look like myself,” she added. “And I have always been fat. I’ve been a fat kid. I’ve been a fat teenager, and I’m a fat adult now. So why would I want to imagine an ideal version of me that doesn’t even look like me?”Other users are reporting that the app is making their skin appear lighter or whiter and is markedly altering their facial features, which Dr. Kambhampati said was an ongoing issue with generative A.I. tools, including Snapchat’s face lenses. “If most of the images you fed the system were of white faces, then it’s not surprising that when it tries to make an image that looks supposedly ‘better,’ it just makes it whiter,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow do artists feel about Lensa?Stable Diffusion was trained on the creations of many artists who did not explicitly consent to the use of their work for Prisma Labs’s profit, Dr. Kambhampati said, adding, “If van Gogh was alive today, you’d probably need to pay van Gogh some licensing fee to make your pictures be in van Gogh’s style.” That is not what has happened here.“To a lot of people, having our art stolen, they don’t view it as anything personal — like, ‘Oh, well, you know, it’s just a style; you can’t copyright a style,’” said Jonathan Lam, a storyboard artist who works in video games and animation. “But I would argue that for us, our style is actually our identity. It’s is what sets us apart from each other. It’s what makes us marketable to clients.” Mr. Lam, who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, is one of many artists who have since spoken out on social media about the app.ImageOne photo generated by Lensa AI appeared to include artists’ signatures. Credit...Lensa AIHe also noted that some of the works being generated by Lensa include what appear to be renderings of artists’ signatures. (Several of our own Lensa-generated images had scribbles where a signature might go on an IRL painting.) “All these tech enthusiasts are saying that these generators are creating something new, but if the artist’s signature is still there, it’s not something new,” Mr. Lam said. “It’s just generating something based on the data it was fed.”“I think the general public is under the assumption that it is a program that has just learned to draw by itself in a vacuum, and they don’t realize the greater implication of the exploitation of data,” he added. “When you’re starting to see these things becoming monetized and real people being exploited and abused, it’s quite scary. And it’s even scarier when it’s disguised as a pretty application.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHas Prisma Labs responded to these concerns?Prisma Labs wrote in a Twitter thread that A.I. “will not replace digital artists” and pushed back against the characterization that Lensa was ripping off artists’ work. “The AI learns to recognize the connections between the images and their descriptions, not the artworks,” the company wrote. “As cinema didn’t kill theater and accounting software hasn’t eradicated the profession, AI won’t replace artists but can become a great assisting tool.”Are there any privacy concerns?“I doubt that the whole business model is, ‘Give us $10 or $15 and we’ll send you back an A.I. glam shot,’” said Jen King, the privacy and data policy fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. Lensa AI’s privacy policy claims that “face data” is deleted within 24 hours after it has been processed and is not used to identify any individual user — but it also states that your photos and videos can be used to further train Lensa’s algorithms. Would Dr. King use Lensa AI? “No.”It Happened Online is a column in which we explain very particular bits of news enabled and amplified by social media.Madison Malone Kircher is a reporter for The Times. She writes about the internet for the Styles desk.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated decision-making tools in recruitment is on the rise among Australian organisations. However, research shows these tools may be unreliable and discriminatory, and in some cases rely on discredited science. 
At present, Australia has no specific laws to regulate how these tools operate or how organisations may use them. 
The closest thing we have is new guidance for employers in the public sector, issued by the Merit Protection Commissioner after overturning several automated promotion decisions.  
A first step
The commissioner reviews promotion decisions in the Australian public sector to make sure they are lawful, fair and reasonable. In the 2021-22 financial year, Commissioner Linda Waugh overturned 11 promotion decisions made by government agency Services Australia in a single recruitment round. 
These decisions were made using a new automated process that required applicants to pass through a sequence of AI assessments, including psychometric testing, questionnaires and self-recorded video responses. The commissioner found this process, which involved no human decision-making or review, led to meritorious applicants missing out on promotions.

      Algorithms can decide your marks, your work prospects and your financial security. How do you know they're fair?




The commissioner has now issued guidance material for Australian government departments on how to choose and use AI recruitment tools. 
This is the first official guidance given to employers in Australia. It warns that not all AI recruitment tools on the market here have been thoroughly tested, nor are they guaranteed to be completely unbiased.
AI recruitment tools risky and unregulated
AI tools are used to automate or assist recruiters with sourcing, screening and onboarding job applicants. By one estimate, more than 250 commercial AI recruitment tools are available in Australia, including CV screening and video assessment. 
A recent survey by researchers at Monash University and the Diversity Council of Australia found one in three Australian organisations have used AI in recruitment recently.
The use of AI recruitment tools is a “high risk” activity. By affecting decisions related to employment, these tools may impact the human rights of job seekers and risk locking disadvantaged groups out of employment opportunities. 
Australia has no specific legislation regulating the use of these tools. Australia’s Department of Industry has published AI Ethics Principles, but these are not legally binding. Existing laws, such as the Privacy Act and anti-discrimination legislation, are in urgent need of reform.
Unreliable and discriminatory?
AI recruitment tools involve new and developing technologies. They may be unreliable and there are well-publicised examples of discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups.  
AI recruitment tools may discriminate against these groups when their members are missing from the datasets on which AI is trained, or when discriminatory structures, practices or attitudes are transmitted to these tools in their development or deployment. 
There is currently no standard test that identifies when an AI recruitment tool is discriminatory. Further, as these tools are often made outside Australia, they are not attuned to Australian law or demographics. For example, it is very likely training datasets do not include Australia’s First Nations peoples.
Lack of safeguards
AI recruitment tools used by and on behalf of employers in Australia lack adequate safeguards. 
Human rights risk and impact assessments are not required prior to deployment.  Monitoring and evaluation once they are in use may not occur. Job seekers lack meaningful opportunities to provide input on their use. 
While the vendors of these tools may conduct internal testing and auditing, the results are often not publicly available. Independent external auditing is rare.
Power imbalance
Job seekers are at a considerable disadvantage when employers use these tools.  They may be invisible and inscrutable, and they are changing hiring practices in ways that are not well understood.  
Job seekers have no legal right to be told when AI is used to assess them in the hiring process. Nor are they required to be given an explanation of how an AI recruitment tool will assess them.

My research has found this is particularly problematic for job seekers with disabilities. For example, job seekers with low vision or limited manual dexterity may not know they will be assessed on the speed of their responses until it is too late.
Job seekers in Australia also lack the protection available to their counterparts in the European Union, who have the right not to be subjected to a fully automated recruitment decision.
Facial analysis
The use of video assessment tools, like those used by Services Australia, is particularly concerning. Many of these AI tools rely on facial analysis, which uses facial features and movements to infer behavioural, emotional and character traits.  
This type of analysis has been scientifically discredited. 
One prominent vendor, HireVue, ceased the use of facial analysis in its AI tool after a formal complaint in the United States.
What’s next?
The Services Australia example highlights the urgent need for a regulatory response. The Australian government is currently consulting on the regulation of AI and automated decision-making.  
We can hope that new regulations will address the many issues with the use of AI tools in recruitment. Until legal protections are in place, it might be best to hold off on the use of these tools to screen job seekers.

Correction: an earlier version of this article suggested HireVue was forced to stop using facial analysis as a result of a complaint filed against them. This has been amended.

	It took exactly three days for someone to resurrect beloved Korean artist Kim Jung Gi after his death in early October at the age of 47. Not in flesh and blood, of course, but in code through the use of an AI image generator. 

	By October 6, a former French game developer known online as 5you announced that he had released a tool, based on popular open-source AI image generator Stable Diffusion, that could generate images in Kim’s iconic style with a text prompt. 5you described the tool as an “hommage [sic]” and encouraged users to “feel free to use it” so long as they “credit plz.”

	Manga, anime, and comic book artists were universally outraged, with 5you telling Rest of World that he had received death threats from Kim’s fans and fellow artists. Some denounced the move as a tasteless ploy for publicity; others, meanwhile, read it as a premonition of the dystopian future that lay ahead—“they won’t let people die, they’ll work forever” read one popular comment on a TikTok. For many, 5you’s request for credit echoed a long line of white creators appropriating and then benefitting from Asian art styles.



	But the controversy illuminates a truth long held by technology ethicists: New technology is not ideologically neutral; these tools latch onto and aggravate existing structural inequalities. Image generators like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others are poised to do the same, creating new avenues of exploitation while also reinforcing our existing biases. 

	While all artists stand to lose from AI, the Kim Jung Gi bot reveals how Asian artists in particular — long racialized as the robotic Other — are uniquely vulnerable to these tools as well as a new form of technologically-inflected Orientalism.

		The Old and the New Orientalism	








In the early 1900s, many advertisements, like these from New York based Murad cigarettes, incorporated Orientalist motifs or models dressed in Middle Eastern dress.

	Historically, Orientalism in Western art was motivated by a vision of Asia as an archaic, traditionalist alternative to Europe— prone to barbarism, yet in contact with a mystic essence lost to those in modernity. 

	During the early period of Orientalism — typically considered the 18th and 19th centuries — it wasn’t uncommon for artists to adopt the styles and signifiers of these cultures from clothing and decor to artistic practices like printmaking, in the hopes of imbuing their work with a kind of exotic authenticity. 



	In the post-World War II era, however, Asia became an increasingly dominant player in the global economy and in the development of technology. The notion of Eastern backwardness could no longer hold in the face of its growing influence, and so a new myth arose to rationalize the superiority of the Western subject while making sense of this global reconfiguration. Asian peoples began to be depicted in the media as essentially robotic— automata capable of fine-tuned execution and coordination, but lacking the sort of individual creativity and spirit that defined the Western subject. 

	As the theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun wrote in her 2019 study on “High-Tech Orientalism,” these depictions protected whiteness’ hegemony over the human by “jettisoning… the Asian/Asian American as robotic, as machine-like,” while explaining Asia’s technological proficiency in dehumanizing terms that justified their continued exploitation.

	This framework has since been dubbed “techno-Orientalism,” where the traditional and premodern imagery that once stereotyped Asia is replaced by “hyper technological terms,” as the editors of an essay collection on the subject note. In this formulation, Asian people are racialized using the language of machines, as industrious, hard-working, and functionally competent, yet hollow and lacking personality, while their art is rendered “soulless and mechanical.” 

	Techno-Orientalist stereotypes have become commonplace in mainstream media, from Hollywood blockbuster films like Blade Runner, with its Tokyo inspired cityscapes and Asian holograms, to musicians like Grimes, who frequently draws on Asian iconography in her flirtations with technoscapes, to video games like 2022’s Stray, which depicts a thinly disguised Kowloon Walled City populated solely by robots. White creators in nearly every medium have and continue to use Asianness to symbolize robotic futurity, and vice versa.

		The Logical End of Techno-Orientalism

	5You’s model simulating Kim Jung Gi and his art style is just the latest evolution in this twisted association between Asian bodies and roboticism. Finally, the Asian artist, long racialized as mechanistic, is reproduced via technology. The Asian artist is fully realized as a machine, thrust into the public as a product to be exploited and consumed. It’s not just their art, but the artists themselves that are now appropriated— pacified, transformed into a pure tool, made manipulable for anyone who might be so inclined (as long as they give the developer credit, of course). 

	Though one might point out that historically famous white artists have also been simulated by image generators, the speed with which Kim was mechanically refashioned after his death gestures towards an underlying attitude that already saw him as mechanistic to begin with. 

	In September, Jennifer Gradecki, a Northeastern University art and design professor, said in an interview about the future of artists that “creativity is actually the one thing that isn’t going to be able to be automated” in the future. Gradecki may have meant to reassure artists, but for Asians, a group often denied claims to creativity — and characterized at best as effective replicators, but rarely creators or originators — her statement rings like a warning for how these tools might push us further towards the margins and alienate us from our art. 

	Jet Li, for instance, voiced precisely this fear when he explained in 2018 that his refusal to work on The Matrix franchise stemmed from the fact that the filmmakers wanted Li to “record and copy all [his] moves into a digital library,” meaning that the movements of his body, honed during a lifetime of training, would become someone else’s intellectual property forever.

	When you’re already seen as mechanistic, the reproduction of your bodies and art through machines isn’t seen as theft, but simply the next logical step.

	We shouldn’t simply resign ourselves to this alienated future — and many artists aren’t, instead using a range of disciplines to interrogate the boundaries between human and machine creativity.

	Chinese Canadian painter Sougwen Chung, for example, incorporates a robotic arm into her art-making practice. As the robotic arm and Chung read each other’s brush strokes and respond in an ever-evolving dance, the machine collaboration centers her body— rather than divorcing her from it— by highlighting the physical performance between these organic and inorganic beings. 

	Meanwhile, last year, Korean American artist Anicka Yi, installed a series of floating “biologized machines” — giant ovoid airborne structures that suggest jellyfish — in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. The installation contained another component often included in Yi’s practice: a particular aroma that changed week to week based on different time periods. One scent profile was meant to evoke the bubonic plague. Yi’s semi-autonomous robo-organisms challenge the cold, sterile notion of artificial intelligence as disembodied “pure cognition” by integrating them in natural forms, while her olfactory scent-scapes serve as a carnal reminder of embodiment.

	Korean American filmmaker Kogonada has challenged techno-Orientalist ideology directly in his latest film, After Yang. In the film, starring Colin Farrell, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Justin Min, a father goes on a mission to repair his daughter’s non-responsive robotic “big brother” and caretaker, Yang.  The film is a profound meditation on the figure of the Asian robot in the sci-fi genre, complicating this archetype beyond recognition and making space for something new.

	The impact of these technologies is not yet written, but if history is to serve as a guide, new tools tend to carry on the mistakes of the past without direct intervention. Liberating these devices from their dehumanizing potential will require us to challenge and reimagine the frameworks we use to navigate the oppressive binaries of man and machine and East and West. 

	Only then might we truly live up to Kim Jung Gi, who hoped that these technologies would help us pave new paths forward— enabling us to express ourselves more clearly and ultimately “make our lives more diverse and interesting.”

The company has partnered with Udacity, an educational organization. If successful, the training program could become a model for other companies during a time of drastic and rapid change due to artificial intelligence technology. The classes are offered online through Udacity and are meant to help the company increase its AI skills among workers. According to Shell, around 2,000 of its total 82,000 employees around the globe have expressed interest in the AI classes. Many workers have said that their managers are approaching them and asking about courses regarding things like Python programming and training neural networks. The training is all voluntary. The pilot program with Udacity launched back in 2019 after Shell needed more AI-skilled workers due to the large number of AI-related projects. The company has relied on AI for many aspects of its operations, from deepwater drilling and maintenance to predictive analysis and autonomous computing. After the pilot program proved to be successful, the company expanded it and looked toward petroleum engineers, chemists, data scientists, geophysicists, and more. The online program takes around four to six months to complete, and employees work on it about 10 to 15 hours per week. Shell pays for the customized online coursework, which is called a nanodegree. Reasons for AI WorkersThere are two major reasons why Shell is in need of AI-skilled workers. First, the company is currently developing alternative sources of energy, and they are set to spend up to $2 billion on new energy technologies. According to Dan Jeavons, general manager of data science at Shell, its power business is “digitally native, and the differentiation is going to be around AI.”The other reason for the need of AI workers is that Shell is still running its massive oil business. By reskilling workers in AI through the online program, they will be able to find problems within maintenance equipment before it breaks down. The new knowledge will also help them identify areas where there can be reduced carbon emissions. On top of all this, machine learning algorithms could be used to automatically process seismic data and collect information on underground rock formations. “The potential to move the needle and help people understand that we’re serious about trying to change the way we do things for the better is not an easy task,” Jeavons says. “But one thing we do know is that technology is a huge element of that change. We need to find a way to provide more and cleaner energy and investing in AI is a key way in which we’re going to do that.”Shell also hopes that the Udacity AI collaboration will attract younger workers, who view this type of work as dangerous and physically-demanding. Paul Donnelly is director of industry marketing at Aspen Technology. The company specializes in complex manufacturing processes. “Young people are digital natives,” says Donnelly. “When they come into the workforce, energy and chemical companies are unfortunately competing with Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. It’s tough to compete with those companies.”Targeting Existing WorkforceOne of the biggest challenges for these companies is to transition their current workforce. “The worst case scenario is laying people off and then going out and hiring all new workers with the skills you need,” says Gabe Dalporto, CEO of Udacity. “First of all, our universities can’t turn out all the workers we’ll need for the jobs of the future and it’s expensive. The cost of reskilling is so much less.”According to the company, the Udacity pilot program resulted in an increase in employee satisfaction among workers who completed the coursework. “We don’t want people to feel that they’re stagnant and not growing as the company changes,” Jeavons says.As artificial intelligence becomes more important in many different industries, companies will be forced to adapt. Retraining will be one of the top approaches to dealing with the change. There have been many instances of retraining that did not provide sufficient results, but if Shell’s program is successful, it could be used as a model in the future.          Related Topics:AIartificial intelligenceretraining programs  Up NextNew Research Shows How AI Can Act as Mediators     Don't MissAnthony Macciola, Chief Innovation Officer at ABBYY – Interview Series   Alex McFarland  Alex McFarland is an AI journalist and writer exploring the latest developments in artificial intelligence.

Student Researchers Share What They Know About AI and Health

By Victoria Wilson
On December 8, 2022
In Artificial Intelligence, Data, Medicine, Students



The healthcare industry and academic medicine are excited about the potential for artificial intelligence — really clever computers — to make our care better and more efficient.  
The students from Duke’s Health Data Science (HDS) and AI Health Data Science Fellowship who presented their work at the 2022 Duke AI Health Poster Showcase on Dec. 6 did an excellent job explaining their research findings to someone like me, who knows very little about artificial intelligence and how it works. Here’s what I learned:
Artificial intelligence is a way of training computer systems to complete complex tasks that ordinarily require human thinking, like visual categorization, language translation, and decision-making. Several different forms of artificial intelligence were presented that do healthcare-related things like sorting images of kidney cells, measuring the angles of a joint, or classifying brain injury in CT scans. 
Talking to the researchers made it clear that this technology is mainly intended to be supplemental to experts by saving them time or providing clinical decision support. 
Meet Researcher Akhil Ambekar

Akhil standing next to his poster “Glomerular Segmentation and Classification Pipeline Using NEPTUNE Whole Slide Images”
Akhil Ambekar and team developed a pipeline to automate the classification of glomerulosclerosis, or scarring of the filtering part of the kidneys, using microscopic biopsy images. Conventionally, this kind of classification is done by a pathologist. It is time-consuming and limited in terms of accuracy and reproducibility of observations. This AI model was trained by providing it with many questions and corresponding answers so that it could learn how to correctly answer questions. A real pathologist oversaw this work, ensuring that the computer’s training was accurate. 
Akil’s findings suggest that this is a feasible approach for machine classification of glomerulosclerosis. I asked him how this research might be used in medicine and learned that a program like this could save expert pathologists a lot of time. 
What was Akhil’s favorite part of this project? Engaging in research, experimenting with Python and running different models, trying to find what works best.
Meet Researcher Irene Tanner
Irene Tanner and her poster, “Developing a Deep Learning Pipeline to Measure the Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle in Full Leg Radiographs”
The research Irene Tanner and her team have done aims to develop a deep learning-based pipeline to calculate hip-knee-ankle angles from full leg x-rays. This work is currently in progress, but preliminary results suggest the model can precisely identify points needed to calculate the angles of hip to knee to ankle. In the future, this algorithm could be applied to predict outcomes like pain and physical function after a patient has a joint replacement surgery. 
What was Irene’s favorite part of this project? Developing a relationship with mentor, Dr. Maggie Horn, who she said provided endless support whenever help was needed.
Meet Researcher Brian Lerner
Brian Lerner and his poster, “Using Deep Learning to Classify Traumatic Brain Injury in CT Scans”
Brian Lerner and his team investigated the application of deep learning to standardize and sharpen diagnoses of traumatic brain injury (TBI) from Computerized Tomography (CT) scans of the brain. Preliminary findings suggest that the model used (simple slice) is likely not sufficient to capture the patterns in the data. However, future directions for this work might examine how the model could be improved. Through this project, Brian had the opportunity to shadow a neurologist in the ER and speculated upon many possibilities for the use of this research in the field.
What was Brian’s favorite part of this project? Shadowing neurosurgeon Dr. Syed Adil at Duke Hospital and learning what the real-world needs for this science are.
Many congratulations to all who presented at this year’s AI Health Poster Showcase, including the many not featured in this article. A big thanks for helping me to learn about how AI Health research might be transformative in answering difficult problems in medicine and population health.

Gartner recently released its list of 7 Technology Disruptions That Will Impact Sales Through 2027. One was generative Artificial Intelligence. Gartner defined generative AI as AI that “learns from existing content artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts that reflect the characteristics of the training data, but do not repeat it.” In simple terms, it can produce entirely new content, like images, videos, text and code, with very simple inputs.
Generative AI is going to completely alter the marketing landscape, among many other areas. For example, type any combination of descriptors into OpenAI’s DALL·E 2, and AI creates realistic and/or artistic images. In fact, the title image of this piece was created using that technology by simply typing the phrase: “How generative AI will help marketing teams around the world.” Suddenly, any firm can become a one-stop creative shop with tools that can increase efficiency and creativity.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



With nearly limitless possibilities, what does this mean for professionals and their job security? 
While new AI tools are changing marketing, they’re not entirely replacing human marketers. At nearly every AI company that I represented at my communications firm, the computer intelligence was there to augment people’s abilities — but not fully supplant it. While the AI’s capacity to make new things possible was unmistakable, these tasks were best executed with an expert’s touch at the end to make final decisions.
Here are three ways to increase a marketing firm’s range by using new AI tools while still keeping professionals in the creative driver’s seat. 
Foster unlimited brainstorming potential with generative AI
Few things haunt a marketer quite like a blank page, and often the first step is the hardest. That’s where generative AI can come to the rescue. According to a blog by Sequoia Capital, this technology will help users “thrive from a tight iterative creative cycle between human and machine.” These sped-up cycles can be very advantageous early in any initiative. 
If a visually-driven project needs inspiration, programs like DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion can rapidly generate images from text prompts. These distinctive works can either fuel new creative ideas, or be the jumping off point for visual artists to build upon. For the linguistically minded, products like Jasper and Copy.ai use generative AI to help get marketing copy ideas flowing. Not only can these increase anyone’s imaginative capacity, but Sequoia believes that generative AI can make workers at least 10% more efficient and/or creative. 
Hack creative brains for new inputs
Beyond simply brainstorming, these tools can expand business offerings by creating visuals to their writing, enhanced copy to their visual images, or even unearth wholly novel creative realms. This is a game changer for smaller firms, where you can now add a new dimension to your work. If someone is generally a visual artist, I suggest using AI-generated content sparingly at first and pay attention to what it comes up with. Or, for those who are deft copywriters, start by creating images as a way to augment an article, blog, press release, etc.  advertisement
The most promising development in generative AI’s semantic creativity is the tsunami being produced by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Akin to DALL·E 2’s ability to transform language into brilliant images, ChatGPT’s model does the same thing with words and is trained to interact in a conversational way. Prompts to explain complex topics are produced with ease, but where ChatGPT shines is in the more imaginative requests. Just check out its answer to “write a biblical verse in the style of the King James bible explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR.” This is cultivating exponential imaginative potential right before marketers’ eyes.



 While this technology is still in its infancy, people should proceed cautiously and use them with continual supervision. The key to implementing any of these powerful programs is to start small and build up, all while acclimating to how these tools operate. While they may be generating the final product, starting slowly will help users define input processes — thus fostering unique and on-brand outcomes. 
Constantly iterate at speedadvertisement
One key element of a marketer’s job is to craft foundational brand elements — from written messaging and position to brand logos, colors and more — and constantly tweak concepts on the go. Rowan Curran, a Forrester AI/ML and data science analyst, cites speed constraints as a reason for adopting generative AI. According to his report, “Human-produced content creation will never be fast enough to address the need for personalized content at scale, and in the next year, we expect to see at least 10% of [Fortune 500] companies invest in AI-supported digital content creation.” Like Curran, Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30% of outbound messages from large organizations will be synthetically generated. This means that iterations can happen at much faster speeds.
There’s also an opportunity for companies to unlock new content from unlikely sources. For example, a marketing lead can have their writers create generative AI images, and their designers bring their visual minds to work on AI-assisted copy. All of a sudden, there will be entirely new concepts created by hacking into creative minds traversing unusual media — all unlocked by generative AI.
So, does this spell the end of the marketer? Not quite. Campaigns still require expert oversight at the end to ensure that content is fully within a brand’s ethos and are deployed in the right place and at the right time. However, make no mistake: these processes will soon become fully intertwined with human-powered content creation.

The legal status of generative AI 
Artificial intelligence can create art (good and bad). But what does it mean for copyright?

Generative AI artwork of a Warhol-style painting of Baby Darth Vader on a Harley by DALL-E

Andy Warhol might have appreciated the irony. The late artist who put the act of reproduction — of copying — at the centre of his oeuvre is now the focus of a copyright case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The case involves a set of silkscreens Warhol made of pop star Prince based on a portrait taken by a professional photographer who is now suing Warhol's estate for copyright infringement. At issue is whether what Warhol brought to the image — the flat, masklike face, the day-glo colours — was ""transformative"" enough in legal terms to qualify as ""fair use"" under the U.S. Copyright Act.
Courts deal with such hazy questions of authorship and artistic style all the time — questions that might come more naturally to curators and critics. But now those questions are getting a lot hazier, because artificial intelligence is getting into the game.
""Generative AI"" refers to semi-autonomous machine learning algorithms that allow computers to use existing content — text, images, video and audio — to create new works. A text-to-image AI turns user prompts into images; the user types in words describing what they want to see (""Baby Darth Vader on a Harley,"" for example) and the AI ""creates"" the image (we tried, it works).
How? Generative AI algorithms are built upon vast amounts of content scraped from the internet. In the case of Stable Diffusion, one of the most popular text-to-AI systems, the algorithm was ""trained"" on billions of images pulled from hundreds of domains — blogs, stock art libraries, art sites, everything. Some of that scraped material is not copyrighted anywhere. Much of it is.
It's new technology and it's posing some puzzling new questions for people in the copyright field. Who owns the images made by generative AI? Who owns the inputs? Can artists claim some stake in an image created by an AI trained on their work? Does an artist whose style is being ripped off by a machine have any recourse?
Right now, there's no legal consensus on any of these questions, either in Canada or in the major jurisdictions for AI startups (the U.S., U.K., EU). The companies behind generative AI can make their own assertions — OpenAI, the firm behind the wildly popular DALL-E platform, claims it retains ownership of the ""original"" images, although its subscribers get full rights to reprint, sell and merchandise them. But that claim has yet to be tested in court.
Canadian copyright law takes its cue from a 2004 decision of the Supreme Court: CCH Canada Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada. In it, the high court defined an ""original work"" in terms of effort — as a product of ""an exercise of skill and judgment."" That exercise of skill and judgment, wrote then Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, ""must not be so trivial that it could be characterized as a purely mechanical exercise."" 
It's hard to imagine a creative act more mechanical than feeding an AI a few prompts. Tom Lebrun, a Quebec-based lawyer who specializes in digital law and copyright, said that ""for most AI-generated images, the copyright would belong to no one.
""No one would own the image because no one would have contributed the talent or judgment required to produce an original work,"" he said. ""So it would be public.""
But what happens when the user actually puts in some effort? What if the user expends considerable time and effort refining the prompts? What if an advertising firm uses AI-generated imagery in a campaign — could they find their work appropriated by others legally?
""The maker of the camera is not the creator of the photos. That's not up for debate,"" said Alan Macek, a partner and patent agent at DLA Piper. ""I think advertising campaigns will be careful to make sure there's enough human authorship to forestall any arguments about copyright. But as the user's role becomes less and less, the questions get trickier.
""The thing is, we don't know. What if the user spends all morning refining the keywords and prompts to produce the image they want? On the other hand, if I hand the words over to my friend the painter to paint a painting, I don't think anyone would regard me as the creator.""
So much for output. What about input? Could an artist prove that their work formed part of an AI's training dataset and, as a result, was exploited by that algorithm to produce work in the artist's style? Would it matter?
Both Canadian and American copyright law make exceptions that allow third parties to make use of copyrighted material. The ""fair use"" doctrine in U.S. law is blurrier than the ""fair dealing"" doctrine in Canadian law, which limits third-party use to a handful of purposes: education, satire, parody, research, private study, criticism and journalism. Canadian law is more protective of an individual artist's expression.
""Style is protected under Canadian copyright law,"" said Lebrun. ""Judges try to view the artwork as a whole. They're looking to determine whether there is enough of the original work in the work in question to justify protection. Sometimes it's a key feature of the composition. Sometimes it's the style itself.
""But the artist may have to find something better than style to prove the case. What would really help would be proof that the artist's work was part of the original dataset used to train the AI. That would definitely help.""
Best of luck getting that proof, said Eve Gaumond, a Quebec-based researcher in information technology law. She said AI companies would be extremely reluctant to open their datasets to scrutiny, even if they managed to retain them.
""The company would argue the dataset is proprietary information,"" she said. ""And in any case, you'd be talking about millions and millions of images. Tech companies tend to move fast and break things, so they don't necessarily preserve all aspects of their development processes.""
Tech companies also tend to have deep pockets. Artists seldom do. Gaumond predicts stock image companies will be the ""first out of the gate"" with lawsuits alleging copyright violation through generative AI.
""They're the ones whose images are being ripped off and they've got the resources to take a case all the way,"" she said.
But because Canada is a little fish in a big copyright pond, said Lebrun, many decisions about the legal status of generative AI may be settled abroad. ""The principal problem facing any artist in this situation is jurisdiction,"" he said. ""This isn't happening in Quebec. It's happening in California, mostly. This is an international issue. It's international data.""
So keep an eye on that Warhol case in the U.S. Even though it doesn't deal directly with generative AI, it's a rare instance of the U.S. Supreme Court touching on the law of fair use. Given the United States' vast cultural footprint, any significant changes to the court's interpretation could have ripple effects worldwide.
But until it does, and until Canadian courts start generating case law of their own, the legal status of AI art remains a blank canvas.

You want success over the coming months and years? The number-one way to get there is through people — building businesses through their creativity, passion, and full participation in decision-making.


But right behind empowered people is the number-two vital ingredient for success: data. Data that can reveal to you what your customers want, how your business is running, and what’s around the corner. Now, we have the key that unlocks the patterns that have long been hidden away in databases and applications. The question is: are we paying enough to the care and feeding of this data?

“Some may think it’s a magical line of code that all of a sudden makes a process much faster,” says Moses Guttmann, CEO and co-founder of ClearML. “But in reality, AI requires meaningful data to make noticeable improvements and drive commercial innovation.”

PROMOTED
It turns out that data may even be a finite resource. One study out of Aston University predicts that we’re quickly running out of storage space for all the data being generated. Plus, there’s even the specter of running out of general training data, as recently reported by MIT Technology Review’s Tammy Xu.

But let’s keep things at the enterprise level for now, where lack of data is already proving to be the most vexing roadblock to AI. Succeeding with AI requires “availability and access to data; and understanding how to apply that data to specific use cases to improve business outcomes,” says Umesh Sachdev, co-founder and CEO at Uniphore.

Successful AI “requires data diversity,’ says IDC analyst Ritu Jyoti in a report from earlier in 2022. “Similarly, the full transformative impact of AI can be realized by using a wide range of data types. Adding layers of data can improve accuracy of models and the eventual impact of applications. For example, a consumer's basic demographic data provides a rough sketch of that person. If you add more context such as marital status, education, employment, income, and preferences like music and food choices, a more complete picture starts to form. With additional insights from recent purchases, current location, and other life events, the portrait really comes to life.”

To enable AI to scale and proliferate across the enterprise, “stakeholders must ensure a solid data foundation that enables the full cycle of data management, embrace advanced analytical methods to realize the untapped value of data,” says Shub Bhowmick, co-founder and CEO of Tredence.
“In terms of data availability and access, businesses need a way to parse through huge tracts of data and surface what’s relevant for a particular application,” says Sachdev. “Is the data easily contained and categorized? Is there enough relevant data to form a meaningful assessment? Consider virtual learning — do educators have enough relevant data from student interactions to make meaningful adjustments to how classroom content is taught?”
A quality dataset “is crucial to supporting successful AI, as models are only as good as the data put into them,” says Guttmann. “This idea of data quality is an important part of having a solution that delivers consistent results, and this also needs to be understood ahead of adoption. Not enough decision makers understand that AI is a never-ending process and also that as the data changes, the AI needs to adopt those changes in tandem.”
For most businesses today, “it is a struggle to tap the immense value present in the data they generate daily,” says Bhowmick. “Hence integrating sufficient business context and change management practices is critical to get the interplay between scale and innovation right. Businesses can have a tangible, measurable impact on their bottom line by using the right data models to operationalize their AI investments. Building an AI-led connected intelligence has never been more cohesive, from demand forecasting and stock alerts to IoT-based remote monitoring for patients. That's just one of the many ways businesses realize AI investments' benefits — by connecting insights to action and value.”
IDC’s Jyoti makes the following recommendations to strengthen the data backbone essential for AI:


Enable data from both internal and external sources. “Machine learning models need the most relevant data, which may not always be inside the organization,” Jyoti points out. “Internal data only allows companies to see their own operations or customer information. That doesn't provide a complete picture. Companies need access to secure data sharing. Create a workflow for bringing in third-party and or net-new data sources into the organization, including testing, buying, and seamless integration with existing internal data sets and processes.”
Bring in data expertise. “Build a talent pool of industry domain and technical experts like data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.”
Develop a data strategy. “Get employee buy-in and trust for the data strategy with inclusivity and transparency,” Jyoti advises. “Embrace an intelligent data grid that helps automate and enforce universal data and usage policies across multicloud ecosystems. The grid also should “automate how data is discovered, cataloged, and enriched for users,” as well as “automate how to access, update, and unify data spread across distributed data and cloud landscapes without the need of doing any data movement or replication.”

Elon Musk has been promising to introduce fully autonomous driving features in his Tesla vehicles for the last eight years. Significant progress has been made in this direction, primarily by businesses other than Tesla. But it's still too far off in the future to be drinking chai as an autopilot takes us from Marina Beach to Mylapore..On another front, we could have made fantastic — or, depending on how you look at it, horrifying — progress. Today, AI is capable of writing competent code, creating protein structures and product strategies, writing scripts, picturing our pathetic bodies as ripped superhero avatars, creating cinema, and performing music. All this in a fraction of the time it would take a professional using modern tools to be only somewhat skilled. Your daughter Paromita, who plans to work in software engineering, may have a better employment outlook than your plumber Perumal, according to recent news reports. So, Generative AI is about to make your job obsolete, maybe or maybe not?.This decade will go down in AI history with the emergence of generative AI technology. This nebulous phrase distinguishes AI models that produce writing, music, and visuals from those that make judgments or predictions..The generative AI models for text and images that have been introduced this year are more than competent. The Gofundme initiative to safeguard artists against AI technology, which last week alone collected US$150,000, serves as proof. For example, a survey from the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2025, machines will eliminate 85 million jobs while also creating 97 million new employment roles..Whole jobs are seldom eliminated by technology. Technologies just automate tasks and lessen the labor-intensive aspects of jobs in practice. An acre of land was once daily ploughed by a farmer and his oxen. The same farmer can now plow 15 acres in the same amount of time with a tractor. Knowledge labor will have a comparable rate of productivity growth thanks to generative AI systems. Additionally, they will make some equipment and abilities outdated in the process. Increased employment frequently results from such productivity improvements and the accompanying profit. In the US, this was the situation. In 11 occupations that are thought to be at risk from AI, employment rates increased on average by 13% between 2008 and 2018..Additionally, brand-new employment categories are created by new technology. Before the airplane, there were no pilots. It is difficult to predict what new job categories generative AI will ultimately produce. Many ideas motivate engineering, one of which may be determining the best approach to convey your objective to an AI. I'm not convinced. First, this function is more analogous to a psychologist, as Andrej Karpathy, an AI researcher, has noted. Second, all we want is another AI that converts sentences from everyday language into more detailed prompt inquiries that generative AI models like. Therefore, don't waste your time honing talents for a job you'll never have..To comprehend how future humans and AI would cooperate on cognitive activities, some have proposed a three-step procedure. The demand originates from humans, who then consult an AI system for a list of choices, choose the best fit, and further modify it to suit their needs. This framework is useful. But take note that the structure of cognitive value generation in institutions is not changing as a result of AI..In the future, there might not be much of a reason to hire and train young employees. The children, though, I believe will be well. The paradigm of how one gains expertise currently exists is going to be destroyed. We urgently need to revamp both our established job pathways and our educational institutions. ChatGPT creates MBA essays with a B+ mark on specialized subjects like relational contracts. Teachers in high schools and professors in colleges are about to have a bad surprise..How can Humanity Survive in a Future Dominated by AI?.The solution is to develop your humanity. Workplace value will increase for traits like agency, dedication, empathy, and perserverance. The drawback is that we frequently develop these qualities in our first employment. Because it is practically hard to start as junior staff, I'm not sure where we may get them..Thoughtfully considering your clients and co-workers, your profession, and its role in the world, and learning the finer points of its knowledge base should serve as a general prescription for success for everyone. As a software developer, writing boilerplate code won't get you very far. Start learning about algorithmic complexity, delay, and clear abstractions instead. There will generally be less of a need to put up with the shrewd but volatile sorts on the job. Therefore, perhaps a little humility and friendship are required for those of us with white-collar occupations. The generative AI celebration is just getting started, and it will be eccentric..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Companies, commentators and even sci-fi movies can't stop talking about artificial intelligence (AI).Indeed, AI in the real world is far from the artificial intelligence villains you might recall from your favorite sci-fi flick.This article will break down what artificial intelligence is, how it works and how it's used in the real world. It will also explore AI technology's benefits and potential downsides now and in the near future.



Artificial intelligence explainedArtificial intelligence is the computer simulation of human intelligence. It's programming one or more machines to act in a way that mimics or replicates human behavior. AI breakthroughs are tied to computer science and programming languages, and applications of AI are scalable to simplify workflows across various industries.Depending on the AI program or software used, it can more or less act similarly to someone doing the same task when viewed from the outside as an observer.In general, AI is about creating software that is ""smart"" enough to do complex tasks without excessive human intervention or direction.Indeed, AI researchers want to program computers to rationalize and think semi-independently. In this way, AI computers and software will likely be able to solve problems faster and better than humans can.Artificial intelligence is closely connected to machine learning models, a technology that allows machines and computer programs to learn from and adapt the data without human assistance.For example, a software program could be created (in theory) to run several tests, take the results from those tests, and come to conclusions or better processes without a human having to interfere or direct it.


Artificial intelligence is not about building anything you may have seen in science-fiction stories, like killer robots, war machines and similar constructions. Rather, it's usually about maximizing efficiency, productivity and profit. Most AI research and AI development focus on use cases in the financial, business, supply chain, cybersecurity and healthcare industries.Related: 3 Ways Machine Learning Can Help Entrepreneurs What does AI really mean?For most people, AI means that computers are becoming more intelligent and capable without human direction.It's all based on the idea that human intelligence can be defined and then mimicked so that software can reliably emulate it, even to the point where humans can't tell whether they are talking to a machine or a real person.In some cases, this is already true. Many people get fooled by ordinary customer service chatbot messaging or similar intelligent systems, which have enough preprogrammed sentences and responses that they can feel relatively lifelike.However, AI researchers and machine learning software programmers are focused more on making types of artificial intelligence that can do more profound, more complex work and emulate human intelligence more comprehensively.In a certain sense, humanity has reached the pinnacle of simple machine technology and inventions. With machines that can do precise tasks and carry out complex commands (if programmed correctly), the next phase in machine development is creativity, initiative and complex ""thought.""This doesn't mean that AI will replace humans in all aspects, nor will artificial intelligence spell the end of the human race. It does, however, mean that many new technological advancements could be in the future.


These AI system advancements include:Neural networks that mimic the activity of the human brain.Deep learning algorithms.Natural language processing and speech recognition AI algorithms.New ways to automate systems.Decision-making capabilities.Real-time computer vision overlays or screens.Related: 5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Already Influencing Your Daily Life and You Don't Even Know It Why is AI important?In a practical sense, artificial intelligence is essential for various specific goals and objectives.For example, artificial intelligence software may allow enterprises to understand the enormous quantities of data they collect on their target consumers and customers. In this way, businesses can make better decisions about their marketing campaigns, their products and much more.Alternatively, artificial intelligence could be critical because AI-powered machines could do some tasks better than humans, especially when it comes to repetitive or detailed-oriented tasks.For instance, a computer can read mountains of legal documents much more quickly and accurately than even the savviest legal mind, and it can come to some conclusions to provide to lawyers later on.AI is important because:It represents the ability to improve or innovate in industries without much innovation.It may allow humans to exceed current productive capacities even further, meaning more significant profits and more efficient production for businesses and industries.Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide


How does artificial intelligence work?AI works, in essence, like this:A programmer writes a software program using complex, comprehensive and clever language.That software program includes the capability to ""learn"" from experience, usually by recording event outcomes and changing its behavior in response. This is essentially what machine learning is.The software program then tailors its behavior according to its experience, its predictions for future events and what it needs to do.AI programming uses separate cognition skills to facilitate this behavior. Learning processes allow the AI program to acquire data and make rules for using that data to do actions.Artificial intelligence programs use reasoning processes to use suitable algorithms and reach specific objectives or outcomes. Self-correction processes are leveraged to rework or fine-tune algorithms and constantly strive for more accurate or desirable results.Naturally, this software process is highly complex and resource intensive. Therefore, artificial intelligence technology is only possible in specific contexts and for certain organizations.Generally, real AI (as far as it has been developed) is only available to large enterprises and institutions like the government. AI technology uses specially designed hardware, such as special chips, servers and processors, to facilitate its actions.In theory, as technology and hardware get better, and people develop new ways to write software creatively, the capabilities of artificial intelligence will continue to grow and expand.Artificial intelligence typesTechnically, artificial intelligence can be classified into several different types. The two broadest types are:Narrow or weak AI. Narrow AI is artificial intelligence designed to complete or accommodate very specific tasks. Some examples of limited artificial intelligence include weather app assistants, chatbots and other digital aids, as well as specialized software intended to analyze data and optimize business functions.General or strong AI. General artificial intelligence is closer to the imagined version of AI in sci-fi flicks. It's not yet fully realized, but it's intended to be more versatile and flexible than its narrow counterpart. In theory, general AI can do anything necessary, not just one or two tasks very well.However, artificial intelligence can also be categorized differently based upon intended function and specific capabilities. These types include:


Reactive AI uses algorithms to optimize objectives or outputs based on specified inputs from human users. Examples include chess-playing AIs.Limited memory AI adapts to past experiences and updates itself based on new data or observations. Examples include autonomous vehicles (or the programs that drive them).Theory of mind AI is supposedly fully adaptive and can learn from past experiences. It includes some of the most advanced chatbots that can pass the Turing Test (named after the inventor of the computer, Alan Turing), though they are not self-aware. The Turing Test classifies any machine capable of engaging in conversation with a human without being detected as a machine as demonstrating human intelligence.Self-aware AI is theoretically conscious and aware of its existence, like humans. Self-aware AI has yet to be created.How can artificial intelligence be used?There are practically no limits to how you can use AI solutions as they are developed and implemented in organizations.Nowadays, AI gets used in various industries, and not just as publicity machines like IBM's Deep Blue or Watson, which famously won a game of Jeopardy! as an artificial general intelligence.Related: 5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Radically Transforming Creativity in Business HealthcareIn the healthcare industry, artificial intelligence is used to assist with healthcare diagnostics, such as identifying diseases or ailments in patients. That's because AI can often rival humans at locating and identifying anomalies or issues in diagnostic scans.In the healthcare industry, AI is also helpfully utilized to track and maintain patient records, handle health insurance claims and even classify hospital patients quickly and efficiently.Driving and machine operationAutonomous vehicles like those from Tesla also heavily use modern artificial intelligence programs.With self-driving cars, AI may eventually learn from other drivers, fine-tune its own safety practices and drive more safely than even the most experienced human, all while maintaining faster response times due to its computerized nature.In addition, the manufacturing and industrial sectors often use limited machine learning or AI software to operate machines requiring incredible precision and repetition.


Related: What's Under the 'Hood' of Self-Driving Cars? Financial applicationsThe financial industry can use artificial intelligence to analyze stocks, market trends and other economic activity, thus allowing brokers and fund managers to make better decisions on behalf of their clients. This is similar to algorithmic trading and has been increasingly common in recent years.AI is good at this because it can take a lot of information, analyze it quickly and come to accurate conclusions based on past data sets. AI uses expert systems to improve pricing and similar actions over time.GamingYou can use artificial intelligence programs to make gaming bots or nonplayer characters, also known as NPCs. AI intelligence is getting better in this arena all the time — modern bots can simulate some of the motions or behaviors of human players very realistically by simulating the human mind.Related: 3 Surprising Ways That Video Game Companies Leverage AI User assistanceNaturally, artificial intelligence programs are already being used for general user assistance purposes, such as Amazon Alexa. Siri, Cortana, and other basic AI programs will likely become even more sophisticated and intelligent as time goes on.Virtual assistants are already among the most commonly used types of AI computer systems and maybe eventually replace personal assistants.Data analysisYou can use artificial intelligence for general data analysis across various industries. Many large organizations already leverage machine learning or AI platforms and programs to understand their data sets. Google famously uses artificial intelligence to understand its billions of users' queries and search patterns.


The benefits of AIMany people are excited for artificial intelligence technology to grow even further, primarily because of its potential advantages.For example, artificial intelligence programs tend to be much better at detail-oriented jobs than humans, as there is less of a chance that these programs would miss details due to fatigue or human error. This can significantly reduce the time needed for data-heavy tasks, and artificial intelligence programs are already better at analyzing big chunks of data than humans.In addition, AI can deliver more consistent results with fewer errors than human counterparts. Machines like AI don't break or make mathematical errors as often as humans, plain and simple.Some businesses are also looking into AI to replace specific jobs because AI-powered chatbots, virtual agents and customer service agents are always available 24/7, allowing them to respond to customer complaints quickly and easily, around the clock.In a broad sense, AI will allow businesses to make more money, save more and deliver better customer results. The same is true for hospitals, governments and other large organizations that have a lot to do and rely on taking advantage of big data sets.Related: AI Gives Outdated Industries a Makeover The downsides of AIThat all said, AI does have some downsides that it needs to overcome.For starters, artificial intelligence is universally expensive. This is why only some organizations, like the U.S. government, Google and other big enterprises, can fully take advantage of its technology and benefits.


In addition, AI usually requires deep technical expertise to leverage it effectively. This requires having the staff on hand to use, edit and repair AI software or technology from time to time, which only adds to its operating expenses.Furthermore, since AI is still relatively unproven and still being developed, only a limited number of workers have the qualifications to build AI tools or monitor AI programs.Since artificial intelligence hasn't reached its full potential, it can't maintain or repair itself, meaning it is liable to have issues or ""break down"" in specific contexts.Given all these flaws, it's no surprise why artificial intelligence hasn't yet taken over many industries and sectors, despite its purported importance and power.SummaryArtificial intelligence isn't a computerized bogeyman out to ruin the world. AI is also not a one-size-fits-all solution for the world's problems. Rather, artificial intelligence is a valuable software tool that businesses and individuals can leverage for their goals.In the future, artificial intelligence may evolve in a somewhat unpredictable direction, offering even more benefits to organizations that take advantage of it.

GDP is calculated by adding up the value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year. This includes the value of goods and services produced by both the government and the private sector. GDP is typically measured in monetary terms, using current market prices for goods and services. GDP is used as a measure of the size and strength of an economy, as well as its overall level of economic activity. It is often used to compare the economies of different countries and to track economic growth over time.

There are several traditional ways to increase the GDP:




Encourage innovation and entrepreneurship: Encouraging people to start their own businesses and come up with new ideas can lead to the creation of new products and services, increasing the size of the economy.
Promote free trade: Removing barriers to trade can allow for a greater exchange of goods and services, leading to increased economic growth.
Invest in education and training: By investing in education and training, individuals can develop new skills and knowledge, leading to greater productivity and economic growth.
Foster a supportive business environment: A supportive business environment, including access to capital, regulatory support, and a skilled workforce, can encourage businesses to start and grow, leading to economic growth.
Promote sustainable development: Sustainable development, which takes into account economic, social, and environmental factors, can lead to long-term economic growth.
Encourage collaboration and cooperation: By fostering a culture of collaboration and cooperation, businesses and individuals can work together to create new opportunities, leading to economic growth.




All of the above rely upon a skilled human workforce to increase the size of the economy. Generally speaking, a larger population tends to correspond with a larger economy, all else being equal. This is because a larger population can provide a larger pool of labor, consumers, and producers, which can contribute to economic growth. For example, a larger population may allow for a greater diversity of goods and services to be produced, as there will be a larger demand for these goods and services from the larger population. A larger population may also allow for economies of scale to be achieved, in which the cost of producing a good or service decreases as the volume of production increases.
Now, let's explore what happens if AI race enters the world. How does this new species contribute towards GDP? One way to size the economy is to multiply GDP per capita by the human workforce. So, the size of an economy is limited by the number of working beings. What if the number of working beings becomes unlimited by including the ‘AI beings’ as part of the workforce? Do we start to approach a limitless economy - an economy that has no bounds on its GDP? Let’s delve into this by learning the impact of existing (non-AI) robots in the industry as a small step towards the AI workforce-based limitless economy.
PROMOTED
Robots already contribute to the economy in several ways:


Increased Productivity: Robots can work 24/7 without getting tired or needing breaks, resulting in increased productivity and output. This can lead to increased profits for businesses and contribute to economic growth.
Job Creation: While robots can replace certain jobs, they can also create new jobs in the fields of programming, maintenance, and supervision.
Cost Reduction: Automation can lead to cost savings for businesses through reduced labor costs and increased efficiency. These savings can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, which can stimulate economic activity.
Increased Efficiency: Robots can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in various industries. This can lead to increased competitiveness and economic growth.
Innovation: The development and use of robots can lead to technological innovation and advances in various fields, which can drive economic growth.


Extrapolating the impact of robots on the size of an economy, we can say that the AI workforce can contribute to the economy by increasing productivity, reducing labor costs, and improving decision-making processes. AI can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Additionally, AI can analyze data and make informed decisions, helping companies make better business decisions and increase profits. The development and implementation of AI technologies can also create jobs and stimulate economic growth. However, the extent to which the AI workforce contributes to GDP will depend on various factors, such as the size and adoption of the AI workforce, the type of tasks being performed, and the overall economic conditions of the country. Overall, the integration of AI into the workforce can lead to increased competitiveness and growth for businesses and the economy.

But it is still a complex question whether AI workers should be counted towards GDP. On the one hand, AI workers can contribute to economic productivity and efficiency by performing tasks faster and more accurately than human workers. This can potentially lead to increased profits and economic growth. On the other hand, AI workers do not require wages or benefits and do not contribute directly to the consumption of goods and services, which are key components of GDP.

There are also ethical considerations to take into account. If AI workers are counted towards GDP, this could potentially lead to increased unemployment and wage stagnation for human workers. There is also the question of whether AI workers should be considered entities with rights and protections similar to human workers.

In summary, AI has the potential to increase the GDP and eventually lead to a limitless economy. But ultimately, the decision to count AI workers towards GDP should be made after carefully weighing the potential economic and ethical impacts. Whatever the outcome of Ai species landing in the world, it is clear that we will see a step-function impact on the economy.
