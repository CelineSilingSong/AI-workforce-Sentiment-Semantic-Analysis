In 2017 companies spent around $22bn on AI-related mergers and acquisitions, about 26 times more than in 2015. The McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank within a consultancy, reckons that just applying AI to marketing, sales and supply chains could create economic value, including profits and efficiencies, of $2.7trn over the next 20 years.

We live in amazing times. Driverless cars, drones delivering packages and chatbots taking our fast food orders. In fact, this entire “thing” of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is now being called the next industrial revolution. And it does not come without a lot of fear about a large workforce losing its jobs and means of making a living.

When the first industrial revolution hit, factories and mass production drew workers to the cities in droves. Manufacturing put individual craftsmen out of business. Consumers could get products cheaper and faster and that was a good thing. Yes, some workers were obviously displaced. But along with the “revolution,” new jobs were created and, over time, employment reached high levels.
Fears about the new robotic revolution
Of course, technology will eliminate many jobs – it has always done so. And predictions about those job losses range from a few million to over a billion, as a recent MIT study revealed.
PROMOTED
Why this variance? Because no one can predict accurately exactly all of the jobs that robots and AI will assume from humans over the next few decades. We just don’t know where the technology will take us.

At the same time, we cannot predict the numbers of new jobs/careers that new technology will create. One study from Gartner Research states that while 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020, 2.3 million new ones will be created.
Even today, there are a huge number of technology jobs that did not exist ten years ago: State-of-the-art programming, data science, web security, marketing and sales. There is no reason to believe that the need for humans to create and manage new technology will decrease.

And in developed countries, with comparative salary data readily available for various industries, far fewer people are willing to enter low-paying work force jobs that require no thinking and that do not allow people to have a decent lifestyle. Young people who graduate high school often have vocational-technical skills that allow them to enter the workforce with skills that are needed. Others opt for vocational-technical or community college programs where they learn to use the latest technology.
China is a prime example. Automation, through robotics and AI, has moved China to a major economic force in the global economy. Because of its focus on automation and new technology, China now exports far more than it imports, and as a result, is having a huge impact on the global supply chain. Smaller countries with less to invest are seeing some negative consequences and they will suffer from the inability to compete. On the other hand, they can take a lesson from countries like India that have moved into areas of technology that are in high demand. There are jobs – the key is the right training of people to work within an environment of robotics and AI.
Humans create and humans control
Robots and AI have been created by humans – they are tools that we can use when we give the right instructions. The point is that humans and technology must work together, humans in control and the technology providing what it is programmed to provide. The idea that technology will replace the need for creative thinking, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork and initiative is rather silly right now. The idea that humans can leverage technology to provide a better world for all of us is not silly, however. It’s fascinating.
Consider this: One of the industries that have seen the greatest disruption of robotics and AI has been medicine. We now have robotic and AI tools that can perform amazingly accurate diagnoses and precise surgery. Have we lost doctors to this technology? The answer is “no.” Doctors have simply learned to leverage the new technology to provide better healthcare.
Finding your place in a robotic world
Robots and AI will certainly replace jobs – boring, dangerous, and dirty ones mostly. Consider coal mining for example. How many people still want to go down into a mineshaft and dig out coal? How many want to subject themselves to black lung disease and a host of other health problems from that job? This is why coal mining towns are dying out. Young people in these towns are moving on to the brighter job prospects. And technology is taking over what’s left of the mining industry. Green energy is taking over, and with it, a host of new, clean jobs and careers. It’s the march of civilization that will never cease.
Those entering the workforce today will have to be adaptable. They'll have to be hungry for knowledge and committed to continuing education whether that's by taking an online MBA, attending conferences, reading books, consuming podcasts or taking traditional advanced degrees. What robots can do is make humans more productive than ever before. Workers will need to develop technical skills and keep those skills updated as technology moves forward. Those who do not want to deal with technology need to pursue careers where it is not as much a factor or where demand for human skills and talents remains high.Andrew ArnoldI am a writer and lifestyle entrepreneur.

Rather than being a disruptor, artificial intelligence will amplify the human ingenuity of Singapore’s greatest asset – her people.
By Richard Koh, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Singapore
This article was first published in The Business Times on 26 March 2018.
Today, our morning routines will probably see us checking our smartphones for updates on the latest news headlines and updates of our friends’ social lives. You read the work emails arrived overnight, text your sister to confirm dinner plans, and perhaps check traffic conditions as you head to work.
In 2038, or probably earlier, digital devices will help us do more with one of our most precious commodities: time. At Microsoft, we imagine a world where your personal digital assistants such as Microsoft’s Cortana will be trained to anticipate our needs, help manage our schedule, prepare us for meetings, assist as we plan our social lives, reply to and route communications, and drive cars.
Artificial intelligence will enable breakthrough advances in areas like healthcare, agriculture, education and transportation. It is already happening in impressive ways.
In the office, AI is already helping companies understand customers better by analysing their preference and consumption patterns. In the fields, AI is helping farmers analyse weather patterns and soil conditions to help optimise their harvest. At home, smart devices such as lighting control and music players work together to provide the perfect ambience to unwind after a long day.
Beyond becoming the catalyst for some of the most dramatic changes in the way we live, work and play today, embracing AI will yield both economic and societal benefits.
By 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated US$10 billion to Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to a study released last month by research firm IDC, in partnership with Microsoft. The study also found that digital transformation will boost growth by an additional 0.6 per cent annually; and this will accelerate as digital technologies and services are enabled by AI, along with the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics.
The projected economic growth is possible with businesses adopting transformative technologies, of which AI is a central piece. In this future economy, new startups will sprout even as traditional businesses find new niches to grow into.
But as we have witnessed over the past 20 years, new technology also inevitably raises complex questions and broad societal concerns.
How do we ensure that AI is designed and used responsibly? How do we establish ethical principles to protect people? How should we govern its use? And how will AI impact employment and jobs?
To answer these tough questions, technologists will need to work closely with government, academia, business, civil society and other stakeholders. At Microsoft, we identified six ethical principles – fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability – to guide the cross-disciplinary development and use of artificial intelligence. The better we understand these or similar issues — and the more technology developers and users can share best practices to address them — the better served the world will be as we contemplate societal rules to govern AI.
We must also pay attention to AI’s impact on workers. One constant over 250 years of technological change has been the ongoing impact of technology on jobs — the creation of new jobs, the elimination of existing jobs and the evolution of job tasks and content.
Some key conclusions are emerging.
First, the companies and countries that will fare best in the AI era will be those that embrace these changes rapidly and effectively. This is because new jobs and economic growth will come to those that embrace the technology, not those that resist or delay adopting it.
Second, while we believe that AI will help solve big societal problems, we must look to this future with a critical eye. There will be challenges as well as opportunities. We must address the need for strong ethical principles, the evolution of laws, training for new skills and even labour market reforms. This must all come together if we are going to make the most of AI.
Third, we need to act with a sense of shared responsibility because AI will not be created by the tech sector alone. At Microsoft, we are working to democratise AI in a manner that is similar to how we made the PC available to everyone. This means we are creating tools to make it easy for every developer, business and government to build AI-based solutions and accelerate the benefit to society.
All of this leads us to what may be one of the most important conclusions of all. Skilling-up for an AI-powered world involves more than science, technology, engineering and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions. If AI is to reach its potential in serving humans, then every engineer will need to learn more about the liberal arts and every liberal arts major will need to learn more about engineering.
Singapore’s ability to nurture a future-ready workforce will be key to thriving in the digital economy, one where digital products and services will make up 60 per cent of our economy. We need to constantly reassess and prepare ourselves for a future that appears to be shaping up differently each time you take another look at the crystal ball.
Yet, that concept is not new to Singapore, a young country that has both experienced and embraced change over the years. Singapore’s success has always depended on the skill, intelligence and determination of its people. Aided by AI, this human ingenuity will be even more important in the years ahead.
With AI, we have more power at our fingertips than entire generations that came before us. The questions will be what we will do with it.

Predictions are big business. The market for predictive analytics is expected to reach $12.4 Billion by 2022 as Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread in Demand Planning organizations. But we’re not losing our jobs – don’t worry – because even though a lot of the analytical work will be automated, new roles are emerging to implement and manage AI, and interpret the findings. Here are the four types of AI in Demand Planning, and the new roles required to leverage them.1. Limited Memory AIToday, most Limited Memory Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications rely on an age-old premise: use vast stores of historical data together with current observations to predict future outcomes. A Demand Planner calculating the base forecast on a product is likely to use past sales to trend as a starting point. Depending on the number of products in a portfolio, this task could be executed efficiently without the use of AI applications, say for instance in a small enterprise. However, for large organisations such as multinationals, Limited Memory AI could execute this task with speed and accuracy providing live or on demand recommendations for review by the Demand Planner.For any organization, investments in technology must provide a Return on Investment, with any decisions on AI implementation first requiring an extensive review of data stores to ensure they meet the required standard. Garbage in garbage out still applies and if you want quality data, you need a human.Working In Reactive AI: Demand Planners with an interest in the technical aspects of the role may specialize as Demand Planning Scientists with a focus on Data Management and algorithm development, optimisation and maintenance. This function would support the initial preparation of data, selection and fine-tuning of the organization’s specific algorithms.2. Reactive AIReactive AI, a second type of application, could also support Demand Planners. Scenario Planning and one-off decisions, which combines multiple information sources together, benefits launch and promotional planning where historical trending is not possible. Reliability of this proposition would depend on the extent of connectivity between the organization and it’s customers or key partners. Inputs could be drawn virtually from various stakeholders when scenarios are triggered as part of automated workflow processes.Working In Reactive AI: Demand Planners could specialize in this area as Launch & Promo Planners. Successful collaboration with other departments has always been a differentiator of top talent in this area. Weak AI deployed in Limited Memory and Reactive applications do not offer direct substitutes for this aspect of human capability.3. Theory Of Mind AIDeveloped social characteristics of human communication and trust have proven difficult to replicate in AI. The Theory of Mind category of these applications deliver outcomes based on predictions of how people will behave within a given environment through perception of that environment and those within it. Where technological advancement of this type enables AI to read body language and interpret non-verbal cues to inform decision-making, opportunity may arise in collaborative forecasting processes.Working With Theory Of Mind AI: AI assistants trained to work with teams may be well placed to provide a second opinion. Managerial and strategic skills would enable Demand Planners to thrive in such scenarios. Those individuals with the required capabilities may be qualified to be promoted to Demand Manager, overseeing AI decision recommendations, validating them and making the last call.4. Self-Aware AIAI in the fourth category is differentiated from the others based on its self-awareness capability, which draws on internal concepts of feelings and uses these additionally in the outcomes produced. This type of AI does not exist in the full capacity of that category definition, although strides are being made. To replace Demand Planners, AI would need those skills and more. Instinct, intuition, creativity to generate new ideas, social energy and charisma to influence are characteristics humans themselves are unable to quantify – far less replicate. These allow new ways of doing things and decisions to be taken outside of information that is available or could be generated. These include, for example, unprecedented events and rapid changes in consumer tastes including those for food or emerging fashion trends. [bar id=”527″] Working With Self-Aware AI: There’s is no new Demand Planner role for the type of AI (yet, anyway). That’s because in these circumstances, data does not usually exist. In professions where errors translate into costs such as lost sales and inventory builds, AI would excel in driving quality of information, automating mundane tasks, providing secondary opinions and recommendations. It could succeed under supervision, which would create a new Demand Planning role. How much time is committed to this would determine the viability of the application and the role. For those aspects of human nature, which enable social interaction, AI would fail and create a void in organizational cultures that could be detrimental to creativity, engagement and performance. [For jobs in Demand Planning, Predictive Analytics and S&OP, check out IBF’s jobs board]        TweetShareSharePin0 Shares AIartificial intelligencedemand planning jobsPrevious ArticleHow To Balance Demand & Supply In OmnichannelNext ArticlePredictive Analytics: Real Life Use CasesRelated PostsIn New Product Forecasting, Human Beats MachineOlga GerasymchukSeptember 9, 2019Beware The Pitfalls Of AI In Demand PlanningDaniel FitzpatrickFebruary 16, 20215 Laws Of Demand Planning You (& Executives) Must Never ForgetEric Wilson, ACPFDecember 17, 2018My “Future Shock” with ChatGPTPatrick BowerFebruary 14, 2023AI Is a Forecasting Silver Bullet, So Why Aren’t You Using It?Yuan ShenDecember 10, 2018Will AI Revolutionize Demand Planning?

Artificial Intelligence and Asian Security


Event Recap


  March 27th, 2018

  
  



On March 27, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) hosted a public discussion entitled, Drones, Bots, and Smart Weapons: Artificial Intelligence and Asian Security. The panel discussion from the event can be watched above. It features Joshua Marcuse, Executive Director of the Defense Innovation Board, Office of the Secretary of Defense; Dr. Heather Roff, Associate Fellow at the University of Cambridge Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence; R. Shashank Reddy, Research Analyst at Carnegie India; Dr. Heigo Sato, Professor and Vice President of the Institute of World Affairs at Takushoku University; and moderator Lindsey Ford, ASPI's Director for Political-Security Affairs. (58 min., 29 sec.)
Ambassador Amandeep Singh Gill, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament and the Chair of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems, delivered keynote remarks at the event. He delivered his remarks remotely, via a live video feed. Below is an unedited transcript of the speech.   
Keynote Remarks by Amb. Amandeep Singh Gill
Thank you Lindsey. I am grateful to Asia Society for this opportunity and I am delighted to see the distinguished panelists you have gathered for this discussion. Professor Sato, Dr. Heather Roff, Shashank, it is good to be thinking about this issue with you again.
Whether it was the socially-disruptive cross bow in medieval times or the dual use horse stirrups that allowed the Mongols to stand erect and shoot, technology has always mattered in the security space. Paradigm-shifting advances such as nuclear weapons can even rewrite security strategies. As battlespaces expand to cover the globe, as the speed of engagement accelerates and as peer-powers compete in information-degraded battle environments thousands of miles away from the home-base, autonomy, and intelligent autonomy in particular, will rise in salience. If nuclear weapons helped rewrite strategy – just think of Brodie, Kissinger, Kahn, Wohlstetter, autonomy might also change the way humans relate to weapons. Throughout the history of conflict, the weapon and the wielder have been separate. What happens when the weapon becomes the wielder? Who do the laws of war apply to and how? But it is the potential shock and awe of swarms of intelligent autonomous systems “learning” their way through defences that is focusing a lot of minds in the security space.
Some of that focus is on compatibility and compliance with the laws of war or IHL, some on what lethal autonomous systems mean for strategic stability, crisis stability, arms race stability and good old fashioned proliferation, including to non-state actors as well as some on potential shifts in thinking about the distinction between war and peace, the lowering of the threshold for use of force in international relations – in other words are some countries going to be more trigger happy if body-bags are replaced by mangled metal? Then there is no other sector, with the exception perhaps of the cyber domain, where the commercial stakes are so high and so intertwined with the security stakes. As important and cut-throat as the military edge is the economic edge as advanced economies try to squeeze out an extra percentage point of growth and as the emerging economies attempt catch up with leapfrogging technologies. If we look at the dozen or so countries with the relevant upstream capabilities –U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, France, Russia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Israel – you see this entanglement at work. Eight of these eleven by the way are in the Asia-Pacific region.
In the context of the Group that I chair in Geneva in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, we are looking at the risks associated with the potential deployment of autonomous intelligent systems in weapons capabilities and whether these risks can be managed within existing legal frameworks and how or whether some explicit rules of the road – political or legal – prohibitions and/or regulations are required. Our mandate is such that we have to look at emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems, in other words we have to focus on the novel, the unexpected, not just what is quantitatively different but what is qualitatively different from existing weapon systems. We are not looking so much at discrete, countable, “feelable” systems as we are at the penetration of AI/AS into weapons capabilities. As I am fond of saying, we are neither going far back into the past in terms of legacy systems nor are we going far into the future in Hollywoodian terms.
This focus on the mandate for the GGE allows me to segue from the why and what of the security dimension to the how of our work.  How are we tackling the humanitarian and international security concerns arising out of lethal autonomy in a multilateral inter-governmental setting? We started last year in a formal sense building on 3 years of informal discussions that were triggered by the first set of reflections on the issue in the human rights context. What the informal meetings in 2014-2016 did was to raise awareness of the complex dimensions of the issue – humanitarian, ethical, military, legal and techno-commercial and to underline the importance of the CCW as a platform for addressing these various dimensions. The CCW sits at the junction of IHL and arms control; it recognises the principle of military necessity alongside the IHL humanitarian principles. Thus it provides comfort to the governmental stakeholders to engage.It has a modular construct and can be updated as the security and technology landscapes evolve. Its rules of procedure allow the participation of a broad range of stakeholders.
I took up the reins in 2017 from my French and German predecessors and started a formal discussion using a Food for Thought paper and other devices of multilateral diplomacy on three specific dimensions – the legal/ethical, the military and the technological. I also brought in a broader set of stakeholders into the conversation, in particular industry as a civil society actor. The gender and age representativeness were strengthened and participation was encouraged from the Global South.  The November 2017 meeting was successful in underlining the appropriateness of the CCW as the venue for dealing with this issue. We also managed to lock in some basic principles as a bedrock on which to build on. They include:

One, IHL continues to apply fully to all weapons systems, including the potential development and use of LAWS;
Two, responsibility for the deployment of any weapons system in armed conflict remains with States and States must ensure accountability for lethal action by any weapon system used by its forces in armed conflict;
Three, given the dual nature of technologies in the area of intelligent autonomous systems that continue to develop rapidly, the work on LAWS should not hamper progress in or access to civilian R&D and use of these technologies;
And, four, given the pace of technology development and uncertainty regarding the pathways for emergence of increased autonomy, there would be need to keep potential military applications of related technologies under review.

Importantly, we also managed to shape an agenda for the future. This is what will guide our work in two weeks from now in April and then again in August.
The three plus one agenda we have developed is as follows:
i)  characterisation of the systems under consideration in order to promote a common understanding on concepts and characteristics relevant to the objectives and purposes of the CCW;
ii) further consideration of the human element in the use of lethal force and further assessment of aspects of the human-machine interaction in the development, deployment and use of emerging technologies in the area of LAWS;
iii) possible options for addressing the humanitarian and international security challenges posed by emerging technologies in the area of LAWS – these options could include a politically-binding declaration, a legally-binding instrument, a moratorium or some other pathway; plus
iv) a review of military applications of related technologies in the context of the Group’s work. I see the last two items – the political and technical aspects if you will – as something of a continuing focus. This year, we hope to be able to make progress on characterisation and the various touch points in the human-machine interface.
Let me conclude by sharing with you my sense of where we are and where we could be at the end of the year based on the consultations I have had so far, bilaterally with thirty odd delegations, with regional groups, NGOs, academics and industry, I am optimistic that we can have a high quality discussion with the participation of all stakeholders as we did last year. And like last year we can capture our work in text that is acceptable to everyone in the room. Thus, we would be able to advance our mandate in a step-by-step and pragmatic manner while ensuring that everyone stays on board. I am particularly heartened by the Working Papers that countries are bringing to the table after extensive inter-agency work in capitals. I am also heartened by the attention our work is garnering, as this event today underlines.

If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure,"" says French President Emmanuel Macron.Laura StevensSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →ApplicationEthicsRegulationEnd UserGovernmentSectorPublic safetyOn Thursday, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, gave a speech laying out a new national strategy for artificial intelligence in his country. The French government will spend €1.5 billion ($1.85 billion) over five years to support research in the field, encourage startups, and collect data that can be used, and shared, by engineers. The goal is to start catching up to the US and China and to make sure the smartest minds in AI—hello Yann LeCun—choose Paris over Palo Alto.Directly after his talk, he gave an exclusive and extensive interview, entirely in English, to WIRED Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Thompson about the topic and why he has come to care so passionately about it.Nicholas Thompson: First off, thank you for letting me speak with you. It was refreshing to see a national leader talk about an issue like this in such depth and complexity. To get started, let me ask you an easy one. You and your team spoke to hundreds of people while preparing for this. What was the example of how AI works that struck you the most and that made you think, ‘Ok, this is going to be really, really important’?Trending NowThe Fascinating Robot That Teaches Itself How to Grab New ObjectsEmmanuel Macron: Probably in healthcare—where you have this personalized and preventive medicine and treatment. We had some innovations that I saw several times in medicine to predict, via better analysis, the diseases you may have in the future and prevent them or better treat you. A few years ago, I went to CES. I was very impressed by some of these companies. I had with me some French companies, but I discovered US, Israeli and other companies operating in the same field. Innovation that artificial intelligence brings into healthcare systems can totally change things: with new ways to treat people, to prevent various diseases, and a way—not to replace the doctors—but to reduce the potential risk.The second field is probably mobility: we have some great French companies and also a lot of US companies performing in this sector. Autonomous driving impresses me a lot. I think these two sectors, I would say, healthcare and mobility, really struck me as promising. It’s impossible when you are looking at these companies, not to say, Wow, something is changing drastically and what you thought was for the next decade, is in fact now. There is a huge acceleration.NT: It seems you’re doing this partly because it is clearly in France’s national interest to be strong in AI. But it also seemed in the speech that you feel like there are French or European values that can help shape the development of AI? Is that correct, and what are those values?AdvertisementEM: I think artificial intelligence will disrupt all the different business models and it’s the next disruption to come. So I want to be part of it. Otherwise I will just be subjected to this disruption without creating jobs in this country. So that’s where we are. And there is a huge acceleration and as always the winner takes all in this field. So that’s why my first objective in terms of education, training, research, and the creation of startups is to streamline a lot of things, to have the adaptable systems, the adapted financing, the adapted regulations, in order to build champions here and to attract the existing champions.Laura StevensBut you’re right at the same time: AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy and our collective preferences. For instance, if you take healthcare: you can totally transform medical care making it much more predictive and personalized if you get access to a lot of data. We will open our data in France. I made this decision and announced it this afternoon. But the day you start dealing with privacy issues, the day you open this data and unveil personal information, you open a Pandora’s Box, with potential use cases that will not be increasing the common good and improving the way to treat you. In particular, it’s creating a potential for all the players to select you. This can be a very profitable business model: this data can be used to better treat people, it can be used to monitor patients, but it can also be sold to an insurer that will have intelligence on you and your medical risks, and could get a lot of money out of this information. The day we start to make such business out of this data is when a huge opportunity becomes a huge risk. It could totally dismantle our national cohesion and the way we live together. This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.When you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the US and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values. That’s exactly the problem you have with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica or autonomous driving. On the other side, Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as US or China. If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution . That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy.The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.NT: So the stakes here in your mind aren’t just French economic growth, it’s the whole value system that will be incorporated into this transformative technology the world over. And you want to make sure that the values you have, your country has, your continent has, are involved in that?Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDEM: Sure, exactly. I want to create an advantage for my country in artificial intelligence, directly. And that’s why we have these announcements made by Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu who choose Paris to create AI labs and research centers: this is very important to me. Second, I want my country to be part of the revolution that AI will trigger in mobility, energy, defense, finance, healthcare and so on. Because it will create value as well. Third, I want AI to be totally federalized. Why? Because AI is about disruption and dealing with impacts of disruption. For instance, this kind of disruption can destroy a lot of jobs in some sectors and create a need to retrain people. But AI could also be one of the solutions to better train these people and help them to find new jobs, which is good for my country, and very important.I want my country to be the place where this new perspective on AI is built, on the basis of interdisciplinarity: this means crossing maths, social sciences, technology, and philosophy. That’s absolutely critical. Because at one point in time, if you don’t frame these innovations from the start, a worst-case scenario will force you to deal with this debate down the line. I think privacy has been a hidden debate for a long time in the US. Now, it emerged because of the Facebook issue. Security was also a hidden debate of autonomous driving. Now, because we’ve had this issue with Uber, it rises to the surface. So if you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries. And I think we are very well equipped to do it, on top of developing the business in my country.But I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy. For instance, we are using artificial intelligence to organize the access to universities for our students That puts a lot of responsibility on an algorithm. A lot of people see it as a black box, they don't understand how the student selection process happens. But the day they start to understand that this relies on an algorithm, this algorithm has a specific responsibility. If you want, precisely, to structure this debate, you have to create the conditions of fairness of the algorithm and of its full transparency. I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm. I have to be able to tell French citizens, “OK, I encouraged this innovation because it will allow you to get access to new services, it will improve your lives—that’s a good innovation to you.” I have to guarantee there is no bias in terms of gender, age, or other individual characteristics, except if this is the one I decided on behalf of them or in front of them. This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. If you don’t deal with it from the very beginning, if you don’t consider it is as important as developing innovation, you will miss something and at a point in time, it will block everything. Because people will eventually reject this innovation.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: So the steps you’re taking to guarantee that is that all of the algorithms developed by the French government will be open, algorithms developed by any company getting money from the French government will also be required to be open?EM: Yes.NT: And is there a third step you’re doing to help guarantee this transparency?I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy.EM: We will increase the collective pressure to make these algorithms transparent. We will open data from government, publicly funded projects, and we will open access from this project and we will favor, incentivize the private players to make it totally public and transparent. Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don't want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens and will say: “I have to better understand your algorithm and be sure that this is trustworthy.” The power of consumption society is so strong that it gets people to accept to provide a lot of personal information in order to get access to services largely driven by artificial intelligence on their apps, laptops and so on. But at some point, as citizens, people will say, “I want to be sure that all of this personal data is not used against me, but used ethically, and that everything is monitored. I want to understand what is behind this algorithm that plays a role in my life.” And I’m sure that a lot of startups or labs or initiatives which will emerge in the future, will reach out to their customers and say “I allow you to better understand the algorithm we use and the bias or non-bias.” I’m quite sure that’s one of the next waves coming in AI. I think it will increase the pressure on private players. These new apps or sites will be able to tell people: “OK! You can go to this company or this app because we cross-check everything for you. It’s safe,"" or on the contrary: “If you go to this website or this app or this research model, it’s not OK, I have no guarantee, I was not able to check or access the right information about the algorithm”.NT: When you talk about how AI will transform democracy, do you imagine a day where you make decisions based on recommendations from AI-based algorithms, where there’s a system that tells you what a labor reform should be and you say, “OK?”EM: At this point, I think it could help you. But it will never replace the way you decide. When you make a decision, it’s the result of a series of cross-checks. AI can help you because sometimes when you pass a reform, you’re not totally clear about the potential effects, direct or indirect, and you can have hesitations. So it can help you to make the right decision. An algorithm is relevant for this part of the equation. For instance, on economic and social reforms, to have a clearer view about direct and indirect measurable effects. But on top of it, when you take a political decision, you need to have a part of personal judgment. That’s the quality of the decision maker, and artificial intelligence will never replace that. And there is a thing that AI could never replace; which is accountability and responsibility. Because this is his decision and will be held accountable for it, a political leader could never say, “OK I’m sorry this decision was bad because it was a decision of an algorithm.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: Let’s get back to disruption for a second. You’ve talked a lot about transportation, you talked about it in your speech. AI is going to massively disrupt transportation, and it’s going to make a lot of people lose their jobs as we go to driverless cars. It will create new jobs, but this is already an area where people in France have been protesting. There were railroad strikes this weekend, there were trucker strikes this fall. Aren’t you taking a huge risk by aligning yourself with a force that is going to disrupt an industry that has already been protesting like crazy?EM: Look, I think in this country---and in a lot of countries---you have a tradition of controversy. I launched a series of reforms that a lot of people thought impossible to be conducted in France. So, I'm absolutely sure it's possible, when you explain to people, when you have the energy and determination, to pass such reforms. I’m certainly not reluctant to do so and I’m certainly not, I would say, upset or threatened by dealing with artificial intelligence and convincing my people of its rightful implementation. As consumers, they are already big fans of artificial intelligence. And big fans of innovative solutions. All the tech guys can tell you that the French market is a very good market. People love technology here. I think that’s why the overall philosophy I have stuck to from the very beginning of my mandate is to say: blocking changes and being focused on protecting jobs is not the right answer. It’s the people you need to protect. You do so by giving them opportunities and by training and retraining them again to get new jobs. Don’t block the change because it’s coming and people will accept it. But try to be at the fore-front of change to better understand it and deal with it. Change can destroy jobs in the very short run, but create new ones in other sectors at the same time.Laura StevensFor me, one of the key issues of artificial intelligence is that it will probably reduce the most replicable and straining human activities. And naturally you will raise a whole range of other opportunities for people with low, middle and high qualifications. The big risk for our society is to increase opportunities only for very highly qualified people and, in a way, very low-qualified workers. It is especially necessary to monitor the qualification of the middle class, because they can be the most disrupted. If I take your examples, that would encompass taxi drivers, people working in the industry, or people working in highly repetitive tasks. So you have to train them either to change their sector of activity or to increase their qualification to work with a machine. We will need people working with machines.For I do not believe that autonomous vehicles will exist without any drivers at all. For me, that’s pure imagination. You already have fully automated programs to drive planes. Therefore we technically could have planes with no pilots. But you still have two pilots in every plane. Even if almost everything is automated. That’s because you need to have responsibility, precisely. So what we will reduce with autonomous cars is the number of risks. What you will reduce is how painful it is to be a driver for a long period of time ; but you will need people to make the critical choice at critical moments for autonomous vehicles. I’m almost sure about that. So AI will change the practice but it will not kill transportation jobs in many cases.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDBottom line, my point is: I can convince my country about change precisely because I embrace it. My role is not to block this change, but to be able to train or retrain people for them to get opportunities in this new world.NT: Got it. I want to ask you a military question. I know that the UN has had discussions on restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons. Do you think machines---artificial intelligence machines---can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention?EM: I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check. And in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties, can reduce until nil the uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it.Blocking changes is not the right answer. You have to protect people and to think about opportunities.NT: Let me ask you about the national competition in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk tweeted some months ago: “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of World War3 in my opinion.” Do you think Musk is overstating it? Or do you think that this is going to get very intense, particularly between the United States and China?EM: I think it will become very intense. I will not be so pessimistic, because I think that the core basis of artificial intelligence is research. And research is global. And I think this artificial intelligence deals with cooperation and competition, permanently. So you need an open world and a lot of cooperation if you want to be competitive. And at a point of time, in some issues, you need competition. But I think you will have to rethink a sort of sovereignty. I addressed that in my speech today. Artificial intelligence is a global innovation scheme in which you have private big players and one government with a lot of data—China. My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI, as I told you at the beginning of this discussion, especially on regulation. You will have sovereignty battles to regulate, with countries trying to defend their collective choices. You will have a trade and innovation fight precisely as you have in different sectors. But I don't believe that it will go to the extreme extents Elon Musk talks about, because I think if you want to progress, there is a huge advantage in an open innovation model.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceNT: So this is a slightly cynical response to that, but let me ask you this: If France starts to build up an AI sector, in some ways it’s competitive to Google and Facebook. So won’t there be an incentive for Europe and for France to regulate Facebook and Google in ever-tougher ways? Doesn’t it create a strange dynamic where you might have incentives to bring more regulation and antitrust?EM: Look, I would say exactly the opposite. Today, Google, Facebook, and so on, on artificial intelligence, they are very much welcome. Most people like them, these companies invest in France, they also recruit a lot of our talents and they develop their jobs here. So they are part of our ecosystem. The issue for these big players is the fact that they will have to deal with several issues. First, they have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation; they are huge players. At a point of time--but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem--at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. They are too big.” Not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed. Which is brand new. So at this point, you may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDBut second, I have a territorial issue due to the fact that they are totally digital players. They disrupt traditional economic sectors. In some ways, this might be fine because they can also provide new solutions. But we have to retrain our people. These companies will not pay for that; the government will. Today the GAFA [an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon] don’t pay all the taxes they should in Europe. So they don’t contribute to dealing with negative externalities they create. And they ask the sectors they disrupt to pay, because these guys, the old sectors pay VAT, corporate taxes and so on. That’s not sustainable.Third, people should remain sovereign when it comes to pivacy rules. France and Europe have their preferences in this regard. I want to protect privacy in this way or in that way. You don't have the same rule in the US. And speaking about US players, how can I guarantee French people that US players will respect our regulation? So at a point of time, they will have to create actual legal bodies and incorporate it in Europe, being submitted to these rules. Which means in terms of processing information, organizing themselves, and so on, they will need, indeed, a much more European or national organization. Which in turn means that we will have to redesign themselves for a much more fragmented world. And that’s for sure because accountability and democracy happen at national or regional level but not at a global scale. If I don’t walk down this path, I cannot protect French citizens and guarantee their rights. If I don't do that, I cannot guarantee French companies they are fairly treated. Because today, when I speak about GAFA, they are very much welcome I want them to be part of my ecosystem, but they don’t play on the same level-playing field as the other players in the digital or traditional economy. And I cannot in the long run guarantee my citizens that their collective preferences or my rules can be totally implemented by these players because you don't have the same regulation on the US side. All I know is that if I don’t, at a point of time, have this discussion and regulate them, I put myself in a situation not to be sovereign anymore.NT: But aren’t those two goals very much in tension? You want the GAFA to come to France, you’ve touted it—Google has been invested in AI [in France] since 2012—but you also really want to crack down on them. How do you do both simultaneously?EM: No. Look, because I think first, you don’t just have the GAFA. You have a lot of other players, startups, and so on. And I think, even for them, I mean they are discovering they will have to deal with democratic and political issues in your country.NT: They’re just starting to learn that!EM: Yes, yes! I mean, it’s fair. That’s the end of the very first phase, that was a sort of an early phase without any regulation, where they were in a situation to set up all the rules. Now they will have to deal with governments — but I want to do it in a cooperative way. I don't want to say, “I don’t want this guy anymore.” Exactly the opposite. I want a permanent dialogue. But I want them to understand and respect my constraints. I want them to be part of my reflection and to take into consideration their own reflection. I want them to better understand the fact that it is unfeasible to have a world without any responsibility and without a clear democratic accountability.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDNT: Got it. So back to the big question, what will be success? How will you know that this has worked? And what will be failure? When you look at this a couple years from now?EM: Look, first of all I think it’s very hard to answer this question because by definition, I don't have a clear view on what will happen for artificial intelligence in five years time. But I would say, if I manage to develop a very strong, powerful ecosystem, number one in Europe on artificial intelligence dealing with mobility, defense, healthcare, fintech, etc. I think it will be a success. And for me, if a majority of people in France understand and endorse this change it will be a success. It will be a failure if we are stuck with fears and blocked by big scares. My concern is that there is a disconnect between the speediness of innovation and some practices, and the time for digestion for a lot of people in our democracies. I have to build a sort of reciprocal or mutual trust coming from researchers, private players, startups, and my citizens. If the first category of people trust a country as being a relevant ecosystem for them, and at the same time, if I manage to build trust with my citizens for AI, I’m done. If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

The day we start to make such business out of this data is when a huge opportunity becomes a huge risk. It could totally dismantle our national cohesion and the way we live together. This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.
When you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the US and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values. That’s exactly the problem you have with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica or autonomous driving. On the other side, Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as US or China. If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution . That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.
The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.
NT: So the stakes here in your mind aren’t just French economic growth, it’s the whole value system that will be incorporated into this transformative technology the world over. And you want to make sure that the values you have, your country has, your continent has, are involved in that?
EM: Sure, exactly. I want to create an advantage for my country in artificial intelligence, directly. And that’s why we have these announcements made by Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu who choose Paris to create AI labs and research centers: this is very important to me. Second, I want my country to be part of the revolution that AI will trigger in mobility, energy, defense, finance, healthcare and so on. Because it will create value as well. Third, I want AI to be totally federalized. Why? Because AI is about disruption and dealing with impacts of disruption. For instance, this kind of disruption can destroy a lot of jobs in some sectors and create a need to retrain people. But AI could also be one of the solutions to better train these people and help them to find new jobs, which is good for my country, and very important.
I want my country to be the place where this new perspective on AI is built, on the basis of interdisciplinarity: this means crossing maths, social sciences, technology, and philosophy. That’s absolutely critical. Because at one point in time, if you don’t frame these innovations from the start, a worst-case scenario will force you to deal with this debate down the line. I think privacy has been a hidden debate for a long time in the US. Now, it emerged because of the Facebook issue. Security was also a hidden debate of autonomous driving. Now, because we’ve had this issue with Uber, it rises to the surface. So if you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries. And I think we are very well equipped to do it, on top of developing the business in my country.
But I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy. For instance, we are using artificial intelligence to organize the access to universities for our students That puts a lot of responsibility on an algorithm. A lot of people see it as a black box, they don't understand how the student selection process happens. But the day they start to understand that this relies on an algorithm, this algorithm has a specific responsibility. If you want, precisely, to structure this debate, you have to create the conditions of fairness of the algorithm and of its full transparency. I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm. I have to be able to tell French citizens, “OK, I encouraged this innovation because it will allow you to get access to new services, it will improve your lives—that’s a good innovation to you.” I have to guarantee there is no bias in terms of gender, age, or other individual characteristics, except if this is the one I decided on behalf of them or in front of them. This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. If you don’t deal with it from the very beginning, if you don’t consider it is as important as developing innovation, you will miss something and at a point in time, it will block everything. Because people will eventually reject this innovation.
NT: So the steps you’re taking to guarantee that is that all of the algorithms developed by the French government will be open, algorithms developed by any company getting money from the French government will also be required to be open?
EM: Yes.
NT: And is there a third step you’re doing to help guarantee this transparency?
EM: We will increase the collective pressure to make these algorithms transparent. We will open data from government, publicly funded projects, and we will open access from this project and we will favor, incentivize the private players to make it totally public and transparent. Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don't want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens and will say: “I have to better understand your algorithm and be sure that this is trustworthy.” The power of consumption society is so strong that it gets people to accept to provide a lot of personal information in order to get access to services largely driven by artificial intelligence on their apps, laptops and so on. But at some point, as citizens, people will say, “I want to be sure that all of this personal data is not used against me, but used ethically, and that everything is monitored. I want to understand what is behind this algorithm that plays a role in my life.” And I’m sure that a lot of startups or labs or initiatives which will emerge in the future, will reach out to their customers and say “I allow you to better understand the algorithm we use and the bias or non-bias.” I’m quite sure that’s one of the next waves coming in AI. I think it will increase the pressure on private players. These new apps or sites will be able to tell people: “OK! You can go to this company or this app because we cross-check everything for you. It’s safe,"" or on the contrary: “If you go to this website or this app or this research model, it’s not OK, I have no guarantee, I was not able to check or access the right information about the algorithm”.
NT: When you talk about how AI will transform democracy, do you imagine a day where you make decisions based on recommendations from AI-based algorithms, where there’s a system that tells you what a labor reform should be and you say, “OK?”
EM: At this point, I think it could help you. But it will never replace the way you decide. When you make a decision, it’s the result of a series of cross-checks. AI can help you because sometimes when you pass a reform, you’re not totally clear about the potential effects, direct or indirect, and you can have hesitations. So it can help you to make the right decision. An algorithm is relevant for this part of the equation. For instance, on economic and social reforms, to have a clearer view about direct and indirect measurable effects. But on top of it, when you take a political decision, you need to have a part of personal judgment. That’s the quality of the decision maker, and artificial intelligence will never replace that. And there is a thing that AI could never replace; which is accountability and responsibility. Because this is his decision and will be held accountable for it, a political leader could never say, “OK I’m sorry this decision was bad because it was a decision of an algorithm.”
NT: Let’s get back to disruption for a second. You’ve talked a lot about transportation, you talked about it in your speech. AI is going to massively disrupt transportation, and it’s going to make a lot of people lose their jobs as we go to driverless cars. It will create new jobs, but this is already an area where people in France have been protesting. There were railroad strikes this weekend, there were trucker strikes this fall. Aren’t you taking a huge risk by aligning yourself with a force that is going to disrupt an industry that has already been protesting like crazy?
EM: Look, I think in this country---and in a lot of countries---you have a tradition of controversy. I launched a series of reforms that a lot of people thought impossible to be conducted in France. So, I'm absolutely sure it's possible, when you explain to people, when you have the energy and determination, to pass such reforms. I’m certainly not reluctant to do so and I’m certainly not, I would say, upset or threatened by dealing with artificial intelligence and convincing my people of its rightful implementation. As consumers, they are already big fans of artificial intelligence. And big fans of innovative solutions. All the tech guys can tell you that the French market is a very good market. People love technology here. I think that’s why the overall philosophy I have stuck to from the very beginning of my mandate is to say: blocking changes and being focused on protecting jobs is not the right answer. It’s the people you need to protect. You do so by giving them opportunities and by training and retraining them again to get new jobs. Don’t block the change because it’s coming and people will accept it. But try to be at the fore-front of change to better understand it and deal with it. Change can destroy jobs in the very short run, but create new ones in other sectors at the same time.
For me, one of the key issues of artificial intelligence is that it will probably reduce the most replicable and straining human activities. And naturally you will raise a whole range of other opportunities for people with low, middle and high qualifications. The big risk for our society is to increase opportunities only for very highly qualified people and, in a way, very low-qualified workers. It is especially necessary to monitor the qualification of the middle class, because they can be the most disrupted. If I take your examples, that would encompass taxi drivers, people working in the industry, or people working in highly repetitive tasks. So you have to train them either to change their sector of activity or to increase their qualification to work with a machine. We will need people working with machines.
For I do not believe that autonomous vehicles will exist without any drivers at all. For me, that’s pure imagination. You already have fully automated programs to drive planes. Therefore we technically could have planes with no pilots. But you still have two pilots in every plane. Even if almost everything is automated. That’s because you need to have responsibility, precisely. So what we will reduce with autonomous cars is the number of risks. What you will reduce is how painful it is to be a driver for a long period of time ; but you will need people to make the critical choice at critical moments for autonomous vehicles. I’m almost sure about that. So AI will change the practice but it will not kill transportation jobs in many cases.
Bottom line, my point is: I can convince my country about change precisely because I embrace it. My role is not to block this change, but to be able to train or retrain people for them to get opportunities in this new world.
NT: Got it. I want to ask you a military question. I know that the UN has had discussions on restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons. Do you think machines---artificial intelligence machines---can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention?
EM: I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check. And in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties, can reduce until nil the uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it.
NT: Let me ask you about the national competition in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk tweeted some months ago: “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of World War3 in my opinion.” Do you think Musk is overstating it? Or do you think that this is going to get very intense, particularly between the United States and China?
EM: I think it will become very intense. I will not be so pessimistic, because I think that the core basis of artificial intelligence is research. And research is global. And I think this artificial intelligence deals with cooperation and competition, permanently. So you need an open world and a lot of cooperation if you want to be competitive. And at a point of time, in some issues, you need competition. But I think you will have to rethink a sort of sovereignty. I addressed that in my speech today. Artificial intelligence is a global innovation scheme in which you have private big players and one government with a lot of data—China. My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI, as I told you at the beginning of this discussion, especially on regulation. You will have sovereignty battles to regulate, with countries trying to defend their collective choices. You will have a trade and innovation fight precisely as you have in different sectors. But I don't believe that it will go to the extreme extents Elon Musk talks about, because I think if you want to progress, there is a huge advantage in an open innovation model.
NT: So this is a slightly cynical response to that, but let me ask you this: If France starts to build up an AI sector, in some ways it’s competitive to Google and Facebook. So won’t there be an incentive for Europe and for France to regulate Facebook and Google in ever-tougher ways? Doesn’t it create a strange dynamic where you might have incentives to bring more regulation and antitrust?
EM: Look, I would say exactly the opposite. Today, Google, Facebook, and so on, on artificial intelligence, they are very much welcome. Most people like them, these companies invest in France, they also recruit a lot of our talents and they develop their jobs here. So they are part of our ecosystem. The issue for these big players is the fact that they will have to deal with several issues. First, they have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation; they are huge players. At a point of time--but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem--at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. They are too big.” Not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed. Which is brand new. So at this point, you may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue.
But second, I have a territorial issue due to the fact that they are totally digital players. They disrupt traditional economic sectors. In some ways, this might be fine because they can also provide new solutions. But we have to retrain our people. These companies will not pay for that; the government will. Today the GAFA [an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon] don’t pay all the taxes they should in Europe. So they don’t contribute to dealing with negative externalities they create. And they ask the sectors they disrupt to pay, because these guys, the old sectors pay VAT, corporate taxes and so on. That’s not sustainable.
Third, people should remain sovereign when it comes to pivacy rules. France and Europe have their preferences in this regard. I want to protect privacy in this way or in that way. You don't have the same rule in the US. And speaking about US players, how can I guarantee French people that US players will respect our regulation? So at a point of time, they will have to create actual legal bodies and incorporate it in Europe, being submitted to these rules. Which means in terms of processing information, organizing themselves, and so on, they will need, indeed, a much more European or national organization. Which in turn means that we will have to redesign themselves for a much more fragmented world. And that’s for sure because accountability and democracy happen at national or regional level but not at a global scale. If I don’t walk down this path, I cannot protect French citizens and guarantee their rights. If I don't do that, I cannot guarantee French companies they are fairly treated. Because today, when I speak about GAFA, they are very much welcome I want them to be part of my ecosystem, but they don’t play on the same level-playing field as the other players in the digital or traditional economy. And I cannot in the long run guarantee my citizens that their collective preferences or my rules can be totally implemented by these players because you don't have the same regulation on the US side. All I know is that if I don’t, at a point of time, have this discussion and regulate them, I put myself in a situation not to be sovereign anymore.
NT: But aren’t those two goals very much in tension? You want the GAFA to come to France, you’ve touted it—Google has been invested in AI [in France] since 2012—but you also really want to crack down on them. How do you do both simultaneously?
EM: No. Look, because I think first, you don’t just have the GAFA. You have a lot of other players, startups, and so on. And I think, even for them, I mean they are discovering they will have to deal with democratic and political issues in your country.
NT: They’re just starting to learn that!
EM: Yes, yes! I mean, it’s fair. That’s the end of the very first phase, that was a sort of an early phase without any regulation, where they were in a situation to set up all the rules. Now they will have to deal with governments — but I want to do it in a cooperative way. I don't want to say, “I don’t want this guy anymore.” Exactly the opposite. I want a permanent dialogue. But I want them to understand and respect my constraints. I want them to be part of my reflection and to take into consideration their own reflection. I want them to better understand the fact that it is unfeasible to have a world without any responsibility and without a clear democratic accountability.
NT: Got it. So back to the big question, what will be success? How will you know that this has worked? And what will be failure? When you look at this a couple years from now?
EM: Look, first of all I think it’s very hard to answer this question because by definition, I don't have a clear view on what will happen for artificial intelligence in five years time. But I would say, if I manage to develop a very strong, powerful ecosystem, number one in Europe on artificial intelligence dealing with mobility, defense, healthcare, fintech, etc. I think it will be a success. And for me, if a majority of people in France understand and endorse this change it will be a success. It will be a failure if we are stuck with fears and blocked by big scares. My concern is that there is a disconnect between the speediness of innovation and some practices, and the time for digestion for a lot of people in our democracies. I have to build a sort of reciprocal or mutual trust coming from researchers, private players, startups, and my citizens. If the first category of people trust a country as being a relevant ecosystem for them, and at the same time, if I manage to build trust with my citizens for AI, I’m done. If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure.

Chemists have a new lab assistant: artificial intelligence. Researchers have developed a ‘deep learning’ computer program that produces blueprints for the sequences of reactions needed to create small organic molecules, such as drug compounds. The pathways that the tool suggests look just as good on paper as those devised by human chemists.

        When we think about agriculture, we tend to think about subsistence farming. Although many people may think that the agricultural community is behind the curve when it comes to implementing new technologies, there is lots of evidence that farmers are actually moving quite quickly to modernise almost everything about the farming process.
According to Techopedia, these farmers are using artificial intelligence in new and amazing ways to bring the process of food cultivation into the future.
Sowing the seeds
High-tech agriculture starts at the very second that the seed is first placed in the ground. Experts in the field are familiar with variable rate planting equipment that does more than just planting a seed down into the dirt somewhere. 






All sorts of artificial intelligence work is being done behind the scenes on predictions – where a seed will grow best, what soil conditions are likely to be, etc.
The power of artificial intelligence is being applied to agricultural big data in order to make farming much more efficient.
Harvesting technologies        
Companies are already producing robotic harvesting equipment, partially in response to labour gaps that have left farmers scrambling to harvest crops like fruits and berries.
You can see a lot of this at work in documentation from companies like Harvest Croo, which has produced an autonomous strawberry picking machine, and Abundant Technologies, where a vacuum apparatus harvests mature apples from trees.
While manufacturing robots have been around for a while, these harvesting technologies are something new in many ways.
Harvest technologies like the Harvest Croo berry picker operate on the basis of machine vision and sensor fusion to identify where harvest fruits and berries are. They use sophisticated directed movements to pick precisely.
This is the kind of functionality that is very much in the artificial intelligence field and mimics human cognition and directed action.
Agricultural robotics is filling a need as labour pools decrease. But it’s also saving humans from one of the most repetitive and difficult jobs in our economy.
People simply don’t want to have to harvest enormous amounts of produce all day, every day. In that sense, harvest robotics is also making our world a little more enjoyable. Now, if people do want to pick by hand, boutique orchards and gardens offer that option!     
Harvest robotics presents a real landmark in the very rapid modernisation of the farming world.
Eye in the sky
How are farms using artificial intelligence to direct crop planting, harvesting and more, and how are they getting that data in the first place?
In some trade journals, you can see unmanned aerial vehicles or drones being outfitted with precision sensors, in order to run the fields and get the data that is needed. These airborne surveillance engines can look for stunted crops, signs of pest or weed damage, dryness and many other variables that are part of the difficulty of farming in general. With all of this data in hand, farmers can enhance their production models and their strategies across the lay of the land to decrease risk, waste and liability.
Pest and weed control
Yesterday’s farmers were living in fear of the windstorm and the grasshopper but not anymore. Farmers are quickly adopting new high-tech ways of protecting plants against weeds and various kinds of pests outdoors. Another alternative is to grow in greenhouses, which is being done as well, but some of the most amazing farming technology is being deployed outside.
The See and Spray model acquired by John Deere recently is an excellent example of harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision.  
“We welcome the opportunity to work with a Blue River Technology team that is highly-skilled and intensely dedicated to rapidly advancing the implementation of machine learning in agriculture,” the President, Agricultural Solutions, and Chief Information Officer at Deere, John May, said in a press statement, weighing in on the potential of new technologies in farming.  Related News  How to protect your gadgets from power surge  Strix promotes access to gadgets  8 ways to protect gadgets from cyberattacks   
“As a leader in precision agriculture, John Deere recognises the importance of technology to our customers. Machine learning is an important capability for Deere’s future.”
We know that artificial intelligence excels at image processing – computers can now “see” almost as well as we can.
So by deploying mobile technologies with AI and computer vision built in, farmers can find weeds and eradicate them, instead of blanket spraying an entire crop.
That makes the food cleaner, and it saves enormous amounts of money. It’s just another example of real new technologies that are having a dramatic impact on yields and everything else.
Yield boosting algorithms
When we talk about machine learning and artificial intelligence, we often talk about algorithms. The mathematical models behind the computer science are the fundamental basis for how we deal with big data to make decisions.     
Companies are now quickly developing agricultural yield-boosting algorithms that can show farmers what’s going to be best for a crop. Despite some concerns about the difficulty of doing this type of analysis in nature, farmers and others have been able to make quite a lot of headway in maximising crop yield, simply by applying the algorithms and intelligence generators that we’ve built to help computers imitate our own cognitive abilities.
The farmer’s Alexa
There is one more very interesting groundbreaking technology that may also be one of the highlights in the modern farmer’s tech toolkit.
Yes, companies are talking about creating chatbots for farmers, artificial intelligence personalities like the smart home helper “Alexa” that are able to converse with farmers to help them figure out tough problems. We’re hoping that these specialised farming chatbots are a little more capable than Alexa, since the current consumer technology basically provides encyclopaedic facts and figures and not much else. However, if they’re packed with the right answers and analytics information, the farmer’s chatbot could be a real boon to busy farm managers who are doing all they can to expand and grow their businesses.
Population growth and climate change will be massive challenges, but artificial intelligence deployment can help reduce the impact of these and other challenges, and make smart farming much more resistant to the problems that farmers face.

Impressions        
Impressions track how many times a webpage or element on a webpage is viewed. It is one of the standard metrics used in website analytics software. The term “impressions” most often refers to page impressions, which is synonymous with page views. Each time a page is viewed, a page impression is counted. Therefore, a single visitor can rack up multiple impressions on a website by visiting multiple pages.
Unique impressions, or page views by different visitors, according to www.techterms.com, are useful for measuring the number of daily unique visitors to a website. Website analytics software may record unique impressions by either saving a 24-hour cookie on visitors’ browsers or by resetting the record of unique visitors at the start of each day.
Most analytics software records both total and unique impressions. These two metrics can be used to determine the average number of pages visitors view before leaving the website.
While impressions typically refer to page views, they may also define how many times individual elements on a webpage are viewed. For example, in online advertising, “ad impressions” track the number of times individual advertisements are displayed. If a webpage contains three ad units, each page view will produce three ad impressions.
By tracking the number of ad impressions, webmasters can monitor the performance of individual ads. This information can be used in combination with revenue per 1,000 page views, to determine the ideal amount of ads for each webpage.

In the wider world, there is a big debate on the likely effects of artificial intelligence ( AI) and robotics. There is a fear that robots will replace not just manual labour but a lot of brainwork as well. There are scenarios being painted where no human being may be needed for any paid work and robots will do everything. Of course, a few people will be needed to produce robots and improve their quality. That would be the investment. The idea that automation will make human effort redundant, and it will create a problem of no work and too much leisure, was rife in the 1960s. Each wave of innovation leads to the fear that jobs will be destroyed. But so far while some jobs have been destroyed, other jobs have been created. World has gone through phases where agriculture was the principal occupation. Then, we moved on to manufacturing. Now, a lot of the world is in a phase where services are the principal sector. Will AI and robotics be different ? With robots replacing human labour, capital will provide machines as well as labour. All output will belong to the capitalists. Robots neither eat nor drink nor sleep. So, labour costs are just those of repairs and replacement. Take an extreme case. If all income goes to profits, how do people carry on? Many economists have come to the idea that some sort of universal income entitlement will have to be created. To finance this, the state will have to tax profits. The level of basic income will depend on the tax collection. Thus, if a tax rate of 50% were feasible, everyone can have half of per capita income as their entitlement (ignoring administrative costs of tax collection, bureaucracy, etc). Indeed, in general, the tax rate determines the fraction of per capita income which can be paid. But, will the capitalists agree? Why should they? Here is where Keynes (and even Marx) comes in. The capitalists need people to purchase their product to be able to realise profits. The amount of income distributed as purchasing power will determine the revenue realised by the capitalists. So, we are on the horns of the circular flow dilemma. The capitalists have to give away money to get it back. They may want to give 80-90% away to get it back. Thus, whatever the world is like under AI, it will provide for all. There are two positive elements to this extreme scenario. Notice, first, that this world has most incomes equal except for the capitalists who have all the profits. After tax, income will be substantially equal if 99% get just the basic income. Secondly, women who do unpaid work in the household will get paid the same as those who used to do paid work. This is a simple fairy tale. It reassures that the world of no human work is not a world of poverty and starvation. But truth is that robots cannot do everything. You can programme a robot for all the foreseen and foreseeable contingencies. At present, robots are quite simple and can only handle simple contingencies. But, as the case of the driverless car recently showed, they may cause accidents and death when an unforeseen event (someone crossing in the dark at a place which is not a designated crossing) occurs. But even supposing that the smartest machines are designed, there will always be radical uncertainty. As Keynes put it, you can calculate probabilities of all possible outcomes but that is risk. Uncertainty is when you cannot foresee the possibilities. One of the most uncertain phenomenon is human behaviour. For older people with dementia, you need a human helper who can cope with unexpected turns of behaviour. Indeed, in healthcare in general, you require human empathy and ability to communicate to be effective. There is an estimate that in the US, as much as 40% of workforce may be in healthcare in the near future. As people live longer, the demands for healthcare are going to rise. This is also the case with most one-to-one activities such as tutoring. No robot can be your physical instructor or teacher. Indeed, if we are not doing boring manual work, we could be doing interesting one-to-one activities. This would extend to artistic and sports activities where coaching and mentoring cannot be done by even the best machines. Indeed, we may have many more people available for these sorts of work. The profits of the capitalists will still need to provide a large part of public revenue, but there will be employment for many people. So relax. AI and robotics will not wreck our lives—just change them.

Organizations that put AI to work in this way will lead their industries. However, making AI work in new and wondrous ways requires a powerful sense of imagination.  In their latest book, Human + Machine, Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson say that as humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling employees and companies make changes on the fly -- or even to completely re-imagine them.
Daugherty and Wilson explored the practices and approaches of 1,500 organizations, and found achieving success with AI is as much an exercise in imagination as it is in technical prowess. 
PROMOTED
Imagine new and bold processes. ""When trying to re-imagine a process, it's natural for people to become stuck on the old ways of doing things, making it difficult to envision things that might be,"" the authors state. ""To avoid that, they should always keep in mind the differences between traditional business processes versus the new, AI approach. Our research shows that outcomes are no longer linear but exponential. Change is no longer episodic and human-led; it's self-adaptive, based on real-time input from humans as well as machines. Roles are not just limited to human-only and machine-only positions; they must also include collaborative work in the missing middle.""
Imagine and experiment. ""In science, an experiment that doesn't support the hypothesis isn't called a failure. It's called data,"" Daugherty and Wilson point out. This is the mindset that should be applied to designing new business processes.""The age of the standard business process is over; companies can no longer aim to replicate the best-in-class process of an industry leader,"" they state. ""That's why experimentation is key. The catch, though, is that tailor-made processes require managers and leaders be more aware of their workforce and culture at large so they know how and when to implement experiments.""
Imagine a blended culture of people and machines: Trust is the key in a blended culture, the authors state. ""How do you foster a culture of trust that extends even to robo-colleagues? One way is to test with AI and train with it. To engender a trust in AI systems, leaders to allow for those who work with systems to develop stakes in the outcome and to have a sense of urgency over the inner workings of the system. Ideally, AI systems should generally be designed to offer explanations of their decisions and to help people maintain some decision-making autonomy. Developing processes that are fundamentally trust-based takes time and experimentation, but case studies show that if all parties are trusted -- humans, machines, and humans and machines working together -- then outcomes can improve for everyone.""

Technological innovations have impacted almost every aspect of life over the past century. The steam engine and electricity allowed total labor productivity to grow at more than 2 percent per year and the total number of weekly work hours to drop from 60 to 40.
The concept of artificial intelligence is not new but has recently come into view as a technology that is capable of revolutionizing the world and bringing a new industrial revolution. A significant amount of research and discussion among scientists and economists has focused on the critical topic of disruption to labor markets and potential productivity gains from AI.











 
 
 
However, there is a more nuanced picture of the way in which AI will reshape how we work – in many cases augmenting our abilities and supporting organizations to redefine their operating models for improved performance and agility. The role of human resource and talent leaders in pairing humans and machines to this end will be critical to success in the future.

4 steps for HR to support enterprise agility and value from AI
A global study conducted by Accenture Strategy found that 64 percent of executives plan to use AI to automate tasks to a considerable extent in the next three years and 97 percent intend to use AI to enhance worker capabilities. Naturally, human resources is no exception. In a survey done by ServiceNow on 350 HR leaders, 92 percent agree that the future of providing an enhanced level of employee service will include chatbots, and they are already bringing this vision to life by leveraging chatbots for recruiting, employee services, development, and coaching. Moreover, things will not stop there – AI will be infused organically into many of the standard tools and activities employees do every day. The traditional world of work, where people are assigned to jobs that contain tasks, is being inherently disrupted. AI can play a tremendous role in augmenting the capabilities of people and organizations to reinvent work and increase agility.
There are four key areas where human resources leaders will need to focus to get the most value from AI in the future:











 
 
 
1. Look inward
HR organizations need to first focus on internal training to help team members be conversant about the possibilities that AI technologies can bring to talent transformation. Additionally, HR needs to disrupt itself by focusing on the options to leverage AI for its processes – including how to automate and augment more transactional and compliance activities. The right people and skills focused on the HR operating model will set the stage for HR to have expertise in the process and free up team members to focus on the more strategic dimensions of implementing transformational AI capabilities. By transforming the HR business model to focus primarily on roles that humans will play in the organization, employees will become the key value drivers behind organizational success. In fact, 75 percent of business leaders acknowledge that a digitally enabled operating model must be customer centered, in this case, meaning HR personnel.
2. Reimagine the talent lifecycle
Machine learning and AI capabilities can and are reshaping recruiting, learning, performance management, and every other dimension of the l employee experience. Companies are using technologies for a variety of HR tactics, including the minimization of bias in writing position descriptions as well as the development of predictive analytic web-based video interviewing. Beyond talent acquisition, AI can play a role in improving the talent lifecycle in many ways. For example, identifying people with expertise on specific topics within an organization or supporting continuous performance management processes.
3. Help business teams rethink the nature of work
Inertia is typical in organizations, and AI is going to be no exception. Additionally, it is likely that leaders will look at AI as “just another technology” to implement. However, organizations that invest in changing the way that people work and interact with this capability stand to achieve outpaced value creation. This includes breaking down typical end-to-end roles into more segmented groups of activities and then targeting those to the appropriate source of labor – be it human or machine. Alongside this, people need to be skilled in how to use AI to support their work. Emerging tools that relieve people of everyday tasks such as scheduling appointments and booking travel (while still evolving) will benefit from HR’s involvement in adapting organization structure, performance assessment, and job/skill architectures. In practice, this may mean restructuring the HR business model to effectively identify the best opportunities for AI augmentation as well as streamline the interface points of humans and machines. This ties hand in hand with 81% of executives who expect to manage multiple operating models in parallel in the future.











 
 
 
4. Support enterprise reskilling
A rapid deployment of “new skilling” is an essential role of AI to help organizations seize value from AI. While three-quarters of companies are investing in AI, only 26 percent of executives believe their current workforce is ready for AI adoption, and a mere three percent of leaders say they plan to increase investment in training programs for AI. HR should lead the charge in changing this dynamic as well as the approach to re-skilling. Traditionally, learning and development is periodic with scheduled training programs. Through the use of AI, learning and development should reflect the agile model leaders would like to see throughout the rest of their organization: learning and development should be constant and re-skilling rapidly.
Getting started
CHROs and talent leaders have a significant opportunity to help build a future workforce in which humans and intelligent machines work together to improve productivity, innovation and growth. Here’s what they can do to get started:
Create partnerships and experiment
Don’t think that implementing AI right is something to do alone. It takes a broad ecosystem of capabilities and relationships to figure out where to invest and where to get the capabilities. Developing a more comprehensive strategy is essential, but just as critical is building trusted alliances across the enterprise and being willing to test and experiment with concepts to see how they work. This necessary collaboration will bring organizations out of siloes into a truly unified workforce, amplifying the organization’s ability to respond quickly to change. As an example, if new hire onboarding is a challenge for hiring managers, exploring ways to automate or augment the experience with AI can demonstrate how HR can leverage advanced technology to make principal activities easier and more efficient.











 
 
 
Design with the employee in mind
A fundamental activity for “getting it right” with AI will be redesigning the paradigm of employees’ relationships with the business and the nature of work in the future. A new design will determine the priorities for HR in where to invest in changing the talent processes or other nature of work as well as how to shape future learning initiatives. Syncing this new paradigm with business priorities will then enable a holistic approach to AI developed on an intrinsically motivated foundation, a key component of maintaining an agile HR organization. For instance, if organizational agility is a priority, HR can support talent investments and AI tools that assist people to move quickly and freely between projects and automate many processes that may create barriers to workforce agility today.
Prototype, evaluate and scale
A perfect approach or framework does not exist for leveraging AI to drive talent outcomes and organization agility. Leaders will need to be focused and courageous in their approach to prototyping AI solutions where it makes sense. If these new capabilities are put together in an employee-centric model, there is tremendous potential for HR to transform the way that people work and the way that organizations adapt to the future. Not every activity will flourish, but a thoughtful model can setup quick wins that can become more substantial capabilities over time.
Ready or not, AI is already making its way into our organizations and changing the nature of work. Savvy HR and business leaders need to develop a digitally-enabled culture focused on human-machine collaboration. This strategy will help enable HR to be a partner in creating value from the talent transformation by changing the way it works and how it invests to help employees get the most from their work.

Scenarios describing the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) seem to gravitate toward hyperbole. In wonderful scenarios, AI enables nirvanas of instant optimal processes and prescient humanoids. In doomsday scenarios, algorithms go rogue and humans are superfluous, at best, and, at worst, subservient to the new silicon masters.  
However, both of these scenarios require a sophistication that, at least right now, seems far away. Our recent research indicates that most organizations are still in the early stages of AI implementation and nowhere near either of these outcomes.  
A more imminent reality is that AI is agnostic and can benefit both good and bad processes. As such, a less dramatic but perhaps more insidious risk than the doomsday scenario is that AI gives new life to clunky or otherwise poorly conceived processes.
Consider faxes in the health care industry. Despite being obsolete in most places, “like the floppy disk or the CD player,” faxes are still a fundamental part of the medical infrastructure. Because of the long history and strong network effects, the medical industry still sends a staggering number of faxes every day.  
Invented in the 1840s, well before the telephone, faxes illustrate how difficult it is to change an entrenched process.
Despite widespread use, sending faxes is, for the most part, a horrific way to transfer information. The process is typically (1) extracting and printing information from a computer system, (2) scanning it into an image, and (3) transmitting it somewhere else via fax. The burden rests squarely on the recipient to interpret a pixelated approximation of the original information. Structured digital information has become unstructured. With every fax, a data scientist gets their wings ripped off.
The conversion from structured information to unstructured and back is a waste. No one wins — a patient may be waiting for approval, medical staff may lack information, errors can creep in, etc. At a minimum, time and effort are needlessly spent.

Advances in AI and image processing are making significant progress in reducing this problem. Organizations can use AI to recognize images, automate the interpretation, and restructure the information. Certainly, this is a welcome improvement. No one gets competitive advantage or business value from wasted time spent restructuring information.
However, this improved image processing is a pyrrhic victory.

Spot on Sam !This is our thesis too at Skan . Automation is one of the end points of a larger transformation agenda. It needs to be preceded by discovery , optimization / re-engineering. Further just because we have been pointed in the automation direction of late let us not assume that that’s only way to transform. Infact automation forms only a small portion of the interventions that can be made in the work continuum. Again great article Sam !

We completely agree with the insights in this article.  Without uncovering process variants, untangling the process pretzels, unleashing legacy processes with AI will not be a fruitful endeavor.  We suggest starting with computer vision-enabled process discovery, and then after understanding the process nuances, any interventions - re-engineering, automation, transformation, et al. - will be a net positive.

I concur with this article, yet think it belittles the potential for hurriedly executed mechanization innovation to use little issues (e.g., squander, incapability) into huge, even vital, waste, botches and hazards. 

A significant number of the charitable Humaneering Technology Initiative's field trials for the rising biopsychosocial or ""humaneering"" connected science (now in v4.0 open beta) have concentrated on the revive or overhaul of human work in readiness for computerization. In light of what now appears to go for the ""plan"" of human work (e.g., some remnant rehearses and a speedy expected set of responsibilities) in associations, the operational and key effect and the ""specialized obligation"" of poor work configuration, once utilized with computerization, would far surpass any advantage that would have been picked up. Or maybe, upgrading the human work on account of the mechanization, and adopting a light-footed strategy to creating and actualizing the robotization innovation, appear to yield the best results, both operational and monetary.

I agree with this article, yet think it underestimates the potential for hastily implemented automation technology to leverage small problems (e.g., waste, ineffectiveness) into significant, even strategic, waste, blunders and risks. 

Many of the nonprofit Humaneering Technology Initiative's field trials for the emerging biopsychosocial or ""humaneering"" applied science (now in v4.0 open beta) have focused on the refresh or redesign of human work in preparation for automation. Based on what now seems to pass for the ""design"" of human work (e.g., some holdover practices and a quick job description) in organizations, the operational and strategic impact and the ""technical debt"" of poor work design, once leveraged with automation, would far exceed any benefit that would have been gained. Rather, redesigning the human work with the automation in mind, and taking an agile approach to developing and implementing the automation technology, seem to yield the best outcomes, both operational and financial.

I 100% agree with this article, but I have also come to think otherwise.  There's a pragmatic view here which you point to:  An automated bad process is still better than a manual bad process.   

Changing people and processes is hard, or at least usually harder than implimenting a bit of technology.  Technology can then act as an agent of change to change the harder parts.  
First step, then becomes to automate the process.  Then you are less constrained by human or legacy influence to improve, or even remove it.

Based on the serverless delivery model, Gradient removes the friction involved in launching and configuring GPU-backed VMs to train machine learning and deep learning models.









Artificial Intelligence
Source: Graphicstock






Data scientists and developers spend a lot of time configuring the right environment needed for creating machine learning experiments and models. Firstly, they need to launch a Linux virtual machine powered by a GPU. This step is followed by installing required NVIDIA tools such as graphic drivers, CUDA runtime, and cuDNN libraries. Once the VM is configured for the GPU, they spend a significant amount of time installing libraries and frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch, Microsoft CNTK and Apache MXNet. With multiple dependencies and fragmented toolkits, the installation and configuration process often turns cumbersome.
Paperspace is removing the barrier to ML experimentation and model generation through Gradient. Users will never have to spin up VMs or install any software to get started. They can gain access to a fully-configured environment that’s ready to run machine learning jobs.
PROMOTED
Gradient PaaS has three components – Notebooks, Jobs, and Storage. Notebooks expose a full-blown Jupyter environment for immediate access. Jobs can pretty much run any Docker container or a Python program on the GPU cluster. Storage exposes artifacts and datasets that can be persisted and shared across multiple projects.

A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that allows users to mix code or formulas with text and diagrams. With Gradient, developers can choose pre-configured Python notebook instances that come with mainstream frameworks including Fast.ai and TensorFlow. Each notebook instance may be backed by NVIDIA K80 or a P100 GPU. The best part of this service is the speed at which the notebook becomes available. In just a few seconds, developers gain access to a fully-configured Python notebook preloaded with the required runtime and frameworks.
Gradient Job Runner is designed for users who want to execute code (such as training a deep neural network) on a cluster of GPUs efficiently and without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. A Job can be a pre-baked Docker container image with code dependencies and packages pre-installed. Developers will also be able to run standard Python code as a Gradient Job. Once the job is done, users will be able to download the artifacts and logs from a secure location.

Gradient Storage exposes storage for workspace, artifacts, and persistence. Users can use persistence storage to access data from multiple jobs.
Paperspace has priced Gradient on the basis of creation, runtime and teardown of Jobs. The hourly cost of a Job depends on the GPU machine type, which is prorated down to the millisecond.
Apart from offering the PaaS, Paperspace also has traditional IaaS-style VMs that can be used for running parallel processes for ML training or game rendering.
When I first encountered Paperspace, it reminded me of DigitalOcean. Both the platforms emphasize simplicity and developer experience. With Gradient, Paperspace has taken the experience to the next level. I loved the workflow involved in creating a deep learning job without ever worrying about the VMs. All I had to focus on was the data and the model packaged in a Docker container.
AI as a Service is the next big thing for the public cloud. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM are working towards offering managed services and tools for ML developers. Startups like Paperspace can become alternatives to mainstream cloud platforms for developing and deploying niche ML workloads. Ultimately, it’s the developer community that benefits from this competition.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Janakiram MSVFollowingFollowJanakiram MSV is an analyst, advisor and an architect at Janakiram & Associates.

For entrepreneurs and companies big and small, AI is not the enemy at the gates we feared, but a strategic building block for professional relationships that can ultimately improve a company's professional network, finances, and operational structure.Here's how AI can improve working relationships with four different business cohorts:Employee relationshipsAlready, AI tools like facial recognition in video conferencing software have helped facilitate teamwork, allowing entrepreneurs to discuss and collaborate on projects more readily. However, it can also help them interact with and manage their employees.



In fact, AI can be an HR advocate in many ways. Machine learning allows businesses to analyze employee data analytics to help incorporate inclusive, representative policies in the workplace. Companies are even implementing AI tools to make their work environments safer and more comfortable places to work.For example, Botler.ai is a startup curbing workplace sexual harassment by utilizing natural language processing to scan online conversations for specific phrases or sentence structures, flagging for any inappropriate content. When implemented, these tools can help safeguard egalitarian structures, performance and personal development among all workers. According to the Harvard Business Review, that same natural processing language algorithm can also mine customer actions and social sentiment data to identify employees (and even customers) who are at a risk of leaving. Although there are privacy issues to be addressed with this operation, profitable data can optimize employee satisfaction and training.

This system intelligently provides information about contacts including their biographies, skills, interests and achievements. A searchable interface can even construct timelines for past interactions users had with their contacts. With AI and big data insights, entrepreneurs can get to know their employees much better and even include them in important decisions or ask their opinion on sensitive data.In fact, researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) determined that AI automation can increase employee morale, reduce operational errors and improve employee productivity and transparency between workers and managers. A recent Deloitte University report also shows that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can benefit employee satisfaction and loyalty. With streamlined functions, businesses can truly foster creativity, productivity and well-being of their workers.Vendor relationshipsArtificial intelligence can also improve relationships between businesses and their vendors. Since many AI devices are programmed as personal assistants and communication tools, they can help provide shared insights, mentoring and strategic planning to create a shared understanding and trust between the two partnerships. Whether third party companies are hired for expertise or skilled labor, both teams need to understand clear internal marketing goals and analytics.

Start By Making Your Startup More Data-Driven.One way to foster smooth and productive relationships is to offer automation and predictive analytics to research, monitor, report and build media content that third-parties can utilize or edit according to their expertise. Regular check-ins and support are essential for nurturing these vendor-to-business relationships. A report from MIT Sloan Management Review mentions that companies like Airbus now use AI to combine data sets from past production projects, but that information is continuously updated from other interlinked projects that can improve the quality of products in development. These AI programs can use computer-assisted translation and self-learning algorithms to identify problems and positive patterns in assembly line production. Airbus's system can match up to 70 percent of factory disruptions to successful solutions that worked in the past -- in real time! This allows teams in different locations to learn quickly and meet production needs.As owners of data sets, hiring companies can provide select information to vendors while creating tangible results and trustworthy relationships. In addition, content like automated video editing can radically cut down on time and save money for both companies, building strong creative dynamics between outside business teams.Related: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business


Customer relationshipsFor businesses and entrepreneurs, one of the most vital relationships AI can foster is the one shared with their customers. Marketing customer relationiship management (CRM) systems can now build more personalized, data-centric centers that are driven by predictive models and customer concerns. Chatbots, especially, are personalizing customer service. Customers can now ask questions and expect high-quality answers. In fact, chatbots are the preferred contact methods for 44 percent of U.S. consumers, according to a Harvard Business Review survey.Machine learning is using customer service data, like customer reactions, actions and social sentiment data, to assess hidden insights even without being programmed. Learning from past customer experiences and interactions, machine algorithms can now create more relevant and personal experiences that directly address the needs of customers in convenient ways. One prime example of this is how Amazon and Netflix recommend suggestions based on your viewing history.Industry giants like Salesforce are motivating businesses to quickly establish AI infrastructures. The company's AI toolkit, Einstein, allows businesses to provide smart, personalized customer experiences through predictive analytics gained from their data and accumulated insights.For small businesses, personalized products are especially important but often take a backseat to larger businesses. Now, even small entrepreneurs can invest in user-friendly (and affordable) in-house machine learning technologies. Third-party tools and software, like Acquisio, help to optimize customer acquisition with their AI-based marketing tool specifically for small businesses.

But, AI is allowing investors to get a better sense of how new ventures and their current investments are performing. Startups like Alphasense and Kensho let investors analyze market information of emerging and wide-ranging market practices.Databases that implement machine learning algorithms and natural language processing models can browse online messages and social media posts to learn the latest trading sentiments for specific markets or determine a company's output value. This allows investors to analyze a prospective company's market or business model with confidence.As communication is key in any working relationship, investors need to evaluate the necessary background information on new startups. But, information on startups is often limited. Yet, McKinsey & Company reports that companies like Hone Capital are initiating AI metrics and computer vision models, allowing investors to research beforehand to become more acquainted and trusting of their potential acquisitions.


AI software can now identify key background information like current financing, the founder's background, previous funding rounds and intellectual property information. As investors use AI, they can work on strategic plans to enhance their businesses' revenue and operating systems. As a result, these predictive analytics can foster deeper and more nuanced relationships between investors and their companies.New customs for new connections It's time for entrepreneurs to get creative and high-tech with their communication skills. In the future, the factors that will differentiate successful leaders between their competitors is how they can interact, emotionally engage and respond to a wide network of industry players ranging from employees to investors.The interconnected, AI era is not one to hide from. Rather, it's one that can help empower businesses to accentuate their services and creative capabilities, so they can prosper in a more emotionally aware world. Professional relationships are the backbone of success -- even in the business world -- and soon our relationship with AI could advance all of us to another level of innovation.

Robots in the ranks: how human skills fit together with artificial intelligence

This week, public-sector discussions centre around artificial intelligence and how technology will shape the jobs of the future. Research suggests future jobs will require people skills more than high-level engineering and maths, as most will work with technology, rather than build it.
There are two popular views about the impact of technological change in the workplace and the skills mix that will be required by tomorrow’s workforce.
One well-known fear is that various kinds of automation, powered by artificial intelligence and other emergent technologies will put masses of people out of jobs.
The other is the assumption that technological change means skills in science, technology, engineering and maths — particularly an understanding of computer programming, which is now widely seen as a vital part of school curricula — will be in increasingly high demand.
But analysis of labour force data from Australia and the United States shows that the big growth is occurring in “people skills” rather than STEM. And that makes sense in some ways when combined with the first fear. Logically, the more that automation takes processes out of human hands, the more our uniquely human skills come to the fore.
While plenty of people will find work in certain burgeoning fields like cybersecurity or the data sciences, and in the technology industry developing cutting-edge applications of AI, it is likely that the bulk of the workforce will be using more and more technology, rather than actually building it.




Not all jobs will be swept away by technology, some will be complemented by it, and in many cases those workers who are displaced will be able to transition to other jobs, perhaps at higher rates of pay, with a relatively small amount of extra training or education.
Estimates of how this will affect the labour market in terms of unemployment vary considerably, but the machines haven’t taken over yet. We still have our free will, and some experts are concerned about what we do with it.


Claire Mason
“It is really important that we are not being passive about technology,” says Claire Mason, an expert on these issues from Data61, who worked on the aforementioned studies showing that the value of people skills, particularly around communication, is growing much more quickly than demand for traditional STEM skills.
Discourse analysis recently showed people commonly talk about technological disruption as “something that happens to us”,  she adds.
“But the alternative is a much more active stance towards technology — that technology is something that humans have always wielded to shape and improve our lives,” Mason told The Mandarin.
“And that is what I think we need as a mindset, not that we all need to become coders, but that we all need to stay engaged with how we can be using the latest improvements in digital technology to do what we currently do most efficiently, in a new way, to add value, to enhance a customer’s experience.
“That is the mindset that Australia needs in order to maintain our position rather than either fear about technology, or this very narrow view about us all needing to become software engineers.”
Mason is speaking on a panel at the Australian Information Industry Association’s conference in Canberra focused on these very issues, among a long list of federal public servants and parliamentarians, academics and ICT industry leaders.
She thinks there is too much alarming rhetoric around, encouraging people in jobs like teaching or community services to feel “threatened and resistant to the technology” — but “it’s that attitude that will hurt us, rather than the technology itself” in her view.
Some of the research into skills trends showed relatively low growth in demand for traditional STEM areas but there is significant growth in the need for what Mason calls “generic” STEM skills, like using computers.
“So yes, in so many of the jobs of the future, people need to be able to work with tech. They need to be able to make sense of the numbers that might come out of a machine or a program, but they don’t actually need to program [computers], most people,” she explained.
Teaching coding in schools is sometimes said to be important for the same reason writing is important, even though few students will become professional writers; it teaches a basic understanding of how programming works.
Mason says that being able to use technology to “add value, to be more productive” at work will be important, across the workforce, but we don’t need a world of programmers.
A lot of workers will be able to learn how to use new technology that augments existing jobs, and others will be able to transition into new jobs that are created, which will likely maximise the value of the human touch.
Robots on the case
The Department of Human Services has begun implementing systems built around forms of AI — including as a decision-support tool that is relatively easy for staff to use.

Chief information officer Charles McHardie spoke about this on Tuesday at a forum about AI in the public sector, organised by the Institute of Public Administration Australia (full video below). He told his fellow public servants about the department’s exploration of AI products like IBM’s Watson, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s TensorFlow, and its three digital assistants.
Sam answers questions over the phone, Oliver’s job is guide people through the Centrelink claims process, and Roxy helps customer service staff when they have a tricky question about a claim they would otherwise have to ask a superior.
McHardie spoke about the jobs related to rolling out virtual helpers like Roxy — he said they needed to be “corrected and directed” repeatedly, like a child — but the research suggests these technologist roles won’t dominate the workforce.
Three questions rounded off an entertaining and thought-provoking keynote by Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist and futurist who spent a long time in Silicon Valley and is now an Australian National University professor leading a new research institute that collaborates with Data61:
What metrics, beyond efficiency, will be necessary in the 21st Century workplace?
Where on the organisational chart will we put artificial intelligent technologies?
What does training/skill acquisition look like in a 21st Century learning environment?
The first concerns the possibility that standard ways to measure the value of technology might not be the best methods to judge the success or failure of AI-enabled tools.
“What are going to be the other metrics we might want here?” Bell asked. “If not efficiency, is it efficacy, because we’re talking about whole systems?
“Is it about engagement, because we’re changing the model of what that work might do? Is it also about other things that we are far less used to thinking about technology giving us, like the space to make things? Is it about creativity and, god forbid, that much-ballyhooed word, innovation?”

She said the continuing rise of AI was about more than the various technological strands that have come together, “… it’s also about ethics, and regulation, and reason. It’s about how do we think about the systems that will contain these systems.”
In Bell’s view, questions about security, transparency, trust, and “explicability” of automated systems have to be “part and parcel” of public policy and regulation as algorithms and AIs begin to play a larger role.
“This can’t just be about ‘it took us less time to make a decision’ — we might want to think about quality of decisions. There are all sorts of mechanisms we might want to involve here as we think about how we will want to use these things.”
The second question is just a humourous way of considering how AI fits into hierarchical organisations. Who can challenge or overturn automated advice or decisions? Will bots be equals, subordinates, bosses, or some of each?

Education and training up next for disruption
The third question calls out an issue that has occurred to Mason and her colleagues as well: standard education and training needs to change. Universities, Bell suggested, might be next to face digital disruption.
“There’s going to be a real pressure to deliver education somewhat more efficiently but also to allow people to dip in and dip out more, which is lifelong learning,” Mason told The Mandarin.
Another issue is that technological change is never evenly distributed, as Bell noted, repeating this oft-quoted observation of cyberpunk author William Gibson. In some places the future is already here, but in others, like Centrelink’s welfare payments platform, extremely old legacy technology is still in place.
This certainly affects the ICT skills DHS needs to employ; it has a need for software engineers that is hard to fill from the local market, but its massive seven-year project to replace the system might change that.
Theoretically, a huge chunk of current jobs could be automated, but there is reason to doubt how soon the potential will be realised, given old technology tends to linger, especially when it costs a lot to replace. And other jobs that make use of especially human skills will be created, Mason suggests.
The research into skills demand suggests workers won’t suddenly need to undertake “massive re-skilling” but rather small “tweaks” to their existing skillsets, she explains, through new “micro-credentials” for an increasingly digitised world.
Mason says ongoing data analysis could reveal useful details about the kinds of add-on skills people will need to keep pace with how their jobs evolve, or to switch over to new jobs that emerge, and Data61 has already begun helping the Department of Jobs and Small Business (formerly Employment) understand how it could do that.
Other speakers at the AIIA conference on the jobs of the future include the head of the ACT public service, Kathy Leigh, Attorney-General’s Department secretary Chris Moraitis, Digital Transformation agency boss Gavin Slater, Australian Public Service Commission first assistant commissioner Kerryn Vine-Camp and several APS deputy secretaries. 
There will also be politicians like the opposition’s digital transformation lead Ed Husic, who has already thrown the cat among the pigeons with some comments published by Innovation Australia on Wednesday.

Cryonics attempts to protect the body from decay by storing it at extremely low temperaturesAs soon as the patient dies, the clock is ticking to start the procedure. The heart has stopped pumping and the brain is no longer receiving oxygen, meaning within minutes it will lose the ability to make new memories, and soon after that the cells will begin to die.This means the technician must get to work immediately after the individual is declared legally dead, cooling their body in an ice bath in order to slow down the process of degeneration.Future of WorkBBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.How to cope when the bots take your jobStaying one step ahead of the cyber-spiesHow to become a professional shopperWhy Finland is experimenting with 'free money'More Future of Work storiesAfter this blood is drained from the body and replaced with cryoprotectant agents - similar to antifreeze - in an attempt to stop ice crystals forming in the blood cells.The body is then placed in a storage tank and brought down to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196C) in an attempt to preserve the organs and tissue.Necessary skillsWhile cryonics has been practised since the 1970s, only the US and Russia actually have small storage facilities.In the US state of Michigan, the Cryonics Institute has about 2,000 living people signed up, and 165 patients who have already gone through the process. Cryonics InstituteDennis Kowalski is a paramedic by training, which he says is a perfect fit for the cryonics procedureDennis Kowalski is the institute's president and performs some of the cryonic procedures. By day, he is a paramedic.""The training to become a paramedic is perfect to become a standby in cryonics,"" he says.""You also need someone with a funeral director's licence (because you are still legally handling dead bodies), experience running a perfusion pump, and basic surgical skills.""Future roleThe Cryonics Institute is a co-operative with just three full-time members of staff, but Mr Kowalski thinks this will grow as medical science evolves.So far just 5,000 people around the globe have signed up but the numbers are growing so funeral homes may start to offer this as an option, he says. ""Artificial intelligence, genetic modification, stem cell engineering - all these fields are vindicating what we are doing, which is giving people the greatest opportunity possible.""Fisher StudiosDr Anders Sandberg has elected to have his head cryonically preserved after death, even though he puts the chance of revival at only 3%One of the 5,000 is Dr Anders Sandberg, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute.He is on the board of the Brain Preservation Foundation and has elected to have only his head preserved after death, even though he estimates a success rate of just 3%.Like Mr Kowalski, he argues the skills needed to become a cryonics technician are already in use in many medical professions.""Right now cryonics feels a little too cold or impersonal and it relies on the admission that it is uncertain, but I do think it will grow. ""In the future, wouldn't having a cryogenicist at the hospital make sense? When you do heart or brain surgery you lower the body temperature to buy more time and I imagine that over time we will start doing more low temperature surgery.""This is a job that you might want to do if you started out as a nurse or a perfusion specialist. It would not be a big leap from a technical standpoint, only from a social one, as it's using arguments from within medicine. ""There's a lot of resistance to overcome but from a practical perspective it makes sense and might save us from a lot of wasteful medicine.""Cryonics and cryogenicsAlthough they sound similar, cryonics and cryogenics are viewed very differently by the scientific community.Cryonics specifically relates to the preservation of the human body after death. Most supporters of the process admit they do not know if or when the technology will exist to revive people, or whether the techniques used to prepare the body for storage will have worked. Getty ImagesCryogenics has many applications in present day medicine, and can be used in stem cell researchCryogenics, on the other hand, has many applications in today's society. It involves the freezing of matter at temperatures of -150C or lower. In medicine, this includes the freezing of embryos, eggs, sperm, skin, and tissue in order to preserve them for future use.  Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College, London, suggests applying validated cryogenic techniques to the brain or whole body is doomed to failure. That's because the application of antifreeze during the preservation process fails to reach all of the brain, and it would be impossible to defrost each part of the body at the same time, he says""Advocates of cryonics are naive in comparing their wishful thinking with the successes achieved in storing loosely packed cells - such as sperm - at low temperatures. ""And they shouldn't forget that any resuscitation process that isn't instantaneous will merely set the process of decay running again.""Getty ImagesCryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organsBut Prof Coen says cryogenics is an exciting field ripe for expansion. Although the brain is far too complex, cryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organs. This could revolutionise the process of transplantation, which would no longer have to take place immediately. ""People are tremendously hard at work in this field trying to store organs such as the kidney, and even the heart on a long term basis. That would be a tremendous boon to our health and wellbeing,"" Prof Coen says.  ""But a whole body? Forget it.""Illustration by Karen Charmaine Chanakira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Todd Young, R-Ind., discuss the policy implications of artificial intelligence. (Washington Post via Twitter)
It’s high time for government officials to get up to speed on the promise and potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, two U.S. senators leading the charge said today.
“I think we’re entering an age where artificial intelligence is going to provide great benefits,” Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said during an AI conference presented in Washington, D.C., as part of The Washington Post’s Transformers program.
Cantwell compared the state of the AI field to the state of the internet or the drone industry during the early days, when policymakers weren’t completely sure how those technologies were going to be used.
Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., acknowledged that members of Congress aren’t sufficiently equipped to deal with all of the issues raised by AI. “I like a measure of humility from our legislators,” he said.
To remedy that gap, Cantwell and Young are among the sponsors of a bill known as the FUTURE of AI Act. (The title is an acronym standing for “Fundamentally Understanding The Usability and Realistic Evolution of Artificial Intelligence.”)
The bill calls for creating a federal advisory committee on AI, which would include representatives from academia, private industry, civil liberties groups and other stakeholders.
Cantwell said she’d also like to see the establishment of an AI engineering institute, analogous to the federally funded Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, to help government officials sort through the field’s technical complexities.
“That is probably right now where we’re missing a little bit of, if you will, technology oomph,” she said.

Such institutions would help government and industry leaders address worries about threats to personal privacy, automation’s impact on employment and the potential for black-box algorithms to “bake in” all-too-human racial and gender biases.
Some experts say regulation is desperately needed. Last year, for example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said governments had to be “proactive in regulation rather than reactive,” because the potential threats posed by AI could turn into actual threats so quickly.
Last week, Musk said he regarded AI as “far more dangerous than nukes” — a warning that was brought up several times in the course of today’s panel discussions.
Jack Clark, strategy and communications director for OpenAI, a non-profit research company, said “government has a clear role to play,” particularly when it comes to applications such as autonomous vehicles. But Young counseled caution.
“Before we overregulate it, we want to make sure that we get a better understanding what sort of policy structures need to be in place so people can meaningfully participate in an economy driven in large measure by AI, so that it’s not biased,” Young said, “and so that hopefully America can lead with respect to this technology, which has the potential to increase our rate of economic growth, I’ve been briefed, by up to doubling it within just over 15 years.”
Other angles on AI:

Cantwell put in a pitch for Seattle’s AI ventures, ranging from Amazon and Microsoft to the startups fostered by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “If you have any kind of AI education, please head to Seattle,” she said.
Both Cantwell and Young said they’d like to see Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg provide testimony about the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that’s come in for heavy criticism. Other lawmakers have already demanded that Zuckerberg appear before Congress.
Clark and other experts said this week’s case of a fatality linked to an Uber autonomous vehicle illustrated why AI should be regulated. Young pointed to the AV START Act as an effort to bring clarity to the issue.
Peggy Johnson, Microsoft’s executive vice president for business development, pointed to several AI applications fielded by her company, including Seeing AI and Microsoft’s collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies. Health care, financial services and climate monitoring were among the promising frontiers for AI, she said.
Some experts, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, have suggested enacting a “robot tax” to compensate for the employment disruption caused by automation. But Young said he was against the idea. “I would not start by taxing capital investments, which is what this is,” he said. Cantwell took a different tack: “I would have taken the tax bill and put a big down payment on retraining,” she said.

Mar 7, 2018, 8:38 AM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Photo by Matt Roberts/Getty ImagesAI is a problem for jobs, say the majority of Americans, but it’s someone else’s problem. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of US adults believe artificial intelligence will “eliminate more jobs than it creates,” according to a Gallup survey. But, the same survey found that less than a quarter (23 percent) of people were “worried” or “very worried” automation would affect them personally. Notably, these figures vary depending on education. For respondents with only a four-year college degree or less, 28 percent were worried about AI taking their job; for people with at least a bachelor degree, that figure was 15 percent. These numbers tell a familiar story. They come from a Gallup survey of more than 3,000 individuals on automation and AI. New details were released this week, but they echo the findings of earlier reports.One survey conducted by Quartz last year found that 90 percent of respondents thought that up to half of all jobs would be lost to automation in five years, but 91 percent said there was “no risk to my job.” Another study from the Pew Research Center in 2016 found the same: 65 percent of respondents said that 50 years from now automation would take over “much” of the work currently being done by humans, but 80 percent thought their own job would still exist in that time frame. Will AI destroy jobs or create them? No one really knowsOn the surface, these answers suggest complacency, ignorance, or short-sightedness, but they also reflect a deep divide among experts on what exactly the effects of new technology will have on the workplace. Studies trying to estimate job losses caused by advances in robotics and AI vary wildly. Some claim that up to 1 billion jobs will be destroyed overall as soon as 2022, while others predict that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs will be lost globally, but more than that number will be gained. As you might expect, the methodology in these studies also varies. What counts as “AI” and when is a job “destroyed”  are up for debate. Historically, though, it’s the cheerier scenario that’s been true: technology usually leads to a net gain in jobs, destroying some professions but creating new ones in the process. What’s different this time around, argue some economists and AI experts, is that machines are qualitatively smarter than they were in the past, and historical examples don’t offer a useful comparison. This stance is sometimes presented as a doomsday scenario in which AI and automation lead to mass unemployment.Given these contradictory predictions, it’s no wonder that most Americans think automation is someone else’s problem. After all, enough people are saying it is a problem, but not many individuals will look at their own job and think, “Yes, a computer could probably do all this.” This isn’t ignorance, either. Even in high-risk industries like truck driving, there’s only so much automation can do. A computer can drive on a highway, yes, but it can’t repair a truck, unload its inventory, argue with unhelpful warehouse managers, or even refill the gas tank. Not yet anyway. The newly released findings from Gallup’s survey also show that by one measure, the use of AI is already widespread in the US. Nearly nine out of 10 Americans (85 percent) use at least one of six devices or services that use features of artificial intelligence, says Gallup. Eighty-four percent of people use navigation apps like Waze, and 72 percent use streaming services like Netflix. Forty-seven percent use digital assistants on their smartphones, and 22 percent use them on devices like Amazon’s Echo.

Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of US adults believe artificial intelligence will “eliminate more jobs than it creates,” according to a Gallup survey. But, the same survey found that less than a quarter (23 percent) of people were “worried” or “very worried” automation would affect them personally. Notably, these figures vary depending on education. For respondents with only a four-year college degree or less, 28 percent were worried about AI taking their job; for people with at least a bachelor degree, that figure was 15 percent. 

These numbers tell a familiar story. They come from a Gallup survey of more than 3,000 individuals on automation and AI. New details were released this week, but they echo the findings of earlier reports.

One survey conducted by Quartz last year found that 90 percent of respondents thought that up to half of all jobs would be lost to automation in five years, but 91 percent said there was “no risk to my job.” Another study from the Pew Research Center in 2016 found the same: 65 percent of respondents said that 50 years from now automation would take over “much” of the work currently being done by humans, but 80 percent thought their own job would still exist in that time frame. 

""Will AI destroy jobs or create them? No one really knows""

On the surface, these answers suggest complacency, ignorance, or short-sightedness, but they also reflect a deep divide among experts on what exactly the effects of new technology will have on the workplace. Studies trying to estimate job losses caused by advances in robotics and AI vary wildly. Some claim that up to 1 billion jobs will be destroyed overall as soon as 2022, while others predict that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs will be lost globally, but more than that number will be gained. As you might expect, the methodology in these studies also varies. What counts as “AI” and when is a job “destroyed”  are up for debate. 

Historically, though, it’s the cheerier scenario that’s been true: technology usually leads to a net gain in jobs, destroying some professions but creating new ones in the process. What’s different this time around, argue some economists and AI experts, is that machines are qualitatively smarter than they were in the past, and historical examples don’t offer a useful comparison. This stance is sometimes presented as a doomsday scenario in which AI and automation lead to mass unemployment.

Given these contradictory predictions, it’s no wonder that most Americans think automation is someone else’s problem. After all, enough people are saying it is a problem, but not many individuals will look at their own job and think, “Yes, a computer could probably do all this.” This isn’t ignorance, either. Even in high-risk industries like truck driving, there’s only so much automation can do. A computer can drive on a highway, yes, but it can’t repair a truck, unload its inventory, argue with unhelpful warehouse managers, or even refill the gas tank. Not yet anyway. 

The newly released findings from Gallup’s survey also show that by one measure, the use of AI is already widespread in the US. Nearly nine out of 10 Americans (85 percent) use at least one of six devices or services that use features of artificial intelligence, says Gallup. Eighty-four percent of people use navigation apps like Waze, and 72 percent use streaming services like Netflix. Forty-seven percent use digital assistants on their smartphones, and 22 percent use them on devices like Amazon’s Echo. 

This definition of AI-enhanced products may strike some as overly broad, but it contains an important lesson that’s relevant to our predictions about job losses. It shows that AI is not a singular entity. It is a process, something that’s integrated into products and jobs bit by bit. You might not think that Netflix’s predictions of what you want to watch next count as artificial intelligence (or that they’re even intelligent at all), but they’ve helped the service steal viewers from traditional TV and cable companies by shaping the creation of shows like House of Cards.

The scientists are creating systems that can learn for themselves and be able to operate in the home, the workplace and even on the sports field. The University of Texas, Austin team is incorporating artificial intelligence into its machines so that they can deal with real-world situations.Among the systems are automated assistants that will carry out simple tasks in a working officeScience fiction films predicted that in the future we would have intelligent robots.In the Day the Earth Stood Still, we had the sinister Gort; in Forbidden Planet there was Robby; and in the TV series Lost In Space it was Zachary Smith's nemesis, the Robot.Peter StoneRobot office assistants need to be self-learning to cope with the unpredictable environmentIt's been more than 50 years since those fictional representations - so where are they?Although we have had robots in factories for decades, getting them to leave the shop-floor has been no easy task. In manufacturing plants, they carry out pre-ordained, repetitive tasks all day and night.But if they step outside, they are unable to deal with the chaos of the real world. It is a place where order and routine are gone. Even the simplest of tasks are complicated by the unpredictability and vagueness of human interaction.A team at the University of Texas, Austin has set itself the challenge of bringing robots out of their comfort zone and into our messy world.Laptops on motorised pedestals wander eerily through the lab like slow, partly built Daleks. They are the researchers' Building Wide Intelligence Project. Currently, they are learning their way around the place.Pallab Ghosh/ BBC NewsRobot soccer players have a short career - usually a season or twoSo far they have learned how to avoid bumping into stuff. But great things are planned for them.The aim is for them to be able to carry out simple instructions, like finding a colleague or locating and bringing over a piece of equipment. But that is easier said than done. They need to be able to recognise objects and people. They also need to understand rather than recognise human speech. There is a difference. The later involves having a limited number of voice commands pre-programmed into them. But understanding requires context and meaning. This can only be achieved using AI techniques, which involve the robot asking questions to help it understand what words mean. The researcher leading the project is a linguist, Dr Jesse Thomason. He has restricted the number of questions the partly built Daleks can ask to just five. Why so few?He tells me that the robots can become ""infuriating"" with their questions. They would ask them forever like a small child.Top teamIndeed, when Jesse teaches one of the robots it seems like he is talking to a baby.His colleague, Dr Andrea Thomaz, is trying to teach human etiquette to the Daleks. She wants them to know when it is appropriate to approach a human and start up a conversation. Dr Thomaz has developed code to enable the robots to give out social cues, such as waving at someone, and then to look for movements or expressions from their human counterparts that indicate that they are happy to talk.""The problem really is that robots have to be able to deal with the dynamics and noise and unpredictability that people bring into the environment, and so we have to think about perception, control and learning to build robots that can deal with that sort of thing,"" she told BBC News.In another part of the lab, humanoid robots are playing football. They are part of an international ""RoboCup"" initiative, which has set itself the challenge of building a team capable of beating the men's World Cup winners by 2050.The robots play on a mini indoor football pitch, working together as a team and learning from each match.Tiki-taka robotsPlaying football is far harder for machine-learning systems than chess or go, according to Prof Peter Stone who leads this project and plays football regularly himself.""Rather than turn-taking, you have everyone moving at the same time. And if you take too long to decide what to do when you pass the ball, your opponents come and take the ball from you.""It's also continuous. There are no discrete places where people need to be. They are always moving, through the air and through space.""So there are many challenges in contrast to some of the board games.""The kinds of robots in 1950s films are still in the realms of science fiction. But with rapid strides in artificial intelligence, it won't be long before they become part of our every day lives.

However, pesticides also carry inherent risks, such as the damage they can do to the environment and local ecosystems, and the hazards that over-exposure can pose to human health. Their production and distribution also has environmental costs, as well as financial costs to the farmers. For this reason, when they must be used, there are a lot of good reasons that they should be used efficiently, and accurately.

Computer vision specialist Blue River Technology has developed a solution for exactly that, using advanced machine learning algorithms to enable robots to make decisions, based on visual data (just as we would do ourselves) about whether or not a plant is a pest, and then deliver an accurate, measured blast of chemical pesticides to tackle the unwanted pests. Given that traditionally such decisions are made on a field-by-field basis, rather than plant-by-plant basis, the opportunities for efficiency are clear.
PROMOTED
Farm equipment and services giant John Deere saw the potential of this development and acquired the start-up late last year and added it to the catalog of high tech, data-powered services it already offers its customers.

It is just the latest move in John Deere’s push to put data-driven analytical tools and automation in the hands of farmers. With the rate of global population growth, the company – established in 1837 as a tool manufacturer – understands that they serve an industry where small efficiencies quickly add up to big competitive advantages.
Already the firm enables automated farm vehicles to plough and sow, under the control of pinpoint-accurate GPS systems. On top of that its Farmsight system is designed to enable data-driven insights to inform agricultural decision making, based on shared user data from subscribers all around the world.

With so much data now available and an ever-growing number of sophisticated tools to crunch through it, it’s no surprise that agriculture is staking its claim to a slice of the AI-driven tech revolution. And it’s a good job too - the industry which provides us with our most basic necessity for survival is heavily affected by weather patterns, climate change, water availability and human migration patterns. And that’s before you even get into the impact that economic and political activity can have.
Luckily infrastructure for gathering data which can be used to predict the effects of these influences is increasingly available. Satellite imagery – previously often prohibitively expensive – is more affordable than ever with one person I spoke to recently comparing the cost of launching a satellite to launching an app. Visual data is also available from unmanned aerial vehicles such as quadcopter drones, which can be used to monitor the growth and spread of pest through crops in real-time.
One company specializing in analysis of satellite imagery last year came within 1% of accurately predicting corn and soya yields by applying machine learning algorithms to their data. It has already released its predictions for this year’s season, which it claims will be more accurate.
The large-scale mechanization of agriculture means that accurate data is available from the machines which spread seeds and harvest crops. Robots - such as those developed by Google Funded Abundant Robotics which suck ripe fruit from branches with vacuums -naturally record everything they do and every parameter of their operation. This structured machine data meshes well with unstructured data from meteorological or satellite imagery, and when filtered through AI algorithms will provide insights that more accurately predict yields and losses.
Of course, getting on-board with all these possibilities could prove challenging to some farmers who are more accustomed to running their businesses on grain silos than data silos. And even in the developed world, its generally acknowledged that the slow rollout of fast broadband services to rural areas has had a constricting effect on business. In the developing world the situation is worse with local farmers often reliant on slow, shared internet connections provided by community cooperatives or charities.
But it’s problems like this that agricultural technology plans to overcome, and with the world population expected to grow by another billion by 2030 while the amount of available agricultural land is expected to shrink, it is in all our interest to make farming as efficient as we can.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

AI Seen as Greater Job Threat Than Immigration, Offshoring
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

58% in U.S. say new technology is the greater threat to jobs
23% of U.S. workers worry they may lose their jobs to technology
12% of workers worry they may lose their jobs to immigration


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than half of Americans (58%) say technology poses a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. over the next decade, while 42% see immigration and offshoring as the greater threat. Republicans, who see immigration and offshoring as roughly an equal threat as technology, are the only subgroup of Americans not to see technology as a greater threat.


Americans' Perceptions of Threats to Jobs Over the Next Decade
Which of the following do you believe is a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. in the next 10 years: job loss due to immigration and offshoring, that is jobs or companies moving overseas, or job loss due to new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence?

NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





 
These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. The data show Americans are largely positive about the impact AI will have, but still expect it to cost jobs, with 73% of Americans predicting that AI will lead to a loss of more jobs than it creates.
The survey asked Americans to choose which they thought was the greater threat to U.S. jobs over the next decade, immigration and offshoring or new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence. The question defined offshoring as jobs or companies moving overseas.
Although majorities across nearly all subgroups agree that new technology poses a greater risk to their jobs than immigration and offshoring does, Republicans consider the threat posed by technology (52%) to be roughly equal to that of immigration and offshoring (48%). Republicans' perceptions contrast sharply with Democrats', whose views strongly tilt toward believing new technology is the greater threat to jobs (67%) than is immigration and offshoring (33%).
U.S. Workers Twice as Likely to Worry About Losing Job to AI Than to Immigration
U.S. workers as well see a greater threat from new technology than from immigration and offshoring. Almost one in four American workers say they are very or somewhat worried about losing their own jobs to new technology, nearly twice as many as the 12% who say the same about immigration and offshoring. Levels of worry about these specific threats to American workers' jobs are higher than the 8% of U.S. adults who worry about being laid off in the next 12 months, in general.


American Workers' Worry About Job Loss to New Technology vs. Immigration
How worried are you about your job being eliminated as a result of new technology, automation, robots, or artificial intelligence?
How worried are you about an immigrant, that is, someone from another country taking your job, or are you not worried at all?

NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





 
For the most part, American workers' fear of losing their jobs to new technology versus to immigrants varies little by subgroup. However, the key exception is Republican workers, who worry about the two threats to their own jobs roughly equally -- 19% for new technology versus 17% for immigration. Among Democratic workers, nearly a quarter (23%) worry about losing their jobs to new technology compared with 9% who worry about the threat to their personal jobs posed by immigration.

Bottom Line
Americans largely perceive new technology as a greater threat to jobs in the U.S. over the next decade than immigration and offshoring. This view is supported by a recent Oxford study of the potential impact of the adoption of AI on the U.S. job market, which suggests as many as 47% of jobs are potentially at risk of elimination from this new technology. In contrast, estimates of the cost in American jobs from immigration and offshoring vary widely, with some reports suggesting these may create more jobs than they eliminate.
The risk posed by new technology to American jobs has been given little public attention by President Donald Trump's administration. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said that there was no need to worry about AI displacing American workers for a half century or more. Trump has been much more focused on the impact of immigration, based on the contention that immigrants take jobs away from Americans.
Whether the Trump administration is focused on the impact of AI on jobs, many others see it as particularly pressing. Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) say the adoption of AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University-Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15 to Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
-For results based on the total sample of 3,297 U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.
-For results based on the sample of 2,871 employed U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

Developing good software is extremely challenging for any number of reasons. Look no further than cloud-based solutions like Workday to see that just because you have a $26 billion company, it doesn’t mean you’re capable of deploying something that would be considered remotely usable by anyone other than your local human resources department. On the other hand, deploy a CRM tool like Salesforce for your sales team, and you’ll wonder how you could have ever lived without it. The difference between good and bad software is something called software quality assurance or SQA. It’s not just about software testing, but encompasses the entire software development process.
If you’ve ever worked in a software testing role (a key function of SQA), then you know what a isht job it is for at least several reasons. Firstly, you need to make sure the software developers built what the requirements document asked for (referred to as internal requirements), but that’s not enough. If your business analyst didn’t do their job properly, then the requirements document may not actually reflect what the user asked for (referred to as external requirements) so even though you built the right thing, you actually built the wrong thing. Then, because the sales people have already sold something that wasn’t actually built yet, you’re pressured to release the software anyway even though it’s complete crap.

That’s the joy of working in SQA. It’s not just about testing software to internal and external requirements, but also about developing software properly.
We recently talked about a company that is using artificial intelligence to find people who would make good software engineers even though they may not have the stereotypical pedigree. It’s a great idea because intelligent people are simply those individuals who have the ability to learn, and that will take you places in the ever-changing world of software development. Of course that’s only a temporary need, because soon we’re going to have software that creates itself – using artificial intelligence of course. Until then, developing good software will continue to be difficult because of humans, so we’re interested in learning about more companies out there that might be using artificial intelligence to help develop better software. Here are three two examples and one startup that should be using AI.
Mabl
Founded in early 2017, Boston startup Mabl has taken in $10 million in funding to develop “the only machine learning test automation service that automatically maintains tests and identifies regressions for you make functional testing much easier”. Let’s get some of this terminology defined for the average layman. Regression testing is when you create a suite of software tests and then run them over and over as a software product evolves. Every time one of your brogrammers on Soylent makes a change, you can then run the regression tests to make sure nothing broke.
Bonus points for referring to software testing as a “journey”
In ancient times, software testers would use record-and-playback tools to create these regression test suites (anyone remember Rational Robot?). This would allow software testers to automate functional software testing, that is, testing the software in the way that the users would actually use it via the “graphical user interface” or GUI. That’s also called “test automation”, and it’s something that the founders (Izzy Azeri and Dan Belcher) saw could be optimized while they were working at Google. The reason they were at Google is because that’s who bought their last successful startup, Stackclouds, which raised $15 million before being acquired. Mabl is free to use and the founders are solid guys so go check it out.
Update 09/20/2018: Mabl has taken in an additional $20 million from a Series B Round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) for a brand new enterprise product. This brings the company’s total funding to $30 million so far. 
Diffblue
Founded in 2016, Oxford University spinout Diffblue has taken in 17 million British pounds (about $23.46 million) from investors that include Goldman Sachs to essentially “automate all traditional coding tasks: bug fixing, test writing, finding and fixing exploits, refactoring code, translating from one language to another, and creating original code to fit specifications”.  As of now they have three products:

Automatic Test Generation – While before we talked about “functional testing” using the GUI, there are also tests that programmers write are supposed to write behind the scenes that look for problems. Also called “unit testing”, the idea here is that you don’t want your highly paid Indian developers spending their time doing this sort of stuff. Now AI will do it for you.
Refactor – This is all about changing a piece of code while making sure it still does the same thing. Refactoring makes code cleaner and helps with things like maintenance and performance. AI would be perfect for doing something like this, and it can even test itself to make sure nothing broke.
Security – The AI algorithms get all devious and try to find places in the code that hackers other malicious AI algorithms may try and exploit.

The platform is something they’ve been developing over the past 10 years, and now they’re rolling it out to blue chip companies.
Split
No, this isn’t the now defunct startup that built an app that helps you avoid people you don’t want to run into (first world problem) but a nearly three-year-old Silicon Valley startup that makes tools for testing software. With nearly $27 million in funding, Split offers a solution for a type of testing that many people out there who work in web development would be familiar with – A/B testing – and it’s already being used by some big clients like Salesforce and Chase. More simply, A/B testing can be described as experimenting. You choose two different options in your software design (A & B), then you have 1,000 people use them. Whichever performs better using whatever performance metrics you choose can then be implemented. Here are some of the features in nerd-speak:
Bonus points for referring to A/B testing as a “customer experience”
While we didn’t see them explicitly talk about using artificial intelligence, it’s exactly the sort of thing that could be optimized with some AI algorithms. All Split needs to do is hire a few AI programmers and a “big data expert”, then instruct their marketing team to splash these terms all over their website liberally so they can raise even bigger funding rounds. You’re welcome.
What usually happens when we write one of these broad-topic AI articles is that shortly after, we get inundated with “you forgot our cool AI startup” emails which is understandable considering that we usually “forget” all kinds of startups out there. That’s because research costs money, and we only have so many MBAs working 9-9-6 trying to get you free, insightful research just as quick as their little hands can type. If your startup uses artificial intelligence / big data / machine learning / neural networks / etc. to develop better software then, yes, we forgot you. Please drop us a note reminding us about how cool you are, and we’ll include you in a coming article that will dive deeper into the topic of using artificial intelligence for software development.

Artificial Intelligence and the Rise of the Bots
An autonomous, artificially intelligent entity could task itself with inciting hatred to millions, even without being designed for that purpose.

by Nathan González Mendelejis



 


The 1984 classic Terminator envisions a future taken over by warrior robots on a quest to eradicate humans. The story is a classic Frankesteinian tale of a hubris-fueled human invention getting out of hand and eventually turning against its creator. Recent developments in defense-related artificial intelligence (AI), such as autonomous drones, offer eerie reminders of the sci-fi plots of yesterday. And yet, while we may be tempted to ruminate on future robot armies, a more immediate AI threat is brewing right under our noses: heteromated terrorism, which occurs when humans engage in violent acts at the behest of AI technology.

Computer scientists Hamid Ekbia and Bonnie Nardi coined the term heteromation to describe “an extraction of economic value from low-cost or free labor in computer-mediated networks.” This refers to commercial technology that pushes critical tasks to the end users: humans. We can think of a person scanning products at the supermarket self-check-out line at the prompting of a machine, or someone uploading valuable personal information at Facebook’s request in order to help enrich the company with data that can be turned into ad revenue. 

If automation involves machines doing the work of humans, heteromation refers to the way machines task humans with essential actions. As Ekbia and Nardi argue, heteromation turns “artificial intelligence on its head” by extracting free or low-cost labor from willing human participants.
Given the prevalence of so-called “bot” agitation on social media, and given the fact that social media serves as a primary platform for political recruitment, it is not a stretch to envision acts of heteromated terrorism becoming a trend. Filmmakers and authors have imagined the AI threat as a rational process, whereby non-human entities accumulate power and eventually move to systematically replace humans. But heteromated terrorism is something arguably more dangerous—and also more likely to occur in the near term, as it marries the power and reach of algorithmic content production and targeting with humans’ propensity for irrational outbursts.





For example, an individual could be radicalized at home through the relentless input of bot-generated content online, boosted and repeated ad nauseam into an echo chamber the target human considers credible. The human would then take up arms and fight for a cause of the network’s choosing.

Heteromated terrorism could manifest itself as a conscious enterprise, sponsored by a state or a sophisticated non-state actor that lets bots loose on unsuspecting social-media users. It could also emerge as the natural byproduct of AI engagement with today’s acerbic body politic—autonomous bots radicalizing themselves online and in turn becoming independent agents of subversion. Regardless of whether it is planned or spontaneous, the threat of heteromated terrorism is upon us.
The Two Radicals

To realize how likely the rise of heteromated terrorism is, we need only look back at the highly publicized radicalization of two political actors—one artificial and one human—which took place in 2016.
The first example is the seemingly innocuous radicalization of “Tay,” a Microsoft-created AI bot. Tay was released onto Twitter under the handle @TayTweets, and within twenty-four hours, users had successfully taught it to spew conspiracy theories and racist tweets. “I fucking hate feminists and they should die and burn in hell,” wrote Tay in a March 26 tweet. Four minutes later, Tay tweeted, “Hitler was right I hate the Jews.” Some of the outbursts were merely parroting what other users had written—but some of the comments were developed by the bot itself after picking up topics and lingo from the Twitterverse. Microsoft shut down Tay, but the lesson was clear: an autonomous, artificially intelligent entity could task itself with inciting hatred to millions, even though it had not been designed for that purpose.
The second radicalization example is that of Edgar Maddison Welch, a human from Salisbury, North Carolina. On December 4, 2016, Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington, DC armed with a semi-automatic rifle and on a mission to rescue children he thought were being held captive. Welch had been motivated by extremist media outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart, as well as by Twitter and message boards that had become increasingly prone to promoting conspiracy theories. According to Welch’s echo chamber, the pizza parlor in question was host to a pedophile ring in which then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was supposedly implicated. The accusation was blatantly untrue and absurd, but like many extreme viewpoints, it gained a gullible audience online.
Tay and Welch represent two sides of what a heteromated terror equation might look like. On one side would be an artificially intelligent network pushing extremism, and on the other, a willing human nudged to act on behalf of the network’s objectives. What makes heteromation such a pressing concern today is that we already know Welch’s radicalization was likely influenced, if not by sophisticated artificial intelligence, then at least by a cadre of relatively simple bots that helped amplify the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory over social media.
The Rise of the Bots
The extreme rhetoric that inspired Welch’s acts were fed by a loose network that involved the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a private troll farm based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which U.S. intelligence claims has ties to the Kremlin. (A troll farm is a group of humans paid to create and comment on antagonistic claims online.) The broader network also relies on activists and media personalities with an interest in disseminating combative views. The brilliance of IRA’s efforts is in the company’s ability to fuse with existing political and social dynamics of the countries it targets. One such country is the Ukraine, where Russia has an interest in supporting separatists. Another is the United States, where Russia wants to undermine a political establishment it has battled for two generations. The IRA doesn’t create the social schisms it exploits, but it has had some successes in harnessing and amplifying them via trolls and social bots—algorithms that help with both targeting and automation of propaganda messages.
Emilio Ferrara, et al., define a social bot as “a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior.” Such bots have already become highly advanced and hard to distinguish from human actors. For example, bots can be selective about whom they follow (gauging by influence level and content type), when they post (to mimic human sleep and activity patterns), and they can even interact with human users.
Social bots additionally have the capacity to model themselves after people in a social network, not unlike the way machines took on the physical characteristics of humans in the Terminator franchise. By scouring for names, profile photos, and speech patterns from actual people who willingly offer up their identities to social-media companies, bots are successfully exploiting today’s highly heteromated environment.
Bots are difficult to detect, not only because of their human resemblance, but because human social- media activity has a high tolerance for interacting with unknown users, either in the form of replies on Twitter or Facebook users accepting friend requests from unknowns. Ferrara, et al., found that 20 percent of legitimate Facebook users accept friend requests from anyone—even folks they do not know. And 60 percent of users will accept friend requests from users with whom they share at least one common friend. This means that once a bot has successfully befriended one human user, the door opens to the infiltration of a broader social network.
Heteromated Terror
Heteromated terror need not be limited to right-wing extremism. In fact, the Islamic State’s social-media campaign has followed a model similar to that of Russia’s IRA. Both the IRA and the Islamic State rely on two separate stages for propagating messages: content creation (original work written by humans) and amplification (retweets and comments by humans and bots). The amplification phase lends itself well to automation, allowing a comment to be retweeted thousands of times in order to keep it from fading into Internet obscurity, as the vast majority of social-media posts do. But as Tay has shown, artificially intelligent bots can now take on the role of content creators, too.
More sophisticated social-bot campaigns would give the Islamic State and similar groups a significant boost in capabilities. Like the Russian IRA, Islamist radicals can assume a good percentage of their target audience would not be aware it is interacting with non-human accounts. Even algorithmic tools developed to detect bots have a mixed record, and Christian Grimme, et al., showed that today non-English accounts are particularly difficult for anti-bot technology to flag. This means the use of Arabic, French, Urdu and other languages found in the diverse Muslim world will be attractive vehicles for heteromating Islamist terrorism.
A Campaign without a General
As artificial intelligence further develops on social-media platforms, we can imagine heteromated terrorism being exponentially more difficult to combat than anything we have fought to this day. That is because the extremist signal will not need to originate from a particular group or state. Instead, autonomous AI bots will learn from the already existing cesspool of extremist propaganda on the Internet and build upon it independently of human direction. For states fighting terror, there will be no targets to bomb or countries to sanction. The ever-evolving enemy will live online.

How artificial intelligence will impact the South African workforce.
Last year, research by Accenture and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) posited that artificial intelligence (AI) had the potential to double the growth rate of the South African economy and boost rates of profitability by an average of 38 percent by 2035. This is great news for South African businesses of course, but an AI-dominated landscape brings with it multiple ethical and social issues, including the problem of a labour force that feels redundant and whose skills may be no longer needed.
AI will undoubtedly change the world of work, just as the Industrial Revolution did in the 1700s and 1800s. Certain jobs will become obsolete, as intelligent machines will be able to complete tasks quicker and more accurately than humans. New roles will also be created – jobs that we haven’t even thought about yet. AI will be the biggest disruptor the business world has seen in over two centuries. It is little wonder, then, that people are already starting to get jittery about the possibility of being replaced by, or working with, a robot in the near future.




Why we see AI as a threat
Neuroscience, which focuses on how the brain works, has some valuable insights into precisely why AI is perceived as such a threat by the workforce. As social animals, our desire to be part of a herd – in this case a company – is hardwired into our brains, an evolutionary remnant of when physical survival depended on safety in numbers. Any sense of social exclusion, therefore, is felt as a danger to our very existence, and our brain is consequently sensitive to this trigger in our social environments.
Feeling excluded is one of the five social triggers that is interpreted by the brain as a result of its central organising principal: to minimize danger and maximise reward. These triggers can put our brains into a threat or reward state that has an effect on our capacity to solve problems, make decisions and collaborate. AI is particularly threatening because it can be triggered by all five areas of human social experience: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness (SCARF).
AI threatens an employee’s Status, as their value in the workplace and as a productive member of society comes into question. Certainty is no longer guaranteed, as the future is unpredictable and employees wonder whether they will even have a job in the next five years. With AI encroaching on the workplace, employees feel as though they are losing their Autonomy because they cease to feel in control and think that they may not have options. Their Relatedness is threatened as they believe that they don’t belong anymore and are not sure which group they may belong to in the future. Finally, a sense of Fairness is triggered in employees as they feel as though they may not be treated equally.
One of the worst effects of being in a threatened state is that people are not open to change because the brain has less access to long-term memory and its capacity to think rationally and make decisions is reduced. This is because the brain is in a flight-or-flight survival mode, and so does not prioritise these actions. People are consequently also unable to see AI as something that could allow them the space to be more innovative, explore a new career, or give them more free time.
This brain state also affects the control of self-defeating behaviour; for example, an employee in a threatened state could stop being collaborative with their colleagues, procrastinate in their work, and have lower capacity to solve problems. None of this behaviour is conducive to doing business or ensuring a productive workforce.
Cultivating a growth mindset in employees
As AI becomes more of a permanent fixture in companies, employers should start focusing on fostering a growth mindset in their employees, so that they welcome the change that AI will bring, rather than fearing it. This mindset, pioneered by the work of Dr Carol Dweck, is based on whether employees believe that their abilities are finite or if they can be developed. If they do believe that their ability can be developed, then they will be inspired by the change and look forward to it as an opportunity to grow.
We must also remember that, with the dawn of the age of AI, human qualities become far more valuable. AI machines cannot truly collaborate and adjust their behaviour in relation to others’ actions. They do not have the same degree of social intelligence, and cannot become leaders. AI machines also lack business acumen and are unable to transfer their ‘skills’ from one industry to another. All these qualities, even in the age of AI, will still be a vital aspect of ensuring a prosperous society and thriving economy.
Entrepreneurship provides a solution
It is undeniable, however, that many South African’s jobs will become obsolete or change as AI becomes more of a permanent fixture in the workplace. The significant portion of SA’s workforce that is unskilled or semi-skilled will most likely be the first to be replaced by machines that will be able to do the work more efficiently. This will place pressure on individuals to change how they approach work and possibly to seek work in other sectors. However, this is no different to how jobs have evolved in the past. The introduction of more efficient farming technology a few centuries ago, for example, meant fewer people were needed to farm the land and so more workers were able to take up roles in other industries where there were labour shortages.
But with every door that AI closes to the workforce, another one opens – in this case, entrepreneurship. AI will make entrepreneurship an even more sought-after skill in the SA economy, as it focuses on innovation, provides employment opportunities, and has significant social impact. Entrepreneurship also gives individuals a sense of belonging, as being productive members of society provides Status, Certainty, Autonomy, and a sense of Relatedness and Fairness. People are able to elevate their level of contribution, they have more certainty and autonomy in their own work in an entrepreneurial setting, and can develop a more individualised sense of belonging by being able to gain as much as they contribute. This sense of belonging means that people are performing at their best, as they do not feel threatened by a change that may seem out of their control.
Of course, in order to retain employees, it is not feasible to ask them to set up their own shops. However, as employers, we can look at the ways that we define and integrate current employment when the machines join us in the workforce. By allowing employees more autonomy and control in the way they do and view their work, we can put them in a better brain state, as it plays to their social drivers. In most industries where the impact of machines will become more prominent, this is already being done in the advancement of the gig economy.
In conclusion, then, AI is definitely set to change our workforce in the next few decades, but not all these changes will be threatening. It is up to employers to ensure that their employees realise this by playing to the social domains that trigger the brain, so that every individual can continue to perform optimally, learn new skills, and work towards their future roles in stimulating our economy. If we are able to do this, we will ensure our brains will be at their best to face and embrace this change.
In a world that is becoming more mechanistic, it is our ability to be aware of our social surroundings that both sets us apart, and allows us to never fear a robot taking our job.

“There’s a strong, hard demand driven by smart cities and surveillance,” says vice president Yang... [+] Fan (left) with CEO Xu Li.

It's common now to read of the Chinese government's push to lead the world in applications of artificial intelligence. But, in fact, many of the greatest gains are the result of key individual actions and intersections over many years.

Take the case of SenseTime, a standout in facial-recognition technology and, by virtue of an implied capitalization it says exceeds $3 billion, China's largest AI unicorn.
SenseTime's creation begins with Tang Xiaoou's Ph.D. in computer vision from MIT in 1996, which led to a teaching post at Chinese University of Hong Kong. Busy in the same engineering department there was Xu Li, en route to his own doctorate in computer vision and imaging in 2010. (Computer vision is software for recognizing images.)
PROMOTED
The two formed part of the nucleus of what became SenseTime a few years later, with Xu as CEO. One of Tang's students at the school, Xu Bing, today spearheads the company's fundraising and strategic partnerships. And when Tang took a sabbatical from the university in 2008 to head a computer-vision group at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing, he met Yang Fan, now SenseTime's head of product development. ""It took me a couple of years to find out what I really liked to work on at MIT. Then it took more than 20 years of hard work in this area such that we finally start to see some real industrial applications and impacts. It does not happen overnight,"" Tang, now 49, writes in an email.

It also took investors to give the group a critical boost. Justin Niu, a partner at venture capital firm IDG in Beijing, in 2014 visited professor Tang and his research team, still working out of the same university lab. They showed him demos of how a camera enhanced by machine learning could pull distinct faces out of a smoggy day's tableau in Tiananmen Square.
""Their techniques are quite shocking to me. I realized how far the progress had been in the field,"" Niu recalls.
IDG joined with another firm, StarVC, to lead a $30 million investment into the formative SenseTime as Tang was processing the company's registration paperwork. The professor and his founding group, by then numbering ten and all at least a decade his junior, parked themselves a few miles away in Hong Kong's Science Park. Yang Fan added a contingent from his base, Tsinghua University.

In 2014, a series of technology breakthroughs won SenseTime global acclaim from publications such as Nature and Science and other media attention before IDG came calling. These included a research paper showing its computing capability, the world's first to outperform human vision under certain conditions, and its claim of beating Facebook's DeepFace with its algorithms called DeepID.
Fast-forward to 2018, after stakes were taken by other Chinese VCs and private corporations, and by Qualcomm of the U.S. SenseTime's workforce numbers 1,500, with five mainland hubs added to the Hong Kong site. Revenues aren't disclosed, but by Forbes Asia's estimations approach $100 million.








SenseTime founder Tang Xiaoou.





Tang remains the largest individual shareholder. SenseTime sports two faces: a research team working with 18 professors at universities across China and the profit-seeking commercial operations, which Tang, simply referred to as ""founder,"" and Xu Li lead. ""We hope our professors would continue to focus on the fundamental research,' including our founding professor, so we can continue to have discoveries,"" says CEO Xu, who spent three years at a Motorola research center in Shanghai and six months at Omron Research Institute in Kyoto.
SenseTime's field is exploding, and it says sales are growing better than fivefold annually. With the proliferation of smart machines and mobile devices, computer ""eyes"" are seemingly everywhere. In China's burgeoning fintech sector, SenseTime's recognition technology has scanned and authenticated the faces of 400 million consumers, 300 million for China Mobile alone. Its software is being used by China's ten largest security surveillance manufacturers, fitted on various Chinese phone makers to catalog, search and enhance user images, and soon should equip autonomous vehicles in a partnership with Honda.
To put the current pace in context: It had taken SenseTime nine months to produce its first commercial product: a face-based identity-verification system for opening an account at one of China's 4,000 peer-to-peer microlenders, phasing out days of laborious manual processing. SenseTime claims applying its facial recognition to a security lock can be as safe as an eight-digit password, compared to four digits in 2014.
In mobile apps, SenseTime's augmented-reality software helps place products in commercials (such as during Alibaba's Singles Day promotion) and other short videos and live broadcasts. For instance, a performer could pull a showcased item, such as a soda can, from out of nowhere. On top of the consumer uses come the ""public security"" applications, which can be the most lucrative. ""There's a strong, hard demand driven by smart cities and surveillance,"" Yang Fan says.
Visitors at SenseTime offices are greeted by cameras that capture their images while instantly matching their identities with an internal registrar and making an estimate of their age, and detecting intruders behind face masks or eyeglasses.
With positioning technology capable of processing data from 240 points on a human face, a leap from just 106 points before August 2017, SenseTime-aided monitors capture and count every passerby, whether inside an Ikea outlet or at a busy downtown intersection. That can be used for general crowd data (breaking down by age or sex, say, for marketing) or a specific identity search. Humans are surprisingly good at recognizing faces but no longer a match for machines that can also attach names and data to an image.
SenseTime, with an internal training database of 2 billion faces (many of them collected online) and claiming 10 billion more images and videos, has worked with 40 Chinese localities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing. Yang cites a case in 2016 in which police in Chongqing, powered by its technology, identified 69 suspects and caught 14 fugitives within 40 days. ""What we've accomplished [once] happened only in movies,"" he says.
At the central government level, SenseTime is working with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute to develop the nation's so-called citizen network identity infrastructure.
The web is another policing opportunity. In 2016 the Cyberspace Administration of China, its central internet regulator, enlisted SenseTime on a national cleanup campaign: to scan and delete online pornography, banishing videos of violence, terrorism and horror as well. This work would otherwise be attempted by legions of laborers. Result: The Chinese web might be the most ""hygienic"" on earth. ""It's very, very difficult to find all these videos on the Chinese internet today,"" Yang says.








SenseTime’s recognition technology has scanned and authenticated the faces of 400 million consumers.





Of course, SenseTime does not have this emergent imaging sector to itself. Two prominent Chinese rivals, Megvii of the Face++ brand and Yitu Technology, are on the same hunt for clients. Megvii, founded in 2011 and backed by Ant Financial and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, claims its FaceID platform has authenticated the identity of 290 million worldwide, with more than 85% market share in security software for China's financial industry. Yitu, five years old, with backing from Alibaba founder Jack Ma's private Yunfeng Capital and giant Sequoia Capital, is active in health care imaging and fintech, and boasts of being an industry leader with 50% of market share in some unspecified segments in China's financial services industry.
A Megvii representative argues that SenseTime's accuracy in facial recognition doesn't automatically translate into use applications. Software design needs to fit with computer chips, monitors and an organization's procedures. ""More and more public security clients look at product compatibility, timeliness and efficiency. Its algorithm could be used as technical support but by itself would not address a security problem,"" he says.
Founder Tang is undaunted. At a recent event in Hong Kong, he told the audience: ""Dream big. I also learned from my son. He said someday he wanted to build an airplane with a swimming pool in it, calling it 747-380. That's a combination of Airbus and Boeing. You need to prepare for your dream. I prepared for it for 20 years.""
Supplementing his AI talents in Hong Kong, he scurried for hardware engineers in Shenzhen, and found plenty of software engineers in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, his company has 150 employees with doctorates--and globally competitive salaries to match. ""The success of SenseTime is really based on the connection of Hong Kong with Shenzhen, with Beijing and with Shanghai,"" he says.
Its stated ambition is to be the global dominant force in facial recognition, a ""platform company"" in the category of Google and Facebook, by taking a page from Intel, the global chip giant. Says CEO Xu, ""For SenseTime, our algorithms would form the high-entry barrier. We are forming an ecosystem with our business partners. Learning from Intel Inside, we are building up our model. Call it 'SenseTime Inside.' ""Shu-Ching Jean ChenFollowingFollowI cover regional corporates and entrepreneurs for Forbes Asia magazine as a contributing correspondent.

AI, as the term is most often used today is, simply put, the theory and practice of building machines capable of performing tasks that seem to require intelligence. Currently, cutting-edge technologies striving to make this a reality include machine learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning.
Meanwhile, blockchain is essentially a new filing system for digital information, which stores data in an encrypted, distributed ledger format. Because data is encrypted and distributed across many different computers, it enables the creation of tamper-proof, highly robust databases which can be read and updated only by those with permission.
PROMOTED
Although much has been written from an academic perspective on the potential of combining these ground-breaking technologies, real world applications are sparse at the moment. However, I expect this situation to change in the near future.

So here are three ways in which AI and blockchain are made for each other.

 AI and encryption work very well together

Data held on a blockchain is by its nature highly secure, thanks to the cryptography which is inherent in its filing system.
What this means is that blockchains are ideal for storing the highly sensitive, personal data which, when smartly processed, can unlock so much value and convenience in our lives. Think of smart healthcare systems that make accurate diagnoses based on our medical scans and records, or even simply the recommendation engines used by Amazon or Netflix to suggest what we might like to buy or watch next.
Of course, the data which is fed into these systems (after being collected from us as we browse or interact with services) is highly personal. The businesses that deal in it must put up large amounts of money to meet the standards expected of them in terms of data security. And even so, large-scale data breaches leading to the loss of personal data are increasingly common (and increasingly large!).
Blockchain databases hold their information in an encrypted state. This means that only the private keys must be kept safe – a few kilobytes of data – in order for all of the data on the chain to be secure.
AI has plenty to bring to the table in terms of security, too. An emerging field of AI is concerned with building algorithms which are capable of working with (processing, or operating with) data while it is still in an encrypted state. As any part of a data process which involves exposing unencrypted data represents a security risk, reducing these incidents could help to make things much safer.

 Blockchain can help us track, understand and explain decisions made by AI

Decisions made by AIs can sometimes be hard for humans to understand. This is because they are capable of assessing a large number of variables independently of each other and “learning” which ones are important to the overall task it is trying to achieve.
As an example, AI algorithms are expected to increasingly be used in making decisions about whether financial transactions are fraudulent, and should be blocked or investigated.
For some time though, it will still be necessary to have these decisions audited for accuracy by humans. And given the huge amount of data that can be taken into consideration, this can be a complex task. Walmart, for example, feeds a months’ worth of transactional data across all of its stores into its AI systems which make decisions on what products should be stocked, and where.
If decisions are recorded, on a datapoint-by-datapoint basis, on a blockchain, it makes it far simpler for them to be audited, with the confidence that the record has not been tampered with between the information being recorded and the start of the audit process.
No matter how clearly we can see that AI offers huge advantages in many fields, if it isn’t trusted by the public, then its usefulness will be severely limited. Recording the decision-making process on blockchains could be a step towards achieving the level of transparency and insight into robot minds that will be needed in order to gain public trust.

 AI can manage blockchains more efficiently than humans (or “stupid” conventional computers)

Traditionally, computers have been very fast, but very stupid. Without explicit instructions on how to perform a task, computers can’t get them done. This means that, due to their encrypted nature, operating with blockchain data on “stupid” computers requires large amounts of computer processing power. As an example, the hashing algorithms used to mine blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain take a “brute force” approach – effectively trying every combination of characters until they find one which fits to verify a transaction.
AI is an attempt to move away from this brute force approach, and manage tasks in a more intelligent, thoughtful manner. Consider how a human expert on cracking codes will, if they are good, become better and more efficient at code-breaking as they successfully crack more and more codes throughout their career. A machine learning-powered mining algorithm would tackle its job in a similar way – although rather than having to take a lifetime to become an expert, it could almost instantaneously sharpen its skills, if it is fed the right training data.
Clearly, blockchain and AI are two technological trends which, while ground-breaking in their own rights, have the potential to become even more revolutionary when put together. Both serve to enhance the capabilities of the other, while also offering opportunities for better oversight and accountability.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

From the UK to the UAE, China and the USA, governments are putting serious money and resources behind efforts to corner the artificial intelligence (AI) market. China recently published its AI strategy, which boldly declared that within a decade AI will become “the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transition”. If China’s approach to AI mirrors its 2014 semiconductor plan we could see up to $150bn being invested in AI over the next 10 years. It’s not just nations that are betting on an AI-based economy. The largest technology firms, including Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft, are investing huge sums to develop their AI capabilities. It is estimated that in 2017 alone, companies globally completed around £15bn in mergers and acquisitions related to AI. As for the UK, in January AI was at the heart of the Prime Minister’s speech at Davos. She highlighted the potential of AI, for example, to reduce unnecessary breast cancer surgeries by a third. Public backing of AI follows on from a UK Government review, co-chaired by Professor Dame Wendy Hall, which reported in October that the technology could boost productivity, advance healthcare, improve services for customers and unlock £650bn for the UK economy. As a result, the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund - which is part of the Government’s £4.7bn increase in R&D over the next four years - has several challenge funds to support the development of practical applications in AI, robotics and autonomous vehicles.

 But exactly what is AI? AI is an umbrella term to describe technology that exhibits behaviours that appear intelligent and autonomous. From predictive text to deep neural networks, AI is an evolution in computing and the way we look at data. There are three broad categories of AI. First, basic artificial intelligence: simple algorithms and rules that give the impression of intelligent computing. For example, simplistic chat bots. Second, machine learning: computing that has the “ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. From pattern recognition, to predictions, this type of AI learns through training and the quality of analysis improves with experience. For example, Netflix recommending new films to users. Third, deep learning: a modern advance in AI, the core feature of deep learning is that it’s based on practice and feedback, rather than complicated rules. It is a subset of machine learning and is only possible through high-quality data that is processed and analysed in a similar way to the human brain. Deep learning creates a neural network that becomes more sophisticated as more data is added. For example, the ability for a computer to detect tumours in medical images.

 The notion of AI at the heart of the economy and society is not some distant ambition among a few giant corporations. The CBI is detecting a major shift on the horizon as businesses look to unlock the potential of AI. Every business has the potential to take advantage of the digital revolution and embrace the opportunities that arise from new technologies. CBI research shows that 94% of businesses believe that digital technologies are a crucial driver of increased productivity. Businesses that innovate grow twice as fast, both in employment and sales, than firms that fail to do so, and adopting new technology gets the best out of people - 50% of labour productivity is driven by innovation. But why now? The emergence of AI as a technology that is on the brink of becoming ingrained within business products and services is due to three main factors. Firstly, new, abundant and high-quality data - 90% of the world’s data has been created in the past 24 months. Secondly, development of affordable sophisticated hardware to handle the processing of vast sums of data and evolving algorithms that benefit from the richness of information and power of the computing. Finally, availability of cloud technology that enables developers and businesses across the world to collaborate and experiment with AI models. The concoction of excellent data, powerful computers and cloud technology has propelled AI to lead the charge for business investment. Some 42% of companies are planning to devote resources to adopting AI over the next five years.

 The CBI predicts sectors likely to be impacted first include media, real estate, finance and insurance, professional services and public services. Current examples of the most advanced AI to date include the following. In health, Your.MD has built an AI personal health guide that provides users immediate trustworthy healthcare advice from the NHS. In banking, to help confirm customer identity and increase security HSBC has created an AI chatbot, Olivia, who assists customers all year round. In education CENTURY, an AI platform, is helping children learn and teachers provide more personalised education programmes, Finally, in law, AI is helping lawyers to do legal searches and to draft the best standard documents. Law firm Pinsent Masons has developed its own team of computer scientists to put AI into practice for its lawyers. Indeed, just last week Futurism reported a new study from LawGeex that revealed AI outperforms lawyers in reviewing non-disclosure agreements and accurately spotting risks within the legal documents. Lawyers needed an average of 92 minutes to complete the task - the AI took 26 seconds. So how should the Welsh Government respond to AI? It is off to a good start with AI included as a priority within the new Economic Action Plan. What we need to do now is assess the potential for AI in Wales and the opportunities we can grasp.

Here’s a Swedish mine worker’s reaction to impending automation: “I’m not really worried. There are so many jobs in this mine that even if this job disappears, they will have another one. The company will take care of us.”
Germany’s experience with intensive use of robots since 1995 tells a similar story of job stability. When robots are introduced into a German manufacturing firm, largely automobile plants, this increases the chances that workers will keep a job at the firm, although many of them perform different tasks there. When German manufacturing firms deploy robots, they don’t displace existing workers. They do, however, create fewer new jobs, resulting in, over time, a decline in overall employment in manufacturing. Since there are fewer new manufacturing jobs, workers seek and find work in other industries. As a result, robot use hasn’t produced an overall decline in German employment.
There’s nothing preventing U.S. companies from doing the same
Indeed, Accenture shows how it can be done.  They automated 17,000 back office jobs over an 18-month period without displacing a single worker. CEO Richard Lamb says, “We are fortunate enough to reskill and reposition them.”











 
 
 
Amazon has done the same thing with the installation of bin-stacking robots in its warehouses. Some workers took company courses on how to operate robots. Others were repositioned to receiving stations where they sorted merchandise into bins. Amazon’s operations chief put the outcome simply, “The people didn’t go anywhere.”

This kind of win-win transition takes careful planning. A number of consulting studies have provided some guidelines for companies. Accenture recommends that companies start now, increasing their efforts to retrain people for new skills, redesigning work to fit the humans who will do the job, and developing needed talent through an improved skills pipeline. For example, AT&T launched a retraining program to fill jobs in cloud computing, data science and coding and found, during one four-month period in 2016, that the retrained employees filled half of all technology management jobs at the company.
Amazon’s Career Choice program is another example of this. It pays 95 percent of tuition and fees for employees “to earn certificates and associate degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, nursing, and many other fields.”











 
 
 
Pearson says that 20 percent of all workers are in declining occupations and 10 percent are in growing occupations. There will be increased demand for interpersonal skills, including teaching, social perceptiveness, service orientation and persuasion, and higher-order cognitive skills such as complex problem solving, originality, fluency of ideas and active learning. They encourage companies to re-design jobs “to pair uniquely human skills with the productivity gains from technology to boost demand for jobs.”  The idea is to supplement, not supplant human skills, just as in education where technology supplements but does not replace the crucial role of the teacher.
McKinsey echoes these points, saying companies should prepare for the transition by scaling and reimagining job retraining and workforce skills development, including providing on-the-job training and opportunities to workers to upgrade their skills.
But these problems are larger than any one company
McKinsey recommends an important role for government in matching workers to jobs to improve labor mobility, maintaining robust economic growth to support job creation, including increased infrastructure investments, and providing income and transition support to workers, including retraining programs, unemployment insurance, public assistance in finding work, and portable benefits that follow workers between jobs.











 
 
 
History shows that, in the long run, technological advances do not create unemployment, but they do change the nature of the work that is available. Fewer agricultural worker are needed to raise crops, so new workers move to jobs in manufacturing and service industries. That transition was enabled through the far-sighted progressive thinking of policymakers and educators who developed the U.S. system of universal education, producing the world’s most productive literate, and numerate workforce.
The OECD estimates that 65 percent of children today will do jobs that haven’t even been developed. We need to train tomorrow’s workers in the general skills that they can use flexibly to fill the ever-changing job demands of an AI-intensive workplace.  We need to equip them with the skills they need to be lifelong learners who will not be afraid to change. But they need the reassurance that if they are willing to change, there will be a place for them in our nation’s workplaces.

Tens of thousands of little things, as it turns out.Mondragon is head psychologist at HireVue, which markets software for screening job candidates. Its flagship product, used by Unilever and Goldman Sachs, asks candidates to answer interview questions in front of a camera. Meanwhile its software, like a team of hawk-eyed psychologists hiding behind a mirror, takes note of barely perceptible changes in posture, facial expression and vocal tone.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” says Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes.”The program turns this data into a score, which is then compared against one the program has already “learned” from top-performing employees. The idea is that a good prospective employee looks a lot like a good current employee, just not in any way a human interviewer would notice.Approaches like vocal analysis and reading “microexpressions” have been applied in policing and intelligence with little clear success. But Mondragon says automated analyses compare favourably with established tests of personality and ability, and that customers report better employee performance and less turnover.HireVue is just one of a slew of new companies selling AI as a replacement for the costly human side of hiring. It estimates the “pre-hire assessment” market is worth $3bn (£2.2bn) a year.A study in the UK last year found an average of 24 applicants per low-wage job. Tesco, the country’s largest private employer, received well over three million job applications in 2016. With applications rising, employers have automated as much of the process as possible. This started more than a decade ago with simple programs that scanned text CVs for key words. It has now expanded to include quizzes, psychometric tests, games and chatbots that can reject applicants before a human ever glances at their CV.Jobseekers are forced to prepare for whatever format a prospective employer has chosen, a familiar power shift in the gig economy era. And without human interaction or feedback, an already difficult process has become deeply alienating.Will a robot recruiter be hiring you for your next job?Read moreBeyond the dehumanising experience lurk the usual concerns that attend automation and AI, which uses data often shaped by inequality. If you suspect you’ve been discriminated against by an algorithm, what recourse do you have? How vulnerable are those formulas to bias? And is it inevitable that non-traditional or poorer candidates, or those who struggle with new technology, will be excluded from the process?“It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employer,” says Robert, a plumber in his 40s whom I met at a weekly jobs club in London. He uses job boards and recruiters to find temporary work. Harry, 24, has been searching for a job for four months. In retail “just about every job opening” requires a test or game. He completes four or five a week. The rejections are often instant, piling up without a word of feedback. Every time you start again from zero.“You never know what you’ve done wrong. It leaves you feeling a bit trapped,” Harry says.The problem is worst for older jobseekers. Many rely on support from councils or voluntary services to help them fill out applications. “It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who was a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?” asks Lynda Pennington, who organises another jobs club in Croydon.After 86 unsuccessful job applications in two years – including several HireVue screenings – Deborah Caldeira is thoroughly disillusioned with automated systems. Without a person across the table, there’s “no real conversation or exchange”, and it’s difficult to know “exactly what the robot is looking for”, says Caldeira, who has a master’s degree from the London School of Economics.Despite her qualifications, she found herself questioning every movement as she sat at home alone performing for a computer. “It makes us feel that we’re not worthwhile, as the company couldn’t even assign a person for a few minutes. The whole thing is becoming less human,” she says.A fightback against automation has emerged, as applicants search for ways to game the system. On web forums, students trade answers to employers’ tests and create fake applications to gauge their processes. One HR employee for a major technology company recommends slipping the words “Oxford” or “Cambridge” into a CV in invisible white text, to pass the automated screening.Measures are under way to tip the balance of power back to those seeking work, according to Christina Colclough, director of digitalisation and trade at UNI Global Union, a federation of trade unions. They include a charter of digital rights for workers touching on automated and AI-based decisions, to be included in bargaining agreements.An imminent update to the EU general data protection regulation will require a company to disclose whenever a decision that “significantly affects an individual” has been automated. But even minimal human involvement – approving a list of automatically ranked CVs, for example – could exempt companies from such regulations, warns Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute. She also notes that a much-discussed “right to explanation” of automated decisions will not be legally binding.Explore more on these topicsRobotsThe ObserverArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingConsciousnessfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedLiveHakeem Jeffries reportedly did not offer Biden his endorsement in private meeting – liveKaty Perry: Woman’s World review – what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?You could sense the embarrassment as Biden spoke, a sign of how low the presidency has sunkJohn CraceWeek in wildlife – in pictures: a rare blue frog, a cheeky heron and climbing bearsTeamsters president faces backlash over ‘unconscionable’ GOP convention speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here’s How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the Way You Recruit 
AI is no substitute for human search professionals, but the technology is going to completely overhaul the people business, says Nachi Junankar, founder and CEO of Avrio. Cumbersome and mundane tasks are its first targets. Let’s go inside the latest thinking.

 March 2, 2018 – How often have you said to yourself, “There just aren’t enough hours in the day?” In an industry that moves as fast as talent recruitment, lack of time is a serious problem.
Recruiters are spread so thin that 75 percent of applicants never receive a response after submitting a resume.
The bigger problem for recruiters is that these candidates can eventually become clients – but if they’re ignored and treated poorly at this stage, that’s unlikely. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is becoming the solution to this and other problems that traditionally have bogged down recruiters.
“Imagine you hire someone to help you with the most cumbersome part of the recruitment process: matching candidates to jobs,” said Nachi Junankar, founder and CEO of Avrio AI, an artificial intelligence talent platform based in Boston. “Instead of spending hours of your day scanning resumes and comparing them to job descriptions, candidates are screened and ranked for you. Now, you can focus on connecting with the best applicants more quickly, making more successful placements, and ensuring a positive experience for each individual candidate.”
AI As a Solution
While this scenario may seem too good to be true, technology has advanced enough to make it a reality. Artificial intelligence has already become extremely useful for businesses looking to do more with less. “AI helps your organization scale by automating low-value tasks, allowing people to execute the tasks that truly affect the bottom line,” said Mr. Junankar. “It’s no longer just a buzzword; it’s an opportunity for businesses to minimize the amount of time spent on rote tasks so they can focus on more meaningful work.”

Adoption of AI is at an early stage, so it’s no wonder that many are skeptical of its potential. But the truth is that there is only so much a consultant can do. Certain tasks or processes can be automated, said Aviro, but AI is no substitute for recruiters, an inherently human profession.
Automate the Grind
“Most talent acquisition employees spend roughly 45 percent of their time resume matching, getting buried in resumes and job descriptions,” said Mr. Junankar. “That time is better spent building relationships with clients or candidates and gaining a thorough understanding of exactly what they are seeking.”
Time is of the essence when it comes to recruiting. If one spends too much time on the resume matching process, candidates who are identified as great fits for certain roles will be off the market by the time the recruiter contacts them, said Aviro. For smaller companies and staffing firms, it’s expensive to hire enough recruiters to reach the best talent and stay ahead of the game. “But leveraging AI gives you crucial time in your day back,” said Mr. Junankar. “Keeping up with the competition is easier when artificial intelligence takes over tedious processes, enabling you to make those vital connections with candidates.”

AI Ushers in a New Day for Companies and Recruiters
Artificial intelligence is transforming the face of workforces around the world. For executive recruiters and HR departments, it has meant a growing number of new roles to fill and untapped talent to discover. Gartner, the information technology research firm, says AI will cause millions of jobs to fall by the wayside.

Of course, recruiting is about more than filling seats and making placements. The candidate experience is a top priority, and it improves immeasurably when you no longer own cumbersome and mundane tasks, said Aviro. Understanding a candidate’s skills and background on paper is one thing, but meeting candidates in person and having a genuine conversation is the best way to make recommendations that guarantee a successful placement.

Additionally, the more time one has to focus on candidates and clients, the more proactive a recruiter can be. “You can reach out to candidates before they contact you, asking for an update,” said Mr. Junankar.
The best recruiters make their candidates feel like their job search isn’t an afterthought, said Aviro. When AI handles the tedious tasks and identifies the best people, recruiters have more time to nurture their candidates, making them feel valued, which can turn them into advocates for recruiters and their firms.
The Bottom Line 
“Artificial intelligence is presenting recruiters with an opportunity to revolutionize the way we hire,” said Mr. Junankar. “Automating processes boosts efficiency, allowing your organization scale without incurring extra expenses and keep up with the competition. Most importantly, adopting AI gets you back to the reason you became a recruiter: finding candidates not only a job, but a fulfilling career.”

Avrio is building an AI platform that uses machine intelligence to bring people and companies together. It’s AI talent platform reduces hiring workload by 35 percent. Mr. Junankar is passionate about building long-lasting companies that create amazing technologies that change the world. He recently sat down with Hunt Scanlon to discuss the impact AI will have on how we will soon search for talent. Let’s take a look into the future of hiring.


Nachi, explain how AI can help recruiters?
AI is able to eliminate repetitive tasks that slow down business operations. Speeding up business processes enables recruiters to make placements faster than ever seen before. Along with speed, AI provides cognitive insight into a candidate’s ability to perform a job at a high level. This will ensure that recruiters are matching the right candidate to the right job, every time. In addition to analyzing and matching, AI will be able to increase candidate engagement, allowing recruiters to spend more time nurturing potential candidates. Specifically, Avrio AI automates 45 percent of repetitive recruiting tasks, allowing recruiters to spend more time on developing strong relationships with candidates. Overall, AI is going to allow recruiters to become more strategic and effective.
Some feel threatened by technology taking over jobs — so how can these people embrace technology and see security in the future?
It is only natural that people are threatened by new technology, this is nothing new. However, in order to stay competitive they are going to have to embrace it. Technology is not going to wait for people to feel comfortable. It is coming whether people like it or not. What separates the people who thrive and the people who get pushed out is their willingness to adopt early. There is going to be a big shift in the labor market. On a positive note, these emerging technologies are only going to make people’s working lives better. The challenge is learning how people and technology can work side by side and I think here at Avrio AI we have found that symbiosis.

“Technology may not replace job roles entirely, but it is going to change how people work, their cognitive load and tasks that they work on.”


Hunt Scanlon’s Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Stories of 2017
One of our most important missions at Hunt Scanlon Media is to report on the trends that are altering the executive recruitment industry, and in many cases, the world of business. Among the most consequential transitions we’ve reported on this past year has been the rise of AI – and what it means for the future of …

Do you foresee technology replacing various roles with companies or more specifically HR and recruiting?
Technology may not replace the job roles entirely, but it is going to change how people work, their cognitive load and tasks that they work on. If a recruiter has 50 cognitive tasks they do in an average day and AI can now complete half of those tasks, the recruiter is going to have to find another 25 tasks to work on. This allows recruiters along with other workers to think more strategically and find the tasks that technology cannot replace such as building and fostering relationships with a candidate.
How big is AI?
As a definition, AI is something that seems it might need human intelligence but is done with a computer. AI is going to become the standard across all business functions. Its ability to optimize business operations will increase the speed at which business is done and the ability for companies to scale and therefore compete. Enhancing the decision making process is clearly a huge benefit. Ultimately, AI is going to solve problems that we don’t even know we have yet, freeing up time for people to focus on more strategic tasks. Overall, the best way to put it is, let tech do what tech does best and let people do what they do best.

Most Americans Already Using Artificial Intelligence Products
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

85% of Americans use at least one of six products with AI elements
84% use navigation apps
72% use streaming media services


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly nine in 10 Americans (85%) say they currently use at least one of six devices, programs or services that feature elements of artificial intelligence (AI). Use of these products ranges from 84% of U.S. adults using navigation applications to 20% using smart home devices such as self-learning thermostats and lighting.

These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. The study found 79% of Americans saying AI has had a very or mostly positive impact on their lives so far.
The percentage of Americans using different consumer AI products may be at least partly related to the length of time these products have been on the market. The most widely used product -- navigation apps, such as Google® Maps, Waze® or Apple® Maps -- has been on the market since the mid-2000s. Streaming media services -- including Netflix®, Hulu®, Pandora® and Spotify® -- which 72% of Americans use, first launched in 1993, though technical limitations with these limited their growth until the mid-2000s. Nearly half of Americans (47%) use digital personal assistants on their smartphones, such as Siri® or Google Voice. The first digital personal assistant launched in 2011.
Beyond the three most widely used products, ride-sharing apps, such as those used for Uber® or Lyft®, which first appeared in 2011, are used by roughly a third of U.S adults. Intelligent home personal assistants -- such as Amazon's® Alexa™ or Google Home™, which use voice commands to search for information online or control elements of their homes -- debuted in 2014. Currently, 22% of U.S. adults report using such devices. Twenty percent of U.S. adults say they use smart home devices, on the market since 2011, when the first learning thermostat was released.

NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/GALLUP SURVEY, SEPT. 15-OCT. 10, 2017





At least a majority in all key subgroups of Americans use navigation apps. However, use of these is much more common among adults aged 50 and younger -- more than nine in 10 of whom use such apps -- and falls to 80% among those aged 51 to 65 and 66% for those over age 65. Additionally, there is a 15-percentage-point gap in use of navigation apps between college graduates and those without a college degree -- 94% vs. 79%, respectively.
For streaming media use, the decline by age group is more dramatic, with 91% of those aged 18 to 35 using these services. Use falls to 84% among those aged 36 to 50, to 63% for those 51 to 65 and finally to 41% for those over age 65. There is also a 15-point gap in use of streaming media services between college graduates (82%) and those without college degrees (67%).
By age group, use of ride-sharing apps falls from a high of 45% among those 18 to 35, to a low of 14% among those over age 65. There is also a difference in ride-sharing-app use between those with a college degree (51%) and those without one (23%).
Bottom Line
The vast majority of Americans are already using consumer products that employ elements of AI. These products have made it into their homes and vehicles in the form of streaming media services and navigation applications. Even products adopted by a smaller percentage of Americans, such as smart home devices, are already being used by millions. Growth estimates suggest adoption of AI consumer products is likely to grow substantially in the future. Amazon alone predicts its intelligent home assistant, Alexa, will be adopted by 100 million or more people within the next three to five years.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
For results based on the total sample of 3,297 U.S. adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

But the Russian capital has perhaps the most pervasive vision for AI in government yet.

“We want AI to work everywhere,” Moscow’s Chief Information Officer, Artem Ermolaev, tells GovInsider. His team is already trialling AI to advise doctors in treating cancer patients; help residents find new homes; and assess applications for government services and support.

“The Moscow vision of the future is when artificial intelligence is equal to humans - or sometimes, artificial intelligence is higher than the human,” he says.
Diagnosing cancer

Healthcare is one of the most comprehensive cases of AI in Moscow. The city government is training machines to diagnose cancer from CT scans, Ermolaev says. Patients visiting certain hospitals receive a diagnosis from a machine along with the one from their doctor.

In the next three to five years, machines will advise general practitioners on diagnoses, he says. “We expect, in the future, we have robot doctors which will have to work with you 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. It is not a really far future,” he adds.
 
“We expect, in the future, we have robot doctors”
In trials so far with thousands of CT scans, computers found cancer in 5% of cases where the doctors did not, Ermolaev says. It’s a small but critical portion, as it means that machines help cut human errors, and in this trial, about 200 cancer patients have avoided misdiagnoses. “Machines can’t be tired and the machine doesn’t have sleepless nights,” he adds.

AI everywhere

Outside clinics and hospitals, AI will be widespread in residents’ daily interactions with the government thanks to the detailed data it has on citizens. “We have a pretty big division for big data which helps us to analyse how Muscovites live, where do they live, what do they need,” he says.

In the future, residents’ applications for public services will be assessed by artificial intelligence. “The machine receives it, understand if it can be accepted or it should be declined, and does it automatically.”

AI will also help residents find new homes, he adds. About 700,000 residents move homes every year in Moscow. They can request the city to advise them on other neighbourhoods where they can lead a similar quality of life as in their current home.

The city is building AI to suggest other areas where they will have access to similar social, cultural, health, financial and education services. “What we are working on is that, using big data, we are analysing the school you are visiting and the teachers you have; the doctors you are visiting and the hospital you are also using; and we are trying to find a place which is similar to that in another part of Moscow,” Ermolaev says.
Safety

It is also building AI for facial recognition from CCTV footage. The city has a network of 160,000 cameras, one of the largest in the world, he says, which are currently monitored by humans. “We are testing in this system video analytics which will analyse the faces and face recognition.” This will help track down criminals, but can also help find missing elderly people or help parents keep track of their children,” he says.
 

 Artem Ermolaev, CIO of Moscow City


The city will use the video analytics to track garbage collectors and snow removers. “We need to control if the public objects are cleaned and the companies which maintains, for example, the major squares in the city do their job correctly or did not,” explains Ermolaev. The city is spread out over 2,000 square kilometres, and only AI, he says, can help the government ensure contractors and city officials are doing their jobs.
E-voting on blockchain

Moscow also has a vision for using Blockchain. Distributed systems to hold government records will help increase public trust in government and cut corruption, Ermolaev believes. It will “deliver the confidence that the services we are providing are fair and there is no intervention of government in it.”

Moscow’s first trial with Blockchain is on a platform that allows citizens to vote for municipal and local projects, like setting speed limits and changing bus routes. The votes are now stored on a blockchain platform that ensures no one can tamper with them, and allows citizens to monitor them in real-time, according to the city government.

It plans to connect more public services to Blockchain in the next few years, Ermolaev says. One area, for example, is admissions to free public schools, he explains, which is on a first-come, first-served basis.

At the best schools in the city, there are more applicants than available seats, which has left parents unhappy and accusing the government of meddling and corruption. Implementing Blockchain in such a process will help “convince” citizens that “there is not intervention in the system”, he believes.

There has been a great deal of hype around Blockchain and the city is still cautiously testing its value. The trials have shown that the “speed of Blockchain is still not very good”, he says, and any delays will lead to complaints from residents. Like in every other large city, “Moscow citizens are very tough customers because they don’t want to wait”, Ermolaev says.
 
“The speed of Blockchain is still not very good.”
As Moscow plans for a high-tech future, building “trust in machines” is a challenge, he notes. The city needs to “invest in explanations” for citizens to understand how the technologies like AI work and how it can help them.

Doctors, for instance, are being told that having an AI assist them on diagnosis can help them keep customers happy and earn more money. “We are explaining to them that they shouldn't be afraid that machines will replace them,” he says.
Moscow’s vision for AI is wide-ranging, but the challenges its officials face are not so different from other cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what’s the cost to workforce diversity – and workers themselves?Stephen BuranyiSun 4 Mar 2018 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 10 Nov 2019 14.27 ESTShare141141According to Nathan Mondragon, finding the right employee is all about looking at the little things. Tens of thousands of little things, as it turns out. Mondragon is the head psychologist at Hirevue, a company that offers software that screens job candidates using algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI). Hirevue’s flagship product, used by global giants such as Unilever and Goldman Sachs, asks candidates to answer standard interview questions in front of a camera. Meanwhile its software, like a team of hawk-eyed psychologists hiding behind a mirror, makes note of thousands of barely perceptible changes in posture, facial expression, vocal tone and word choice.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” says Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent, or turn to ‘ums’ and ‘ahs’. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes. The facial movement analytics would tell us you were going into a creative thinking style.”The program turns this data into a score, which is then compared against one the program has already “learned” from top-performing employees. The idea is that a good prospective employee looks a lot like a good current employee, just not in any way a human interviewer would notice.It sounds far fetched. Approaches like vocal analysis and reading “microexpressions” have previously been applied in policing and intelligence with little clear success. But Mondragon says their automated analyses line up favourably with established tests of personality and ability, and that customers report better employee performance and less turnover.It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employerRobert, plumberHirevue is just one of a slew of new companies selling AI as a replacement for the costly human side of hiring. Bath-based Cognisses specialises in games that predict various aptitudes (“personality is hard to gamify, but we’re working on it,” Boris Altemeyer, their head of technology, told me.) San Francisco’s Mya Systems offers a reactive, AI-powered chatbot that will conduct the entire interview process. Hirevue estimates the “pre-hire assessment” market is worth £2.14bn (US$3 billion) a year. According to Doug Rode, senior managing director at recruiter Michael Page, the past year has seen a marked increase in companies aggressively selling AI packages of widely variable quality.A study last year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found an average of 24 applicants for an average low wage job. Tesco, the UK’s largest private employer, received well over three million job applications in 2016. As the number of people applying for jobs has increased, employers have removed human beings from the hiring side whenever possible, automating more and more of the decisions in the process. This started over a decade ago with simple programs that scanned text CVs for keywords about education, skills and past employers in order to flag them for recruiters. It has expanded to include a bewildering range of quizzes, psychometric tests and custom built games that can be used to reject applicants before a human ever sees their application.This shift has already radically changed the way that many people interact with prospective employers. The standardised CV format allowed jobseekers to be evaluated by multiple firms with a single approach. Now jobseekers are forced to prepare for whatever format the company has chosen. The burden has been shifted from employer to jobseeker – a familiar feature of the gig economy era – and along with it the ability of jobseekers to get feedback or insight into the decision-making process. The role of human interaction in hiring has decreased, making an already difficult process deeply alienating.Beyond the often bewildering and dehumanising experience lurk the concerns that attend automation and AI, which draws on data that’s often been shaped by inequality. If you suspect you’ve been discriminated against by an algorithm, what recourse do you have? How prone are those formulas to bias, and how do the multitude of third-party companies that develop and license this software deal with the personal data of applicants? And is it inevitable that non-traditional or poorer candidates, or those who struggle with new technology, will be excluded from the process?View image in fullscreenGroceries are prepared for distribution at a Tesco distribution plant in Reading, England. The company received well over three million job applications in 2016. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images“It’s all these artificial barriers, it makes people feel the hiring process is impenetrable,” says Heather Davies, a retired HR coordinator and one of the organisers of a Christians Against Poverty jobs club that meets weekly in a church hall in Muswell Hill, London. While there’s acceptance among attendees that increasing automation is inevitable (“it’s 2018 after all”), there’s real frustration at the hollowing out of human interaction.“It’s a bit dehumanising, never being able to get through to an employer,” says Robert, a plumber in his forties who uses job boards and recruiters to find temporary work. Harry, 24, has been searching for a job for four months. In retail, where he is looking, “just about every job” has some sort of test or game, anything from personality to maths, to screen out applicants. He completes four or five tests a week as jobs are posted. The rejections are often instant, although some service providers offer time-delay rejection emails, presumably to maintain the illusion that a person had spent time judging an application that had already failed an automated screen. The rejections pile up without ever signposting a different path. Every time you start again from zero.“It’s frustrating. You never know what you’ve done wrong; it leaves you feeling a bit trapped,” Harry says.It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who is a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?Lynda Pennington, Croydon jobs clubThe problem is compounded amongst older jobseekers. Many rely on support from council or voluntary services to help them fill out applications or submit CV forms. “It’s a big barrier. Why is an older guy who is a bricklayer suddenly expected to have IT skills?” asks Lynda Pennington, who organises another jobs club in Croydon.Kirsty McHugh, head of the Employment Related Services Association (ERSA), which advocates for jobseekers, raises concerns about programs that “screen out non-traditional applications without thinking”. ERSA members wouldn’t encourage employers to use them, she added.Most of the data on unemployment in the UK ignores the vast ocean of people who have given up looking for work. The ONS says 8.7 million people aged 16 to 64 are “economically inactive”– not working and not seeking work. It’s impossible to predict how many people will be put off looking for a job by the new realities of the hiring process.Even amongst the groups where automated hiring is seen as the biggest success, there is some apprehension. Several professional recruiters told me that at every job level many candidates were put off by these systems, and that they failed to engage “passive but talented” applicants. A survey by the recruiter Allegis Global Solutions found that 58% of North American job applicants said they were comfortable interacting with an automated program – an ambiguous statistic widely interpreted as a green light.Rise of the racist robots – how AI is learning all our worst impulsesRead moreDeborah Caldeira, a masters student at the London School of Economics, told me that after 86 unsuccessful job applications over the past two years – including several Hirevue screenings – she is thoroughly disillusioned with automated systems. She says that without a person across the table, there’s “no real conversation or exchange,” and it’s difficult to know “exactly what the robot is looking for”. Despite her excellent grades and extracurriculars, she was plagued by doubts that she didn’t look or sound like the ideal candidate, whose form was unknown to her. Sitting at home alone performing for a computer, she found herself questioning every movement.“It makes us less confident, and feel that we’re not worthwhile, as the company couldn’t even assign a person for a few minutes. The whole thing is becoming less human, which is concerning. What’s the limit for the use of automation when we are evaluating people?” she says.Q&AWhat is AI?ShowArtificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.An underground fightback of sorts against automation has emerged, as applicants search for ways to game the system. On web forums, students trade answers to employers’ tests and create fake applications to scope out their processes. A colleague relayed a story about a HR employee for a major technology company who recommended slipping the words “Oxford” or “Cambridge” into their CV in invisible white text, to pass the automated screening. I spoke with a jobs counsellor for high school students who has observed similar strategies.The apex of this practice is perhaps the Wales-based company Practice Aptitude Tests, which collates information from jobseekers and former employees about recruitment tests and sells practice versions, as well as tips and tricks for navigating them. Guy Thornton, the head of the company, claims the service has been used over three million times.It’s difficult to determine exactly how widespread the automation of hiring is, chiefly because companies aren’t keen to disclose how much automation they make use of. Several of the UK’s largest employers, including Sainsbury’s and Tesco, declined requests for interviews about their application process. Both Sainsbury’s and Tesco use a simple situational quiz to prescreen shop floor-level jobs.People are getting more conscious about these systems and may take the right to contest decisionsSandra Wachter, Oxford Internet InstituteBut most large companies use some form of screening, according to reports from jobseekers and jobs counsellors. And Thornton says that over the past few years, small and medium businesses are increasingly adopting it.There are a variety of popular and legislative pushes to tip the balance of power back towards those seeking work, according to Christina Colclough, director of digitalisation and trade at UNI Global Union, which represents skills and services globally. Labour unions have been slow to respond to technological change, but UNI Global and others are working on a variety of workers digital rights charters governing automated and AI-based decisions, to be included in bargaining agreements.And an imminent update to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will require a company to disclose whenever a decision that “significantly affects an individual” was automated. The applicant will also be entitled to contest the decision, or request human intervention.But the GDPR is not a catch-all, warns Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute. Wachter notes that even minimal human involvement – approving a list of automatically ranked CVs, for instance – could exempt companies from the obligation of disclosing that they use automated systems and of enabling individuals to challenge the decision. She also says a much-discussed “right to explanation”, requiring a company to explain how a given automated decision was made, will not be legally binding.“Legislators find this difficult because these programs are very technical, highly complex and difficult to understand, even to the experts who build them. And their workings are often protected by copyright held by a company,” she says.Its significant that the GDPR specifically mentions recruiting as an area targeted for regulation. Its an acknowledgement of how comprehensively the field has changed. And it opens the door for jobseekers to take more power in the process. “People are getting more conscious about these systems and may take the right to contest decisions,” Wachter says.Explore more on these topicsInequalityArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWork & careersJob huntingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedLiveHakeem Jeffries reportedly did not offer Biden his endorsement in private meeting – liveKaty Perry: Woman’s World review – what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?You could sense the embarrassment as Biden spoke, a sign of how low the presidency has sunkJohn CraceWeek in wildlife – in pictures: a rare blue frog, a cheeky heron and climbing bearsTeamsters president faces backlash over ‘unconscionable’ GOP convention speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence: A New Look for Business Productivity Tools








While artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied on a massive scale to alter the very nature of how the world works, it turns out AI is also very good at making everyday drudgery disappear. Productivity apps powered by AI are emerging that will help you, for example, come up with snappier and more personalized e-mails, transcribe all your phone calls into searchable text or find just the right photo that goes with the color scheme you’re using for your presentation.
                

And while most of us are well acquainted with everyday apps designed to help us work more efficiently, the best of the new incarnations powered by AI have been programmed to learn over time and become ever-smarter at the everyday tasks they’re handling for you.

The latest search tool for Microsoft Office, for example, goes far beyond searching for things that you’re looking for and actually gets to know how you work. The idea: The better the program “knows” you, the better search results it can bring back to you.
                

“AI is not some next-generation technology that will be available in 20 years. It’s being used now, across our economy, and the potential economic benefit for fleet operators is immense,” said Hoyoung Pak, head of transportation, logistics and supply chain at Uptake, an AI transportation software firm.
                

John Reed, chief information officer at Aim NationaLease, added: “Like most disruptive technologies, there is an enormous upside potential to AI when properly used.”
                

As time goes on, some trucking executives envision an expanding role for AI within the transportation industry.
                

Sarah Riggs Amico, executive chairwoman at Jack Cooper, said: “Eventually, I suspect AI will be used to manage the efficiency of the entire supply chain in our industry — including the use of deep neural networks and predictive analytics to prepare for likely weather events or traffic disruptions, for example.”
                

 
Scott Sullivan, CFO and chief information officer at Pitt Ohio, yearns for the day — which is being promised by AI technologists — that AI is infused into every aspect of logistics planning, particularly in the less-than-truckload sector.
                

“Can you imagine — if you can ‘AI’ the whole LTL process based on history — how you can drive efficiency into the customer experience and the process?”
                

Brian Wood, director for enterprise technology services at Ryder System Inc., has similar hopes: “I’m looking forward to when the systems we support, as well as the trucks and smart warehouse systems, are calling me to tell me there’s something I should be aware of. This is already happening with real-time route optimization and monitoring.”
                

Even today, scores of productivity tools currently are being completely remade by AI.

It’s a great time to take a look at what’s out there, and where the software category is headed.
                

Here’s a representative sampling:
                

• Personalize Your E-mails With an AI Web Crawler: Aizimov adds a personal touch to your ­e-mails by auto-crawling the web for interesting insights on the people you do business with.
                

“All you have to put in are four things: first name, last name, e-mail and company,” said Jerome Devosse, Aizimov’s CEO. After that, the software searches Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks for insights about your contacts, including their likes, dislikes and passions.
                

“If the guy, for example, has done a marathon, I may finish the e-mail by saying, ‘By the way, I also did a marathon in Rome, here’s my time — how do we compare?’ to get their attention,” Devosse said.
                

Aizimov also works for you after you send your e-mail, collecting info on the types of e-mails you send that get the best responses, based on tone, length, content and time-of-day sent.
                

Using these insights, it will put together a draft of an e-mail the next time you want to communicate with your marathon buddy — which you can use as is or customize to your own tastes.
                

• Leverage Microsoft Office’s New AI: Stop one for millions of computer users each day, Microsoft Office has been given an AI face-lift. It will now automatically transcribe your conference calls into text and even organize that text with automatic subtitles.
                

Joe White, owner of CostDown Consulting, sees calls-to-text as a natural for trucking.
                

“Transcribing phone calls to searchable text would provide an excellent tool for researching recruiting calls,” White said. “From driver conversations, we could identify, quantify and rank their ‘must-have’ job influences by the questions they ask. The top influences could then be used to adjust and improve a company’s employment offering. From recruiter conversations, we could analyze how effectively they communicate their company’s employment offering and what additional training they may need.”
                

PowerPoint users will also appreciate the new AI version of the program, which can automatically create a presentation after you type a line or two of text over each slide you plan to use.
                

And Office search is now completely powered by AI. Cortana, an AI assistant that made its debut in Microsoft Windows 10, also has been integrated into Microsoft Office.
                

• Transcribe Your Phone Conversations: Tetra uses AI to translate any conversation you have into searchable text. Almost immediately after you finish a phone call using Tetra, you’ll receive a detailed text synopsis of the conversation in your inbox — searchable by keyword.
                

All of Tetra’s transcripts also include two-way speaker ID, so you’ll always know by looking at the text who said what.
                

Eva, Voicera’s AI assistant, is another app in this genre that’s also worth checking out.
                

• Send Out for an AI Rewrite: If you’re looking for a different take on some text you’ve just written, SpinnerChief will rework it for you so you can present it from a slightly different perspective. The software has also been designed to ensure the text it produces is optimized for the search engines.
                

Another AI program in the same genre is Writer. Writer is designed to learn everything you need to know about a specific topic by crawling the web and then presenting the results to you in a text article. The program works best when you instruct it to research an extremely narrow topic.
                

• Index Your Photo Library With AI: Imagga is able to analyze your entire photo library, studying one picture at a time at blazingly fast speed and then tagging each image so you’ll be able to quickly call up any image with a text search.
                

• Find Images for Your Color Theme: Everypixel bests the other stock images libraries on the web by offering you the ability to find an image based on the color scheme you’re using for your ad or presentation.
                

• Add an AI Tax Adviser to Your Virtual Staff: While most of us try not to spend all of our time thinking about taxes, Andy can’t get enough. He’s at it every day, making sure you get all the tax deductions you deserve by keeping a steady eye on everything you do financially, 24/7.
                

The result: Instead of frantically trying to put together your deductions at midnight on April 14, Andy will have them all ready for you when it comes time to sit down and tell Uncle Sam all about the year you had. Andy also stays current on all the tax laws and tax changes that impact your business. And he’ll auto-prepare your tax return for you, too.
                

• Have an AI Assistant Schedule Your Meetings: There are a number of AI assistants dedicated to using e-mail to auto-schedule your meetings for you using e-mail. Those worth a try include Julie Desk, Kono, Clara and Hire Amy.
                

• Pick an AI Personal Assistant to Your Liking: Unlike task-specific AI apps, AI personal assistants attempt to handle a number of everyday tasks for you simultaneously. It’s a popular AI productivity category, so you’ll have plenty to check out.
                

Zoom.AI, for example, is designed to help organize your schedule, prepare meeting notes, handle travel logistics, search for files, order a car and more.

Braina and Vesper can perform similar functions.
                

“I do think items such as Zoom.AI can help save time if plugged in correctly to the right tools,” Ryder’s Wood said.
                

Wood said his own experience with AI-driven productivity apps is that the simpler ones tend to work right out of the box, while more sophisticated applications may need a bit of training for optimum performance.
                

Besides off-the-shelf products, people who follow AI in trucking have their own list of dream AI products they would like to see in the industry.
                

“One very useful AI application would be a driver satisfaction tool that analyzes driver performance and activities to forecast which drivers may be considering quitting,” said CostDown’s White. “Using factors such as declining wages and hours worked, increased absences, load refusals, excessive home time and complaints to driver managers, the app would generate a list of dissatisfied drivers, allowing managers an opportunity to address individual driver problems before they result in another turnover.”
                

Aim NationaLease’s Reed added: “The difference between AI and old-fashioned data analytics is AI can modify its recommendations in seconds and keep up with any new set of events in near-real time. Yes, today it’s an overused buzzword. But there’s meat behind the concept.”

That largely depends on whether we're technology optimists or pessimists. In our Future of Work series we look at how jobs might change in the future.The Snewing family lived in 62 Falkner Street, Liverpool, for more than four decades. They were saddlers working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And while the horse-drawn economy dominated, they enjoyed a brisk trade.But then, as the BBC Two series A House Through Time relates, along came the motor car.Rival saddlery businesses saw the lie of the land and turned to making leather footballs, handbags and luggage instead. The Snewings sadly carried on regardless and eventually went out of business.That, in a nutshell, is the challenge we face when new technologies come along. Adapt or die. But it is the pace of technological change that is unprecedented in the modern era and which poses the greatest challenge for jobs.Getty ImagesFord's Model-T motorcar symbolised the death-knell for the horse-drawn economyGetty ImagesSaddlers didn't disappear completely as engines replaced horses, but businesses had to adaptThese days algorithms dictate the automated trading of trillions of dollars' worth of assets in the financial markets. Artificially intelligent chatbots are taking over from humans in call centres. And soon, planes and cars could be operating autonomously, putting in jeopardy the livelihoods of those who drive professionally.Robots have been doing the repetitive drudge work in our factories for decades. But now they can flip burgers, flick away unripe tomatoes on a high-speed sorting machine using image recognition, lay bricks, even co-operate to open doors and escape. Giant 3D printers can make houses out of concrete in a fraction of the time humans can. Burger-flipping robot taken offlineWhat happens when AI meets robotics?Robots to 'take 800 million jobs by 2030'How long will it take for your job to be automated?The International Federation of Robotics says in manufacturing there are now 74 robot units per 10,000 employees on average, compared with 66 units in 2015. The highest growth rate is in Asia, China in particular.And software automation, informed by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), will have a profound effect on our workplaces and the jobs we do.""AI is a big threat to low-skilled jobs, no question,"" says Bernard Louvat, general manager of digital customer engagement solutions at tech firm Nuance.Getty ImagesWill robots really be able to help around the house or care for the elderly?""I don't think we're ready to handle this problem yet.""He thinks clever chatbots will replace most call centre staff within 10 years.""A virtual assistant can handle 60%-80% of all customer conversations now without any need for a human agent to intervene - five years ago it would have been 25%-30%,"" he says.""Chatbots are certainly eliminating jobs - we need fewer and fewer human agents each year. The ones that are left will be highly skilled super-agents looking after the most complicated cases.""Future of WorkBBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.How to become a professional shopperIs cryonics the key to immortality?Why Finland is experimenting with 'free money'More Future of Work storiesResearch firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of questions will be answered by virtual assistants. When you think that a huge telecoms company like AT&T employs about 100,000 call centre agents to look after its 120 million customers, that's a lot of jobs that could disappear pretty quickly. But the cost-savings are too big for large corporations to ignore. And they say customer satisfaction increases as these chatbots learn from the millions of previous customer conversations and become smarter.

But McKinsey also acknowledged that this new technology ""will also create new occupations that do not exist today, much as technologies in the past have done"".Could the saddler of the past ever have imagined the roles of car mechanic, smartphone app developer or drone pilot?The Industrial Revolution from the late 17th Century onwards saw mechanisation sweep through many industries. Farming in particular, which accounted for around 50% of all jobs across Europe, saw that percentage dwindle to less than 5% now.duncan1890The mechanisation of farming saw many agricultural jobs move to other sectorsSuch upheaval was undoubtedly painful for those unable to adapt, but new types of employment came along eventually. More recently, there have seismic changes to the global economy. In the last 30 years, we've had digital transformation, the rise of the internet, globalisation. But figures from the World Bank show that global unemployment as a percentage of total labour force has actually fallen from 6.1% in 1991 to 5.8% in 2017, despite the population rising from 5.4 billion to 7.6 billion over the same period.Robotic process automation - RPA - will remove the need for staff to do boring, repetitive, rules-based activities, such as inputting data or handling payroll, tech optimists say. ""This is an evolution of work - the type of work we do will change,"" says Ian Barkin, co-founder of Symphony Ventures, an RPA specialist with clients such as Lloyds Banking Group and US payroll giant ADP.PolycomPolycom boss Mary McDowell thinks new technologies will make us more productive""RPA doesn't have to lead to a culling of staff, it can empower them and unleash their creativity. It's freeing them from doing the unproductive stuff."" Mary McDowell, chief executive of video-conferencing provider Polycom, envisages a time where AI will effectively run virtual meetings for us, using facial recognition to identify who's speaking and calling up relevant documents and statistics to support points being made.""The management of sound and video will be so much better,"" she says. ""Participants will feel like they're actually present and augmented reality will help us collaborate and annotate documents much more productively.""Meetings will be about the ideas, not the mechanics. Without technical barriers we can focus on the work at hand, whether that's providing telemedicine or distance learning services.""But even the optimists admit that as low-skilled jobs disappear, people will need to learn new skills to compensate. ""This calls on us all to focus on up-skilling,"" says Mr Barkin. ""There's an urgent need for education reform - people need to learn design thinking, creativity, analytics, programming.""Research by job site Indeed finds that in the last three years demand from UK employers for AI specialists has almost tripled.""Technology can lead to job reductions, but it doesn't have to. This could be a huge good news story,"" concludes Mr Barkin.Just don't carry on making saddles when the car is driving down the street towards you.In the rest of this series we will look at the new types of job that could emerge in the age of robots, AI and automation.Follow Matthew on Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The late Stephen Hawking was a major voice in the debate about how humanity can benefit from artificial intelligence. Hawking made no secret of his fears that thinking machines could one day take charge. He went as far as predicting that future developments in AI “could spell the end of the human race.”
But Hawking’s relationship with AI was far more complex than this often-cited soundbite. The deep concerns he expressed were about superhuman AI, the point at which AI systems not only replicate human intelligence processes, but also keep expanding them, without our support – a stage that is at best decades away, if it ever happens at all. And yet Hawking’s very ability to communicate those fears, and all his other ideas, came to depend on basic AI technology.
Hawking’s conflicted relationship with AI
At the intellectual property and health law centers at DePaul University, my colleagues and I study the effects of emerging technologies like the ones Stephen Hawking worried about. At its core, the concept of AI involves computational technology designed to make machines function with foresight that mimics, and ultimately surpasses, human thinking processes.
Hawking cautioned against an extreme form of AI, in which thinking machines would “take off” on their own, modifying themselves and independently designing and building ever more capable systems. Humans, bound by the slow pace of biological evolution, would be tragically outwitted.
AI as a threat to humanity?
Well before it gets to the point of superhuman technology, AI can be put to terrible uses. Already, scholars and commentators worry that self-flying drones may be precursors to lethal autonomous robots. 
Today’s early stage AI raises several other ethical and practical problems, too. AI systems are largely based on opaque algorithms that make decisions even their own designers may be unable to explain. The underlying mathematical models can be biased, and computational errors may occur. AI may progressively displace human skills and increase unemployment. And limited access to AI might increase global inequality.
The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, launched by Stanford University in 2014, highlighted some of these concerns. But so far it has identified no evidence that AI will pose any “imminent threat” to humankind, as Hawking feared.
Still, Hawking’s views on AI are somewhat less alarmist and more nuanced than he usually gets credit for. At their heart, they describe the need to understand and regulate emerging technologies. He repeatedly called for more research on the benefits and dangers of AI. And he believed that even non-superhuman AI systems could help eradicate war, poverty and disease.
Hawking talks
This apparent contradiction – a fear of humanity being eventually overtaken by AI but optimism about its benefits in the meantime – may have come from his own life: Hawking had come to rely on AI to interact with the world.
Unable to speak since 1985, he used a series of different communication systems that helped him talk and write, culminating in the now-legendary computer operated by one muscle in his right cheek.
The first iteration of the computer program was exasperatingly slow and prone to errors. Very basic AI changed that. An open-source program made his word selection significantly faster. More importantly, it used artificial intelligence to analyze Hawking’s own words, and then used that information to help him express new ideas. By processing Hawking’s books, articles and lecture scripts, the system got so good that he did not even have to type the term people most associate with him, “the black hole.” When he selected “the,” “black” would automatically be suggested to follow it, and “black” would prompt “hole” onto the screen.


Stephen Hawking discusses a predictive system that helped him communicate.

AI improves people’s health
Stephen Hawking’s experience with such a basic form of AI illustrates how non-superhuman AI can indeed change people’s lives for the better. Speech prediction helped him cope with a devastating neurological disease. Other AI-based systems are already helping prevent, fight and lessen the burden of disease.
For instance, AI can analyze medical sensors and other health data to predict how likely a patient is to develop a severe blood infection. In studies it was substantially more accurate – and provided much more advance warning – than other methods. 
Another group of researchers created an AI program to sift through electronic health records of 700,000 patients. The program, called “Deep Patient,” unearthed linkages that had not been apparent to doctors, identifying new risk patterns for certain cancers, diabetes and psychiatric disorders.
AI has even powered a robotic surgery system that outperformed human surgeons in a procedure on pigs that’s very similar to one type of operation on human patients.
There’s so much promise for AI to improve people’s health that collecting medical data has become a cornerstone of both software development and public-health policy in the U.S. For example, the Obama White House launched a research effort seeking to collect DNA from at least a million Americans. The data will be made available for AI systems to analyze when studying new medical treatments, potentially improving both diagnoses and patients’ recovery.
All of these benefits from AI are available right now, and more are in the works. They do suggest that superhuman AI systems could be extremely powerful, but despite warnings from Hawking and fellow technology visionary Elon Musk that day may never come. In the meantime, as Hawking knew, there is much to be gained. AI gave him a better and more efficient voice than his body was able to provide, with which he called for both research and restraint.

Today, it boasts 800 million monthly active users and is owned by Facebook. There are 70 million photos uploaded to Instagram every day. People interact with each of those posts by showing their love with a heart, commenting and using hashtags. What all of this activity does is create an enormous amount of data. Once analyzed, by humans as well as increasingly through artificial intelligence algorithms, it can provide incredible business intel and insights into human behavior causing Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to say, “We’re also going to be a big data company.”

Here are some ways Instagram uses big data and artificial intelligence today.
Explore Page and Search Function
Via the use of tags and trending information, Instagram users are able to find photos for a particular activity, topic or event or discover experiences, restaurants and places around the world that are trending. Enabled by tagging, the search tools help Instagram users discover things of interest among the millions of uploaded images.
PROMOTED
Target Advertising
In order to make the data that Instagram collects valuable, it must extract customer insights from it. By assessing the search preferences and engagement insights from its users, Instagram can sell advertising to companies who want to reach that particular customer profile and who might be most interested in receiving a particular marketing message. Since Facebook with 1.8 billion users owns Instagram they have a powerful network of analytics information to help target advertising based on what people like, who they follow and interact with and what they save.

Enhance the User Experience
In order to ensure users find value in the platform, it’s important for Instagram to show them what they will like. As the amount of content grows, finding content that each user will find relevant becomes exponentially more challenging. When Instagram changed its feed from reverse-chronological order to showing posts that they believe users would like and share, machine-learning algorithms were put on the job to help sort the information and to better learn over time what is most valued and relevant for each user to create a personalized feed.
Filter Spam
Instagram uses artificial intelligence to fight spam. The spam filter is able to remove fake messages from accounts written in nine languages including English, Chinese, Russian, Arabic and more. Once messages are detected they are automatically removed. Instagram uses Facebook’s artificial intelligence text analytics algorithm DeepText that is able to understand the context of a message nearly as good as humans.

Fight Cyberbullying and Delete Offensive Comments
In a survey conducted by Ditch the Label, 42% of more than 10,000 UK youth between ages 12 and 25 reported Instagram was the platform where they were most bullied. With this unfortunate distinction of having the biggest cyberbullying problem of any social media site, they became the first to use machine learning to automatically remove offensive posts, whereas Facebook and Twitter rely on users to report abusive language. Based on the success of using DeepText to identify spam and remove it, Instagram officials began to see it as a solution to identify and eliminate comments that violate Instagram’s Community Guidelines. Humans reviewed and tagged actual Instagram posts to help DeepText learn what would be considered offensive content in certain contexts and what wouldn’t be. If the algorithm finds something offensive, it is immediately removed.
Even though DeepText isn’t perfect, it has received praise from cyberbully prevention organizations for the work it is doing. There is still the risk of misclassifying something as offensive when it’s not or that offensive comments will make it through.
Study the Human Condition
In one study, 100 million Instagram photos were used to learn global clothing patterns.  What would have been an impossible amount of data to review is increasingly possible thanks to machine learning. This work showed the potential for machine learning to help extract insights when studying humans and social, economic and cultural factors around the world. This study exhibited the power of big data and technologies such as computer vision, automated analysis algorithms and machine learning to comb through enormous data sets that are created by social media sites to gain understanding about the world around us.
From enhancing its platform for users and advertisers to finding and removing fake or offensive content, Instagram uses the insights it extracts from all the data it collects to improve while others find great potential in the enormous data it collects to uncover insights about human behavior, cultures and more.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are great benefits in the use of AI and we should cherish them. However, the issue is not innovation, or the pace of technological improvement. The real problem is the governance of AI, the ethics underpinning it, the boundaries we give it and, within that, who is going to define all those.With that in mind, I think the next fight for us women is to ensure artificial intelligence does not become the ultimate expression of masculinity.There are many reasons to fear this could happen. First, the algorithms that codify human choices about how decisions should be made. It is not possible for algorithms to remain immune from the human values of their creators. If a non-diverse workforce is creating them, they are more prone to be implanted with unexamined, undiscussed, often unconscious assumptions and biases about things such as race, gender and class. What if the workforce designing those algorithms is male-dominated? This is the first major problem: the lack of female scientists and, even worse, the lack of true intersectional thinking behind the creation of algorithms.Bill Gates believes governments should tax companies’ use of robots, as a way to fund other types of employmentExamples of bias were reported by the Guardian a few years back, showing that searching Google for the phrase “unprofessional hairstyles for work” led to images of mainly black women with natural hair, while searching for “professional hairstyles” offered pictures of coiffed white women. Or take Microsoft’s Tay chatbot, which was created to strike up conversations with millennials on Twitter. The algorithm had been designed to learn how to mimic others by copying their speech. But within 24 hours of being online, it had been led astray, and became a genocide-supporting, anti-feminist Nazi, tweeting messages such as: “Hitler did nothing wrong.”What can we do about it? Obviously, encouraging more women to take up the profession and create algorithms would be a great step forward, and we are still lagging behind on this. However, we also need to start querying the outcomes of the decisions made by algorithms and demand transparency in the process that leads to them. Although the new EU General Data Protection Regulation does not go far enough, it does broaden the definition of profiling activities, thus providing us with tools to avoid profiling-based decisions by questioning them. There are no legal certainties yet about how far the new European regulations, which come into force on 25 May, can be taken, but pressure must be applied to ensure AI algorithms are not just powerful and scalable but also transparent to inspection.View image in fullscreenGoogle image searches for ‘unprofessional hair for work’ (left) and ‘professional hair for work’ (right) .Of course, the problem of AI goes beyond this. Some academics, such as Joanna Bryson and Luciano Floridi, argue that AI companies should be regulated like architects, who learn to work with city planners, certification schemes and licences to make buildings safe. They argue for watchdogs and regulators.It is encouraging that in the UK the government has set up the Centre for Data Ethics. This new body is tasked with advising on the measures needed to enable and ensure safe, ethical and innovative uses of data-driven technologies. Tech UK, which represents the tech industry, is also having conversations on the subject. For the feminist movement, the challenge is to frame the debate and not to let others decide for us.And let’s not forget the impact on the labour market, with women projected to take the biggest hits to jobs in the near future as a result of automation replacing human activities, according to the World Economic Forum. Women are more likely to be employed in jobs that face the highest automation risks. For example, 73% of cashiers in shops are women and 97% of cashiers are expected to lose their jobs to automation. The same report predicts that persistent gender gaps in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) fields over the next 15 years will also undermine women’s professional presence.And if robots are taking human jobs, we need to figure out how we would deal with a large jobless population. Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of robots, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. And many now suggest that universal basic income is probably the only solution to the rise of robotic automation. This is appealing to many but it does pose questions from a feminist perspective: if the only jobs available will be in science and technology, how is that going to work for women in the light of the gender gaps in those professions? If we followed that route, would we be paving the way to men at work and women at home?Google’s AI is being used by US military drone programmeRead moreWhat we need is a progressive, enlightened digital politics aimed at getting the most out of technology: a better environment, better healthcare, a better work-life balance. To achieve that, we need better governance of AI – and women must be at the heart of this.The Fabian Women’s Network has decided it is time to take action and throw our weight behind the cause. This month, we are launching our Women Leading in AI series. At the first gathering on 22 May, we are bringing together some of the most interesting and thought-provoking female voices on AI, ranging from business and academia to thinktanks. It is time for women not only to investigate what AI means for us, but also to make sure we frame and lead the debate about its governance and purpose, so it becomes a force for the common good and not the ultimate expression of masculine control.

DataArtificial IntelligenceInsights 5 polarizing Quotes from Professor Stephen Hawking on artificial intelligence

By Richard Gall -   March 15, 2018 - 12:00 am 37394 1 










3 min readProfessor Stephen Hawking died today (March 14, 2018) aged 76 at his home in Cambridge, UK. Best known for his theory of cosmology that unified quantum mechanics with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, and for his book a Brief History of Time that brought his concepts to a wider general audience, Professor Hawking is quite possibly one of the most important and well-known voices in the scientific world. 
Among many things, Professor Hawking had a lot to say about artificial intelligence – its dangers, its opportunities and what we should be thinking about, not just as scientists and technologists, but as humans. 
Over the years, Hawking has remained cautious and consistent in his views on the topic constantly urging AI researchers and machine learning developers to consider the wider implications of their work on society and the human race itself.  The machine learning community is quite divided on all the issues Hawking has raised and will probably continue to be so as the field grows faster than it can be fathomed.
Here are 5 widely debated things Stephen Hawking said about AI arranged in chronological order – and if you’re going to listen to anyone, you’ve surely got to listen to him?  
On artificial intelligence ending the human race
The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.
From an interview with the BBC, December 2014

On the future of AI research 
The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems.
As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase…. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.
From Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence, an open letter co-signed by Hawking, January 2015
On AI emulating human intelligence
I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It, therefore, follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence — and exceed it
From a speech given by Hawking at the opening of the Leverhulme Centre of the Future of Intelligence, Cambridge, U.K., October 2016
On making artificial intelligence benefit humanity
Perhaps we should all stop for a moment and focus not only on making our AI better and more successful but also on the benefit of humanity.
Taken from a speech given by Hawking at Web Summit in Lisbon, November 2017
On AI replacing humans
The genie is out of the bottle. We need to move forward on artificial intelligence development but we also need to be mindful of its very real dangers. I fear that AI may replace humans altogether. If people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that will outperform humans.
From an interview with Wired, November 2017

The question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate.On Thursday, Robert O. Work, a former deputy secretary of defense, announced that he is teaming up with the Center for a New American Security, an influential Washington think tank that specializes in national security, to create a task force of former government officials, academics and representatives from private industry. Their goal is to explore how the federal government should embrace A.I. technology and work better with big tech companies and other organizations.There is a growing sense of urgency to the question of what the United States is doing in artificial intelligence. China has vowed to become the world’s leader in A.I. by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort. Like many other officials from government and industry, Mr. Work believes the United States risks falling behind.“The question is, how should the United States respond to this challenge?” he said. “This is a Sputnik moment.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe military and intelligence communities have long played a big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of Silicon Valley’s early tech giants. David Packard, Hewlett-Packard’s co-founder, even served as the deputy secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon.But those relations have soured in recent years — at least with the rank and file of some better-known companies. In 2013, documents leaked by the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of several large internet companies.ImageRobert O.

Mr. Work, who was the deputy secretary of defense, said of the global race for A.I. technology: “This is a Sputnik moment.”Credit...Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesTwo years ago, that antagonism grew worse after the F.B.I. demanded that Apple create special software to help it gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a gunman involved in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.“In the wake of Edward Snowden, there has been a lot of concern over what it would mean for Silicon Valley companies to work with the national security community,” said Gregory Allen, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security. “These companies are — understandably — very cautious about these relationships.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Pentagon needs help on A.I. from Silicon Valley because that’s where the talent is. The tech industry’s biggest companies have been hoarding A.I. expertise, sometimes offering multimillion-dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match.Mr. Work was the driving force behind the creation of Project Maven, the Defense Department’s sweeping effort to embrace artificial intelligence. His new task force will include Terah Lyons, the executive director of the Partnership on AI, an industry group that includes many of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies.Mr. Work will lead the 18-member task force with Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Moore has warned that too much of the country’s computer science talent is going to work at America’s largest internet companies.With tech companies gobbling up all that talent, who will train the next generation of A.I. experts? Who will lead government efforts?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Even if the U.S. does have the best A.I. companies, it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in a substantive way,” Mr. Allen said.ImageAn Air Force team transporting missiles to be loaded onto drones at the Persian Gulf base in 2016.Credit...John Moore/Getty ImagesGoogle illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the Pentagon. Google’s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who is still a member of the board of directors of its parent company, Alphabet, also leads the Defense Innovation Board, a federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on A.I. technologies.Last week, two news outlets revealed that the Defense Department had been working with Google in developing A.I. technology that can analyze aerial footage captured by flying drones. The effort was part of Project Maven, led by Mr. Work. Some employees were angered that the company was contributing to military work.Google runs two of the best A.I. research labs in the world — Google Brain in California and DeepMind in London.Top researchers inside both Google A.I. labs have expressed concern over the use of A.I. by the military. When Google acquired DeepMind, the company agreed to set up an internal board that would help ensure that the lab’s technology was used in an ethical way. And one of the lab’s founders, Demis Hassabis, has explicitly said its A.I. would not be used for military purposes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle acknowledged in a statement that the military use of A.I. “raises valid concerns” and said it was working on policies around the use of its so-called machine learning technologies.Among A.I. researchers and other technologists, there is widespread fear that today’s machine learning techniques could put too much power in dangerous hands. A recent report from prominent labs and think tanks in both the United States and Britain detailed the risks, including problems with weapons and surveillance equipment.Google said it was working with the Defense Department to build technology for “non-offensive uses only.” And Mr. Work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve “lethal force.” But it is unclear where Google and other top internet companies will draw the line.“This is a conversation we have to have,” Mr. Work said.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.

Citizens Want Government to Use Artificial Intelligence to Deliver New, Improved Services (Graphic: Business Wire)






March 15, 2018 07:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citizens are willing to try new artificial intelligence (AI) tools for 
      government services despite their concerns about government use of the 
      technology, according to results of an Accenture (NYSE: ACN) 
      multi-country survey.
    
“These findings should be a wake-up call for 
      government leaders to prioritize effective communications regarding the 
      benefits of AI-related technology in delivering government services that 
      are secure, smart and fast — while also promoting its proper and ethical 
      use.”Post this

      The survey of more than 6,000 citizens from the United States, 
      Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France and Germany found that 
      more than half (54 percent) of citizens said they are willing to use AI 
      services delivered by government, with even more expressing willingness 
      when presented with the potential benefits derived from AI.
    

      For instance, three-quarters (74 percent) of respondents said they would 
      be willing to use AI if it would increase pension or retirement income 
      (such as by improving their personal investment strategy and/or pension 
      scheme), and two-thirds (66 percent) said they would use a chatbot if it 
      would guarantee faster processing of a tax refund or social service 
      benefits.
    

      At the same time, however, the findings highlight citizens’ concerns 
      about the use of AI by governments, with two-thirds (66 percent) of 
      respondents indicating a lack of confidence in government’s ethical and 
      responsible use of AI. Specifically, only one-third (34 percent) said 
      they’re “confident/very confident” that government would be ethical and 
      responsible in its use of AI; fewer than one in three (29 percent) said 
      they are “not at all confident” in government using AI ethically and 
      responsibly, and slightly more than one-third (37 percent) said they are 
      neutral on the point.
    

      The survey also determined that regardless of where they lived, citizens 
      have concerns about the use of AI in government, including in areas of 
      job security and personal data security. For instance, approximately 
      four in 10 respondents (42 percent) said they think AI takes jobs away 
      from people, and only about one in six (17 percent) believe that AI can 
      better protect their personal information and reduce their chances of 
      getting hacked.
    

      The survey found that one of the biggest communications challenges for 
      government officials implementing AI projects is explaining AI’s 
      benefits to citizens. For instance, one-third (32 percent) of all survey 
      respondents reported not understanding AI’s potential benefits well 
      enough to judge whether government should use the technology.
    

      “Citizens are willing to embrace AI-driven solutions that improve the 
      delivery of government services, but they want to be sure that 
      government is taking a leading role in ensuring the safe and ethical use 
      of AI,” said Carl Ward, who leads AI programs for Accenture’s Health & 
      Public Service practice. “These findings should be a wake-up call for 
      government leaders to prioritize effective communications regarding the 
      benefits of AI-related technology in delivering government services that 
      are secure, smart and fast — while also promoting its proper and ethical 
      use.”
    

      The survey findings also highlight differences between citizens who work 
      in the public sector and other citizens regarding their views on AI and 
      government, with public-sector respondents being more positive overall. 
      For instance, public-sector respondents were more likely than other 
      respondents to say they are willing to use AI services delivered by 
      government (63 percent vs. 51 percent) and more likely to say they are 
      confident or very confident that government would use AI in an ethical 
      and responsible manner (46 percent vs. 31 percent). At the same time, 
      public-sector respondents were less likely to say they don’t understand 
      AI’s potential benefits well enough to judge whether government should 
      use the technology (26 percent vs. 33 percent).
    

      Public-sector respondents were also more likely than other respondents 
      to say they would be comfortable using a chatbot to interact with a 
      government agency (56 percent vs. 38 percent) — and twice as likely to 
      say they believe that using AI such as digital assistants or chatbots 
      for government services is a more secure way to protect personal 
      information (46 percent vs. 23 percent).
    

      “New categories of digital jobs are emerging that result in improved 
      government services for citizens, and citizens want government personnel 
      to explain how AI can improve the delivery of public services,” Ward 
      said. “Public-sector employees will be a critical component to bridging 
      that gap between advancing AI and engaging with citizens to address 
      concerns while also explaining the benefits. AI job coaches for 
      government personnel could provide the required skills and training 
      necessary to ensure that staff can explain the benefits of AI government 
      tools and how they can change citizen experiences for the better.”
    

Methodology


      Accenture surveyed 6,000 citizens aged 18 or older in the United States, 
      Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France and Germany to assess 
      opinions about a variety of public service issues and topics. The survey 
      was conducted online between October and November 2017. Approximately 
      one-fifth (21 percent) of the respondents identified as currently 
      working in the public sector. Results for the full global sample are 
      statistically significant with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of 
      error of +/- 1.6%.

How AI is helping recruiters write the perfect job advertBy Taylor Bragg






THE recruitment market seems to be buzzing with innovation right now, and many technologies are being harnessed to find solutions to some of the toughest problems in the industry.Finding the right talent is critical for every business, although it can be a long and cumbersome one. According to research by Jobvite, 65 percent of recruiters claim talent shortage as the biggest challenge in hiring.WHAT CAN AI DO FOR THE FUTURE OF E-LEARNING?Taylor Bragg | 5 March, 2018Hiring the wrong person can be very costly for your business. According to The Times, recruiting the wrong person costs roughly a third of the employee’s first-year earnings. Not only does it cost money, but it can also negatively impact staff morale.  But now, artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to revolutionize how recruitment professionals find the perfect candidate to fill their position. Though the technology is often referred to as dehumanizing, if used efficiently, AI can actually allow recruiters to be more, well, human!From time-saving tools which automate resume screening to AI-powered chatbots which provide 24-hour help and advice to candidates with applicant-queries, AI is set to become an essential tool for the most forward-thinking companies.AI-powered job postingsIn a world of fierce competition to nab the top talent, recruiters should not leave anything to chance. And this starts with the very first step of posting a job advert online.Though this step is often overlooked, the job advertisement is where the applicant’s journey begins. It is often the very first thing that they see from your company, and so getting this right is vital.GOOGLE’S E-LEARNING PROGRAM OPENS DOOR FOR AI TO ALLTech Wire Asia | 8 March, 2018Textio is an example of a company that truly understands the importance of high-quality job postings in recruiting the best possible candidates to join your company.How does it work?Using an “augmented writing” platform, the idea behind Textio is to give users data-driven feedback on job-postings and information on how it would likely perform with a particular audience. As a result of this, companies will be able to improve their communications and thus receive a far more favorable response.Texio uses an algorithm that ingests 10 million job openings per month. The software searches and analyzes language patterns and rates phrasing against criteria such as the number of applicants a job gets and the percentage who qualified to get an interview.Using natural language processing (NLP), the algorithms come up with alternatives to phrases to recommend ones found in the most successful job descriptions. For instance replacing “focused on” with “passionate about”.Attracting diverse candidatesAs well as this, the software can analyze how prevalent gender-biased language is in any given job posting.WHY CULTURE IS THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONTech Wire Asia | 12 March, 2018For instance, Fortune and Textio analyzed thousands of Walmart job descriptions between January and March last year. After collecting and analyzing over 4,400 US-based job postings, it was found that 51 percent of job descriptions were more likely to appeal to men rather than women. On top of this, 53 percent of management positions and 84 percent of director-level job descriptions skew male.According to Textio, using gender-neutral language in job postings is crucial in attracting a diverse mix of talent. Such job postings are filled 14 days faster than posts which contain masculine or feminine bias.Textio is helping to rid of gender-bias within job postings. Source: ShutterstockIt seems that many companies are levering the help AI in finding the right talent. This includes major Fortune 500 companies like Cisco and Johnson & Johnson, who are using Textio to recruit better talent.It is clear that AI-powered software like Textio is a powerful tool in saving recruiters a lot of time while also helping them to find the best and diverse talent.Though, one can’t help but show a little concern about the possibility of augmented writing software like this taking over a writer’s job..

She says this mindset impedes women’s willingness to participate in sport, despite the well-known social, physical and psychological benefits it provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Warren marvels at the profound technological advances she&#039;s&amp;nbsp;witnessed during her career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This month marks 50&amp;nbsp;years since I started my Monash law degree,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;For the first 40 years, technologically, [the legal profession]&amp;nbsp;was doing things more or less as we were in the 19th century. The last 10&amp;nbsp;years have been extraordinary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;“There are times when you just have to be courageous”&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Warren says being the first woman appointed as a chief justice caused “a lot of fuss and comment at the time”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But my approach was to be genderless. I didn’t see myself as a woman, I saw myself as my particular role.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stresses that while she&#039;s received barbs in her various roles over her career, including as a solicitor and barrister, she focused on being the best lawyer she could be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t go in with my armour strapped on, ready for a fight,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t do these things because you’re a courageous person;&amp;nbsp;there are just times when you just have to be courageous.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Warren has advice for women of all ages and at all stages in their careers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The key is when the opportunity comes along, so many women back away and don’t take it on,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“I encourage all women –&amp;nbsp;don’t let those opportunities go past you.”&lt;/p&gt;","AI, law, disputes, International Women's Day, artificial intelligence, Faculty of Law","An AI court system isn't a distant dream. “It’s here, it’s happening,” says former chief justice Marilyn Warren.",The future reimagined: AI may soon be used to decide the outcome of civil disputes – and will be primarily driven by women.

Play   Artificial intelligence finds T. rex couldn't run     
A popular YouTube artist has an unusual collaborator on her new album -- artificial intelligence.  Pop artist Taryn Southern, who appeared on American Idol in 2004, created the lyrics and melodies for ""I AM AI"" but left most of the other work to software programs.     The album's first song ""Break Free,"" which was released on Monday, was developed with the help of startup Amper Music. Amper is one of several AI music services Southern is working with on the album, which will debut later this year.   Southern has only basic piano skills, so she turned to the program to deliver the instrumental part of the song. The AI developed the harmonies, chords and sequences.   ""In a funny way, I have a new song-writing partner who doesn't get tired and has this endless knowledge of music making,"" Southern told CNN Tech. ""But I feel like I get to own my vision; I iterate and choose what I like and don't like. There's a lot more control.""       Southern still worked with a producer on her vocals, but the rest of the song relied on Amper's software. She gave the program some guidelines, such as the speed of the song, key signature and preferred instruments. The program then produced a track for her to consider.   Although some fine-tuning was still necessary after the AI delivered its part, she arranged what was offered into verses and a chorus.   ""In the past, I'd get into traps of writing songs in a given style or chords I know I like,"" Southern said. ""When working with AI music, everything it spits at me is a surprise.""   Related: Farmers turn to artificial intelligence to grow better tomatoes   Southern said writing the structure of the song is now 20 times faster than when relied on human musicians. She also previously used Apple's GarageBand platform.   Southern, known for cover songs and some original work, has been posting on YouTube for a decade. Her ""Hot for Hillary"" music video in 2007 has been viewed over 2.3 million times.        Her new work is an example of how AI can complement the human workforce, even as it automates some jobs. Southern said AI has made her more creative than ever.   ""Human creators and human musicians are not going away,"" Amper Music CEO Drew Silverstein said. ""We're making it so that you don't have to spend 10,000 hours and thousands of dollars buying equipment to share and express your ideas.""

At the Hiring Success 18 conference in San Francisco, SmartRecruiters unveiled an AI-powered... [+] recruiting assistant.
SmartRecruiters




The San Francisco-based recruiting startup is on a roll.
In just 3 years since launching its enterprise talent acquisition online and mobile platform, SmartRecruiters signed up 2,000 of the world's largest companies like Alcoa, Avery Dennison, Bosch, IAC, IKEA, Nature's Bounty or Visa and connected 15 million candidates to 900,000 jobs.

The 200-employee technology company also added more than 3,000 small business customers since it relaunched its free SmartStart offering, last September.
""Last year we've also added more than 200 new large enterprise customers replacing competitors like BrassRing (IBM), iCIMS, Jobvite, SuccessFactors (SAP) and Taleo (Oracle),"" said SmartRecruiters CEO Jerome Ternynck during an analyst briefing at the company's user conference, Hiring Success 18, in San Francisco this week. ""We've also doubled our revenue in 2017 with 96% of our clients renewing their subscription.""
GDPR will become a huge liability for companies using non-compliant recruiting software
The venture-backed hiring startup has raised so far over $56 million and is now available in more than 30 countries, 15 different languages and attracted over 370 partners to its cloud platform, offering additional, and sometimes competitive, services from chatbots to onboarding, CRM, social media or reference checks.
PROMOTED
""We invested heavily to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which governs the collection, use, storage and disclosure of any personal data of individuals in Europe,"" added Ternynck. ""From May, GDPR will be a huge liability as job candidates could sue any company that doesn't comply with the new law.""









SmartRecruiters AI-powered recruiting assistant helps automate the screening, discovery, and... [+] matching of job candidates, while free up recruiting capacity (4X) and save 60% of advertising and sourcing dollars.

How AI can change the future of hiring
At the Hiring Success conference, the human resources tech startup unveiled a recruiting assistant that uses machine learning to automatically screen incoming applications and score candidates against jobs, highlighting their work experiences, education level, and skill set without subjectivity or selection bias.

""We expect that AI will save recruiters 30% of their time screening candidates while the automatic scoring will reduce 50% 0f their sourcing costs by sending jobs to pre-qualified candidates,"" said Rebecca Carr, vice-president of product at SmartRecruiters. ""Another benefit of using AI for screening is that machines don't have biases which will make recruiting human again.”
With NHS, recruiting looks a lot like marketing
SmartRecruiters also announced an integrated CRM module, a new programmatic advertising solution (SmartJobs) that will optimize the posting of jobs for its customers and a scorecard to help measure a company's recruiting process, the Net Hiring Score (NHS), based on the cost and speed of hiring and the quality of the people hired.
""Similar to the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in marketing, NHS is a real-time pulse of how recruiting is performing. Organizations can also easily compare their NHS with their peers and tweak their hiring budget based on the velocity and the quality of hires they want to achieve,"" added Ternynck.
On a final note, Stephane Kasriel, the CEO of Upwork, the world's largest freelance marketplace, shared his views on the future of work, introducing the concept of total talent acquisition management embracing both the full-time workforce and freelancers.

""What has been striking to me is how the recruiting world is split today between the full time traditional W2 hiring handled by HR on one side and contingent, on-demand, temporary, consulting, freelance workers managed by the procurement department on the other. And I hope we can somehow bridge the gap so that we can start treating people like human beings and as part of the same team, and not supplies or materials.""

They can be sporadic and unpredictable. NITI Aayog’s roadmap for national Artificial Intelligence programme hopes to bring one such revolution.The allocated Rs 3,073 crore will spearhead work on fifth generation technology startups like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing and Blockchain.The magnanimity of effort can be gauged by the near doubling of the fund for the programme. Atal Innovation Mission can give Rs 10 crore to start-ups that fit the criteria. In all, Rs 200 crore has been allocated in 2017-18. India is ready to take the AI-assisted leap of faith, with pre-meditated outcomes for before, during and after the leap.The oncoming revolution has to go through mountains of paperwork, maze of data silos, and murky data lakes before any form of AI can begin to make sense of the haphazardness that is India. Let’s tackle some important questions when it comes to these futuristic technologies.Where do we stand now?The next generation of technology is seeing exponential growth. The overall picture is blurry though, due to the extremes we need to be navigating. To crunch some numbers, according to reports, there are more than 200 AI-based start-ups in India.In a March-June 2017, a Capgemini survey of nearly 1,000 companies in India with revenue of over $500 million, found that around 58 percent have gone beyond pilot and test projects and are adopting the technology at a larger scale. The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 500 million by June 2018, it’s the second largest online market in the world.Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsAt 160 million WhatsApp users, we having a generation of people who skipped any computer learning and straightaway became mobile consumers of the internet.Let’s begin with data. AI functions are directly proportional to the amount of data and the kind of data fed into the system. In the case of India, the largest database is built with Aadhaar - 99 percent of India’s population - a staggering 1.19 billion records.Aadhaar is the world’s largest biometric ID system and India’s first foray into scaled up technology has no precedent. And this is precisely why the Aadhaar comes with its own set of unique challenges.The first challenge is how much of the data is personal? Does a collection of retinal scans and finger print breach the right of privacy? Aadhaar is mandatory for one service after another - phone numbers, ration cards, bank accounts, income tax filing. All of the interlinked data will be available to government to garner insights using AI. In the larger scheme of things, this data will be linked to hospital records, land records, purchases, this could be made visible or sold to interested parties, legally or illegally.The second challenge is of course, security. It is impossible to create a non-hackable system. Aadhaar opens up a minefield of security lapses, where the hacked data can be used to cause harm to a person or society. As pointed out by media, there have been lapses in the past wherein the data has been leaked or sold or hacked into. The government needs to make stricter laws and plug in loopholes when it comes to Aadhaar data.The third and yet unseen challenge is the moral implications of using AI, because there is no universal right or absolute wrong in this case. Every case differs from the other. This is the most difficult challenge of all, because there is limited data to study the new scenarios that will be originating when AI will be using countrywide data to garner insights.Let’s take the case of linking Aadhaar to medical records. In times of disasters, floods, fires, train accidents - fingerprint identification and medical history of a patient available to a medical profession will be the factor determining life and death. Analyzing the cases of particular diseases in a specific region, could help predict epidemics before they break out.Websites and apps query people if they are willing to share crash data with developers to better the systems over a period of time. Will hospitals give out similar consent forms to people if they are willing for their data to be used in analyzing patient records by AI to look for insights that have escaped the human eye.Personal data is a double-edged sword. Enterprises and governments can make use of data for a variety of scenarios when it helps people, but cases of blatant misuses will also be flaring up in huge numbers. Medical records of employees help an organisation in times of emergency care for employees with medical histories, like heart condition or diabetes. But the same data can be used for discriminating against employees that have a medical condition like mental health issues or HIV-AIDS.What needs to be done for enterprises to adopt AI solutions? Create secure, usable, scalable dataData is the smallest and most important unit of an AI system. AI is all set to revolutionise manufacturing, transport, healthcare, finance and retail to name a few. But, the biggest problem in India, across industry verticals, is the severe paucity of usable data. We need to create a system to convert records on paper to create data lakes for Machine Learning (ML) to take over from humans. ML will start to analyse data, and then an AI-enabled system learns by itself and provides actionable insights.The mindset needs to shift from find and fix mentality to that of a preventive maintenance.The major barriers to storing data digitally is lack of trust, time, and the inertia to shift from existing systems. Digital data is not considered tamper-proof. Take real estate for example. You have to get a stamp paper to a registrar, and get the documents in your name. For smaller transactions too, a paper bill is preferred over an email.A majority of all our transactions are physical. We need a simplified, encrypted digital transaction system that is easy to adopt. Government departments - legal, transport, medical, educational - carry majority on their transactions on paper, creating silos after silos of static, non-usable data.The existing data is not centralised, creating a disorganised data maze that is impossible to navigate. The digital revolution needs to first start creating organised, usable, accessible data. Create the ecosystem to train AI professionals Around 4,000 positions in the field of AI are vacant in India due to the insufficiency of talent. Kelly OCG India reported that India would see a 60 percent rise in demand for AI and ML professionals by 2018. It’s difficult for Indian companies to attract talent from outside the country.Educational institutes need to scale up and be better equipped for the changing demand for new technologies. A change in curriculum as well as opening new colleges, specifically dedicated to higher studies in the fields of Machine learning, Big data, Cloud computing, Blockchain and AI is the need of the day.We need to start to develop in-house talent to cater to the exceeding demand for skilled professionals.Online courses in AI and Machine Learning from industry leaders like Andrew Ng on Coursera are very helpful to companies that want their workforce to upskill and stay relevant. AI is not a magical cure for all problems Every industry has specific requirements where the use of AI can help tremendously. Manufacturing, healthcare, education, transport: every vertical gains from the use of AI. An enterprise needs to have an understanding of the timeline of the solution, resources allocated for it, financial implications and the fact that AI doesn’t always have a tangible Return on Investment in the short term.The results can often point to long-term advantages. AI can give results, there is a timeline of training the solution to be able to derive actionable insights. The learning curve is often steep.Natural Language Processing is another roadblock as the availability of NLP in any Indian language is scarce. Indian English contains words spoken colloquially and often has a mix of some words in people’s mother tongue. AI needs to train systems on the variety of colloquial terms used in Indian English.Going by the success of HDFC Bank’s chatbot, OnChat, the feat is not impossible to pull off. OnChat can effectively process a mix of Hindi and English and converse with customers to transact for bill payments, mobile recharges, booking travel etc. It has also garnered 160 percent month on month growth, garnering 2.4 million messages. Start-ups can provide better solutions for AI projectsIndia has a great scope for start-ups that work in the AI space. Due to the small size of a team of dedicated resources involved with a project, there is better coordination between the UI/UX designers, architects, developers, data scientists and the client. A smaller team also means shorter turn-around time for agile requirements of the client. Feedback can be incorporated faster into the solution. Smaller teams lead to ownership among team members who are aware of the bigger picture and their contribution to it. The absence of a defined protocol and time-taking processes leads to a fluid work environment where the client can work closely with the team working on the AI solution. InnovateThere are many start-ups in India creating chat-bots, financial solutions and medical scan solutions. But what will really give Indian companies an edge is their ability to find out AI solutions specifically suited to solve in-house problems.A NLP chatbot can bridge the language gap between the English knowing and non-English knowing population of India by having multi-language support. Using AI to recognise handwriting across different languages in India will simplify data entry and help in creating a clean data lake. Currently, most websites support the Roman keyboard, alienating millions of Indians from using the internet. Native language support on the rail bookings app will save the time and energy wasted in traveling to a railway station to book tickets.AI can create a transparent system and bring on a revolution in agriculture. Providing real time selling price of crop across nearest markets, cost-analysis of transport to farther markets, prediction for market rates in coming weeks and months, route-map for nearby storage units can all be fed into a centralised system and provided to farmers. Peer to peer discussions, best practices, weather updates, tractor rentals - there is a lot that an AI enabled solution made for India can achieve.The start-ups in India are fully aware of the shortcomings and work with it to evolve AI solutions that are India ready.Take that AI enabled leap of faithIndia is a developing nation where we are still struggling with poverty and providing food and shelter and fulfilling basic needs of being a human being. But, in prioritizing food and shelter, we haven’t put our dreams on hold.The question is, are we, as a country, ready for AI?The answer is a complex, ‘we don’t know’. But we are not going to find out, unless we go ahead and do it anyway.

",,,"Revolutions do not always follow a linear timeline. They can be sporadic and unpredictable. NITI Aayog’s roadmap for national Artificial Intelligence programme hopes to bring one such revolution.The allocated Rs 3,073 crore will spearhead work on fifth generation technology startups like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing and Blockchain.The magnanimity of effort can be gauged by the near doubling of the fund for the programme. Atal Innovation Mission can give Rs 10 crore to start-ups that fit the criteria. In all, Rs 200 crore has been allocated in 2017-18. India is ready to take the AI-assisted leap of faith, with pre-meditated outcomes for before, during and after the leap.The oncoming revolution has to go through mountains of paperwork, maze of data silos, and murky data lakes before any form of AI can begin to make sense of the haphazardness that is India. Let’s tackle some important questions when it comes to these futuristic technologies.WHERE DO WE STAND NOW?The next generation of technology is seeing exponential growth. The overall picture is blurry though, due to the extremes we need to be navigating.

Will artificial intelligence and robots relieve us of humdrum tasks, making our working lives easier, or will they take our jobs away altogether? As part of a new series called the Future of Work, we look at the growing popularity of ""daigou"" - Chinese expats who buy consumer goods for people back home in China.Sandra Lee describes herself as part of a ""global phenomenon"".A 37-year-old Chinese expat who lives in Central Coast, Australia, she makes money by selling Australian goods to people back in China.Connecting with buyers via Chinese social messaging app WeChat, Ms Lee purchases items from Australian supermarkets and other retailers on their behalf, and then posts them to China.An overseas personal shopper, she is known in China as a daigou, and Ms Lee is far from alone. More than a million people globally are now working as daigou, according to some estimates.Commentators say this booming trade was born as a result of mistrust in the authenticity of products sold in China. In particular, they point to the spate of scandals involving tainted or fake baby formula milk over the last decade.Getty ImagesThere are now an estimated one million daigou around the worldIn one of the worst cases, at least six babies died back in 2008, and tens of thousands became sick, after their formula milk was found to contain melamine, a toxic compound.As a result, many people from Chinese cities greatly prefer to buy foreign brands, which have preferably been bought overseas.At a basic level, a daigou makes his or her money by charging a small fee to the people buying the products. But there are now those who have grown their businesses into mini empires.Future of WorkBBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.Staying one step ahead of the cyber-spiesIs cryonics the key to immortality?How to cope when the bots take your jobWhy Finland is experimenting with 'free money'More Future of Work storiesMs Lee, who juggles her daigou work with being a housewife, says: ""I have lots of friends selling American products such as luxury bags.""I have friends in Germany selling knives, and my classmate who now lives in Japan sells home appliances."" She explains that the phenomenon only really took off seven years ago, and is especially appealing to Chinese expats who are struggling to learn the language of their new home.""This job doesn't require you to speak any English, as long as you sell authentic products at a reasonable price,"" she says. ""You basically sell all these products to your friends, relatives or your friends' friends. It's a trust-based business."" Getty ImagesChina's 2008 baby milk scandal is said to have greatly increased demand for products bought outside the countryToday individual daigou in Australia can make upwards of $100,000 (£72,000) a year selling Australian products to customers in China.Some daigou even use their garages as their stock warehouses, and hire several people to do their customer service.AuMake, a husband-and-wife run daigou business in Sydney, has gone even further, much further. It now has a chain of physical retail stores across the city that caters to daigou shoppers. And last year it floated on the Australian stock exchange, becoming the first daigou business to list in Australia.AuMake also now has a ""daigou hub"", a space where local companies can connect directly to individual daigous and visiting Chinese tourists.It has plans to establish hubs in other capital cities as it expands. Getty ImagesDaigous in Australia have been urged not to buy up all stocks of baby formula milkBenjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst from China Market Research, says that the daigou phenomenon has been fuelled by the development of mobile phone and payment technology.""With the ubiquity of smartphones and live streaming apps it will be easy for consumers to continue to involve themselves in the idea of 're-commerce',"" he says.""The neat thing about this is that it can give a lot of power to the re-seller. An enterprising individual, who has an audience to sell to in China, can earn a lot of money.""Although these new jobs only exist because of technology developed in mobile messaging and payments applications, the skills involved are entirely human rather than automated - at least for now.Shane Oliver, chief economist at Sydney-based investment house AMP Capital, says: ""The new jobs are mainly in sourcing and authenticating the product, something that is hard for machines to do with absolute credibility.""In fact the desire for authenticity that daigous satisfy is anti-technology.""Australia-based daigous can now apply for official certificationSome of the additional tasks carried out by daigous include answering customers' queries, live-streaming on WeChat and other social media platforms, and video posting their product evaluations.""The daigous are trusted advocates on behalf of their communities in China, and their input gives it that authenticity,"" says Jessica Bragdon, co-founder of Koala Eco, an Australian cleaning product firm that sells to daigous. ""They lend a sense of trust, and people believe in it because they are representing it.""Matt McDougall, founder of marketplace Daigousales.com, is also the president of the Australia China Daigou Association, a trade body for the sector.""We get a lot of brands coming to us asking if we can get daigous to tell them about pricing, look at their products and see if they like them,"" he says.As the industry grows in Australia, new ideas are emerging to professionalise it.A number of websites now exist to help daigous do their businessThe Australia China Daigou Association is currently drawing up a code of conduct to implement a common standard of behaviour for daigous. These include not filling supermarket trolleys full of infant formula, and not leaving marks on unpurchased products in shops. ""We are looking to improve the status of this community, and bridge relationships between Australian brands and daigou buying agents,"" says Mr McDougall. The Australian government has also recently thrown its support behind the movement, recognising the job-creating potential this grey industry brings. It sent federal and state ministers to cheer the launch of the newly-formed association. However the way ahead for this new economy may not be all smooth-sailing. Professor Hans Hendrischke from the University of Sydney's Business School, cautions that China may start regulating the daigou sector, which might mean that big players will evolve and push out the smaller ones. Sandra Lee though is far more optimistic about the prospects for her job. ""The association gives you a certificate with your name on it,"" she says. ""It makes you feel like you're not doing something under the table anymore.""You start to consider this as a career and being recognised as a profession, doing something that is helping the Australian economy and also helping your friends and relatives at home to save money and get good products.""Illustration by Karen Charmaine Chanakira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study by researchers at Sweden’s prestigious Stockholm School of Economics (SSE), which looks ahead at the likely impact of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics on people’s lives, should calm the nerves of economic planners and private citizens.
The SSE study The substitution of labour concluded that the introduction of automation technologies will be gradual, and the long-term potential for society is job creation rather than job losses.
The study took the fundamental view that the potential to automate non-routine tasks is likely to remain limited.
This is the fifth report produced under the SSE’s three-year research project, “The internet and its direct and indirect effects on innovation and the Swedish economy”. The project is being funded by Sweden’s Internet Foundation, Internetstiftelsen i Sverige.
At its core, the SSE report investigated the potential long-term impact of AI, machine learning and robotics technologies in the general area of labour replacement.







“We found that technology advancement is unlikely to result in mass unemployment,” said Jochem van der Zande, one of the four researchers behind the SSE study. “It will, rather, lead to more intense collaboration between humans and machines in a way that will change the focus of human labour.”
The study included an impact assessment of new technologies and their likely influence on the Swedish economy. It concluded that although change will be pervade business and industry, influencing how organisations and their employees function, the automation of individual activities is unlikely to displace the majority of working roles and functions that are in place today.
In its own planning strategies for the economy, the Swedish government sees benefits in the ever-changing nature of jobs within increasingly technology-driven workplaces. There is an acceptance that more routine tasks will be replaced by machines, but there is a basic belief that, in the future, humans will work more closely with machines rather than be replaced by them.
“We should not be too afraid of change,” said Ylva Johansson, minister of employment and integration. “Some old jobs will disappear, but new jobs will emerge. Ask any union leader in Sweden if they are fearful of change and the universal response will be a solid ‘no’. Union bosses are less fearful of new methods than they are about old technologies.”
The SSE study identified equipment manufacturing, transportation, high-street retail, warehousing and the wholesale trade as the sectors most likely to replace human workers with AI and robotic automation.

Technical challenges remain
But significant technical challenges to mass automation remain unsolved, according to the SSE study. Computers may well be better at fast-tracking tasks, such as retrieving information from databases, but they lack the capacity and sophistication to compete with human creative intelligence.
Computers also fall short in the routine production of ideas and conceptual thinking. Also, humans perform better in familiar noise-rich working environments, such as manufacturing halls, restaurants and airports.
Machines also lack social and emotional capabilities, although advances in AI and machine learning suggest that gap is narrowing. The SSE researchers said that, based on the current rate of technological progress, many elements of the social and emotional capabilities gap could be effectively eliminated in 20 to 30 years’ time.  
“Creative intelligence is the key – and that is currently one of the most difficult capabilities to automate,” said the report. “To be creative, one must be able to make new combinations of familiar concepts, which requires a rich body of knowledge.”
Sweden’s unstoppable march towards the integration of AI, machine learning and robotics technologies is being fuelled by industry. Swedish companies hope that automation will provide a new dynamic tool to help them compete with goods and services produced in low-cost labour markets in Asia and Eastern Europe.
Latest figures from Sweden’s Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation show a high level of support, both in society and in business, for scaled-up use of AI and robotics. About 80% of Swedes are positive about the idea of increased use of AI and robotics, believing that a move to more computer-based functions will be good for society and the national economy in the long term.
And Sweden’s increasing engagement with AI, machine learning and robotics is not going unnoticed internationally. More Swedish firms, especially those involved in advanced commercial-scale research projects, are likely to be targeted by foreign suitors.

Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important business role for Sweden’s banks – and chatbots are the starting point for many.
The technologists building artificial intelligence algorithms should take responsibility for the technology’s impact on society, a survey finds.
Ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, the World Economic Forum warns that artificial intelligence needs strong governance.



This new trend for acquisitions became apparent when Huachangda Intelligent Equipment, a Chinese industrial robot integrator primarily servicing China’s auto industry, bought Västerås-based Robot System Products (RSP) in November 2017. RSP, which was spun off from the ABB Group in 2003, has operating units in Sweden, Germany and China and produces a range of integral products for robots, including grippers, welding equipment and tool changers.
Sweden’s main services sector also intends to use more AI, machine learning and robotics to automate routine customer-related operations. Swedbank’s increased focus on the digitisation and automation of day-to-day banking services may prove crucial to the bank’s goal of keeping its cost base below SEK17bn (€1.7bn) in 2018 and 2019. Swedbank’s digital-AI-machine learning transition and integration project began in 2016 and is led by its digital banking unit headed by Lotta Lovén.


A positive picture
Ultimately, the SSE’s report paints a positive picture of a future where machines perform more of the routine tasks currently carried out by humans. It underlines the obvious economic benefits of implementing automation, including reduced payroll costs resulting from the substitution of human labour.
The expanded use of AI, machine learning and robotics will inevitably lead to workplaces where fewer employees will be needed to achieve the same output because of increased productivity.
Other value-added advantages of automation include increased throughput and productivity, improved safety, reduced waste and higher quality. For both the private and public sectors, this will help to reduce operating and administration costs, translating into improved operating margins for business and industry.

Superhumanity
March 2018


How will the use of artificial intelligence (AI) affect the workplace and daily life? There is a pessimistic view that “AI creates social problems,” and an optimistic one that “AI solves social problems.” How we understand the impact of AI will be different depending on which perspective we take. But of course, we cannot completely separate these two views from each other, as many have mixed viewpoints, such as promoting AI while maintaining the precautionary principle.
To consider the risks of AI, we need to discuss its ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). Furthermore, we need to recognize that AI cannot be separated from conventional problems caused by information technology (IT). Of course, with AI, there are new problems, such as “Who takes responsibility for the judgments made by machines that learn by themselves?” Yet since information technology first penetrated society, issues such as privacy infringement, information leakage, addiction, and nudging have been problems. While much of the impact expected by AI shares the same problem space and contributes to its extension, it’s important to recognize that AI is currently treated as IT was in the past.
Work
Technology that is difficult for people to use or trust will not penetrate society, even if it is introduced into the workplace. When the personal computer was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, there was a debate around what kind of jobs would be left for people who could not use a personal computer. Now that we are searching the internet for work and writing documents using software, however, there are many people who cannot remember how to find what they are looking for without these technologies.
People use the technology if it is more useful to their jobs, and technology, in turn, becomes more convenient. For example, search engines used to only search text, but now they can search images, movies, voices, etc. Changes such as this largely take place without being noticed. We should also be cautious about overestimating the ability of AI. Even AI engineers themselves are worried about this. There are a lot of activities, such as driving and surgery, where even little mistakes can cause a tragedy. Trust is required, however, and we cannot entirely rely on AI. AI also makes mistake. Troubleshooting will be necessary.
Mastery

We use personal computers and mobile phones without understanding their mechanics or technical operations. AI does not always need to be understood either, but there are a few cases where a certain amount of (re)education is required. For example, driving a car. Cars equipped with automatic braking and automatic steering wheels have already begun to be sold, and largely to drivers who learned how to drive on manual cars. Even though these mechanisms are currently only designed as safety devices, accidents can and will occur if we become overly confident in the automatic capability of machines. Cases such as car automation are transitional technologies, so it is necessary to know what machines can and cannot do. It is therefore necessary to have a place and opportunities for drivers to be reeducated and learn how to drive with AI. Further down the line, automatic driving vehicles themselves might eventually educate people as to what they should and should not do while driving. That said, some people might prefer not to use the technology, or might simply be unable to. Society therefore needs to prepare a safety net, and allow there to be a choice of using AI or not.
Competition
Fordism has long subdivided work into discrete tasks. The Luddite fear that AI will take human jobs is therefore misplaced.1 For instance, the Hen-na Hotel (strange/changing hotel) in the Huis Ten Bosch theme park (Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan) is known for introducing robots to take care of reception, cleaning, concierge, and entertainment.2 Guests hardly see human employees when staying at the hotel. Cleaning is divided into tasks between rooms and corridors, which human beings share with the robots. Due to the sensitivity that guests can have to the cleanliness of their rooms, humans are responsible for their cleaning. The robot, conversely, is in charge of common areas such as corridors, which constantly need to be cleaned.3
Even if the quality of the robot’s performance improves, the task of managing and maintaining the robots remains a human job. In this sense, the concept of “cleaning” in the future may change to mean “cleaning the robot” or “issuing a cleaning instruction,” instead of clearing or removing trash with one’s own hands.4
Specification
AI is good at using machine-learning algorithms for processes of optimization and identification. When actually entering a specific workplace, however, AI will be used according to both its particular purpose and the company’s overarching management policy. While the Hen-na Hotel introduced robots to improve productivity—which has led to staff size being reduced to about one third of what it would otherwise be—the well-established luxury Kagaya Hotel in Ishikawa Prefecture introduced robots into back-of-house operations only. Previously, the hotel staff personally delivered meals to rooms, which imposed a heavy workload on the employees. By introducing an “automatic transfer system” for meals, the hotel aimed to allow employees to concentrate on responding to guests. Contrary to the robot hotel that considers robots as the main staff and humans their support, Kagaya uses robots to support the work of humans.
When introducing AI or robots into a workplace, the value that the company seeks to provide to both employees and customers needs to be considered. Only then can the specific type of AI or robot be found to fit the purpose. While there are managers and company presidents who believe that simply introducing AI or robots will improve their company’s productivity, or who want to do so because their competitors have, the tasks and values of each company vary greatly. Mimicry is not an option.
Problems
It is not just a question of what AI can do, but what humans can and should do. Attention should also be paid to the problems that are left over from earlier forms of IT, such as privacy infringement via the monitoring of one’s location for safety, security, or efficiency. And we cannot deny that the risk of overreliance on IT will—and has—become more serious with the introduction of AI.
Suffering in the workplace will continue to rise until each worker is able to say “no” to technologies that they feel are invasive or over-controlling. The role of the humanities and social sciences in this is to understand and conceptualize those uneasy and unpleasant feelings, and not to disregard them as individualistic selfishness. Problems that arise with the introduction of AI may be rooted in company structures, industry logics, social systems, or human relations. It will therefore become increasingly necessary to focus on the interaction between technology and society to discover the essence of the problem.
AI can be treated as a mirror of our society. It is deeply involved in our daily lives and work, and it questions where we place our values. In other words, AI gives us an opportunity to de- and reconstruct our values, and will lead us to creatively consider the future of our societies.

AI is driving the transformation of business and value creation in new directions.

Online Master of Information Technology 


A new breed of IT expert is getting the knowledge and skills needed to take their place in a burgeoning AI economy.
Whether it is chatbots for customer interaction, neural networks for identifying the patterns tucked in the data or machine learning for improving decision-making, artificial intelligence is driving the transformation of business and value creation in new directions. According to a 2017 study from Cowen and Company, 81 percent of IT leaders are currently investing in or planning to invest in AI.  Angel.co has counted 2,200 AI startups, half of which have emerged in the last two years. By 2019, those startups and others like them will “overtake Amazon,  Google, IBM and Microsoft in driving the [AI]  economy with disruptive business solutions,” according to Gartner.
Few people are as well-positioned as technologists to understand how artificial intelligence is changing the world. After all, IT professionals are accustomed to exploring new automation technologies with the potential for transforming how work gets done.

Most forms of automation focus on performing repetitive, menial tasks. AI’s sweet spot, on the other hand, is in automating tasks that can now be performed by algorithms using access to relevant data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, is an approach to make algorithms “smarter” as they “learn” from more examples. That’s one of the reasons why big data and AI seem to be evolving together.

“With more examples, we can get better algorithms and better prediction accuracy,” explains Kendall Giles, an assistant professor of practice in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech and a faculty member in the university’s Online Master of Information Technology program.
The use of big data and machine learning is just one of the Virginia Tech MIT course concentrations available to students. Those pursuing this degree will position themselves to be in front of a wave of professional demand, with job titles such as:
Machine learning engineer
Data scientist
Research scientist
R&D engineer

Business intelligence developer
Computer vision engineer
Demand for AI specialists
“It is really not a far stretch to claim that every IT professional today must have a working understanding of data science to be successful,” says Naren Ramakrishnan, the Thomas L. Phillips Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech and director of its Discovery Analytics Center. “Seven out of 10 organizations have already invested or plan to invest in big data,” he notes. “Every type of IT practitioner, whether systems or applications, will be impacted by these trends.”

In fact, adds Giles, “There’s a huge shortage in finding people with these skills, who know how to communicate with the computer, who understand technology and who can process data and enjoy doing that.”
According to the New York Times, AI specialists can demand compensation of between $300,000 and $500,000, including salary and company stock, with just a few years of experience. Why such sizable pay? Big companies are driving “a lot of the dollars,” Giles says. “The Googles and Microsofts are able to hire and pay big bucks.”

Virginia Tech’s Online Master of Information Technology program is offered jointly by the College of Engineering and the Pamplin College of Business. Ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the No. 2 “Best Online Graduate Computer Information Technology Programs” the past four years.

When the words “Hello world” appeared in acid green on the tiny screen of a boxy Macintosh computer, I was hooked. I remember thinking with exhilaration, “This thing will do exactly what I tell it to do!” and, only half-ironically, “Finally, someone understands me!” For a kid in the throes of puberty, used to being told what to do by adults of dubious authority, it was freeing to interact with something that hung on my every word – and let me be completely in charge.For a lot of coders, the feeling of empowerment you get from knowing exactly how a thing works – and having complete control over it – is what attracts them to the job. Artificial intelligence (AI) is producing some pretty nifty gadgets, from self-driving cars (in space!) to automated medical diagnoses. The product I’m most looking forward to is real-time translation of spoken language, so I’ll never again make gaffes such as telling a child I’ve just met that I’m their parent or announcing to a room full of people that I’m going to change my clothes in December.But it’s starting to feel as though we’re losing control.These days, most of my interactions with AI consist of shouting, “No, Siri! I said Paris, not bratwurst!” And when my computer does completely understand me, it no longer feels empowering. The targeted ads about early menopause and career counselling hit just a little too close to home, and my Fitbit seems like a creepy Santa Claus who knows when I am sleeping, knows when I’m awake and knows if I’ve been bad or good at sticking to my exercise regimen.Algorithms tracking our every step and keystroke expose us to dangers much more serious than impulsively buying wrinkle cream. Increasingly polarized and radicalized political movements, leaked health data and the manipulation of elections using harvested Facebook profiles are among the documented outcomes of the mass deployment of AI. Something as seemingly innocent as sharing your jogging routes online can reveal military secrets. These cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Even our beloved Canadian Tire money is being repurposed as a surveillance tool for a machine-learning team.Open this photo in gallery:The continuum of creepiness between a Fitbit, above, and 2001: A Space Odyssey's mad computer Hal 9000 may not be as wide as we imagine.MGM/PhotofestFor years, science-fiction writers have spelled out both the technological marvels and the doomsday scenarios that might result from intelligent technology that understands us perfectly and does exactly what we tell it to do. But only recently has the inevitability of tricorders, robocops and constant surveillance become obvious to the non-fan general public. Stories about AI now appear in the daily news, and these stories seem to be evenly split between hyperbolically self-congratulatory pieces by people in the AI world, about how deep learning is poised to solve every problem from the housing crisis to the flu, and doom-and-gloom predictions of cultural commentators who say robots will soon enslave us all. Alexa’s creepy midnight cackling is just the latest warning sign.Which side should we believe? As someone who has played for both teams, my answer is that there are indeed genuine risks we ought to be very worried about, but the most serious risks are not the ones getting the most attention. There are also things we can do to make sure AI is developed in ways that benefit society, but many of the current efforts to address the risk that AI will run amok are misdirected.One scenario I don’t think we need to worry about is the one in which robots become conscious (whatever that means) and decide to kill us. For one thing, conscious robots are still far off. For another, consciousness doesn’t lead directly to murder – it’s a non sequitur. Another scenario I find far-fetched is the one in which a computer tasked with maximizing profits for a paperclip company ends up turning all the resources on the planet (and beyond) into paperclips. Sure, it’s possible, but not very probable. We should be able to switch off that malfunctioning HAL 9000. One thing we should be very concerned about, however, are weaponized drones. Automated killing machines are not going to make our lives better, period.The other serious risk is something I call nerd-sightedness: the inability to see value beyond one’s own inner circle. There’s a tendency in the computer-science world to build first, fix later, while avoiding outside guidance during the design and production of new technology. Both the people working in AI and the people holding the purse strings need to start taking the social and ethical implications of their work much more seriously.In medicine and engineering, there are codes of conduct that professionals are expected to follow. The idea that scientists bear some responsibility for the technologies their work makes possible is also well established in nuclear physics and genetics, even though scientists don’t make the final decision to push the red button or genetically engineer red-headed babies. In the behavioral sciences, there are research-ethics boards that weigh the possible harms to participants in proposed experiments against the benefits to the population. Studies whose results are expected to cause societal harm don’t get approved. In computer science, ethics is optional.Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, which turned 200 this year, is perhaps the most famous warning to scientists not to abdicate responsibility for their creations. Victor Frankenstein literally runs away after seeing the ugliness of his creation, and it is this act of abandonment that leads to the creature’s vengeful, murderous rampage. Frankenstein begins with the same lofty goal as AI researchers currently applying their methods to medicine: “What glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!” In a line dripping with dramatic irony, Frankenstein’s mentor assures him that “the labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” Shelley knew how dangerous this egotistical attitude could be.But the nerd-sighted geniuses of our day make the same mistake. If you ask a coder what should be done to make sure AI does no evil, you’re likely to get one of two answers, neither of which is reassuring. Answer No. 1: “That’s not my problem. I just build it,” as exemplified recently by a Harvard computer scientist who said, “I’m just an engineer” when asked how a predictive policing tool he developed could be misused. Answer No. 2: “Trust me. I’m smart enough to get it right.” AI researchers are a smart bunch, but they have a terrible track record of avoiding ethical blunders. Some of the better-known goof-ups include Google images tagging black people as gorillas, chat bots that turn into Nazis and racist soap dispensers. The consequences can be much more serious when biased algorithms are in charge of deciding who should be approved for a bank loan, who to hire or admit to university or whether to kill a suspect in a police chase.Open this photo in gallery:Tay, a chatbot designed by Microsoft, was introduced in 2016 as an experiment to teach an AI how to hold conversations with people. Within 24 hours, Twitter users had taught it to say racist and misogynist things. Microsoft quickly closed off the bot to the public.TwitterThere is a growing movement within AI to do better. For the first time, this past December, one of the top AI conferences, NIPS, featured a keynote about bias in AI. The New York Times recently reported that top computer-science schools such as MIT and Stanford are rushing to roll out ethics courses in response to a newfound awareness that the build-it-first, fix-it-later ethos isn’t cutting it.In fact, such courses have existed for a long time. The University of Toronto’s computer-science program has a computers and society course, which includes a few weeks of ethics. Philosophy departments and, where they exist, interdisciplinary departments such as science and technology studies, history and philosophy of science and media studies also routinely offer courses covering the social and ethical implications of technology. Unfortunately, these courses are rarely required for computer-science degrees, so most graduates don’t get any ethics training at all. I’m currently teaching a course about the social and ethical implications of AI in health care – to about a dozen students.That’s what may be changing. When I contacted François Pitt, the undergraduate co-ordinator of U of T’s computer science department, he said the issue of ethics training had come up four or five times just that week. Steve Easterbrook, the professor in charge of the computers and society course, agrees that there needs to be more ethics training, noting that moral reasoning in computer-science students has been shown to be “much less mature than students from most other disciplines.” Instead of one course on ethics, he says “it ought to be infused across the curriculum, so that all students are continually exposed to it.” Prof. Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill agrees, commenting on Twitter, “You have to integrate ethics into the computer science curriculum from the first moment you teach students here’s a variable, here’s an array, and look, we can sort things. When you run your first qsort, [a standard sorting algorithm encountered in computer-science 101 courses], you’ve encountered ethical and ontological questions.”Open this photo in gallery:It remains to be seen how computer-science departments can pull off that sort of sweeping curriculum change, given that many of their faculty have just as little ethics training as their students. Philosophy departments regularly face the frustration of having the expertise to teach applied ethics courses, only to have those courses get poached by law, medicine and engineering departments, which require their students to take in-house ethics courses that are often taught by non-experts. Hopefully, computer-science departments expanding their ethics offerings will see the need to hire trained ethicists to design and teach the courses. Frankly, opportunities for philosophers to make themselves useful are rare enough that we shouldn’t pass them over in cases where their training has real value.Another kind of effort at fixing AI’s ethics problem is the proliferation of crowdsourced ethics projects, which have the commendable goal of a more democratic approach to science. One example is DJ Patil’s Code of Ethics for Data Science, which invites the data-science community to contribute ideas but doesn’t build up from the decades of work already done by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science. Then there’s MIT’s Moral Machine project, which asks the public to vote on questions such as whether a self-driving car with brake failure ought to run over five homeless people rather than one female doctor. Philosophers call these “trolley problems” and have published thousands of books and papers on the topic over the past half-century. Comparing the views of professional philosophers with those of the general public can be eye-opening, as experimental philosophy has repeatedly shown, but simply ignoring the experts and taking a vote instead is irresponsible.The point of making AI more ethical is so it won’t reproduce the prejudices of random jerks on the internet. Community participation throughout the design process of new AI tools is a good idea, but let’s not do it by having trolls decide ethical questions. Instead, representatives from the populations affected by technological change should be consulted about what outcomes they value most, what needs the technology should address and whether proposed designs would be usable given the resources available. Input from residents of heavily policed neighbourhoods would have revealed that a predictive policing system trained on historical data would exacerbate racial profiling. Having a person of colour on the design team for that soap dispenser should have made it obvious that a peachy skin tone detector wouldn’t work for everyone. Anyone who has had a stalker is sure to notice the potential abuses of selfie drones. Diversifying the pool of talent in AI is part of the solution, but AI also needs outside help from experts in other fields, more public consultation and stronger government oversight.Open this photo in gallery:Elderly people play with a robot named NAO, manufactured by Softbank Robotics, in their retirement home in Bordeaux, France.REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERSAnother recent article in The New York Times claimed that “academics have been asleep at the wheel,” leaving policy makers who are struggling to figure out how to regulate AI at the mercy of industry lobbyists. The article set off a Twitter storm of replies from philosophers, historians and sociologists of science, angry that their decades of underfunded work is again being ignored and erased. Like the Whos down in Whoville, they cried out in fear, “We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!” If policy makers and funding sources listen closely to those voices, there are solutions being offered. The article concludes that we “urgently need an academic institute focused on algorithmic accountability.” On Twitter, the article’s author, Cathy O’Neil, insisted, “There should be many many more tenure lines devoted to it.” Those both sound like solid ideas.How does this play out in the Canadian context? The federal government recently earmarked $125-million for a Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy – with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in charge – and three new research institutes in Edmonton, Toronto and Montreal. One of the goals is to “develop global thought leadership on the economic, ethical, policy and legal implications of advances in artificial intelligence.”There are promising signs already. An International Scientific Advisory Committee on AI Strategy was recently announced and includes a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, which has a mission to safeguard life against technological challenges. CIFAR just launched an AI and society program featuring workshops and publications designed to stimulate discussion and guide policy makers on the ethical, legal, economic and policy issues AI presents for society. The Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute so far focuses on industry partnerships, while Toronto’s Vector Institute has particular strengths in deep learning and medical applications of AI. Vector Institute research director Richard Zemel has a growing side project in algorithmic fairness and has been making connections with legal scholars and researchers from the University of Toronto’s Centre for Ethics. Another group is studying AI and safety. Prof. Zemel promises that bringing in social scientists, ethicists and policy analysts is something he is “determined to do.”The Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) has taken several concrete steps toward addressing AI’s ethical challenges, including offering diversity scholarships, hosting an interdisciplinary forum on the socially responsible development of AI and announcing the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of AI. Although this too is a crowdsourced ethical code, there’s a key difference: Philosophers, social scientists and policy analysts were involved in its inception and will oversee the final document.What’s still lacking is investment in jobs dedicated to the social, ethical and policy implications of AI. The Vector Institute is hiring research scientists and postdocs, and MILA is hiring interns, postdocs and professors, but in each case, expertise in machine learning is the main job qualification. CIFAR’s AI and society workshops propose to bring together “interdisciplinary teams to explore emerging questions about how AI could affect the world,” but there are precious few jobs in Canada (or elsewhere) for people who study AI’s effects from the perspective of the humanities and social sciences. Alongside the creation of new tenure lines and graduate degrees in AI, we need to invest in training and employing experts in the social, ethical and policy implications of AI if we’re to have a hope of predicting and preventing dangerous outcomes.Open this photo in gallery:Sophia, a robot with Saudi Arabian citizenship, interacts at an innovation fair in Kathmandu. As the technical achievements of robotics and AI advance, there are few jobs to study artificial intelligence from a humanities or social-science perspective.NAVESH CHITRAKARA recent CIFAR event illustrates what’s still missing in the strategy. The workshop brought together AI and health researchers for a joint project to develop systems to do things such as predict flu outbreaks. Sounds good, but work by philosophers of science has shown that putting people in the same boardroom is not enough to make interdisciplinary projects work. Researchers in different fields use different vocabularies, concepts and methods – and may have conflicting goals. Words such as “bias,” “naive,” “ontology,” “regression” and “supervised” have technical meanings in AI that are very different than their usual meanings. Having a translator of sorts at the table to integrate across disciplines is essential to avoid potentially costly misunderstandings. That means inviting philosophers, sociologists and historians of science to the table.Fahad Razak, an internist at St. Michael’s Hospital and an assistant professor of health policy, management and evaluation at the University of Toronto, describes facing just this kind of challenge applying AI methods in his research. The Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute’s General Medicine Inpatient Initiative at St. Mike’s applies machine learning to health-care data with the aim of improving treatment, especially for patients with multiple concurrent diagnoses. One of the main challenges with health-care data sets, according to Prof. Razak, is “a data-quality problem, both with data being inaccurate or poorly coded, but also often because of the lack of lots of relevant data.” Socioeconomic status and the ability to function without assistance at home are two examples of important data that is often missing. But, he says, computer scientists don’t realize how messy and gappy the data is, and because of the hype around AI, health researchers “believe that AI methods are so miraculous, they just work despite data quality problems!”If every computer-science student were taught to look for social and ethical problems as soon as they learn about variables, arrays and sorting, as Prof. Tufekci suggests, they would realize that the way health data is coded matters very much. For example, recording age as a range, such as under 19, 19-24, 25-35, may seem harmless, but whether a patient is 1 or 17 can make a big difference to their health-care needs. An algorithm that doesn’t take that into account could make fatal mistakes – for example, by suggesting the wrong dosage. Likewise, since income is usually missing from health data sets, an algorithm could draw false conclusions about how to prevent diabetes or premature births.These are just a small sample of the mistakes we need to prevent. The current generation of AI researchers (with a few exceptions) do not have the training necessary to deal with the implications of the AI they are building. So far, the experts who do have that training are not being hired to help. That needs to change – or the darkest of science fiction will become reality.Open this photo in gallery:Universal Studios Home Entertainment/Associated PressSign up for the Opinion Newsletter.Keep your opinions sharp and informed with a helpful summary of The Globe’s most provocative columns, covering politics, world affairs, business, arts, health and the way we liveRegister to sign upExplore newsletters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.l-article'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Globe and Mail'}",,,,,,,4.0

They were shooting a powder-blue 1962 Austin Mini, but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the DeLorean from “Back to the Future.”Stepping back from the camera, Mr. Avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as “Project Unemployment.” The film was a way of testing new technology from a start-up called Arraiy, which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies, television and games.ImageTesting Arraiy’s technology at the company’s offices in Palo Alto, Calif. “This is no joke; it will put people out of work,” said a filmmaker who also runs a visual effects house.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesThis new type of artificial intelligence, which is also being developed by the software giant Adobe and in other technology industry research labs, could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“This is no joke; it will put people out of work,” said Mr. Avalos, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who also runs a visual effects house. “The artists are safe. But it will replace all the drudgery.”Over the past three decades, computer-generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made. But building digital effects is still a painstaking and enormously tedious process. For every second of movie time, armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage, digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible.ImageOne of the main ways Arraiy engineers train their artificial intelligence software is by photographing objects in a controlled environment and allowing the algorithm to practice separating the foreground from the background.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesArraiy (pronounced “array”) is building systems that can handle at least part of this process. The company’s founders, Gary Bradski and Ethan Rublee, also created Industrial Perception, one of several robotics start-ups snapped up by Google several years ago.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Filmmakers can do this stuff, but they have to do it by hand,” said Mr. Bradski, a neuroscientist and computer vision specialist with a long history in Silicon Valley. He has worked with companies as varied as the chip maker Intel and the augmented reality start-up Magic Leap.Backed by more than $10 million in financing from the Silicon Valley venture firm Lux Capital, SoftBank Ventures and others, Arraiy is part of a widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own.ImageWesley Chaney, an Arraiy engineer, shows off an application that enables so-called green screen footage to be processed quickly.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesThanks to improvements in so-called neural networks — complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data — these systems can edit noise and mistakes out of images or apply simple effects and create highly realistic images of very fake people or help graft one person’s head onto the body of someone else.Inside Arraiy’s offices — the old auto body shop — Mr. Bradski and Mr. Rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses. That includes systems that learn to “rotoscope” raw camera footage, carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdobe, which makes many of the software tools used by today’s designers, is also exploring so-called machine learning that can automate similar tasks.ImageUnique “tackers” used to calibrate camera lenses with the A.I. software are placed within a scene being filmed at Arraiy.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesAt Industrial Perception, Mr. Rublee helped develop computer vision for robots designed to perform tasks like loading and unloading freight trucks. Not long after Google acquired the start-up, work on neural networks took off inside the tech giant. In about two weeks, a team of Google researchers “trained” a neural network that outperformed technology from the start-up that had taken years to create.Mr. Rublee and Mr. Bradski collected a decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses, which they declined to identify. And they are adding their own work to the collection. After filming people, mannequins and other objects in front of a classic “green screen,” for example, company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection. Once the algorithm is trained, it can rotoscope images without help from a green screen.The technology still has flaws, and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work. But it is improving.ImagePreparing a set for filming, and for testing Arraiy’s technology.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times“These methods are still rough around the edges — there is still a long tail of things that can go wrong in unpredictable ways — but there aren’t any fundamental roadblocks,” said Phillip Isola, a computer vision researcher at M.I.T. and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab created by Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and others.Mr. Avalos thinks this work could ultimately supplant work done by his own effects house. But he is comfortable with that. He already farms out many of the more tedious tasks, via the internet, to workers in other countries.As hardware improves, these methods will help generate preliminary effects right on the movie set, giving filmmakers a better idea of what the finished product will look like, Mr. Bradski said. The Mill, an effects house based in London, recently used Arraiy’s technology to create a system that could instantly apply effects that change the look of an automobile.If tech companies can help automate some of the grunt work involved in creating special effects, creative people will have a chance to try new things, said Pasha Shapiro, a filmmaker and special effects artist who has also worked with Arraiy.“Some work is so tedious that it is not practical,” he said. “That is where technology can help even more.”Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.

Software Engineers Really Excited About Artificial Intelligence, ML

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning are shaping up to dominate the tech industry in coming years, and software developers are eager to work with them. This according to a new study from Digital Ocean, which queried tech professionals on a variety of topics. Notably, 81 percent say they are “interested in learning about” or trying A.I. and/or Machine Learning (ML) tech this year. Good thing there are lots of educational resources out there for that! When asked what advancements they were most interested in, developers and software engineers gave a mixed-bag response, though most were interested in automation. Here’s how it shapes up: 
 Digital Ocean’s data is close to Stack Overflow’s Developer Survey, which notes 40.8 percent of developers voiced a desire to increase automation in their daily routines. Similarly, 19.8 percent of developers in Stack Overflow’s survey say they felt artificial intelligence was “dangerous”... which is almost the exact same figure who show no interest in artificial intelligence via Digital Ocean’s survey. Specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning can greatly boost software engineers' take-home pay, which is one of the reasons they're excited about it. Salaries for software engineers are already high: At Google's L7 level (i.e., senior staff software engineer), annual salary can top $256,059 per year, coupled with $286,176 in stock options and a bonus of $83,294. With the right background in A.I. and ML, though, payouts can spiral into the millions; at Google, self-driving experts were paid so much that they basically started to retire. Compare Google’s data to Microsoft, where engineers who hit level 67 (i.e., principal software development engineer, and roughly equivalent to Google’s L7) are paid roughly $222,714 in salary, along with $226,000 per year in stock options, and a bonus of $73,143. A.I. and ML skills will make that go even higher. Consumers are already using A.I. with aplomb. Though the use-cases for digital home assistants are limited, customers enjoy them. A recent Gallup poll shows 85 percent of customers claim to be using at least one device or program with A.I. baked in. Around 81 percent of developers interested in A.I. and ML has another important angle: it’s a sharp increase from the last time Digital Ocean asked devs how they feel. These ‘Currents’ surveys are released quarterly, with the last coming in December of 2017. At that time, 73 percent of devs were interested in A.I. Artificial Intelligence is also seeing a boom in job growth. Canadian startup Element AI examined LinkedIn data and found a potential six-digit deficit in A.I. researcher positions. Dice’s own Salary Survey shows skills related to artificial intelligence (such as Python) are lucrative, and incomes are gaining steam. It’s also worth noting Digital Ocean’s data points to A.I. efforts coming from outside academia or big companies like Google or Apple. 32 percent of respondents work at companies with less than six employees, and 54 percent had a total headcount of 25 or fewer. Only 15 percent came from companies with 1,000 or more employees; the same percentage as those with over 100 employees.

This year, AI grabbed hold of the Swiss outpost and supercharged the conversation with a palpable shift in tone. In just one day, more than 20 news dispatches about AI came out of Davos in Bloomberg alone.It’s not hard to understand our AI obsession: For years, many of Silicon Valley’s highest-profile leaders, from Elon Musk and Marc Benioff to Bill Gates, have issued warnings about coming waves of automation, saying that they could threaten our jobs and ways of life.This year’s World Economic Forum gathering in Davos included some of that alarmism. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, reiterated his own prediction that AI and robots aren’t only going to take a lot of jobs, they’re also going to start World War III.But Ma’s comments felt out of date this year.Instead of imagining a future of robot overlords, the vast majority of Davos attendees with whom I spoke or heard commentary from instead said they now envision AI augmenting our strengths, not replacing them. Think Iron Man, not Terminator.However, outside of Davos, Ma’s–or, for that matter, Musk’s or Steve Wozniak’s–alarmism is still all too common when it comes to predicting the future of work. And that’s not a good thing. Fearmongering threatens to create the dismal future we all seek to avoid. Envisioning negative outcomes can help us better prepare for the future, but can also pave the path to them. Simply put, we can’t let our anxieties become self-fulfilling prophecies.Related: How Demographics, Automation, And Inequality Will Shape The Next DecadeTo get a sense of the extent to which fear of AI has crept into our psyches, consider the results of Pew Research Center’s survey last fall.When it comes to advancing automation of jobs, Americans are almost twice as anxious as they are excited. Among U.S. adults, 72% say they’re worried “about a future in which robots and computers are capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans,” according to Pew.Gallup’s latest polls on AI, released in January, show that many Americans “remain largely positive about the impact the new technology will have on their lives and work over the next decade.” At the same time, three in four Americans believe that AI will destroy more jobs than it creates.These are depressing statistics because they’re self-reinforcing. If more and more people expect robots will take over their jobs, what incentive do they have to invest in new skills? Won’t their next job be automated, too? Without answers to those questions, how does a worker even go about deciding what new skill to learn?But if, instead, we envision positive potential outcomes, we can plan accordingly by discussing how to best point ourselves in their direction. Fortunately, new research gives us a practical guide to think seriously about future-of-work solutions and, by helping foster constructive conversation, also provides some relief from the anxiety all this fearmongering creates.[Photo: courtesy of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Wikimedia Commons]Lost, FoundIn collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group, a January WEF report, “Towards a Reskilling Revolution,” set out to create a “building block for workers looking to find their place in the future of work and for business leaders and governments looking to build more prosperous companies and productive economies and societies.” Using the United States labor market, it looks at the jobs most likely to disappear next as a result of technological change, and then examines the practical job options for the displaced.No one knows how fast artificial intelligence will advance, and without knowing that, it’s impossible to say how many jobs will truly be lost. An OECD study from 2016 estimated that 9% of jobs are threatened by automation while another study says 50%.The WEF/Boston Consulting Group report shows that the number of jobs lost might not actually matter very much. Why? Because it finds that the skills used to perform the jobs most currently at risk of being automated will help these workers transition to new careers less at risk of automation.advertisementAs I’ve argued before, work is not a fixed pie that machines are eating a bigger and bigger piece of while humans get less and less. New technologies create new jobs, too. Cars killed off the horse and buggy, but replaced it with a giant auto industry. In the 1980s and ’90s, as banks began installing ATMs everywhere, people assumed bank tellers would lose their jobs, but that’s not what happened. Banks used the savings they reaped from labor-saving tech to open more banks and change the job of a teller to be more of a customer service rep, and today banks employ more tellers than they did in 1980.Of course, we can’t expect displaced coal miners to all become software engineers. So what skills will translate to new jobs?Turns out, a lot.The U.S. government’s Department of Labor predicts that 1.4 million workers currently employed will be displaced by technological disruption by 2026. But when the WEF studied Labor Department data, its analysis found “good-fit” job transitions for 96% of those 1.4 million workers.Office clerks might be replaced. But the WEF report says their skills could translate well to being a customer service rep. And software might displace legal secretaries, but the report says their skills make them a good fit to be paralegals.[Photo: Rawpixel.com]From Fear To ActionWhile few countries have taken action in this area, there are some national examples showing what’s possible.Singapore has launched a lifelong learning initiative that’s focused on developing future-oriented skills that can help enhance workers’ productivity. The WEF has also praised the apprenticeship and vocational training programs of Germany and Switzerland. Germany’s Educational Vocation Act, for example, provides 500,000 Germans with two to three years of classroom instruction combined with paid on-the-job apprenticeships.Unfortunately, the United States hasn’t yet taken the lead. There are no national plans to tackle the issue. And while a lot of discussion is developing around the idea of a universal basic income, that is a distraction, not a solution. Education and training are what matter, and solutions addressing them are most urgent.Related: These Two Silicon Valley Pizza Places Show The Challenges Posed By Automation And Inequality Just last week, for instance, AT&T announced a billion-dollar retraining initiative. The company has one of the largest workforces in the world and, when research showed only half its employees had the STEM skills they needed, it decided to take action. According to Bill Blase, senior vice president of human resources at AT&T, the company chose to “try to reskill our existing workforce so they could be competent in the technology and the skills required to run the business going forward.”While AT&T’s move is promising, I still know of no public-private partnerships like Germany’s or Switzerland’s to train the 1.4 million workers that U.S. government’s own analysis predicts will be displaced within eight years. As it stands, the U.S. spends less on vocational training as a percentage of its GDP than almost every other country in the developed world.But that can change. We must enter the next wave of automation prepared, because we can either build the future we want, or be changed by it. First, though, we have to change our conversations themselves, from less anxious predictions to more discussion of how to work toward positive outcomes.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards before the final deadline, July 12.Sign up for Next Big Things in Tech Awards notifications here.

Facebook escalates AI talent wars, makes key hire from Paul Allen’s AI2 in push to grow Seattle team

Facebook has made a high-profile hire as part of a plan to expand its AI research team in Seattle — adding to an already-fierce competition for talent in the artificial intelligence field.
The social network has signed up Luke Zettlemoyer, a computer science professor at the University of Washington who was most recently a senior research manager at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2.
Zettlemoyer is considered a rising star in the AI field, and was among the researchers featured last November in a New York Times article about the bidding war for artificial intelligence talent. He left AI2 last week and began at Facebook this week. His move comes as the Allen Institute, created by Paul Allen, looks to ramp up its own hiring in a tight market for AI talent with help from an additional $125 million in funding from the Microsoft co-founder.
Facebook spokesman Ari Entin said Zettlemoyer will be working with the company’s Seattle-based computational photography team, which was formed in 2015 and is led by Microsoft veteran Rick Szeliski. But Entin added that Zettlemoyer will report to Menlo Park, Calif., under the broader aegis of Facebook AI Research, also known as FAIR.

Zettlemoyer, who led the AllenNLP natural language processing project as part of his AI2 work, is expected to continue working part-time as a UW professor while at Facebook. In November’s New York Times article, Zettlemoyer cited his desire to continue teaching as a reason for turning down an earlier job offer from Google.
His hiring by Facebook is part of a broader initiative targeting AI as a “very significant investment area,” Entin told GeekWire.
“We’re going to continue to recruit and build up our presence in Seattle,” he said. “Luke isn’t a single hire and we’re done.”
Facebook’s recruiting campaign sparked speculation in Seattle’s AI research community that the company would soon open full-scale FAIR labs in Seattle, but Enten played down that idea. “We have FAIR representation in that office, but it’s not a full-scale lab like Montreal, Paris, NY or Menlo Park,” he said in an email.
For what it’s worth, Facebook is looking for research interns to work with FAIR in Seattle as well in Menlo Park and New York — which serves as another indication that Facebook is raising Seattle’s profile in AI research.
Ed Lazowska, a leading computer science professor at the University of Washington, said Facebook’s hiring campaign is “one of a number of signs of Seattle’s emergence as a center of excellence in AI — specifically in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and AR/VR.”
“We have in the past attracted many companies here because of the region’s deep expertise in infrastructure engineering — in building web-scale systems,” Lazowska told GeekWire in an email. “We’re beginning to see that happening in AI, another key technology for the future.”

Facebook already has a significant presence in the Seattle area. Just this month, executives showed off the company’s new 150,000-square-foot Seattle office on Westlake Avenue, which will eventually house 900 employees. When you add in Facebook’s nearby engineering center, that provides enough capacity for close to 3,000 workers in Seattle’s core.
Facebook’s VR company, Oculus, has a separate operation in Redmond, Wash.
And when it comes to Seattle AI research, Facebook is far from alone: Initiatives in artificial intelligence are among the top priorities for local powerhouses Amazon and Microsoft. Last year, Google’s AI investment arm led a $10.5 million funding round for Seattle-based Algorithmia.
 It’s a very, very, very competitive field right now for anybody who has any expertise here, and it’s just going to grow.
AI2, which was created by Allen five years ago, has contributed to Seattle’s standing by spawning initiatives such as the Semantic Scholar search engine as well as spin-outs such as Kitt.ai (which was bought by Baidu last year) and Xnor.ai. The institute has an increasingly active incubator program for AI startups.
Last month, Allen committed $125 million to fund a new initiative at AI2 called Project Alexandria, which aims to foster “common-sense AI.” With the additional funding, AI2 is planning a significant increase in its hiring of artificial intelligence researchers.
There could be a downside to a recruiting campaign that targets institutions such as AI2 and the University of Washington’s highly regarded Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Scooping up professors and senior researchers en masse could make it tougher to train the next generation of AI developers.
Another potential downside has to do with Facebook’s image problem, highlighted by a scandal over the disastrous mishandling of personal data that was gleaned from the social network’s users. It may be a bit tougher to recruit talent when lawmakers are calling for hearings and the company’s stock is falling.
“Personally, I question whether I would be interested in working for Facebook, given what we’ve learned to date,” AI2’s CEO, Oren Etzioni, told GeekWire.
The potential upside is that all the added attention could strengthen the Seattle area’s pull as a magnet for AI talent. On that score, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., delivered a commercial message at least as enticing as Facebook’s job listings this week during an AI conference in Washington, D.C.
“I can tell you right now, if you have any kind of AI education, please head to Seattle, Washington,” she said. “The employers there are telling me it’s a very, very, very competitive field right now for anybody who has any expertise here, and it’s just going to grow.”

Meagan Metzger
Founder and CEO, Dcode
“I’ve found that tech in D.C. tends to be a very inclusive space,” Meagan Metzger, founder and CEO of the government tech accelerator Dcode told FedScoop. That said, leadership positions are still male-dominated. “It’s no secret that government and the contracting industry are still very male at the top: I’ve gone into countless meetings as the only woman in the room. As a female CEO, I’m now trying to do my part to make sure women in leadership are visible, heard, and seen as the norm in government technology.” One way to do this? Make sure there are women on panels at industry conferences. “I’m on a personal mission to make sure that there is not yet another all-male speaking lineup at major government or tech conferences,” Metzger said.
