AI-powered image generators are transforming the way we create images, and there are endless applications for the technology both in and out of business.From generating realistic images of non-existent objects to enhancing existing images, AI image generators are changing the world of art, design, and entertainment. With that said, understanding the technology behind AI image generators and how to use it can prove challenging for beginners.In this piece, we’ll provide a comprehensive guide to AI image generators, including what they are, how they work, and the different types of tools available to you. Whether you’re an artist looking to enhance the creative process or a business owner wanting to streamline your marketing efforts, this guile will provide a starting point for AI image generators.What is an AI Image Generator?An AI image generator, also known as a generative model, is an artificial intelligence system designed to create new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions. These systems use machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from large datasets of images, allowing them to generate new images that are similar in style and content to the original dataset.The main advantage of AI image generators is that they can create images without human intervention, which can save time and resources in many industries. For example, in the fashion industry, AI image generators can be used to create clothing designs or style outfits without the need for human designers. In the gaming industry, AI image generators can create realistic characters, backgrounds, and environments that would have taken months to create manually.There are different types of AI image generators, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular types of AI image generators include style transfer, which allows users to transfer the style of one image onto another, and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), which use two neural networks to generate realistic images that resemble the original dataset. Regardless of the type, AI image generators have immense potential to revolutionize how we create and consume visual content.What are the Benefits of an AI Image Generator?There are many benefits of AI image generators, such as:Time-saving: One of the most significant benefits of AI image generators is their ability to save time. Instead of spending hours or even days creating an image from scratch, AI image generators can generate high-quality images within minutes.Cost-effective: AI image generators save money by reducing the need for human designers or artists. This can be particularly beneficial for small businesses or startups with limited resources.Creativity boost: AI image generators can inspire creativity by generating unique and unexpected images that human designers may not have thought of. This can lead to new and innovative design ideas that can set a brand or product apart from the competition.Customization: AI image generators can be customized to generate images that meet specific requirements or preferences. This can be particularly useful for businesses that require images with specific branding or design elements.Scalability: AI image generators can generate a large number of images quickly and efficiently, making them ideal for creating large volumes of visual content for marketing, advertising, or other purposes.Consistency: AI image generators can create images that are consistent in style and quality, which can help establish a brand's visual identity and improve overall brand recognition.Accessibility: AI image generators can make visual content creation more accessible to people who may not have design or artistic skills. This can democratize the creative process and give more people the opportunity to create high-quality images.Versatility: AI image generators can be used across a wide range of industries and applications, from fashion and gaming to healthcare and education. This versatility makes them a valuable tool for businesses and individuals alike.How Do AI Image Generators Work?AI image generators work by using machine learning algorithms to generate new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions.In order to train the AI image generator, a large dataset of images must be used, which can include anything from paintings and photographs to 3D models and game assets. Ideally, the dataset should be diverse and representative of the images that the AI image generator will generate.The AI image generator is then trained using ML algorithms that can learn from the patterns and features present in the dataset. In training, neural networks identify and extract specific features from images, such as shapes, textures, and colors.Once the AI image generator has been trained, it can generate new images based on a set of input parameters or conditions. These parameters can include things like style, color, texture, and shape. The input parameters can be set by a user or determined by the AI image generator itself.The model uses the input parameters to generate a new image. The process involves using the ML algorithms to combine and manipulate the features learned during training to create a new image that meets the input parameters. This process of generating a new image can be repeated multiple times in an iterative process to create variations or refine the image until it meets the desired specifications.Finally, the AI image generator outputs the generated image, which can be saved, edited, or used in any way the user sees fit.To summarize, AI image generators work by using ML algorithms to learn from large datasets of images and generate new images based on input parameters. The technology behind these models is constantly evolving, and it has the potential to transform how we create and consume visual content.*When providing the input to generate new images with the model, you want to use AI prompt engineering. You can find our guide on the topic here.Limitations of AI Image GeneratorsIt’s important to note that AI image generators also have various limitations when it comes to generating images with precise details. While these tools are a powerful way to create visual content, they are not always perfect in their current form. The quality of the generated image can be heavily reliant on the pre-trained images that the model uses, meaning that if the data used to train the AI is not representative of the desired output, the generated image may not be accurate.Another one of the main challenges of AI image generators is generating realistic human faces. Creating these accurate faces is not an easy task, and image generators can often produce artificial-looking images. All of this is the result of the complex nature of human faces. To capture the various nuances, the model requires a large dataset of human faces that can prove challenging to both acquire and train on.Impacting Artists and DesignersAI image generators are having a big impact on designers and artists, and they are going to change the way these individuals operate. AI can speed up and supplement the creative process by quickly generating work, saving time, money, and resources. Artists and designers can begin with a strong idea rather than a completely blank canvas. For example, if you want to create new icons for an interface, you can input text and generate numerous ideas.With that said, many artists and designers may need to change the way they work as AI models begin to take over some of the responsibilities. Instead of spending hours on designing, they may need to work with the machine and it’s generated art. This shift will likely require a different way of thinking throughout the entire process, which is also true for various other industries impacted by AI.*To begin trying out AI image generators, check out own Best AI Art Generators page.

However, alongside the ample benefits come complications, such as disrupting existing roles, shifting skill requirements, and affecting workforce composition, according to the latest research from McLean &amp; Company, a global HR research and advisory firm. The newly published industry resource, Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI, provides insights that will help HR leaders understand the workforce planning implications of generative AI and adjust initiatives to fill the talent gap.""Generative AI has the potential to disrupt organisations by automating tasks, reshaping roles, and shifting talent requirements,"" says Lisa Highfield, principal director of Human Resources Technology &amp; Artificial Intelligence at McLean &amp; Company. ""The success of organisations in leveraging generative AI to drive organisational objectives hinges on HR to address the underlying impacts on talent.""Organisations that adopt generative AI are more likely to gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and performance, the firm's resource explains. To successfully leverage new technologies, McLean &amp; Company highlights in the blueprint that organisations must first determine how generative AI use supports the organisation's strategic objectives to discover its impact on the workforce, and in turn, the talent demand, supply, and gap.""HR can address the talent gap driven by generative AI by adjusting and developing strategic HR initiatives to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent,"" explains Highfield.To support HR leaders in the future of work, which continues to be heavily impacted by generative AI developments, McLean &amp; Company offers research insights on how to navigate the impact of AI on talent, split into two key sections in the blueprint. An overview of the research is outlined below:Section One: Understand workforce planning implicationsThe first section discusses the anticipated influence of generative AI on roles, tasks, skills, and workforce demographics. For example, roles requiring a higher degree of decision-making and problem-solving, organisational knowledge, creativity and innovation, and social and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated.The guidance and insights in section one can also help HR leaders understand the impact of generative AI on roles, how it will change the demand for technical and non-technical skills, and how generative AI may contribute to the digital divide and disproportionately affect certain populations. Section Two: Address talent gapsThe second section identifies actions HR can take to reduce talent gaps driven by generative AI and ensure the organisation has the right talent in place to meet objectives. Examples of these actions include understanding when to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent to respond to organisational needs appropriately, and determining the next steps needed to address talent gaps.Additionally, section two will support HR leaders in planning to address generative AI's impact on workforce planning initiatives and adjusting HR initiatives to plan for the talent gap driven by the new technologies.McLean &amp; Company suggests that while workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption even without a formal workforce planning process.",HRTech,https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Online Bureau', 'url': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/author/479261596/online-bureau'}, {'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'ETHRWorldSEA', 'url': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Agencies', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-106277811,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}]","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",ETHRWorldSEA,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@ethrworld.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read part one here, part two here and part three here. Across industries, there is rampant concern that generative artificial intelligence — the kind that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT — is powerful enough to take jobs from human workers. But to some degree, that trend was already underway before the popularization of gen AI.  ""A lot of financial services companies are IT shops,"" said Luke Penca, head of emerging technologies at the consultancy Capco. Goldman Sachs, for example, employed 10,000 engineers, representing 25% of its total workforce, as of 2020. ""They're always hunting for an information advantage,"" Penca said. ""They're going to process ever larger volumes of data, be more and more real-time and things like that. These are use cases that are perfect for the deployment and application of AI.""What gen AI adds to this process is its ease of working at scale. It's best at handling quantities of data that are so massive that simply throwing more people at the task won't be enough to dent it, Penca said.The technology can also be trained to handle single tasks well enough that, if a person's job is focused on that task, that job can be handled by AI. There are still caveats; customer-facing interactions may seem like low-hanging fruit, but large language models like ChatGPT can be easily manipulated (intentionally or otherwise) into giving false information, creating more customer service issues than they resolve. Nevertheless, some companies have already taken the plunge and committed to shifting certain tasks from humans to gen AI.

In what seems like the blink of an eye, mentions of artificial intelligence (AI) have become ubiquitous in the healthcare industry. 
From deep learning algorithms that can read computed tomography (CT) scans faster than humans to natural language processing (NLP) that can comb through unstructured data in electronic health records (EHRs), the applications for AI in healthcare seem endless.







But like any technology at the peak of its hype curve, artificial intelligence faces criticism from its skeptics alongside enthusiasm from die-hard evangelists.
Despite its potential to unlock new insights and streamline the way providers and patients interact with healthcare data, AI may bring considerable threats of privacy problems, ethical concerns, and medical errors.
Balancing the risks and rewards of AI in healthcare will require a collaborative effort from technology developers, regulators, end-users, and consumers.
The first step will be addressing the highly divisive discussion points commonly raised when considering the adoption of some of the most complex technologies the healthcare world has to offer.

AI WILL CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO IN HEALTHCARE
AI in healthcare will challenge the status quo as the industry adapts to new technologies. As a result, patient-provider relationships will be forever changed, and the idea that AI will change the role of human workers to some extent is worth considering.
Seventy-one percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup in 2018 believed that AI will eliminate more healthcare jobs than it creates, with just under a quarter indicating that they believe the healthcare industry will be among the first to see widespread handouts of pink slips due to the rise of machine learning tools.
However, more recent data around occupational shifts and projected job growth don’t necessarily bear this out.
A report published earlier this year by McKinsey & Co. indicates that AI could automate up to 30 percent of the hours worked by US employees by 2030, but healthcare jobs are projected to remain relatively stable, if not grow.
The report notes that health aides and wellness workers will have anywhere from 4 to 20 percent more of their work automated, and health professionals overall can expect up to 18 percent of their work to be automated by 2030.
But healthcare employment demand is expected to grow 30 percent by then, negating the potential harmful impacts of AI on the healthcare workforce.
Despite these promising projections, fears around AI and the workforce may not be entirely unfounded.
AI tools that consistently exceed human performance thresholds are constantly in the headlines, and the pace of innovation is only accelerating.
Radiologists and pathologists may be especially vulnerable, as many of the most impressive breakthroughs are happening around imaging analytics and diagnostics. 
In a 2021 report, Stanford University researchers assessed advancements in AI over the last five years to see how perceptions and technologies have changed. Researchers found evidence of growing AI use in robotics, gaming, and finance.
The technologies supporting these breakthrough capabilities are also finding a home in healthcare, and physicians are starting to be concerned that AI is about to evict them from their offices and clinics. However, providers’ perceptions of AI vary, with some cautiously optimistic about its potential.
“Recent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic pursuit to commercial projects. Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye and skin disorders, detecting cancers, and supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis,” the report stated.
“Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example, counting the number of cells dividing in cancer tissue). In other domains, however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns.”
At the same time, however, one could argue that there simply aren’t enough radiologists and pathologists — or surgeons, or primary care providers, or intensivists — to begin with. The US is facing a dangerous physician shortage, especially in rural regions, and the drought is even worse in developing countries around the world.
AI may also help alleviate the stresses of burnout that drive healthcare workers to resign. The epidemic affects the majority of physicians, not to mention nurses and other care providers, who are likely to cut their hours or take early retirements rather than continue powering through paperwork that leaves them unfulfilled.
Automating some of the routine tasks that take up a physician’s time, such as EHR documentation, administrative reporting, or even triaging CT scans, can free up humans to focus on the complicated challenges of patients with rare or serious conditions.
Most AI experts believe that this blend of human experience and digital augmentation will be the natural settling point for AI in healthcare. Each type of intelligence will bring something to the table, and both will work together to improve the delivery of care.
Some have raised concerns that clinicians may become over-reliant on these technologies as they become more common in healthcare settings, but experts emphasize that this is unlikely to occur, as automation bias isn’t a new topic in healthcare, and there are existing strategies to prevent it.
Patients also appear to believe that AI will improve healthcare in the long run, despite some concerns about the technology’s use.
A research letter published in JAMA Network Open last year that surveyed just under 1,000 respondents found that over half believed that AI would make healthcare either somewhat or much better. However, two-thirds of respondents indicated that being informed if AI played a big role in their diagnosis or treatment was very important to them.
Concerns about the use of AI in healthcare appear to vary somewhat by age, but research conducted by SurveyMonkey and Outbreaks Near Me — a collaboration between epidemiologists from Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School — shows that generally, patients prefer that important healthcare tasks, such as prescribing pain medication or diagnosing a rash, be led by a medical professional rather than an AI tool.
But whether patients and providers are comfortable with the technology or not, AI is advancing in healthcare. Many health systems are already deploying the tools across a plethora of use cases.
Michigan Medicine leveraged ambient computing – a type of AI designed to create an environment that is responsive to human behaviors – to further its clinical documentation improvement efforts in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Researchers from Mayo Clinic are taking a different AI approach: they aim to use the tech to improve organ transplant outcomes. Currently, these efforts are focused on developing AI tools that can prevent the need for a transplant, improve donor matching, increase the number of usable organs, prevent organ rejection, and bolster post-transplant care.
AI and other data analytics tools can also play a key role in population health management. A comprehensive strategy to manage population health requires that health systems utilize a combination of data integration, risk stratification, and predictive analytics tools. Care teams at Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation (PCCI) and Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas are leveraging some of these tools as part of their program to address preterm birth disparities.
Despite the potential for AI in healthcare, though, implementing the technology while protecting privacy and security is not easy.  


AI PRIVACY AND SECURITY CHALLENGES
AI in healthcare presents a whole new set of challenges around data privacy and security – challenges that are compounded by the fact that most algorithms need access to massive datasets for training and validation.
Shuffling gigabytes of data between disparate systems is uncharted territory for most healthcare organizations, and stakeholders are no longer underestimating the financial and reputational perils of a high-profile data breach.
Most organizations are advised to keep their data assets closely guarded in highly secure, HIPAA-compliant systems. In light of an epidemic of ransomware and knock-out punches from cyberattacks of all kinds, chief information security officers have every right to be reluctant to lower their drawbridges and allow data to move freely into and out of their organizations.
Storing large datasets in a single location makes that repository a very attractive target for hackers. In addition to AI’s position as an enticing target to threat actors, there is a severe need for regulations surrounding AI and how to protect patient data using these technologies.
Experts caution that ensuring healthcare data privacy will require that existing data privacy laws and regulations be updated to include information used in AI and ML systems, as these technologies can re-identify patients if data is not properly de-identified.
However, AI falls into a regulatory gray area, making it difficult to ensure that every user is bound to protect patient privacy and will face consequences for not doing so.
In addition to more traditional cyberattacks and patient privacy concerns, a 2021 study by University of Pittsburgh researchers found that cyberattacks using falsified medical images could fool AI models.
The study shed light on the concept of “adversarial attacks,” in which bad actors aim to alter images or other data points to make AI models draw incorrect conclusions. The researchers began by training a deep learning algorithm to identify cancerous and benign cases with more than 80 percent accuracy.
Then, the researchers developed a “generative adversarial network” (GAN), a computer program that generates false images by misplacing cancerous regions from negative or positive images to confuse the model.
The AI model was fooled by 69.1 percent of the falsified images. Of the 44 positive images made to look negative, the model identified 42 as negative. Of the 319 negative images doctored to look positive, the AI model classified 209 as positive.
These findings show not only how these types of adversarial attacks are possible, but also how they can cause AI models to make a wrong diagnosis, opening up the potential for major patient safety issues.
The researchers emphasized that by understanding how healthcare AI behaves under an adversarial attack, health systems can better understand how to make models safer and more robust.
Patient privacy can also be at risk in health systems that engage in electronic phenotyping via algorithms integrated into EHRs. The process is designed to flag patients with certain clinical characteristics to gain better insights into their health and provide clinical decision support. However, electronic phenotyping can lead to a series of ethical pitfalls around patient privacy, including unintentionally revealing non-disclosed information about a patient.
However, there are ways to protect patient privacy and provide an additional layer of protection to clinical data, like privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Algorithmic, architectural, and augmentation PETs can all be leveraged to secure healthcare data.
Security and privacy will always be paramount, but this ongoing shift in perspective as stakeholders get more familiar with the challenges and opportunities of data sharing is vital for allowing AI to flourish in a health IT ecosystem where data is siloed and access to quality information is one of the industry’s biggest obstacles.


ETHICS, RESPONSIBILITY, AND OVERSIGHT
The thorniest issues in the debate about AI are the philosophical ones. In addition to the theoretical quandaries about who gets the ultimate blame for a life-threatening mistake, there are tangible legal and financial consequences when the word “malpractice” enters the equation.
Artificial intelligence algorithms are complex by their very nature. The more advanced the technology gets, the harder it will be for the average human to dissect the decision-making processes of these tools.
Organizations are already struggling with the issue of trust when it comes to heeding recommendations flashing on a computer screen, and providers are caught in the difficult situation of having access to large volumes of data but not feeling confident in the tools that are available to help them parse through it.
While some may assume that AI is completely free of human biases, these algorithms will learn patterns and generate outputs based on the data they were trained on. If these data are biased, then the model will be, too.
There are currently few reliable mechanisms to flag such biases. “Black box” artificial intelligence tools that give little rationale for their decisions only complicate the problem – and make it more difficult to assign responsibility to an individual when something goes awry.
When providers are legally responsible for any negative consequences that could have been identified from data they have in their possession, they need to be certain that the algorithms they use are presenting all of the relevant information in a way that enables optimal decision-making.
However, stakeholders are working to establish guidelines to address algorithmic bias.
In a 2021 report, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) suggested that the rule of thumb should be to assume that AI algorithms contain bias and work to identify and mitigate those biases.
“The proliferation of modeling and predictive approaches based on data-driven…techniques has helped to expose various social biases baked into real-world systems, and there is increasing evidence that the general public has concerns about the societal risks of AI,” the report stated.
“Identifying and addressing biases early in the problem formulation process is an important step to improving the process.”
The White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)’s ‘Blueprint for Trustworthy AI Implementation Guidance and Assurance for Healthcare’ have also recently provided some guidance for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI, but these can only go so far.
Developers may unknowingly introduce biases to AI algorithms or train the algorithms using incomplete datasets. Regardless of how it happens, users must be aware of the potential biases and work to manage them.
In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the first global report on the ethics and governance of AI in healthcare. WHO emphasized the potential health disparities that could emerge as a result of AI, particularly because many AI systems are trained on data collected from patients in high-income care settings.
WHO suggested that ethical considerations should be taken into account during the design, development, and deployment of AI technology.
Specifically, WHO recommended that individuals working with AI operate under the following ethical principles:


Protecting human autonomy
Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest
Ensuring transparency, explainability, and intelligibility
Fostering responsibility and accountability
Ensuring inclusiveness and equity
Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable


Bias in AI is a significant negative, but one that developers, clinicians, and regulators are actively trying to change.
Ensuring that AI develops ethically, safely, and meaningfully in healthcare will be the responsibility of all stakeholders: providers, patients, payers, developers, and everyone in between.
There are more questions to answer than anyone can even fathom. But unanswered questions are the reason to keep exploring — not to hang back. 
The healthcare ecosystem has to start somewhere, and “from scratch” is as good a place as any. 
Defining the industry’s approaches to AI is a significant responsibility and a golden opportunity to avoid some of the past mistakes and chart a better path for the future.
It’s an exciting, confusing, frustrating, optimistic time to be in healthcare, and the continuing maturity of artificial intelligence will only add to the mixed emotions of these ongoing debates. There may not be any clear answers to these fundamental challenges at the moment, but humans still have the opportunity to take the reins, make the hard choices, and shape the future of patient care.

The findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies when integrating AI in the workplace to enhance human-AI teamwork.





New research reveals intricate aspects of human-AI interactions, highlighting a surprising trend: artificial intelligence systems tend to benefit junior employees, but not for the reasons you’d expect.New research published in the INFORMS journal Management Science offers valuable insights for business leaders regarding the impact of work experience on employee interactions with artificial intelligence.The study explores the effects of two primary forms of human work experience—narrow experience, which is defined by the volume of specific tasks, and broad experience, characterized by overall seniority—on the dynamics within human-AI teams.  Surprising Findings from a Medical Chart Coding Study“We developed an AI solution for medical chart coding in a publicly traded company and conducted a field study among the knowledge workers,” says Weiguang Wang of the University of Rochester and leading author of the study. “We were surprised by what we found in the study. The different dimensions of work experience have distinct interactions with AI and play unique roles in human-AI teaming.”“While one might think that less experienced workers should benefit more from the help of AI, we find the opposite – AI benefits workers with greater task-based experience. At the same time, senior workers, despite their greater experience, gain less from AI than their junior colleagues,” says Guodong (Gordon) Gao of Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, and study co-author.The Dilemma of Seniority and AI TrustFurther investigation reveals that the relatively lower productivity lift from AI is not a result of seniority per se but rather their higher sensitivity to the imperfection of AI, which lowers their trust in AI.“This finding presents a dilemma: Employees with greater experience are in a better position to leverage AI for productivity, but the senior employees who assume greater responsibilities and care about the organization tend to shy away from AI because they see the risks of relying on AI’s assistance. As a result, they are not effectively leveraging AI,” says Ritu Agarwal of Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, a co-author of the study.The researchers urge employers to carefully consider different worker experience types and levels when introducing AI into the work. New workers with less task experience are disadvantaged in leveraging AI. Meanwhile, senior workers with more organizational experience may be concerned about the potential risks imposed by AI. Addressing these unique challenges are key to productive human-AI teaming.

AI developers, engineers, and consultants are seeing a lot of new job opportunities — even at companies outside the traditional tech world. And the pay is good, with many AI-related job postings listing salaries of well over $100,000.Companies are on the hunt for job candidates whose knowledge of AI can help them use their in-house data more extensively — for instance, to make better predictions and decisions, said Aaron Sines, a director at the Austin-based tech-recruiting company Razoroo. One agriculture client was looking to potentially use AI to help estimate crop yields, he said earlier this year.""The demand for professionals with knowledge in AI research, machine learning, deep learning — it truly outpaces the available supply of candidates,"" Sines said.That means companies are offering salaries above six figures to attract experienced candidates: The base salary for AI researcher roles, even at non-tech companies, could range from $150,000 to $250,000, Sines said.

Before she graduated high school, Michele Rosenthal knew that she wanted to dedicate her life to art. close dialogclose dialogShe had always wanted to be a professional illustrator. When it came time to apply to colleges, she decided to attend art school, where she majored in illustration before becoming a professional freelance artist.""What I really love is art,"" she said in an interview with TheStreet.  But over the last year — in the wake of the launch of ChatGPT, Stability AI and the like — the business of art has become more difficult. AI trends: What experts, execs think artificial intelligence will look like in 2024Read MoreAI trends: What experts, execs think artificial intelligence will look like in 2024Read MoreIndustries that before paid illustrators for their work have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence image generators. The jobs, Rosenthal said, have begun to dry up.Rosenthal's initial response to AI image generation was that there is no real comparison between an artist and an algorithm. A professional artist, she said, brings far more to a job than an output. What she didn't expect was how quickly so many people — with such haste — would choose to adopt AI tools as a means of replacing flesh-and-blood humans. ""The shockwaves are real,"" she said. ""Artists are definitely feeling the results of everyone adopting this technology so quickly."" Still, Rosenthal doesn't think the current bump in the road of the professional artist will be a permanent reality. If people want something new, she said, they still have to turn to a human artist; AI models produce a mere amalgamation of their training data, they don't seem truly creative. The ethics of AIArtificial intelligence is not a new technology. But with the launch of ChatGPT last year, it became consumer-facing in a whole new way, touching off an AI arms race as startups and tech giants alike raced to be the first to ship products. That race has been mirrored in courtrooms and government buildings as regulators have struggled to understand the technology so that they can figure out how best to regulate it. And a debate, meanwhile, has been ongoing within the field about the harms, risks and benefits of AI. A piece titled 'Triple Self Portrait' by Michele Rosenthal. Courtsey of Michele RosenthalAmong these ethical concerns — which include algorithmic discrimination, misinformation, political instability, data privacy and more — are questions of copyright infringement and fears of job loss. Over the past few months, several lawsuits have been filed by groups of authors and artists against the companies behind these models. A class action lawsuit, filed in September by the Authors Guild, alleges that Microsoft  (MSFT)  and OpenAI, without providing notice, credit or compensation, use copywritten work as the underpinning of their models. ""These algorithms are at the heart of Defendants' massive commercial enterprise,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""And at the heart of these algorithms is systematic theft on a mass scale.""OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on this piece. Another case, brought by a group of visual artists against Stability AI, Midjourney and other companies, argues a similar premise: ""AI image products are primarily valued as copyright-laundering devices, promising customers the benefits of art without the costs of artists.""The companies involved have argued that the content they train their models on is ""fair use,"" a claim that could, if true, supersede copyright violations. The U.S. Copyright Office said in August that it had undertaken a study of copyright law as it relates to generative AI to determine how best to treat the sector.  ""Training generative AI models in this way is, to me, wrong,"" Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and technologist, wrote in a Nov. 15 op-ed. ""Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works.""Newton-Rex in November resigned from his position leading Stability AI's Audio team, based, he said, on a disagreement over the company's impression that copyrighted work is fair use. Saying that the act of training on copyrighted work amounts to the exploitation of creators, Newton-Rex questioned the model as an unjust disruptor of existing copyright practices in the arts. He has instead supported generative models that are trained only on licensed content and are further transparent about the content in their training sets. As the legality of the issue is battled out in court, with the potential result of further enforcing existing laws against copyright infringement in the U.S., there has been a growing point of contention between creatives and those who have embraced AI content and image generators over the myriad nuances of creativity, and the differences between human and algorithmic creation. TheStreet spoke with a series of experts, including AI researchers, psychologists who specialize in the study of human creativity and the artists themselves about the differences between algorithmic output and human creation, the importance of the creative process, the impact of human creativity and the important differences between art as a hobby and art as a profession, and the ways in which AI can impact both. The ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreThe ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreHow LLMs 'create'Large Language Models (LLMs) — like ChatGPT — are, at their core, predictive models. Trained on an enormous quantity of data (the first ""L"" in ""LLM"") that includes books, newspaper articles, social media content, photos and videos, the output of any generative AI model is tied directly to its input, something that cannot quite be said for humans.  The Atlantic reported in September that a dataset called ""Books3"" was used to train models by Meta, Bloomberg and others. The dataset included more than 191,000 books, the basis of a July lawsuit filed against Meta by writers Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden.Generative text models, according to AI researcher Dr. John Licato, essentially output a ""probability distribution that's defined over a set of possible tokens."" ""There's a very specific mathematical function that it's trying to optimize when it's doing that training process,"" he told TheStreet. ""It's trying to make it so that the probability distribution best reflects the training data.""Though Licato noted some similarities between the creative processes of humans and AI models, he said that there is an ""inherent limit"" to what LLMs can actually output. Stability diffusion and high-quality datasetsWhen it comes to diffusion image generation — a method employed by Stability AI — models learn the base construction of an image by removing the noise from images in a given dataset so they can produce variations of each image. The artist lawsuit against Stability and its peers notes that ""the primary objective of a diffusion model is to reconstruct copies of its training images with maximum accuracy and fidelity.”The complaint goes on to cite a research scientist at Google DeepMind, Nicholas Carlini, who in a 2023 research paper stated that ""diffusion models are explicitly trained to reconstruct the training set."" DeepFloyd IF, an image generator launched in April by Stability AI, was trained on a high-quality dataset that contained one billion image and text pairs. Stability AI did not respond to TheStreet's request for comment on this piece. A low-quality dataset will produce low-quality output. A piece titled 'Autumn' by Michele Rosenthal.Courtesy of Michele RosenthalLikewise, a biased dataset will produce a biased output. And without datasets at all, such models would be unable to produce anything. AI expert and Ivanti CPO Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala told TheStreet that LLMs cannot generalize any more than they can feel. Such models can only 'create' based exclusively on the information in their training set. ""It doesn't have senses. It doesn't have human empathy behind it,"" Mukkamala said, noting that humans, on the other hand, can both feel and express. ""As a technologist, LLMs are very limited, from the dataset they've been fed with, to the human that's behind it and what you're asking it to answer."" Artificial Intelligence is a sustainability nightmare — but it doesn't have to beRead MoreArtificial Intelligence is a sustainability nightmare — but it doesn't have to beRead MoreHow humans createHumans, on the other hand, are, as Rosenthal said, much more than a mere algorithm. The technical process of human creativity, according to artist and Duke assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience Dr. Paul Seli, is one of generation and evaluation. The working hypothesis, he told TheStreet, is that the brain's default mode network — which is active during passive rest — is at work during the generation of creative ideas. The brain's prefrontal regions are then associated with the process of determining whether those ideas are any good.A recent study conducted by Dr. Ariana Anderson, assistant professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, found highly creative people had more randomness in their brain activity than simply intelligent people. AI, she told TheStreet in an interview, might be considered ""smart"" due to the size of the datasets the models are trained on. But AI can't ""extrapolate beyond what it's been trained, whereas human brains can."" The random turnings inherent to highly creative brains allow such people, humans, to find and explore new creative areas they ""wouldn't have found if they were pre-programmed."" Dr. Roger Beaty, creativity expert and assistant professor of psychology at PennState, told TheStreet that, while AI output might sometimes seem novel or creative, it's ""not really a fair comparison because of the vastness of knowledge that the AI has access to.""Indeed, current LLMs, according to Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, are trained on text data that he said would take a human ""20,000 years to read."" 'Gaussian Noise, Human Hands,' by Eryk Salvaggio, was a series of art created using an exploit in Stable Diffusion that resulted in the model creating an abstract image. The result is a piece of art that ""barely"" touches the training data, instead producing ""strange forms."" Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioRegardless, Beaty said that AI models ""don't have experiential episodic memory, which is also kind of relevant to creativity when you think about drawing on personal experiences for inspiration.""The source of that personal inspiration, according to Seli, more than just being fueled by personal experiences and emotions, comes from a deeply human attempt to ""take our subjective experience and share it with other people."" Human inspiration, Seli said, goes far beyond a 'training set' of previously consumed art, literature or music. ""One of the primary purposes of art is to serve as a communicative element of our inner experience,"" Seli said. ""We can share emotions in ways that words can't capture."" Why humans createHow humans get inspired and create represents an important distinction between the strictly mathematical process that AI algorithms utilize. But the answer to the question of why humans create is perhaps more important. Seli conducted a study in July where participants were asked to grade how creative they found a given set of artworks. The entire set of artwork featured exclusively AI-generated art, though the labels each participant saw — which categorized a work as either human or machine-made — were randomized. The study concluded that people found allegedly human-produced art to be more creative than AI art. ""If we think that a human did it, then we assume that the art is communicating some experience, and then we like it because we can relate to it or we can gain some sort of empathic insight into what it's like to be that person,"" Seli said. ""But with AI, we don't have the same empathic experience.""Seli noted an inherent emptiness to the communicative abilities of AI art, a sentiment that was echoed by new media artist Eryk Salvaggio. A viewer can look at an AI-generated image and be moved by it, but regardless of the viewer's impression, ""there's nothing on the other side of that communication. There's no intention in that communication. There's no meaning in that communication.""And it is that need to communicate that, according to Seli, remains at the very core of what art is and why humans are so drawn to it. It all comes down to a powerful human urge to take isolated experiences and establish a wider level of connection. ""The more welcome we feel in this existence, the more understood. And I think that's the point,"" Salvaggio said. A piece titled 'Tea Break' by Michele Rosenthal. Courtesy of Michele RosenthalThe creation of art, even on the professional level, holds true to that base value of a need for raw, human expression. The dataset that artists work with, Rosenthal said, goes far beyond reference shots, encompassing instead ""everything we've ever experienced and every emotion that we've ever had."" Rosenthal said that at the core of all human art is a powerful urge to symbolically express some element of the artist's human experience. A certain brushstroke, or a particular passage from a poem, or, Seli said, a musical melody, can elicit a strong emotional response from a varied audience. That response is the result of intimate human connection. The act of creating art, for David Depasquale, a professional artist who has worked as an art director and character designer in television, has been an avenue for personal expression and escapism throughout his life. Pursuing it professionally was a ""need.""""It was the only place that I found where my mind just was quiet for a little while,"" he told TheStreet. The importance of that process and that personal expression is on display in his professional work as much as it is in his personal work. None of Depasquale's work comes from a cold place of pure output, a common misconception about an artist's approach when working professionally. ""I get hired as an artist personally for my sensibilities, for my ideas, for my experiences in life and where I've come from,"" Depasquale said. ""Every single character I've designed is from a very personal place.""Good artists, he said, are not just hired for their output, they are hired for the unique humanity, process and soul that they bring to the job of creation, which is why he's not concerned about AI taking his job. ""You have to draw from something personally to be able to communicate something that someone else is going to recognize and translate,"" Rosenthal said, noting that the process of exploring artistic inspiration revolves around answering certain questions of ""what is the image in my mind that I want to make?"" and ""what is the feeling that I want it to evoke?"" This need for symbolic emotional expression — a passion that drove both Rosenthal and Depasquale to pursue art professionally — points to the more philosophical nature of art itself: the vibrant soul ensconced within a piece of art, and the vitality of an often laborious artistic process. The Cloud is vulnerable. Is Chain Reaction the solution?Read MoreThe Cloud is vulnerable. Is Chain Reaction the solution?Read MoreThe soul of artArt, according to Depasquale, is far more than just the final product. And artists are far more than their output. ""You don't play the piece of music you're playing just to get to the end. You play it for the joy of playing the whole thing,"" Depasquale told TheStreet. ""The reality is that the whole process is the art and that's what AI removes."" A growing obsession with ""efficiency and instant gratification"" has, according to Depasquale, fueled the recent proliferation of artificially generated art, something that is merely the latest evolution in the ongoing and damaging commoditization of art itself. ""You hear a piece of AI-generated music and it might sound nice on the surface, but there's nothing behind it,"" he said. ""It's empty. It's an empty door; you can't go through it.""Public conversation that focuses on the economics of art, rather than its inherent emotionality, has further enhanced this perspective. Still, Depasquale does not hate AI, nor does he think AI will take away his livelihood. AI, he said, is a machine and a tool. It ""has no emotions."" The real issue Depasquale has with AI is the ""humans behind it, and how they've chosen to wield this tool."" ""I'm more afraid of the devaluation of art than I am of a machine taking my job,"" he said. The value of human creativity A world without art and creativity, Seli said, ""would be a hell of a lonely place for us."" Rosenthal said that this point represents the ""secret weapon"" of art itself, something that ""AI will never be able to produce."" ""Art making is about human connection and really good art can create more empathy,"" she said. ""The experience of connecting with someone else's experience; that's really powerful. That's what makes art so valuable.""""I hope that doesn't get lost.""But in a more macro sense, human creativity — stretching beyond the arts — improves human society, according to Dr. Anderson. Every technological revolution human society has experienced, Anderson said, was incited by highly creative people. ""Technology can be very beneficial when it is developed by creative people because it can really alleviate human suffering around the world,"" she said. ""But we should always remember that the creative people are the ones who should be guiding it.""And if human society begins to over-rely on AI as a means of replacing artists and art with algorithmically derived, mathematical amalgamations of the art it was trained on, the result, according to Depasquale, could be the downfall of civilization. ""It sounds hyperbolic. And I kind of mean it to be, but I think that is what destroys human civilization,"" he said. ""The arts and creativity is what kept humans going since the dawn of time. Creative people are the people who are the keepers of culture and the keepers of human civilization.""When there is nothing else left, Depasquale said, there is still art, which can be made with a stick in the mud as much as it can be made on a computer or with a pen and paper. The history of humanity can be traced through art and the stories that art has told. This transcends language and modernity, stretching back to the time of the Neanderthal and their cave paintings that today inform historians how they lived.""People always have this instinct to create. And I think removing that or trying to remove that from humanity will destroy humanity,"" he said. ""Human culture is exhibited through art; you can't remove that from humanity. That's like taking out somebody's heart. They can't survive without that.""Art represents the essence and importance of boundless human communication, communication not fettered by the constructs of language or time. And the essence, or soul, of that, Depasquale said, cannot be artificially produced. ""No matter how minutely detailed AI can get, you can never manufacture that, you can't manufacture vision through an artist's eyes or hands or whatever they're using to create,"" he said. ""That's the end of civilization.""Think tank director warns of the danger around 'non-democratic tech leaders deciding the future'Read MoreThink tank director warns of the danger around 'non-democratic tech leaders deciding the future'Read MoreIntentionality in co-creativityDespite its already-established ability and ongoing potential to wreak havoc and harm across the professional art industry, some are looking at AI as a tool that, with the right intentions, can be used to help enhance human creativity, rather than limit it. Seli noted preliminary findings in which the artists themselves seem to be better at using AI image generators than non-artists. ""It's a tool. It doesn't level the playing field in some equality of outcome way with art,"" he said. ""It's just new tools, and you can use them or not, but if you're better at painting a piece you seem to be better at using DALL-E.""Another entry in Eryk Salvaggio's 'Gaussian Noise, Human Hands"" series. Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioThough he is sure that people will take advantage of these models, Seli found that it can be useful on occasion as a sounding board, an initial step in his own process of artistic inspiration and creation. For Salvaggio, who recently taught a course on AI art at Bradley University, generative AI represents an enormous tool with countless creative possibilities. Art, he told TheStreet, is not the commercial pursuit of image creation. There is much more nuance to the field, and to the kinds of creativity AI can enable and enhance, and the ways in which AI can limit creativity. In his artistic work with AI, Salvaggio is always attempting to figure out ways in which he can essentially trick an AI model into making something new.Much of the work he's done with AI has been through a lens of ""creative misuse."" The reason for this approach is that Salvaggio doesn't trust the datasets that power these models, and so doesn't want to rely on them when using them to create a piece of art that is unique to him. ""Most artists don't want to create something that is so literally in dialogue with things that they don't know,"" he said. ""If I want to make work that is in dialogue with other artists, I want to choose how that is represented and I want to choose what that conversation is.""In the act of prompting an AI model, Salvaggio doesn't have much say in what image the model spits out. There is no dialogue with other artists, there is no credit to other artists and there is no ability to extend a story begun by other artists. There is only the generation of an abstraction of other work. Such models also pose an additional challenge to creatives who are attempting to break new ground; no artist, Salvaggio said, wants to put something out there that ""runs the risk of being something that someone else has done."" Prompting alone is not enough. And relying on prompting is creatively limiting — a user might get outputs that are almost exactly what they asked for, something that jeopardizes the relationship between artist and art through something Salvaggio called ""curational creativity."" A still from 'Sarah Palin Forever,' which uses AI images and deepfake voice technology to tell the story of a 17-year-old girl who has spent her entire life inside a looping Sarah Palin rally in Bangor, Maine. The film was a way for Salvaggio to explore the unsavory side of AI and political manipulation, while telling a clearly fictional science-fiction story. Courtesy of Eryk SalvaggioThe central component of his creative process is ""screwing up, making the thing you didn't want to make and the learning that comes from that."" ""There's a constant flow between myself and the work that I'm making where I am putting something in to the best of my capacities, seeing the limits of those capacities, and then calibrating to what's on the page,"" he said. ""There's almost a dialogue with the ideas that are in my head and the ideas that are being expressed.""The challenges, posed by AI, that exist within Salvaggio's new media space are the same faced by many traditional artists. The limits of a person's artistic capabilities, Salvaggio said, are usually defined in terms of commercial viability, which is a violation of the artistic process. The artistic process is about ""our relationship to making"" and ""finding a way to express ourselves within our own minds,"" he said. The idea that AI image generators democratize art suggests that art isn't inherently democratic; it ""isn't a problem with art. It's a problem with the market.""As such, Salvaggio's biggest concern is not about AI, something he engages with as a tool, but with the profession of art itself. Creativity, he said, will always exist, a sentiment that was echoed almost verbatim by everyone TheStreet spoke with for this piece: AI will not and cannot stop human artistic creation. The real question at hand is the industry of professional art, from illustrators to writers and actors, and issues of exploitation and job loss. ""Humans are naturally creative. We've been making art since the beginnings of human history and we're not going to stop anytime soon,"" Rosenthal said. ""I think it's a shame that the people who are hiring artists seem to have lost respect for artists, seem to think that artists could be replaced by something that is just an algorithm.""Contact Ian with AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.By Ian KrietzbergIan Krietzberg is a tech reporter for The Street.

Authors, worried that large language models had been trained using their books, filed a handful of lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and others. So did visual artists, against Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DeviantArt, and more. None of those suits has reached any kind of conclusion, and some argue copyright claims aren’t the way to stop the bots from absorbing creative work, but the suits did turn the courts into yet another battlefield, in addition to picket lines, on which humans pushed back against AI incursion.By the end of 2023, governments entered the fray. In early November, US president Joe Biden signed an executive order attempting, among other things, to curtail AI’s impact on human work and provide “federal support for workers facing labor disruptions, including from AI.” Unions, including SAG, praised the move, which came as world leaders were heading to the UK for the AI Safety Summit, where, as my colleague Will Knight wrote, they sought to contain the threats of machine learning while also harnessing its power.That has always been the tricky part.

AI in India: India's job landscape is experiencing a seismic shift driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). While routine tasks in sectors like data entry and call centres face automation, a surge of opportunities is blossoming in data science, engineering, and machine learning.





    Premium AI Wave Washes Over India: From Routine to Robotics, Transforming Jobs Across Industries

OpenAI’s entrance marked a turning point, automating routine tasks and disrupting employment sectors like data entry and call centres. However, the AI wave also brought a surge of opportunities in data science, engineering, and machine learning, creating a new landscape of high-skilled jobs. Mint speaks with hiring experts to probe into AI’s impact on Indian jobs after its emergence.Experts told Mint that AI has caused both disruption and adaptation, with challenges like the digital divide coupled with social unrest balanced by the potential of AI to revolutionize traditional sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and education.World Economic Forum (WEF) anticipates that AI will generate 12 million more jobs than it displaces by 2025. India houses a talent base of 416K AI professionals as of August 2023 as opposed to the current demand of approximately 629K, a figure expected to surge to 1 million by 2026, according to a report by Wheebox National Employability Test (WNET).Young employability surges to 51.25 per cent, with Haryana, Maharashtra, and UP leading in talent concentration, the report added.Over 85 per cent of employers foresee AI generating new job opportunities within the next 1-5 years. This optimism is shared by around 63 per cent of job seekers, with 53 per cent believing that AI will create more jobs. Sectors like Education, Healthcare, Media, Finance, and Technology witness significant enthusiasm from 50-65 per cent of job seekers toward AI adoption. However, industries such as Construction, Logistics, Government, and Transportation display a more reserved response, an Indeed India survey revealed.What is the overall impact of AI?AI is already changing how we work, and its influence is only going to grow. Instead of replacing people, AI is designed to boost human abilities and help us, said Ruchee Anand, Senior Director of Talent and Learning Solutions at LinkedIn India.AI is still in its nascent stages; there have been very minimal negative effects, said Sumit Sabharwal, Head of HRSS, Fujitsu International Regions.AI has significantly impacted the employment sector in India by automating several tasks, leading to job displacement in some industries but also creating new opportunities in AI-related fields, according to Jaideep Kewalramani, COO &amp; Head of Employability, TeamLease, Edtech.However, Indian job seekers have concerns, including the necessity for reskilling or upskilling, fears of potential job displacement, and ethical considerations, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, observed.AI also provided a promising solution to address recruitment bias by relying on objective criteria like qualifications and skills, minimizing the influence of unconscious biases in hiring decisions. “AI tools promise up to 40 per cent bias reduction, helping increase gender, race and background diversity within teams, Vikram Ahuja, Co-Founder of ANSR and CEO of Talent500, observed.Which sectors have AI boosted employment?Job roles such as data scientist, data analyst, machine learning, Cloud Engineer, and stack developers will be in high demand for both Tech and Non-Tech sectors that aim to employ 11.15 lac tech Talent by FY 2027 from the current 7.65 lac employed, Munira Loliwala, AVP- Strategy and Growth of TeamLease Digital opined.“While some job categories shrink, new ones bloom. AI development, data science, cybersecurity, and robotics engineering are witnessing robust growth, creating exciting opportunities for tech-savvy individuals,” said, Balasubramanian A Vice President &amp; Business Head, TeamLease Services.AI has opened gates for new industries, skills and opportunities, claimed Karthik Sridharan, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Flexiple. AI has unlocked opportunities in fields like consumer apps, CRM applications, learning products, and financial apps.&nbsp;LinkedIn data showed that AI-powered shifts will cause a 65 per cent change in skills that are in demand by 2030. Gen Z was seen as more eager to learn new skills. “We’ve seen a 1.1x increase in LinkedIn learners who are spending 1.8x more time learning since September 2021,” Anand of LinkedIn India noted. Some of the top skills, according to LinkedIn findings, are investing in programming languages, data science, cloud computing, data analysis, and project management skills.Speaking on AI’s impact on a number of opportunities, Felix Kim, co-founder and CEO of Redrob, said, “AI is a force multiplier. AI will increase the disparage between the skilled and unskilled workers.”Which sectors have witnessed decline in opportunities?According to a Gartner survey, 69 per cent of managerial tasks are automatable, emphasizing the necessity for a strategic fusion of AI and human capabilities.Automated systems and AI algorithms can handle data entry and processing tasks more efficiently than manual efforts, impacting jobs in this sector. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI have streamlined customer service, revealed Devashish Sharma, founding member and CEO at Taggd.Additionally, legal, accounting, and finance sectors have been negatively impacted by AI. Salaries, especially in developed countries like the U.S., have seen a 30 per cent decline over the past 10 years after you factor in inflation, Kim opined.AI hasn’t necessarily resulted in a net negative impact on sectors; instead, it has transformed job landscapes, demanding new skill sets and creating opportunities in emerging fields, opined Sekhar Garisa, CEO of foundit.Administrative roles, manual labour in manufacturing, some transportation jobs, telemarketers, basic accounting and bookkeeping are some of the mundane tasks that AI may have put at risk, noted Sarbojit Mallick, Co-founder of Instahyre.Skill up to prepare for the AI ageCandidates need to update their skill sets to leverage AI tools to supercharge their work. Further, aligning their skills with what is in demand will also improve their opportunities to land roles and also the ability to gain better salaries, Sridharan opined. Additionally, they can prepare by acquiring skills for AI, like programming, machine learning, data analytics, data science and prompt engineering, as per Kewalramani.Anand of LinkedIn highlighted that hard skills are not the only skills in focus. “Millennials and Gen X are spending time learning soft skills like Personal Effectiveness, Personal Development, Leadership and Management, etc.”As AI evolves it will not just result in eliminating jobs but also create new opportunities in AI development, maintenance, and oversight, as per Siva Prasad Nanduri, CEO, of Diensten Tech Ltd (DTL).",,"['https://www.livemint.com/news', 'https://www.livemint.com/budget', 'https://www.livemint.com/money', 'https://www.livemint.com/companies', 'https://www.livemint.com/market', 'https://www.livemint.com/elections', 'https://www.livemint.com/industry', 'https://www.livemint.com/opinion', 'https://www.livemint.com/technology', 'https://www.livemint.com/politics', 'https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge', 'https://www.livemint.com/sports', 'https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/ipl', 'https://www.livemint.com/education']","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shivangini', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/authors/shivangini'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'mint', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/newschemalogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/12/23/1600x900/im-904940_1703303654085_1703327417369.jpg', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}",,"['Today News', 'Budget 2024', 'Money', 'Company Business News', 'Stock Market News', 'Election Results 2024', 'Indian Industry Analysis', 'Opinion', 'Technology News', 'Politics News', 'Lounge', 'Sports News', 'IPL 2024', 'Education News Today']",,,,,,,,,,"AI in India: Jobs evolved, not erased - opportunity and reskilling key, experts claim | Mint",,,en,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Americans are flocking to the gig economy for extra income and job flexibility, but the AI boom could make independent jobs a necessity — rather than a choice.That's because three of AI's potential impacts — making jobs easier, more competitive, and in some cases, obsolete — could each make gig work more prevalent.A record 63 million Americans, 38% of the workforce, performed freelance — or gig work — in 2023, according to an Upwork survey of 3,000 US adults conducted in the fall. The most popular gig jobs weren't what you might imagine, like ride-hailing or delivery drivers, but workers who provided knowledge services such as computer programming, marketing, or IT — this group accounted for 47% of all independent workers.

Bosses could opt for fewer full-time workers in the age of AIAI tools like ChatGPT are expected to boost some workers' productivity, in part by automating a portion of their work tasks. A McKinsey study found that up to 30% of hours worked in the US could be automated by 2030.

When a worker's job tasks require fewer hours than they used to, their boss might simply give them additional work or responsibilities. But there's a more negative possibility, Alexandrea Ravenelle, assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, who specializes in the gig economy, told Business Insider. Their boss could decide they're no longer providing enough value to warrant a full-time salary and benefits.""If a worker has realized that they can replace some of their efforts with AI, there's a good chance that their boss has already picked up on that too,"" she said. ""And if part of a worker's job can be filled by AI, why would an employer pay someone for a full day?""

There are plenty of work tasks AI can't do. But if it can do enough, Ravenelle said, more companies might decide to use gig workers —who are oftentimes less expensive — to fill in the gaps.""AI can diagnose a patient, but we still need an actual human to do the exam and enter the data,"" she said as one example. ""Or AI can drive a truck, but we still need humans — for now — to load the truck.""

Ravenelle said this dynamic could play out in many professions, including lawyers, writers, public relations, and marketing.The adoption of AI tools could make it easier for companies to find gig workersIf more companies look for gig workers to replace some of their full-time employees, there could be plenty to choose from. That's because AI tools are helping people become proficient at a variety of work tasks — potentially boosting the labor supply for many professions.If companies can trust AI-assisted independent workers to get the job done, they might turn to them more, Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist who studies AI, told Business Insider.""More complex tasks, like market research, are now much easier to do with the help of generative AI,"" he said. ""And so there is a lot of cheap labor around the world that companies might tap into rather than hiring people in-house.""

AI job replacement could push more Americans into the gig economyIn addition to making jobs easier and more competitive, AI could eliminate some jobs.When full-time jobs are eliminated, some impacted workers might seek employment in the gig economy to make ends meet — boosting the number of total gig workers. A 2018 study found that for every 1% uptick in unemployment in a given US county, there was an average increase of 22% in the number of residents actively working on gig platforms.But AI could eliminate some gig jobs as well, Frey said, citing copywriting and translation work as two possibilities. He said this is among the reasons it remains an open question whether AI will exacerbate or reverse gig work's recent growth.If certain gig workers are forced to find other work, some might pursue traditional employment. But others might just look for new jobs in the gig economy.

""I don't see gig work disappearing,"" Ravanelle said. ""I see it continuing to grow, and I think that we are going to need to really rethink our strategy as a society in terms of ensuring that workers have economic stability and then have access to benefits if their only income is coming from 1099 work.""If a world with more gig jobs means workers receive lower pay and fewer benefits, many workers could be worse off. But if gig work's positive attributes — like flexibility — provide opportunities for workers of all ages to boost their incomes, then it's not all bad news, Kweilin Ellingrud, a senior partner at McKinsey who has researched generative AI and the future of work, told Business Insider.""Figuring out how to create more flexible work for a broader set of people, including an aging workforce, could be a real boon to our productivity, to our economy, to businesses,"" she said. ""It doesn't only have to be a negative.""Are you a worker whose job has been impacted by AI, for better or for worse? If so, reach out to this reporter at jzinkula@businessinsider.com.

It's
happening,
the
worst
nightmare
for
anyone
working
in
the
corporate
world
is
becoming
true.
Artificial
Intelligence
is
slowly
taking
away
jobs.
From
the
clattering
looms
of
the
18th
century
to
the
power
looms,
to
robots
in
factories
to
artificial
intelligence,
each
wave
of
technological
advancement
has
gnawed
away
human
jobs.
But
AI
is
different.     
PAYTM
&
GOOGLE
TO
FIRE
1000s
OF
EMPLOYEES            
India's
Paytm
is
axing
jobs
to
cut
costs,
highlighting
a
broader
trend
in
the
tech
industry,
and
emphasising
the
growing
impacts
of
AI
in
workforce
dynamics.
One
97
Communications,
parent
of
fintech
firm
Paytm
confirmed
the
lay-offs.
""We
will
be
able
to
save
10-15%
in
employee
costs
as
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
has
delivered
more
than
we
expected
it
to,""
the
spokesperson
told
Reuters.
On
Friday
Google
parent
Alphabet
Inc
announced
12,000
job
cuts.
That's
6%
of
its
global
workforce.
Google
is
the
latest
tech
giant
to
retrench
after
years
of
abundant
growth
and
hiring.         Did

MACHINES
ON
THE
MARCH:
CAN
WE
ADAPT? 
Each
leap
in
technology,
from
the
telegraph
to
the
smartphone,
has
chipped
away
at
human
labour,
making
once-vital
jobs
obsolete.
Today,
computers
are
getting
smarter
at
every
click
of
the
mouse,
and
with
every
web
search,
it
is
learning
and
evolving.
Machines
are
becoming
efficient
in
using
algorithms
to
crunch
numbers
and
solve
problems.
Self-driving
cars
are
navigating
the
streets,
so
drivers
won't
be
in
much
demand
soon.
Chatbots
are
getting
smarter
and
may
soon
replace
tele-callers
and
answer
questions,
pushing
the
boundaries
of
automation
further.   
THE
IMPACT
OF
ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE
-
WIDESPREAD
JOB
LOSSES 
In
the
1950s,
the
automation
of
switchboard
operations
in
the
US
alone
displaced
400,000
telephone
operators.
In
1900,
41
percent
of
Americans
worked
in
agriculture;
by
2000,
it
dwindled
to
only
2
percent.
Again,
in
the
post-World
War
II
years
30
percent
of
Americans
were
employed
in
the
manufacturing
sector,
today
it
has
dropped
to
around
10
percent.
According
to
a
survey
done
by
Oxford
Economics,
a
UK-based
research
firm,
lower-skilled
regions,
which
tend
to
have
weaker
economies
and
already
high
unemployment
rates,
are
much
more
vulnerable
to
job
losses.
Again
a
recent
study
by
the
Bank
of
Korea
said
some
3.9
million
jobs
in
South
Korea
were
at
risk
as
AI
adoption
grows.   
WHAT
JOBS
WILL
AI
REPLACE? 
AI
is
replacing
and
will
continue
to
replace
some
jobs.
Workers
in
industries
ranging
from
healthcare
to
agriculture
and
industrial
sectors
can
all
expect
to
see
disruptions
in
hiring
due
to
AI.
There
are
some
professions
which
are
especially
vulnerable.
According
to
experts,
jobs
like
Telemarketing,
Accountants,
Receptionists,
Proofreaders,
Doctors,
Chemists
&
Computer
Support
Specialists.     For
the
first
time
Supreme
Court
uses
Artificial
Intelligence
for
live
transcription
of
hearings       
HOW
CAN
WE
OVERCOME
THE
AI
WAVE? 
While
new
opportunities
arise,
not
everyone
can
surf
the
wave
of
automation.
The
skills
gap
between
those
displaced
and
the
jobs
of
the
future
widens
with
each
passing
year.
But
amidst
the
gloom,
flickers
of
hope
remain.
While
AI
undeniably
automates
some
tasks,
it
also
creates
new
ones.
Adaptability
and
reskilling
will
be
key
for
individuals
to
navigate
this
shifting
technological
landscape.
Machines
will
continue
to
evolve,
there
is
no
stopping
them.
But
we
humans
need
to
rise
to
the
challenge
and
ride
the
AI
wave. Its game time -  play now!

  Much attention has been paid recently to the potential for generative AI to disrupt labour markets in the long term, rendering certain professions redundant whilst enhancing the productivity of human labour in others. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the impact AI has already had on the labour market. This column investigates the effect of generative AI models on affected professions, using data from an online labour platform showing that AI has diminished the potential earnings of exposed writers and image-related professionals across skills distribution.

Artificial intelligence in schools – everything you need to know

Posted by:

Schools



Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay – it’s already having a positive impact across society, including in the education sector.
We believe it could be used to improve our education system, for example, early research suggests it could be used to free up teachers’ time and provide personalised support to pupils.
While we want to make the most out of this emerging technology, we need to understand its risks, as well as its opportunities.
Here, we set out what we’re doing to develop artificial intelligence in education safely and explore how it could benefit both teachers and young people.
What are you doing to develop AI in education?
From investing in AI tools, to gathering evidence about how teachers and pupils are using AI, we’re already investigating how we take can advantage of AI in education.
These are just first steps, but we have already:

Launched a call for evidence on AI

To understand how those in education already use generative AI – including its use to produce content, such as text imagery and audio – we launched a call for evidence to gather views from educational professionals, academics and the edtech sector on its risks and possibilities. The results show AI is already being used to reduce administrative tasks and are optimistic about its potential.

Organised a ‘hackathon’ 

We organised a two-day hackathon for teachers and school leaders from across England, which allowed teachers and school leaders to work with data scientists to come up with solutions which use AI to tackle real-life issues like teacher workload. The results of the hackathon will be published next year.

Invested up to £2 million in AI tools for Oak National Academy 

This boost for Oak National Academy, an online learning platform, will help develop new, free resources for teachers which are powered by AI, such as lesson planners and classroom quizzes.
How could AI help teachers?
We’re still in the early stages of exploring the possibilities of AI and how it could benefit teachers. One area we’re looking at includes using AI tools to cut teacher workload by providing teachers with a virtual ‘assistant’.
From drafting curriculum plans to producing high-quality teaching resources, AI has the potential to reduce the amount of time teachers spend doing administrative tasks, so they can focus on what they do best– teaching and supporting their pupils.
Does this mean pupils could be taught by AI?
Absolutely not.
Teachers are irreplaceable, and AI could never be a substitute for teachers’ professional judgement and the personal relationship they have with their pupils.
We’re aiming to develop AI to serve teachers better, not to take away from the unique role that they play.
We’re also making sure that with any AI tools, teachers are always in charge and that there is always a “human in the loop”. For example, we wouldn’t support the use of AI to draft personalised plans or guidance without expert human involvement.
How could AI help pupils?
There is much more work to be done to explore how AI could enhance how pupils learn, and we know that there are concerns around the risks for young people, especially as this is a new form of technology. The development of any AI tools for young people would prioritise their safety and security.
This includes ensuring that children and young people are not accessing or creating harmful or inappropriate content online through generative AI, and that their data and intellectual property is protected.
As AI tools are interactive and can be easily personalised, they could be used to provide all young people with their own virtual ‘tutor’. To name one example, AI could help provide pupils with a bespoke workplan, based on marking and assessments from teachers.
What are you doing to stop pupils using AI to cheat?
While there are many positive uses for AI tools, we know that some parents and teachers are concerned about pupils using them to do their homework for them, or cheat in exams.
Results of the call for evidence and the hackathon will provide the base for future policy on AI, including how schools can work around the possibility of students using it to cheat.

The potential is unprecedented — the technology not only transforms routine work, but brings the power of AI to creative and knowledge work, putting companies in position to achieve not only great gains in productivity, but also to create entirely new paths for enterprise reinvention.
To pursue those paths, company leaders should first seek to understand the potential impact of generative AI on their particular industry, which could be much larger than it might now appear. Functional leaders should similarly analyze the potential impact in their domains. Then, working collaboratively with IT and technology leaders, executives throughout the organization can get down to the hard work of reinventing jobs, reconstituting processes, and refocusing the organization’s talent and reskilling strategies to realize the full potential of generative AI.
The Impact of Generative AI Across Industries
How big is the opportunity? Building on our initial study, we analyzed the potential impact of large language models (LLMs) on how workers spend time on tasks across 19 major industries, weighted by their 2022 employment levels (our data source is O*NET / BLS).
We found that 44% of all working hours across industries have the potential to be impacted by generative AI. The largest opportunity lies in banking, where 72% of working hours can potentially be transformed by generative AI. In insurance, the figure is 68%. In capital markets, it’s 67%. For industries in the middle of the pack, like retail, travel, health, and energy, the number of working hours that generative AI could potentially transform ranged from 40% to nearly 50%. In a similar analysis across 22 job categories, we found that LLMs will impact every category, ranging from 9% of a workday at the low end to 63% at the high end. In five of the 22 categories we examined, more than half of working hours can be transformed by LLMs.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
What’s even more promising is that our analysis of 19,265 tasks found that more than half can use generative AI as an input to unleash creativity and enable novel solutions. Whereas earlier generations of machine learning and intelligent software mainly impacted jobs and tasks that were routine, repeatable, and rules-based, generative AI will impact creative work like never before. This changes the way executives can and should think about improving productivity. Take the job of data scientist, where 76% of all work time can be impacted by generative AI, enabling a 25% improvement in achievable productivity given the current state of technology and practice.
Moreover, the ability to augment creativity presents an even greater productivity-boosting opportunity: using generative AI to accelerate AI innovation. In other words, one of the most powerful productivity drivers to appear in our lifetime — generative AI — could be used to improve its own productivity.
Reinventing Jobs, Reconstituting Processes, Refocusing Talent 
Currently, we’re at a phase in the adoption cycle of generative AI when most organizations are starting to experiment by using off-the-shelf “foundation models” (platforms for AI applications). However, the biggest value for many will come when they customize or fine-tune models using their own data to address their unique needs. In organizations that have moved beyond off-the-shelf generative AI to models the company continually customizes for its operations and business, the opportunity for enterprise reinvention is particularly large.
In what follows, we use the example of data scientists to explore the potential of generative AI in the IT function. But what we are proposing can and should be applied to almost any AI-facing job. Here’s how:
Decompose AI-facing jobs by tasks.
Tasks, not jobs, will be the building blocks of workplace transformation going forward. To understand where and how generative AI might work most effectively, first break down a job into the tasks that it entails for a particular role. For example, among the many tasks that a data scientist performs are the processing of digital or online data; evaluating the quality or accuracy of data; designing computer or information systems applications; developing models of systems, processes, or products; and numerous other tasks. Second, determine whether the task involves the intensive use of language (natural, computational, or mathematical) for completion. Data scientists employ a number of computational and mathematical languages like Python, C++, or JavaScript. Data scientists must also use natural language to communicate a compelling business case or to explain to business leaders and other stakeholders why a particular insight matters. Why is action needed? How can a decision be improved? Where is change urgently needed?
Third, assess how knowledge is used to perform a particular task. Are its problems ambiguous? Does completion of the task require collaboration with others or validation by a subject matter expert? In order to model an operational or business process, data scientists must understand it in the context of the company’s business and industry. Achieving that understanding requires collaboration with, and validation by, colleagues in many parts of the organization.
Recompose AI-facing jobs around generative AI.
Once a job has been broken down into its constituent tasks, you can then analyze how generative AI might affect each of those tasks. As a rule of thumb, tasks that entail recurring processes are candidates for full automation with generative AI, while tasks that require creative reasoning, collaboration, and judgment are candidates for augmentation with AI. For example, generative AI can help data scientists understand an industry process much faster, augmenting their collaborative and validation activities. Tasks with low potential for transformation through generative AI can continue to be performed exclusively by humans, while new high-value human tasks might emerge as a result of the recomposition of a job.
In our analysis of a typical data scientist’s job, we found five tasks — such as processing digital or online data or evaluating the quality or accuracy of data — that can be automated. Seven tasks can be augmented with generative AI to enable the data scientist to perform the task more effectively and efficiently. For example, Microsoft, GitHub and MIT Sloan researchers gave developers randomized access to GitHub Copilot (a generative AI for coding). It took Copilot users 57% less time than non-users to develop a web server in JavaScript. We also identified five tasks — such as communicating with others about operational plans or supervising personnel — that have little potential for automation or augmentation.
Reconstitute processes.
Automated, augmented, and human tasks — these are the initial building blocks around which to redesign jobs to begin to unlock value from generative AI. These redesigned jobs must then be woven into processes with other redesigned jobs in the organization, which will radically change the way works gets done. Consider how Lemonade, the upstart online insurer, rethought the processes that make up typical insurance features like claims and underwriting, and then redesigned them by looking through the lens of AI and the way humans regard the industry, and reknit those processes into what amounts to a reinvention of the insurance experience for consumers. How? By combining AI chatbots, the cloud, and an approach that made the customer the linchpin of a unique human-in-the-loop process to eliminate the mutual distrust between insurance companies and customers.
For instance, to file a claim, users tap the “claim” button in the Lemonade app and simply tell the chatbot, named Maya, what happened. There are no forms to fill out, there’s no waiting in a phone queue, and there’s no being handed off from one department to another. The company’s AI runs its anti-fraud algorithms and if the claim is instantly approved — as some 30% are — the AI pays it immediately. If not, the claim is escalated to a human who contacts the insured as soon as possible. To counter the insurer’s incentive to deny or reduce a claim and the customer’s incentive to inflate claims, the company simply takes a flat percentage of each premium and returns the unclaimed remainder in an annual “Giveback Day,” when the money is donated to worthy causes that policyholders have identified. The humans in the loop in the claims process are the customers themselves. When they enter a claim, they know that Lemonade has no incentive to unreasonably deny or reduce it. Just as important, they know that every dollar by which they inflate a claim means less money for a cause they care deeply about.
Reconstituting and reintegrating processes is hard work, and companies will need to be realistic about the challenges that come with profoundly rethinking how the organization works. An enterprise-wide strategy needs to account for all the variants of AI and associated technologies you intend to use, not only generative AI and large language models.
Refocus talent and skilling strategies. 
Companies need to invest as much in evolving operations and training people as they do in technology. Radically rethinking how work gets done, and helping people keep up with technology-driven change, will be two of the most important factors in realizing the full potential of generative AI. Nearly every job will be impacted — some will be eliminated, most will be transformed, and many new jobs will be created.
Because employees will participate in the decomposition and recomposition of their jobs, they will acquire new AI-facing skills on the job — the preferred method of learning for many people. Generative AI itself will play a role in reskilling: We found that nearly six in 10 organizations plan to use generative AI for learning purposes and more than 4 in 10 want to make a large investment.
It should be noted that enterprise reinventions that encompass generative AI impose new responsibilities on company leaders. Leaders must ensure that generative AI technologies are responsible and compliant by design. Applications should not create unacceptable risk for the business. The output of generative AI — carefully reviewed and overseen by humans — must be accurate, unbiased, and free from intellectual property issues. As organizations decompose and recompose jobs into tasks, reconstitute processes, and invest in training people to work differently alongside machines, a commitment to responsible AI will further distinguish them from competitors.Read more on AI and machine learningBGBhaskar Ghosh  is Accenture’s Chief Strategy Officer and a member of the firm’s Global Management Committee.

As adoption and utilization of generative AI expands, organizations will need to make sure that not only are they using generative AI to the best advantage but that their employees are on board and understand the new technology as well. In a recent webinar hosted by the MIT Sloan Management Review, MIT Sloan senior lecturer George Westerman and Boston College professor Sam Ransbotham discussed early uses for generative AI, how generative AI compares to previous advanced analytics technology, and why businesses should use caution.
ChatGPT enables anyone to create content
Generative AI tools make it possible for anyone with an internet connection to create customized written, audio, or visual content. When ChatGPT, arguably the most well-known chatbot, was released to the public in November 2022, it became immensely popular, reaching 100 million users in just two months.
One reason for the popularity of generative AI is its widespread applicability, including these use cases for businesses:
It can generate summaries of lengthy documents or recorded meetings.
Engineers can give generative AI prompts to write code. This is particularly useful for those working in an unfamiliar language.
Sales and marketing teams can use it to create highly personalized online shopping experiences by recommending related products.
Design teams can generate a multitude of models and weed out the impractical ones. This has big potential in automotive design, where brands can spend $3 billion on new models.
Call centers can provide training powered by conversational assistants, helping new employees get up to speed faster and improve efficiency — and increase the odds that they’ll stay on the job.
As with all AI products, business leaders will want to tread carefully so generative AI will augment human workers and not replace them, Westerman said. “The idea is that generative AI can work with you to make you a better worker,” he said. “It’s a very nice story, as opposed to so many of the stories that are out there about replacing workers.”
Four types of advanced analytics tools 
Generative AI is the latest in a line of advanced analytics tools. The tools vary in how much data and domain expertise is needed to use them, whether their results are repeatable, and how easy it is to understand how they generate results.
Rules-based systems, based on “if-then” automation, have existed for decades, Westerman said. Given their relative simplicity and the limitations of their computing power, this type of AI is typically used with well-understood problems, like processing insurance claims. “You really don’t need a whole lot data, but you do need a lot of expertise,” Westerman said. The results are also highly repeatable and explainable.
Econometrics, the next step forward, estimates relationships between things that can be distilled down to numbers. This requires less expertise than rules-based automation but more data, and, as a result, it requires careful thought about how models will be built. The results are usually repeatable but less explainable than those of rules-based automation.
Deep learning tools enable automated classification of data, process optimization, and predictive modeling. For example, Google used deep learning to reduce the energy consumed to cool its data centers by nearly 40%. “The machines are running the air conditioner better than people are,” Westerman noted. Deep learning requires a lot of data but less domain expertise. The results are somewhat repeatable but not very explainable.
Finally, generative AI enables the automation of creative processes. Like deep learning, generative AI requires little domain expertise but needs lots of data, and it has taken off thanks to accompanying advances in computing power. As Westerman noted, GPT models must work through trillions of data points.
Accuracy, privacy, and other reasons for caution
The power of generative AI also poses concern. Because generative AI tools don’t express their rules or the relationships within their underlying training data, they produce results that are neither repeatable nor explainable. One user’s output might look completely different from another’s, and the outputs aren’t always accurate. If data is incomplete or biased, the results will also be incomplete and biased.

In some ways, this variance is beneficial. When different prompts lead to different results, it can get the creative juices flowing, Westerman said. But if you’re looking to get the same answer every time, generative AI might not be the ideal tool.
All of this should deter business leaders from implementing generative AI hastily, particularly in certain cases.
“Will there be a lot of risk or cost if the model’s wrong?” Westerman asked. “If the financial advice you give can get you sued, or if the medical advice you give can get somebody hurt very badly, then you might want to be careful or put extra controls in place.”
Privacy is another concern. When users type questions into an open generative AI tool, the prompt and the reply become another piece of data for the model to use. Again, this has some benefits — the model has information it can use to continue to learn — but it also introduces the risk that private data will get released to the public or otherwise be used to modify models.
Ultimately, organizations that have seen the most success using generative AI have treated the process like putting a spare tire on a car.
“You don’t screw one bolt in really tightly, because you’re likely to bend things. You get them all on there a little bit, and then you tighten them all up,” Westerman said. “It’s a constant process — do something, do something more, do something more — rather than just trying one technique and sticking with it.”

Why GPUs Are Great for AI


				Features in chips, systems and software make NVIDIA GPUs ideal for machine learning with performance and efficiency enjoyed by millions.

  GPUs have been called the rare Earth metals — even the gold — of artificial intelligence, because they’re foundational for today’s generative AI era.
Three technical reasons, and many stories, explain why that’s so. Each reason has multiple facets well worth exploring, but at a high level:

GPUs employ parallel processing.
GPU systems scale up to supercomputing heights.
The GPU software stack for AI is broad and deep.

The net result is GPUs perform technical calculations faster and with greater energy efficiency than CPUs. That means they deliver leading performance for AI training and inference as well as gains across a wide array of applications that use accelerated computing.
In its recent report on AI, Stanford’s Human-Centered AI group provided some context. GPU performance “has increased roughly 7,000 times” since 2003 and price per performance is “5,600 times greater,” it reported.
A 2023 report captured the steep rise in GPU performance and price/performance.
The report also cited analysis from Epoch, an independent research group that measures and forecasts AI advances.
“GPUs are the dominant computing platform for accelerating machine learning workloads, and most (if not all) of the biggest models over the last five years have been trained on GPUs … [they have] thereby centrally contributed to the recent progress in AI,” Epoch said on its site.
A 2020 study assessing AI technology for the U.S. government drew similar conclusions.
“We expect [leading-edge] AI chips are one to three orders of magnitude more cost-effective than leading-node CPUs when counting production and operating costs,” it said.
NVIDIA GPUs have increased performance on AI inference 1,000x in the last ten years, said Bill Dally, the company’s chief scientist in a keynote at Hot Chips, an annual gathering of semiconductor and systems engineers.
ChatGPT Spread the News
ChatGPT provided a powerful example of how GPUs are great for AI. The large language model (LLM), trained and run on thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, runs generative AI services used by more than 100 million people.
Since its 2018 launch, MLPerf, the industry-standard benchmark for AI, has provided numbers that detail the leading performance of NVIDIA GPUs on both AI training and inference.
For example, NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips swept the latest round of inference tests. NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, inference software released since that test, delivers up to an 8x boost in performance and more than a 5x reduction in energy use and total cost of ownership. Indeed, NVIDIA GPUs have won every round of MLPerf training and inference tests since the benchmark was released in 2019.
In February, NVIDIA GPUs delivered leading results for inference, serving up thousands of inferences per second on the most demanding models in the STAC-ML Markets benchmark, a key technology performance gauge for the financial services industry.
A RedHat software engineering team put it succinctly in a blog: “GPUs have become the foundation of artificial intelligence.”
AI Under the Hood
A brief look under the hood shows why GPUs and AI make a powerful pairing.
An AI model, also called a neural network, is essentially a mathematical lasagna, made from layer upon layer of linear algebra equations. Each equation represents the likelihood that one piece of data is related to another.
For their part, GPUs pack thousands of cores, tiny calculators working in parallel to slice through the math that makes up an AI model. This, at a high level, is how AI computing works.
Highly Tuned Tensor Cores
Over time, NVIDIA’s engineers have tuned GPU cores to the evolving needs of AI models. The latest GPUs include Tensor Cores that are 60x more powerful than the first-generation designs for processing the matrix math neural networks use.
In addition, NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Core GPUs include a Transformer Engine that can automatically adjust to the optimal precision needed to process transformer models, the class of neural networks that spawned generative AI.
Along the way, each GPU generation has packed more memory and optimized techniques to store an entire AI model in a single GPU or set of GPUs.
Models Grow, Systems Expand
The complexity of AI models is expanding a whopping 10x a year.
The current state-of-the-art LLM, GPT4, packs more than a trillion parameters, a metric of its mathematical density. That’s up from less than 100 million parameters for a popular LLM in 2018.
In a recent talk at Hot Chips, NVIDIA Chief Scientist Bill Dally described how single-GPU performance on AI inference expanded 1,000x in the last decade.
GPU systems have kept pace by ganging up on the challenge. They scale up to supercomputers, thanks to their fast NVLink interconnects and NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networks.
For example, the DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer, combines up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center-sized GPU with 144 terabytes of shared memory.
Each GH200 superchip is a single server with 72 Arm Neoverse CPU cores and four petaflops of AI performance. A new four-way Grace Hopper systems configuration puts in a single compute node a whopping 288 Arm cores and 16 petaflops of AI performance with up to 2.3 terabytes of high-speed memory.
And NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs announced in November pack up to 288 gigabytes of the latest HBM3e memory technology.
Software Covers the Waterfront
An expanding ocean of GPU software has evolved since 2007 to enable every facet of AI, from deep-tech features to high-level applications.
The NVIDIA AI platform includes hundreds of software libraries and apps. The CUDA programming language and the cuDNN-X library for deep learning provide a base on top of which developers have created software like NVIDIA NeMo, a framework to let users build, customize and run inference on their own generative AI models.
Many of these elements are available as open-source software, the grab-and-go staple of software developers. More than a hundred of them are packaged into the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform for companies that require full security and support. Increasingly, they’re also available from major cloud service providers as APIs and services on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.
SteerLM, one of the latest AI software updates for NVIDIA GPUs, lets users fine tune models during inference.
A 70x Speedup in 2008
Success stories date back to a 2008 paper from AI pioneer Andrew Ng, then a Stanford researcher. Using two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, his three-person team achieved a 70x speedup over CPUs processing an AI model with 100 million parameters, finishing work that used to require several weeks in a single day.
“Modern graphics processors far surpass the computational capabilities of multicore CPUs, and have the potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised learning methods,” they reported.
Andrew Ng described his experiences using GPUs for AI in a GTC 2015 talk.
In a 2015 talk at NVIDIA GTC, Ng described how he continued using more GPUs to scale up his work, running larger models at Google Brain and Baidu. Later, he helped found Coursera, an online education platform where he taught hundreds of thousands of AI students.
Ng counts Geoff Hinton, one of the godfathers of modern AI, among the people he influenced. “I remember going to Geoff Hinton saying check out CUDA, I think it can help build bigger neural networks,” he said in the GTC talk.
The University of Toronto professor spread the word. “In 2009, I remember giving a talk at NIPS [now NeurIPS], where I told about 1,000 researchers they should all buy GPUs because GPUs are going to be the future of machine learning,” Hinton said in a press report.
Fast Forward With GPUs
AI’s gains are expected to ripple across the global economy.
A McKinsey report in June estimated that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases it analyzed in industries like banking, healthcare and retail. So, it’s no surprise Stanford’s 2023 AI report said that a majority of business leaders expect to increase their investments in AI.
Today, more than 40,000 companies use NVIDIA GPUs for AI and accelerated computing, attracting a global community of 4 million developers. Together they’re advancing science, healthcare, finance and virtually every industry.
Among the latest achievements, NVIDIA described a whopping 700,000x speedup using AI to ease climate change by keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere (see video below). It’s one of many ways NVIDIA is applying the performance of GPUs to AI and beyond.

Headlines are fewer, and the market capitalization of the largest US companies considered to be direct beneficiaries of AI has stabilized after soaring initially. It seems an appropriate time to take stock of how ChatGPT and similar tools have been applied in a range of industries over the past year, and what they could mean for economies going forward.Have you read?Why we need to be realistic about generative AI’s economic impactHere's why ChatGPT is just the start of the generative AI boomRedefining the work experienceThe transformational impact of generative AI should not be underestimated. When the primatologist Jane Goodall first witnessed Gombe chimpanzees fishing for termites by manipulating blades of grass in 1960, the line between humans and other animals suddenly blurred. The intelligent use of tools was no longer known to be a uniquely human trait, leading her mentor, the paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, to famously say, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.” It is by now evident that generative AI is a tool we can use to perform tasks with such efficiency that we never thought possible, and this is redefining the work experience. Imagine you are tasked with digging a hole and there is a rock blocking the spot. Generative AI is the equivalent of being handed a shovel that transforms into a pickaxe to break down that rock, then goes back to being a shovel to finish the job.More concretely, generative AI is already being used innovatively in a range of industries. Below is a small sampling of its less-publicized use cases that nonetheless hold the potential for transformational applications:1. Healthcare: Doctors are using generative AI to help capture summaries of large amounts of medical literature or brainstorm potential causes of hard-to-diagnose conditions. Hospitals are using personas to better empathize with individual patients to anticipate their needs or communicate with them in a more understandable way.2. Law: Legal firms are using AI to stress-test the strength of arguments and explore ways to negotiate middle grounds. The technology is also being used to support humans performing contract review by looking for specific terms (such as “indemnification”) and identifying sections for further human review.3. Agriculture: AI is helping farmers with irrigation optimization by collecting and analyzing hectare-by-hectare data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction, among others. Farmers can use generative AI to find possible causes of and remedies for low crop yield or identify pests and diseases.4. Manufacturing: Car companies are using AI to analyze focus group feedback by automatically turning recorded discussions into structured data and summarizing group sentiment regarding different vehicle features. Manufacturers are using unstructured data in surveys, dealer warranty reports, and other language from vehicle owners to identify problems faster, determine consumer needs, and plan marketing campaigns.One other way the technology is impacting productivity is by empowering employees with little to no programming background to write programs that suit their employers’ needs. For example, companies in highly regulated industries, worried about putting data into ChatGPT, have started using the technology to produce custom tools in Python and VBA that they can then apply to their internal data for processing and analysis. By contrast, many software companies have been reluctant to put their code into ChatGPT for fear of compromising their intellectual property.At an individual level, innovative workers are enhancing productivity by using generative AI to draft plans, agendas and emails; aid in brainstorming; analyze an issue from multiple angles; write personalized software tools; or summarize large sets of information needed to perform specific tasks. As the technology is integrated into workplace platforms that emphasize collaboration, tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s GSuite can broaden the scope of the productivity benefits.Macroeconomic impact of generative AIYet the macroeconomic impact of generative AI will not be immediately measurable through common indicators such as GDP growth, inflation and factor productivity. History suggests that the impact of past technological breakthroughs on macroeconomic variables takes years to be felt, not quarters. Nevertheless, the timelines for measuring the impact of generative AI may be accelerated by the fact that the technology can be rolled out quickly via software, and by their relative ease of use with less demanding learning and training requirements. In our view, a key variable that will influence the macroeconomic impact of generative AI is the degree of public-private cooperation and overall regulatory approach toward the technology. Without proactive public sector involvement and sensible regulation, countries will lack the necessary amount of investment in both human and physical capital to harness the full power of AI.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. An example of a country that is adapting to this new reality is the United Arab Emirates. In a recent visit to the country as part of the World Economic Forum’s Young Leaders Program, we learned that the UAE had created the world’s first Ministry of Artificial Intelligence. UAE authorities are confident other countries will follow suit – similar to what happened over a century ago with the creation of the first-ever energy ministries. By contrast, countries that don’t promptly recognize the power of generative AI and work on mitigating its risks may not be able to close the gap between innovative micro-level initiatives and macro-level results. The potential is theirs to lose.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Tech and InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesFourth Industrial RevolutionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

A new survey by KPMG in Canada has found a growing trend in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools among Canadians in the workplace. The latest Generative AI Adoption Index found that 22 percent of respondents reported using these tools to assist with their job responsibilities.




The survey, gathering data from 4,515 Canadians, highlighted a rise in the number of users and an increase in the frequency of use compared to just six months ago. Over 60 percent of generative AI users now employ the technology multiple times a week, a jump from 52 percent in the previous survey conducted in May.




“The incredible speed of adoption after just one year of being introduced to the general public shows how generative AI has not only revolutionized the way people work, but it's supercharged the speed of technology innovation as well, with breakthroughs happening at a much faster rate,” says Seamus Blackmore, partner at KPMG in Canada and product leader at Lighthouse.




“For business leaders, it's imperative to keep up with this rapidly evolving technology, understand how it could affect their business, and adapt their strategies accordingly if they want to compete,” Blackmore adds.









The survey also found an annualized growth rate of 32 percent in the adoption of generative AI tools, suggesting that half of all Canadian workers could be using them within the next three years.




“When the tool first became available, workers were experimenting with it to see what it could do and if it could help them work smarter. Our survey clearly shows that generative AI has become a key resource for many Canadian professionals,” says Blackmore.




Generative AI at work
The survey found that employees using generative AI at work are experiencing higher productivity gains than previously reported. Nearly 58 percent of users reported that generative AI helped them save between one to five hours of work per week, up from 55 percent in May.




More than three-quarters (76 percent) of users rely on publicly available generative AI tools, while the remaining quarter (24 percent) use private generative AI tools developed exclusively by their employers.









“We're likely to see more organizations adopting private generative AI systems as access to customizable tools continues to expand - and the more employees use these tools, the more they will reap the benefits,” says Marc Low, director at KPMG Ignition.




Reluctant employers
Low notes that many organizations express interest in adopting private generative AI systems but hesitate due to the overwhelming influx of new tools, frequent updates, and the ever-changing dynamics of the market. He recommends that organizations conduct a thorough assessment of how generative AI will impact their operations.




“Adopting generative AI because it's the latest trend or because everyone else is doing it is not a sound business strategy. Organizations need to be intentional about generative AI; define why it's needed, where it will have the greatest impact, and how to measure improvements in productivity and competitiveness to ensure return on investment,” Low adds.




Among respondents not using generative AI tools for work, 27 percent do not perceive the benefits of the technology in their roles. Nearly the same proportion find the technology either too complex or lacks the necessary training for effective utilization. “This suggests that more education is needed for employers and employees to fully understand how transformative generative AI can be if integrated and deployed effectively,” he says.




Key findings of KPMG’s latest Generative AI Adoption Index:

20 percent of generative AI users reported using the technology daily, up from 18 percent in May. 41 percent reported using it a few times a week, compared to 34 percent in the previous survey.
77 percent stated that their employers were aware of their use of generative AI at work, an increase from the previous 64 percent. 90 percent expressed that generative AI tools enhanced the quality of their professional work, an increase from 84 percent.
72 percent deemed using generative AI essential to managing their workload, up from 65 percent. 76 percent reported that generative AI tools allowed them to take on additional work that they wouldn't have the capacity for, an increase from 67 percent.
55 percent reported always checking the accuracy of information produced by generative AI, up from 49 percent.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in healthcare as stakeholders work to assess how these tools can be used to drive improvements in areas like clinician burnout, population health, and precision medicine.







As health systems begin deploying these tools, more clinicians are getting a chance to learn about how models can help assist them with a variety of tasks. But as AI becomes ubiquitous in the healthcare industry, a major question remains: how can medical institutions effectively educate students about these tools?
The Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) and the University College at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) are working to prepare the next generation of clinicians for further integration of advanced technologies through the United States’ first dual degree program combining medicine and AI.
The program, which takes five years to complete, confers a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from UT Health San Antonio and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) from UTSA.
Ronald Rodriguez, MD, PhD, director of the program and professor of medical education at UT Health San Antonio, was recently featured on Xtelligent Healthcare Media’s Healthcare Strategies podcast to discuss the program’s development, its benefits for medical students, and how to incorporate AI into medical education more effectively.
Listen to the full podcast to hear more details. And don’t forget to subscribe on iTunes, Spotify, or Google Podcasts.

BUILDING THE MD/MS IN AI PROGRAM
The program’s development began roughly four years ago when Rodriguez was giving a report about where the medical school should invest and focus more of its efforts.
“The one area that I felt was particularly pressing was artificial intelligence and the increasing use of these technologies in science and medicine, and how I felt at some point, it was going to become a very important aspect of how we practice medicine,” he explained.
When these suggestions were brought to the school’s dean, Rodriguez and others were tasked with holding a retreat to discuss the current technological landscape and how UT Health San Antonio and UTSA could collaborate on efforts to invest more heavily in analytics, AI, and computer science.
“The university had decided to invest in the development of a school of data science, and they were going to invest heavily in artificial intelligence and hire new faculty specifically in that arena,” Rodriguez noted. “Once they hired several people in that core area, then we got together with them and started to vet how we would actually put together a training program to specifically allow our medical students to capitalize on [AI].”
From there, stakeholders had to meet regularly to determine next action steps, such as what would constitute the core requirements of such a training program, what would be a reasonable amount to teach medical students about these topics, and the logistics of how the program would be carried out across two campuses.
Rodriguez and his colleagues faced multiple obstacles while developing the MD/MS in AI program. One major challenge was how the degrees should be conferred.
“Initially, we were trying to do it as a joint degree program where one degree would be conferred by two institutions simultaneously,” Rodriguez stated. “Once we started that path, we were notified that the complexities of that made it so difficult that it would be better if we had one institution confer the degree and the other form a memorandum of understanding and agreement through which they would allow us to provide students with provisions such as a waiver for the GRE.”
He and his colleagues also had to navigate hurdles related to tuition costs, academic schedules, legal considerations and paperwork, how students would be vetted for participation in the program, and what types of training would be credited toward completion of the dual degree.
Rodriguez noted that overcoming these challenges was a tedious process that took over three years, but that the hard work eventually paid off.
“Now, [the program’s development team is] quite happy with the result,” he said. “Even more importantly, should we ever decide to do other dual degree programs, we have a really good template in place now that would allow this to go much faster.”





HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BENEFIT MEDICAL STUDENTS 
When the idea to develop the MD/MS in AI program was first laid out, the prospect received a lukewarm response from many.
“I couldn't get people really excited about it, but I did my due diligence,” Rodriguez explained, describing how he sent out a questionnaire to all the medical students to gauge their interest in the program.
The students were very receptive to the idea, indicating that they thought being educated about AI in medicine was important enough for their careers that they would be interested to learn about the program and potentially consider taking on the extra training required.
“They were much more in tune with this than I think a lot of the older people in the institutions were,” Rodriguez stated. “They knew immediately how important this was going to be, and more than two-thirds said that they would very much like to hear more, and as much as a third would seriously consider taking an extra year.”
He underscored that the students’ willingness to even consider participating in the program was significant, as the extra year of required training would require a significant financial investment in terms of tuition fees and an additional year of potentially not earning income.
For medical students in a position to do so, making that sacrifice has the potential to pay off in terms of residency placements, Rodriguez noted.
“[Medical students] recognize that in this current environment, getting into a high-quality residency is not easy,” he said. “There is a limited number of slots, and there are more students in line for the slots than there are slots.”
The process is extremely competitive, and students who want to get into a good program must be exceedingly strong students. But not everyone can be at the top of the class, even if they perform well academically. This raises the question of how medical students can set themselves apart from their peers in other ways, Rodriguez emphasized.

“One way you can distinguish yourself is by developing a niche while you're a student that demonstrates additional skills that you have that may bring value to the place that you're going to go train for your residency,” he explained. “[The MD/MS in AI program] was one of those things where it was obvious immediately to the students that there could be great value in knowing how to utilize artificial intelligence tools.”

Now, the program is launching with three students already enrolled at the time of this interview, and more have been in contact with Rodriguez to get more information about the program.
The current program structure involves students completing the first three years of their medical school training as normal. Between their third and fourth years, they take a leave of absence to prepare for their MS in AI training.
The leave of absence helps address the challenges of scheduling classes across two campuses, as UTSA runs on a semester-based schedule while medical schools typically use a block schedule, with each block being anywhere from four to 12 weeks long and based on rotations.
To align the schedules, medical students finish their third year of medical school in July, then start didactic courses at UTSA in August. These courses give them some background on AI, computer science, and data analytics.
When their year at UTSA ends in May, the students prepare to return formally to UT Health Science Center again in July. Currently, one of the courses being developed for students in the program will focus on the use of technologies to interface with the electronic medical record through an application programming interface (API), Rodriguez highlighted.
During their training, students will also be required to complete two additional courses, which are capstone projects to demonstrate their understanding and use of the skills they’ve acquired through the MD/MS in AI program. From there, each student must write a formal thesis and submit it for publication.
Upon completion of these requirements, the MD/MS in AI dual degree can be conferred.
The hope is that the program can prepare the next generation of doctors to be able to use technologies like AI effectively and safely to improve healthcare.
As the first program of its kind in the United States, the program may also provide a blueprint for other academic institutions that want to ensure that their medical students are educated about health AI.


INCORPORATING AI INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULA
Rodriguez emphasized two different approaches that medical schools can take to incorporate AI into their curricula.
“One is to use [AI] as a tool to achieve medical education. So, in that case, schools might be utilizing it to help improve the way that students ingest content and get tested on it. And there are some novel ways to do that,” he said.
The other approach involves allowing students to take a much deeper dive into how these technologies are impacting medicine.
To do this, Rodriguez noted that medical schools must make efforts to establish necessary infrastructure, which is part of what the MD/MS in AI tries to do. By investing in and establishing infrastructure, schools can more easily adapt to challenges along the way. However, some medical schools are in a better position to take this on than others.
“If you look across the country, there are multiple medical schools that have access to engineering facilities, computer science departments within a university, or schools of data science and bioinformatics. Most of these have been set up as standalone institutions,” he indicated.
Such standalone institutions are not set up to train medical students to become doctors well-versed in AI. Rather, many of these institutions focus on conducting AI research to create tools for clinicians to use.
Rodriguez noted that this approach could be shortsighted as AI becomes increasingly integrated into healthcare.
“The paradigm shift here is expecting that medical students are going to be more than just end users. They're going to be the innovators. They're going to be the drivers,” he explained. “And it's really important that [clinicians] take that stance because if not, then we will be just the end users, and we will have the technology developers telling us how to take care of patients.”
He likened this to how payers have slowly gained more control over aspects of care like claims denials, impacting how clinicians practice medicine in ways that are not always in the best interests of the patient.
“I feel the same thing could happen with AI technologies if we are not careful,” he underscored. “It is possible that [clinicians] could be the ones being told by AI what to do and not driving the AI to empower us to be the most effective we can be.”
Rodriguez stated that clinicians, rather than technology experts, are likely to be much more in tune with health AI’s potential limitations and the direction in which these technologies should be developed.
“That's part of my drive for wanting to do this. I want the students that we graduate to not only know how to use the tools, but how to create the tools, to understand how we can best apply them, to understand where the best impact can be achieved for their particular area, and to develop them. We should be leading this; we should not be led.”

There was a time when it was unimaginable that you could generate original prose or poetry, write code, or create art – just by prompting a digital tool using our everyday, natural language. By now, many of us at least experimented with such a tool – generative AI. Generative AI is a form of AI that can generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. 
Here is one example of how it is being used in India. A research group, AI4Bharat, developed an AI-powered chatbot, Jugalbandi, to help Indian villagers gain easier access to government services. Accessible via mobile phones, the chatbot can understand questions in multiple languages. It then gathers information on relevant government initiatives and relays it back in local language. In less than half a year, Jugalbandi has expanded to cover 10 of India’s 22 official languages and 171 government programs.  
Now, imagine the possibilities of applying generative AI in your day-to-day work. A recent report released by the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Malaysia Centre4IR) and Access Partnership, titled, ‘The Economic Impact of Generative AI: The Future of Work in Malaysia’, estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD113.4 billion of productive capacity for Malaysia, equivalent to 28% of GDP in 2022.  
The report also identified three channels, through which generative AI will change the processes of production within an economy, and reprioritize the types of tasks undertaken, as well as the skills that will be valuable in the workforce.  
Three channels of change 
The first channel of change looks at unleashing creativity using generative AI, which can help generate new ideas to augment the creative process, enabling efficiencies of time and cost. Today, it is already being used to support creative endeavors across industries. 
This aligns with findings from Microsoft’s recent Work Trend Index, which found that 87% of workers in creative roles who are extremely familiar with AI said they’d be comfortable using AI for creative aspects of their job. Closer analysis of the findings revealed that more than 4 in 5 workers in Malaysia would be comfortable using AI not just for administrative tasks, but also analytical work and creative aspects of their role.  
Secondly, generative AI can help in accelerating discovery, reducing the cost of research and potentially supporting better learning outcomes. For instance, students can use generative AI to help them better understand difficult topics by making use of the technology’s ability to simplify complex concepts and provide an easy-to-digest summary to speed up the learning process.  
Beyond education, the potential of generative AI in accelerating discovery is also relevant in jobs across other sectors. The top occupations with the greatest share of tasks that can be transformed by this capability of generative AI include biochemists and biophysicists, astronomers, and biologists. 
The third channel of change is the role generative AI plays in enhancing efficiency, primarily in tasks that require analyzing data sets and information sources.  
Across the world, the pace of work has accelerated faster than humans can reasonably manage. We have all likely seen or experienced this ourselves, as 77% of Malaysians say that they do not have enough time and energy to get their work done. While there are some (62%) worried about AI replacing their jobs, many more (84%) would delegate as much work as possible to AI in order to lessen their workloads. Likewise, managers in Malaysia are 1.4x more likely to say that AI adds value to their workplace by boosting productivity rather than reducing headcount. 
With its ability to break down, summarize, and interpret large amounts of data in a matter of minutes or seconds, the AI-assistant becomes a powerful tool to support decision making and problem solving. 
The opportunity for Malaysia 
Shifting to an economic perspective, the report also finds that, given the structure of the nation’s economy, the highest potential impact of the use of generative AI is most likely in the manufacturing sector, taking up 46% of the contribution to economic value potentially unlocked by the technology. This is followed by the wholesale and retail trade sector (13%) and financial intermediation sector (7%).  
At Microsoft, we believe that AI is the defining technology of our time, and we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industries, and society. Understanding its transformative capability, we are cognizant that this technology will undoubtedly play a part in reshaping how we work. It may change the nature of some jobs, allowing people to focus on the more meaningful and enjoyable parts of their work, and may also lead to the creation of new jobs that did not exist before. In line with our aim to democratize our AI breakthroughs, Microsoft is committed to help prepare Malaysians for this future.   
As part of our Bersama Malaysia initiative to empower the country’s inclusive and sustainable digital economy, we have pledged to upskill an additional 1 million Malaysians by the end of 2023 to ensure every person has an equal opportunity to thrive in the digital era. To realize this, we are working closely with government agencies, non-profit organizations, corporates, and education institutions, among others. With their support, we have achieved more than 90% of our target as of November 2023. 
Harnessing the potential of generative AI 
It is vital to have a strategy to harness the potential of AI. Following through from the study, which includes insights from key stakeholders, as well as recommendations for harnessing the potential of generative AI as a country, which include: 

Increasing access and adoption –  the need for AI-ready infrastructure as well as conducive digital policies and regulations, so organizations and employees are encouraged to implement and leverage the technology. Additionally, public-private collaboration to ensure workforce readiness, so employees are equipped with the skills to best leverage the technology, will be important. 
Mitigating risks – the need for necessary guard rails needed to minimize risks and prevent the harmful use of the technology. As designers of the technology, we understand there is a crucial need for responsibility when creating and working with AI, and we aim to continue collaborating in this area, including with sharing our best practices. 
Inspiring innovation – Taking both the benefits and potential risks of generative AI into account, it is critical to find the right balance between protecting and promoting innovation. While accelerating innovation is important to build an AI-ready culture, policy frameworks should also be regularly reviewed in order to achieve a balanced approach that encourages innovation while protecting human interests. 

AI is poised to deliver significant benefits and it is a great time for us to work together to ensure that these can be enjoyed by all, to enable inclusive economic growth to be truly achieved.  
I recently also had the chance to share my thoughts with BFM on the opportunities that generative AI brings to the table and how it’s redefining our nation and way of work.

The job market for software developers has always been competitive, but we’re about to experience a talent crunch unlike anything we’ve ever seen in this industry.
Generative AI is everywhere, and anyone who works in software is trying to figure it out. While developers experiment with AI, business leaders are grappling with what it means for their teams. Most of the discussion revolves around what and who AI can replace.

[ AI is my copilot: The promise of AI code generation ]

The reality? AI is here, and it’s up to us, as software developers, product builders, and organizational leaders, to figure out how we keep up with this phenomenon very few understand. We have only scratched the surface of what AI can do since it became mainstream, yet we’re already talking about how it will replace human intuition. Something about this doesn’t seem right.

Crunch time for developer talent

Developers are under immense pressure to deliver new features faster and more securely, which provides an opportunity for AI to fill a gap in the talent market.
AI introduces a fundamental shift in how we think about software development. When it comes to developer talent, AI can, and most likely will, automate the repetitive work that junior developers currently do. AI-driven tools can unlock developer productivity and efficiency by rapidly building and deploying proofs of concept (POCs), auto-generating sections of code, auto-running A/B tests, and beyond. 











 
 
 
If we replace developers with machines, we won’t have engineers trained to do the more subjective and thoughtful work required to move software forward. The long-term impact of AI will be far more detrimental than beneficial, without the talent that is required to innovate, responsibly.
Redefining the role of a junior developer 
For the last 20 years, we’ve had a multitude of strategies to reduce the amount of duplicative, lower-level code (e.g., frameworks, libraries, and open source) that developers have to write. The goal has been to build on the shoulders of those who came before you so that you could focus on the things that made your application, and specific contributions to it, unique and special.
The goal is the same with AI, just accelerated. It’s about automating the creation of the code that is repeated, and then having your developers spend time reasoning and thinking about the code that is unique and requires deep thought and customization.











 
 
 
Without developers moving up through various career milestones, who will be here to mind the AI skills gap we’ve created?
Preparing for the developer skills shortage, now 
The focus needs to shift to training, specifically to investing in the next generation of software developers. Literally in a matter of weeks, everything changed. Just a few months ago, proficient developers wrote perfect code. Today, developers need to be experts in areas like prompt engineering, testing, and training large language models, or dealing with non-deterministic outcomes.
Software development will always be about experimentation, but delivering the next great feature that brings value to your customers will always be the priority. How do we continue to do this? The industry must prepare for the imminent developer skills crunch by investing in educational initiatives, upskilling programs, and fostering an environment that nurtures talent and promotes continuous learning.











 
 
 
At the junior developer level, that means continuing to hire talent and ensuring that developers gain early exposure to how AI will impact their workflow and approach to building software. For example, an entry-level developer may no longer be responsible for authoring code from scratch, so giving them exposure to validating and testing pre-authored code authored by AI will be essential. Hands-on experience writing code early on in a developer’s career is critical to developing their understanding of the systems they will eventually help build and maintain.

[ Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers ]

We need to provide our engineers who are just embarking on their careers an opportunity to learn in this space. Then, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into our workflows, there will be less emphasis on whose job is replaced, and more attention paid to how talent is trained to leverage AI. Future developers will spend the better part of their career thinking creatively, solving complex problems, and building the future. Who wouldn’t want to be part of that?

Generative AI is beginning to impact the analysis of structured enterprise data. It enables the conversion of natural language queries to structured query language (SQL) and facilitates vector similarity search to uncover valuable insights previously buried in the data, says Chad Meley, CMO at Kinetica.
Generative AI has captured widespread attention by producing novel and innovative outputs in creative domains, from captivating music compositions and breathtaking artwork to crafting compelling pieces of writing. In the business realm, the initial applications of generative AI have focused on extracting insights from the same kinds of unstructured data, such as call center notes or customer contracts. However, its influence now extends into structured enterprise data analysis. By leveraging the power of generative AI, organizations can unlock hidden insights, fundamentally transforming how businesses extract intelligence from their data. This innovative expansion highlights the adaptability of generative AI.
Generative AI is ushering in a transformative era in analyzing structured enterprise data through two key innovations. First, it enables the conversion of natural language queries to structured query language (SQL), a process often referred to as conversational query. This breakthrough allows users to interact with databases and extract insights using plain language, democratizing data access and analysis across organizations. Secondly, generative AI facilitates vector similarity search based on structured data. Structured data, encompassing well-organized information like orders, inventory, web traffic, and sensor readings in IoT, is the foundational data type that fuels industry innovation. Generating embeddings specific to structured information enhances search capabilities, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in vast datasets, greatly expediting decision-making processes, and uncovering valuable insights previously buried in the data.
Natural Language to Structured Query Language (NL2SQL)
NL2SQL processes plain language queries or questions, converting them into structured SQL queries that databases can understand. It involves a two-step process. First, the Large Language Model (LLM) uses natural language understanding to dissect the user’s query, identifying key components such as the entities, conditions, and desired data. This comprehension phase is critical, as it accurately interprets the user’s intent. Second, the LLM generates SQL queries based on the parsed information. It maps the natural language elements to corresponding SQL commands, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN statements, tailored to the database’s schema. This transformation allows users to effortlessly communicate with data sources using conversational language, making data analysis more accessible and efficient for an organization’s broader range of individuals.
Language to SQL conversion, although a transformative technology, faces some limitations. One challenge lies in the potential for incorrect syntax in user queries, as natural language can be imprecise and context-dependent. Furthermore, generative AI models may occasionally generate “hallucinations,” where the AI produces SQL queries that do not align with the user’s intent or database lexicon. Lastly, sub-optimized query planning can occur, leading to inefficient database interactions.
However, these limitations are actively being addressed. Improved training data, fine-tuning techniques, and robust validation processes help reduce incorrect syntax and hallucinations. Additionally, innovations in query optimization and reinforcement learning enhance query planning, ensuring that the generated SQL queries are syntactically correct, semantically accurate, and efficient. These ongoing developments are making language-to-SQL SQL conversion more precise and user-friendly, paving the way for natural language to become the lingua franca of business analytics.

Vector Similarity Search 
Vector similarity search, a powerful concept closely intertwined with generative AI, enables the discovery of patterns and insights that were previously beyond the reach of traditional analytical approaches. At its core, vector similarity search leverages the capabilities of generative AI models to transform structured data into high-dimensional vectors, facilitating efficient comparisons and pattern recognition.
Traditional analytical methods typically rely on structured queries or deterministic methods to identify patterns in data. While effective in many scenarios, these approaches often need help with complex or high-dimensional datasets like customer profiles, sensor data, network traffic data, financial data, etc. Vector similarity search, on the other hand, taps into the inherent relationships and similarities within data by encoding it into multi-dimensional vectors. These vectors encapsulate the essence of the data’s attributes and their interconnections.
Generative AI models, such as deep learning-based autoencoders and transformers, are pivotal in creating these vectors. By training on vast datasets, these models understand the data’s latent structures, enabling them to map data points to vectors in a way that captures essential features, even in high-dimensional or complex data like time series and spatial datasets. 
What sets vector similarity search apart is its ability to uncover patterns and associations not explicitly defined in advance. This data-agnostic approach means patterns emerge organically from the relationships encoded in the vectors rather than relying on predefined rules or queries. As a result, vector similarity search can unveil hidden connections, anomalies, or trends that traditional methods might overlook.
Consider a picture of a dog with its intricate features, such as breed, size, coat color, tail length, tail curliness, eye shape, ear shape, paw size, paw pad texture, snout length, nose color, body weight, whisker presence, and thousands of other features. Those features are stored as a series of numbers within a long vector representation. This vector encapsulates the essential attributes of the image in a high-dimensional space. Utilizing this vector space, the AI can discern similarities between objects. For instance, searching for animals similar to a dog may find a vector corresponding to a wolf, recognizing common traits despite their differences. 
This same principle extends beyond images and can be applied to profile things like stocks in financial analysis. The features of a stock at any point in time may include P/E ratio, liquidity, volatility, volume weighted average price, bid, ask, bid-ask spread, market capitalization, beta, dividend yield, free cash flow, etc. By encoding these various financial data characteristics of a  stock into vectors, generative AI can create a meaningful representation of the stock’s profile. These vectors can then be used to identify other stocks that exhibit similar qualities, enabling investors and analysts to uncover potential investment opportunities or assess risks effectively. Generative AI’s ability to distill complex data into structured vectors provides a versatile and powerful tool for finding analogs and making data-driven decisions across diverse domains. 
The features of a security event may include IP addresses, timestamps, types of threats, packet sizes, source and destination ports, and more. Generative AI can identify similar events that aid in threat detection by encoding these various network security event characteristics into vectors. The features of a logistics operation may encompass shipment weight, origin and destination locations, delivery times, transportation modes, weather events, driver attributes, and cargo types. Generative AI can facilitate the identification of similar logistics scenarios that enhance supply chain efficiency by encoding these various logistics data characteristics into vectors. Similar implications exist in automotive, retail, healthcare, and national defense.  
Vector similarity search and natural language to SQL, enabled by generative AI, will revolutionize structured data analysis by transcending the limitations of traditional approaches. It equips organizations to explore data at the speed of thought and exploit intricate patterns and insights that were once elusive.

But beyond fun smartphone apps and ways for students to shirk essay-writing assignments, what can generative AI do? How does it work? How will it AI technology affect the way that businesses operate? And possibly most heavy on your mind: will generative AI models take your job?\n\n\n\nAs Ainsley Harris has written in Fast Company, in a profile of Mira Murati, the CTO of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI, “Nearly every aspect of economic activity could be affected by OpenAI’s tools. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, relatively narrow applications of AI, such as customer service automation, will be more valuable to the global economy this decade than the steam engine was in the late 1800s. [Artificial general intelligence] will be worth many, many trillions of dollars more, or so say its most ardent believers.”\n\n\n\nWhat is generative AI?\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate novel content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data.\n\n\n\nAI (short for artificial intelligence) broadly refers to the idea of computers that can learn and make decisions in a human-like way. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on teaching computers to recognize patterns through data and algorithms. It differs from traditional programming in that the computer doesn’t need to be explicitly coded to address every potential scenario. Natural language processing (or NLP) refers to the specific ability of certain machine learning models to understand written or spoken language (as opposed to numerical data or specific, previously coded language).\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models take this pattern recognition a step further and use it to create text, images, computer code, and other novel content.\n\n\n\nHow does generative AI work?\n\n\n\nIf you\'re using a generative AI model, you enter a prompt describing the output you\'d like, and the program gives it to you, whether it\'s in the form of text, code, images, or—increasingly—sound and video. But behind the scenes, things are a bit more complicated.\n\n\n\nWhen programming a generative AI model, developers will feed it massive amounts of training data. For example, consider a large language model (or LLM). LLMs are the kind of generative AI used in ChatGPT and the basis of many generative AI tools in use today. These machine learning models utilize deep learning algorithms to process and understand language. LLMs are trained with immense amounts of previously written text to learn language patterns so they can perform tasks. Those tasks can range from translating content to responding in chatbot conversations—basically anything that requires language analysis of some sort.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models are comprised of multiple layers of ""neural networks,"" which are machine learning models that mimic the neurons in the human brain, using a network of nodes to process data through algorithms. This allows the generative AI to make connections between lots of different data points and learn which ones are the most important when responding to query or prompt.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI also makes use of deep learning, which is a type neural network whose data passes through several layers of processing—some of which are hidden from the programmer—before arriving at a response.\n\n\n\nFor LLMs, these neural networks work together to analyze text and predict outputs. They’re also trained with a left-to-right or bidirectional transformer, which works to maximize the probability of following and preceding words in context—just like a human could reasonably predict what might come next in a sentence. LLMs also have an attention mechanism that allows them to focus selectively on parts of text in order to identify the most relevant sections for summaries, for example.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat are the applications of generative AI?\n\n\n\nEven it\'s early stages, generative AI can already do a lot and the tools available are incredibly diverse. Generative AI models can take in such content as images, longer text formats, emails, social media content, voice recordings, program code, and structured data. Then the AI model can output new content, translations, answers to questions, sentiment analysis, summaries, and even videos.\n\n\n\nThese universal content machines have many potential applications in business. Today the most common uses of generative AI are for marketing. In the future, there is potential for generative AI to impact healthcare and life sciences—to make diagnoses, for example, or find new cures for disease.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, many of the early stages of generative AI began with large tech, or digital native, companies. Over the next several years, we see generative AI permeating traditional industries, like manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals, for example. Once a generative AI model has been trained, it can be fine-tuned for specific content domains with much less data.\n\n\n\nWe are now starting to see specialized generative models for biomedical content, legal documents, and translated text, which will give rise to additional use cases in those industries and domains. They may help organizations to manage their knowledge and content more effectively so that it can be easily accessed by employees and customers.\n\n\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?\n\n\n\nThe current wave of generative AI hype comes from the popularity of ChatGPT, a conversational chatbot created by OpenAI using an LLM that emphasizes back-and-forth dialog. GPT is short for “Generative Pre-Trained Transformer,” but the name itself requires some unpacking:\n\n\n\n“Generative” refers to its ability to generate text.“Pre-Training” means using the model from one machine learning task to train another, similar to how humans draw on existing knowledge when learning new things. In this case, GPT involves using a large corpus of text as training data.A “Transformer” is a kind of neural network that holistically learns about the relationship between all parts of a data sequence (in this case, the words in a sentence). It’s seen as a breakthrough for AI and generative AI technologies because it understands context and nuance better than previous approaches.\n\n\n\nBasically, users can ask ChatGPT questions or they can ask it to generate text for them that fits certain parameters. ChatGPT then draws on all the data it was trained on in order to generate a response.\n\n\n\nBut ChatGPT—and generative AI tools in general—cannot come up with original ideas instead it uses its pattern recognition on from its training data and applies those patterns to the user prompts.\n\n\n\nImage generation\n\n\n\nEven though many current AI tools are based on large language models and respond to text input, generative AI can be used to create images. Diffusion models are one method for image generation from text prompts. These generative AI algorithms work by adding random noise to a set of training images, then learning how to remove noise to construct the desired image.\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s text-to-image tool, DALL-E, uses GPT-3 (the same AI text model that underpins ChatGPT) to interpret users’ requests.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI assistants\n\n\n\nWe can all use a little help sometimes—that’s why the rich and famous have armies of personal assistants to help them out. We can’t all afford that, but artificial intelligence is coming to the rescue with a new wave of AI assistants to help get get things done, handling the tedious details of making things happen.\n\n\n\nIt’s a huge growth area, with billions of dollars invested in hundreds of companies creating generative AI models for specific tasks, such as AI marketing assistants, AI recruiting, HR, or even sorting out expenses. Others can handle tasks like taking notes in meetings, negotiating bills, or even doing math homework.\n\n\n\nChances are that whatever someone wants help with, there is, or will soon be, a generative AI assistant available to help.\n\n\n\nPopular generative AI apps\n\n\n\nIn addition to ChatGPT, generative AI apps and tools have been popping up so fast it\'s hard to keep track. From AI tools that can create images for use on social media platforms to video enhancers that are capable of deleting objects and creating virtual avatars, we’ve found some of the best generative AI tools for enhancing productivity, improving writing, and generating multimedia content, including sounds and videos.\n\n\n\nHere are just a few of the most popular:\n\n\n\nGenerative AI text tools\n\n\n\nAISEO.ai: If you have content that’s already written, it makes sense to use it as widely as possible. AISEO\'s content repurposer lets you take something like a blog post and rewrite it into a Twitter campaign, an email, or even a script for a YouTube video. AISEO also offers a neat tool called the Paraphraser, which uses generative AI to tweak your written content, including shortening, extending, and even changing the tone of it for different audiences.\xa0Grammarly: This is an invaluable tool for anyone who writes. At the simplest level, it is a kick-ass grammar and spelling checker far superior to the ones built into Word or Google Docs. But that’s just the beginning: It can also advise on tone, readability, and engagement.Jasper.ai: As the name suggests, Jasper uses AI to provide inspiration. Feed the system a few prompts, and it can crank out anything from Instagram captions to essays on the meaning of life, providing multiple options.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI image tools\n\n\n\nStable Diffusion: An open-source text-to-image application created by Stability AI. The official version has a laborious installation process and runs through a command line, but third-party developers have used the open source code to create more accessible versions for desktop computers and the web.Imagen: Another image generation tool that uses a diffusion model, this one created by Google. The company has chosen not to release its code or demonstrate it publicly for now, citing its potential to create inappropriate content.Dreambooth: A deep learning model, developed by Google, that can fine-tune images created through diffusion. Its most notable use case is the ability to generate new pictures of specific people based on existing photos—for better or worse.Lensa: An image editing app for iOS and Android from Prisma Labs that first launched in 2018.Nightcafe: An online AI image generator with a twist: It allows the user to use several different AI image generators, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others. Users can also apply a range of styles, so the experience is easy to get started with.Image.AI: AI image generators seldom produce good results the first time around. Instead, it is a process of evolution, refining the things that work and removing those that don’t. Image.ai does this, creating image after image until the user accepts the result.Photoleap: If you want to see how your house might look on the set of The Last of Us, Photoleap can help. The AI scenes feature of this iOS-only app uses generative AI to turn an image into a post-apocalyptic, fantasy cartoon or any one many other scene types.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI video tools\n\n\n\nNova AI: Upload a video to Nova AI, and it will automatically caption, categorize and tag it. Nova AL struggles with music, though: when uploading a Leonard Cohen live video to it, and it subtitled “Let’s not talk of love or change” as “Let’s smart things we can’t.” Not quite what Leonard meant, but it has a certain poetry of its own.\xa0\xa0Make-A-Video: Need a video of a confused bear in a calculus class? Meta’s new Make-A-Video tool can create a video from pretty much any text thrown at it.Synesthesia.io: This AI video generator for pitches creates pitch videos from text in a few minutes using a computer-generated avatar.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI sound tools\n\n\n\nSoundraw: This generative AI tool can create multiple pieces of incidental music in seconds. Pick a mood, a genre and a theme and the AI system creates 15 short music clips to choose from.\xa0Murf: Speech generation was one of the first applications of AI, and the latest evolution is Murf, which creates AI voiceovers. This sophisticated service can create very natural-sounding speech from text in 120 voices and 20 languages.NaturalReader: Another voiceover service, but with a twist: The app snaps a smartphone photo and extracts the text and read it out loud in any one of the several hundred voices on offer. Their Personal Reader app can also read eBooks, PDFs, screenshots, and other texts.Cleanvoice.ai: Record yourself speaking and you will be horrified at the background noises, umms, ahhs and lip-smacking. Cleanvoice.ai cuts these out of your audio, leaving only the important stuff.\n\n\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of generative AI?\n\n\n\nBecause the end user can\'t see what ChatGPT and similar generative AI models are doing behind the scenes, it\'s impossible to know the ""source"" of any given information they generate. ChatGPT has been known to generate false or offensive information, and even if you ask it to list its sources, the AI tool may invent a source whole-cloth.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models also can\'t discern bias in a source, leading to output that may not be objective.\n\n\n\nThere are some potential legal and ethical concerns related to generative AI and content creation as well. One is the ability to easily create “deepfakes”—images or video created by AI that appear realistic but are false or misleading.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, generative AI raises questions about what is original and proprietary content and may have a significant impact on content ownership. For example, if you use generative AI for creating content, is that content protected by copyright law? Or on the flip side, generative AI relies on existing content to use as training data, but what recourse does an author or artist have when their work is used as raw data to train an AI model?\n\n\n\nGenerative AI models can also be incredibly expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated that the cost of training a LLM with 1.5 billion parameters can be as high as $1.6 million.\n\n\n\nWill generative AI replace humans in the workplace?\n\n\n\nIn a word: No. Or at least not yet.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is a tool that can provide new ideas and help refine existing practices, but it can’t replace human intelligence in the form of the person who comes up with ideas and concepts. Instead, AI models can make this person more efficient and help them make more of the resources they have.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAI assistants, for example, are excellent at specific tasks and definitely make work easier, but they are not adaptable: You can’t throw a new task at generative AI and leave it to figure it out like you can with a real person. That will probably take a few more generations. But for now, AI assistants can definitely make life easier by automating everyday tasks and leaving humans to tackle new, unique, or creative challenges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow can (and will) businesses use generative AI?\n\n\n\nBabson College Professor Thomas Davenport and Nitin Mittal, head of U.S. artificial intelligence growth at Deloitte, are the authors of All In on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence. Their book examines how companies including Alphabet, Ping An, Airbus, Walmart, and Capital One leverage AI in business strategy, key processes, change management, and competition.\n\n\n\nHere, Davenport and Mittal provide Fast Company with an excerpt from their book offering an overview on AI archetypes, capabilities, and general principles.\n\n\n\nThe general path to using AI (excerpt from All in on AI)\n\n\n\nReprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press. Excerpted from All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal. Copyright 2023 Deloitte Development LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nThe path to becoming all-in on AI is not particularly well trodden; we’ve estimated that fewer than 1% of large organizations would meet our definition of the term. However, there are capability maturity models for virtually every business capability, and we will describe a similar approach for AI. Advancing maturity in AI is based on a variety of factors, including:\n\n\n\nBreadth of AI use cases across the enterpriseBreadth of different AI technologies employedLevel of engagement by senior leadersThe role of data in enterprise decision makingExtent of AI resources available—data, people, technologyExtent of production deployments, as opposed to AI pilots or experimentsLinks to transformation of business strategy or business modelsPolicies and processes to ensure ethical use of AI\n\n\n\nCapability maturity models tend to have five levels, and we see no reason to depart from that standard. They also tend to have low capabilities at Level 1 and high ones at Level 5, and we follow that pattern as well.\n\n\n\nAI Fueled (Level 5). All or most of the components we’ve described above, fully implemented and functioning—the business is built on AI capabilities and is becoming a learning machine;Transformers (Level 4). Not yet AI fueled but relatively far along in the journey with some of the attributes in place; multiple AI deployments that are creating substantial value for the organization;Pathseekers (Level 3). Already started on the journey and making progress, but at an early stage—some deployed systems, and a few measurable positive outcomes achieved;Starters (Level 2). Experimenting with AI—these companies have a plan but need to do a lot more to progress; they have very few or no production deployments;Underachievers (Level 1). Started experimenting with AI but have no production deployments and have achieved little to no economic value.\n\n\n\nWe might also add a “Level 0” to describe companies that have no AI activity whatsoever, but this is certainly a minority category among large firms in sophisticated economies.\n\n\n\nThe key difference with other maturity models is that we’re offering three alternative archetypes for the use of AI, but a company can be at various levels no matter what the primary focus of their efforts.\n\n\n\nWe would argue that in talking about AI-fueled enterprises, we are almost always describing Level 5 organizations. Like our examples, they are companies that have a wide variety of AI technologies and use cases in place, along with specialized technology platforms to support them. They do experiment, and companies striving to create may do more experimentation than those seeking operational improvements.\n\n\n\nThe goal of all these organizations, however—usually achieved—is to actually do business with AI by putting AI systems into production deployment. New business processes are employed. New products and services are introduced to the marketplace and used by customers. Senior executives are engaged and active in identifying use cases and monitoring performance. They have established data science groups, modernized their digital infrastructures, and identified large volumes of data for training and testing models.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there are alternative archetypes for employing AI, and somewhat different versions of capability models for different strategies. As we noted earlier, our view is that the three major archetypes can be summarized as:\n\n\n\nCreating new businesses, products, or servicesTransforming operationsInfluencing customer behavior\n\n\n\nWhile operational improvements are the most common objective for AI according to our survey research, it’s clear that at least some companies don’t just use AI to make their existing strategies, operations, and business models somewhat more efficient. Instead, they use it to enable new strategies, radically new business process designs, and new relationships with customers and partners. Those companies would assess their capabilities in terms of the degree to which they have successfully developed new strategies, business models, or products.\n\n\n\nOperationally focused AI objectives would involve achievement of substantial operational&nbsp; improvements, and customer behavior objectives would focus on how much actual customer behavior change has actually been achieved. Of course, that level of business transformation requires the active engagement and participation in strategic deliberations by senior management that Level 5 organizations typically display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas H.

But beyond fun smartphone apps and ways for students to shirk essay-writing assignments, what can generative AI do? How does it work? How will it AI technology affect the way that businesses operate? And possibly most heavy on your mind: will generative AI models take your job?As Ainsley Harris has written in Fast Company, in a profile of Mira Murati, the CTO of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI, “Nearly every aspect of economic activity could be affected by OpenAI’s tools. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, relatively narrow applications of AI, such as customer service automation, will be more valuable to the global economy this decade than the steam engine was in the late 1800s. [Artificial general intelligence] will be worth many, many trillions of dollars more, or so say its most ardent believers.”What is generative AI?Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate novel content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data.AI (short for artificial intelligence) broadly refers to the idea of computers that can learn and make decisions in a human-like way. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on teaching computers to recognize patterns through data and algorithms. It differs from traditional programming in that the computer doesn’t need to be explicitly coded to address every potential scenario. Natural language processing (or NLP) refers to the specific ability of certain machine learning models to understand written or spoken language (as opposed to numerical data or specific, previously coded language).Generative AI models take this pattern recognition a step further and use it to create text, images, computer code, and other novel content.How does generative AI work?If you’re using a generative AI model, you enter a prompt describing the output you’d like, and the program gives it to you, whether it’s in the form of text, code, images, or—increasingly—sound and video. But behind the scenes, things are a bit more complicated.When programming a generative AI model, developers will feed it massive amounts of training data. For example, consider a large language model (or LLM). LLMs are the kind of generative AI used in ChatGPT and the basis of many generative AI tools in use today. These machine learning models utilize deep learning algorithms to process and understand language. LLMs are trained with immense amounts of previously written text to learn language patterns so they can perform tasks. Those tasks can range from translating content to responding in chatbot conversations—basically anything that requires language analysis of some sort. Generative AI models are comprised of multiple layers of “neural networks,” which are machine learning models that mimic the neurons in the human brain, using a network of nodes to process data through algorithms. This allows the generative AI to make connections between lots of different data points and learn which ones are the most important when responding to query or prompt.Generative AI also makes use of deep learning, which is a type neural network whose data passes through several layers of processing—some of which are hidden from the programmer—before arriving at a response.For LLMs, these neural networks work together to analyze text and predict outputs. They’re also trained with a left-to-right or bidirectional transformer, which works to maximize the probability of following and preceding words in context—just like a human could reasonably predict what might come next in a sentence. LLMs also have an attention mechanism that allows them to focus selectively on parts of text in order to identify the most relevant sections for summaries, for example. What are the applications of generative AI?Even it’s early stages, generative AI can already do a lot and the tools available are incredibly diverse. Generative AI models can take in such content as images, longer text formats, emails, social media content, voice recordings, program code, and structured data. Then the AI model can output new content, translations, answers to questions, sentiment analysis, summaries, and even videos.These universal content machines have many potential applications in business. Today the most common uses of generative AI are for marketing. In the future, there is potential for generative AI to impact healthcare and life sciences—to make diagnoses, for example, or find new cures for disease.Not surprisingly, many of the early stages of generative AI began with large tech, or digital native, companies.

Image.ai does this, creating image after image until the user accepts the result.Photoleap: If you want to see how your house might look on the set of The Last of Us, Photoleap can help. The AI scenes feature of this iOS-only app uses generative AI to turn an image into a post-apocalyptic, fantasy cartoon or any one many other scene types.Generative AI video toolsNova AI: Upload a video to Nova AI, and it will automatically caption, categorize and tag it. Nova AL struggles with music, though: when uploading a Leonard Cohen live video to it, and it subtitled “Let’s not talk of love or change” as “Let’s smart things we can’t.” Not quite what Leonard meant, but it has a certain poetry of its own.  Make-A-Video: Need a video of a confused bear in a calculus class? Meta’s new Make-A-Video tool can create a video from pretty much any text thrown at it.Synesthesia.io: This AI video generator for pitches creates pitch videos from text in a few minutes using a computer-generated avatar.Generative AI sound toolsSoundraw: This generative AI tool can create multiple pieces of incidental music in seconds. Pick a mood, a genre and a theme and the AI system creates 15 short music clips to choose from. Murf: Speech generation was one of the first applications of AI, and the latest evolution is Murf, which creates AI voiceovers. This sophisticated service can create very natural-sounding speech from text in 120 voices and 20 languages.NaturalReader: Another voiceover service, but with a twist: The app snaps a smartphone photo and extracts the text and read it out loud in any one of the several hundred voices on offer. Their Personal Reader app can also read eBooks, PDFs, screenshots, and other texts.Cleanvoice.ai: Record yourself speaking and you will be horrified at the background noises, umms, ahhs and lip-smacking. Cleanvoice.ai cuts these out of your audio, leaving only the important stuff.What are the drawbacks of generative AI?Because the end user can’t see what ChatGPT and similar generative AI models are doing behind the scenes, it’s impossible to know the “source” of any given information they generate. ChatGPT has been known to generate false or offensive information, and even if you ask it to list its sources, the AI tool may invent a source whole-cloth.advertisementGenerative AI models also can’t discern bias in a source, leading to output that may not be objective.There are some potential legal and ethical concerns related to generative AI and content creation as well. One is the ability to easily create “deepfakes”—images or video created by AI that appear realistic but are false or misleading.Additionally, generative AI raises questions about what is original and proprietary content and may have a significant impact on content ownership. For example, if you use generative AI for creating content, is that content protected by copyright law? Or on the flip side, generative AI relies on existing content to use as training data, but what recourse does an author or artist have when their work is used as raw data to train an AI model?Generative AI models can also be incredibly expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated that the cost of training a LLM with 1.5 billion parameters can be as high as $1.6 million.Will generative AI replace humans in the workplace?In a word: No. Or at least not yet.Generative AI is a tool that can provide new ideas and help refine existing practices, but it can’t replace human intelligence in the form of the person who comes up with ideas and concepts. Instead, AI models can make this person more efficient and help them make more of the resources they have. AI assistants, for example, are excellent at specific tasks and definitely make work easier, but they are not adaptable: You can’t throw a new task at generative AI and leave it to figure it out like you can with a real person. That will probably take a few more generations. But for now, AI assistants can definitely make life easier by automating everyday tasks and leaving humans to tackle new, unique, or creative challenges. How can (and will) businesses use generative AI?Babson College Professor Thomas Davenport and Nitin Mittal, head of U.S. artificial intelligence growth at Deloitte, are the authors of All In on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence. Their book examines how companies including Alphabet, Ping An, Airbus, Walmart, and Capital One leverage AI in business strategy, key processes, change management, and competition.Here, Davenport and Mittal provide Fast Company with an excerpt from their book offering an overview on AI archetypes, capabilities, and general principles.The general path to using AI (excerpt from All in on AI)Reprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press. Excerpted from All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big With Artificial Intelligence by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal. Copyright 2023 Deloitte Development LLC. All rights reserved.The path to becoming all-in on AI is not particularly well trodden; we’ve estimated that fewer than 1% of large organizations would meet our definition of the term. However, there are capability maturity models for virtually every business capability, and we will describe a similar approach for AI. Advancing maturity in AI is based on a variety of factors, including:Breadth of AI use cases across the enterpriseBreadth of different AI technologies employedLevel of engagement by senior leadersThe role of data in enterprise decision makingExtent of AI resources available—data, people, technologyExtent of production deployments, as opposed to AI pilots or experimentsLinks to transformation of business strategy or business modelsPolicies and processes to ensure ethical use of AICapability maturity models tend to have five levels, and we see no reason to depart from that standard. They also tend to have low capabilities at Level 1 and high ones at Level 5, and we follow that pattern as well.AI Fueled (Level 5). All or most of the components we’ve described above, fully implemented and functioning—the business is built on AI capabilities and is becoming a learning machine;Transformers (Level 4). Not yet AI fueled but relatively far along in the journey with some of the attributes in place; multiple AI deployments that are creating substantial value for the organization;Pathseekers (Level 3). Already started on the journey and making progress, but at an early stage—some deployed systems, and a few measurable positive outcomes achieved;Starters (Level 2). Experimenting with AI—these companies have a plan but need to do a lot more to progress; they have very few or no production deployments;Underachievers (Level 1). Started experimenting with AI but have no production deployments and have achieved little to no economic value.We might also add a “Level 0” to describe companies that have no AI activity whatsoever, but this is certainly a minority category among large firms in sophisticated economies.The key difference with other maturity models is that we’re offering three alternative archetypes for the use of AI, but a company can be at various levels no matter what the primary focus of their efforts.We would argue that in talking about AI-fueled enterprises, we are almost always describing Level 5 organizations. Like our examples, they are companies that have a wide variety of AI technologies and use cases in place, along with specialized technology platforms to support them. They do experiment, and companies striving to create may do more experimentation than those seeking operational improvements.The goal of all these organizations, however—usually achieved—is to actually do business with AI by putting AI systems into production deployment. New business processes are employed. New products and services are introduced to the marketplace and used by customers. Senior executives are engaged and active in identifying use cases and monitoring performance. They have established data science groups, modernized their digital infrastructures, and identified large volumes of data for training and testing models.Perhaps most importantly, there are alternative archetypes for employing AI, and somewhat different versions of capability models for different strategies. As we noted earlier, our view is that the three major archetypes can be summarized as:Creating new businesses, products, or servicesTransforming operationsInfluencing customer behaviorWhile operational improvements are the most common objective for AI according to our survey research, it’s clear that at least some companies don’t just use AI to make their existing strategies, operations, and business models somewhat more efficient. Instead, they use it to enable new strategies, radically new business process designs, and new relationships with customers and partners. Those companies would assess their capabilities in terms of the degree to which they have successfully developed new strategies, business models, or products.Operationally focused AI objectives would involve achievement of substantial operational  improvements, and customer behavior objectives would focus on how much actual customer behavior change has actually been achieved. Of course, that level of business transformation requires the active engagement and participation in strategic deliberations by senior management that Level 5 organizations typically display.Thomas H.

But none of that compares to the seismic shift AI represents as it starts to fundamentally redefine the way we work across sectors and societies.
As the CEO of LinkedIn, a platform dedicated to creating economic opportunity for the global workforce, it’s no surprise then that in almost every conversation I have these days, especially with fellow CEOs, I’m consistently asked the same question: “What is happening with AI and work, and what does it mean for me?
Here’s my response: The world of work is changing this fast and the most important thing to do is realize that the old playbooks, especially around talent management, will not work — now, it’s time to adapt. Ignoring that truth all but guarantees that your business will fall behind. But embracing it, with a focus on three big shifts, will set your business up for new levels of success in the age of AI.
Redefine jobs as a collection of a skills and tasks, not titles.
The smartest companies today are starting to redefine jobs as a collection of skills and tasks — instead of just titles — and are considering how those skills and tasks will evolve as AI advances.
If this thinking is new to you, it’s easy to embrace. Take the jobs done by your team or across your workforce and categorize them not by title but by the key tasks that get done every day. We know that AI will eventually impact virtually all tasks at some level given the increasing integration of AI tools into our day to day. But the impact of AI is going to be more pronounced on some teams than others.
When you see jobs as a collection of tasks, you’ll quickly be able to see which jobs are more prone to be automated than others. In those areas, it’s not a given that a job goes away. Instead, you can focus on up-skilling workers to manage more complex tasks and help them develop the people skills that AI is least likely to automate, such as communication and collaboration. This view of jobs as tasks not titles empowers leaders to identify the skills your workforce must cultivate to stay competitive and agile in the age of AI.
If that sounds too big of a shift to implement at your company, consider what’s being done at places like Unilever. Unilever is one of the world’s largest consumer goods brands and has been redefining roles as a collection of skills for some time. That shift enabled them to create flexible pathways for employees to unlock opportunities they may otherwise not have been considered for, fostering a more dynamic internal talent marketplace. Unilever’s innovative employment model, U-Work, helps employees transition between a diverse set of assignments based on their skills, rather than being tied to fixed titles and roles. In between assignments, U-Work employees (or “U-workers”) can pursue other passions, whether that’s setting up their own business or spending more time with family. This offers employees flexibility and creates agility for the organization.
Insight Center CollectionHow Generative AI Is Changing WorkExploring the impact on workers, companies, and the economy.
Figuring out how best to build this new thinking — and the systems around it — at your company is going to be one of the most important tasks every leader faces in the coming years. In fact, it’s likely we will see an entirely new category of jobs at companies crop up centered around the idea of “AI transformation,” where teams are tasked with figuring out which AI tools are the right tools to grow your business and, as a result, which workforce strategies are the right strategies to keep your teams agile and engaged. The battle for that talent will be fierce and it’s already begun.
Bring skills and workforce learning to the center of talent management.
Jobs are changing on us, even if we’re not changing jobs. The average LinkedIn member has seen the skills needed for their job change by 25% over the past eight years. That number is expected to reach at least 65% by 2030 due to AI.
Think about it. We’re already upskilling en masse on AI-adjacent skills to keep pace with change. How many of us have tried ChatGPT, experimenting with a slew of questions, trying to get the best results from AI? “Prompting” as a skill isn’t something taught in school, but being proficient in it has already become core to work in the last year.
For leaders, that means one thing: We need to prioritize and accelerate workforce learning, as it’ll be practically impossible for a one-off moment of learning (like a degree, or a two-year stint at a company) to last an entire career. Companies should start embracing a “training to hire” mindset with onboardings and apprenticeships as well as a “training to promote” mindset through upskilling and tours of duty that help guide employees into new functions, and perhaps even new careers.
IBM does this well. A longtime leader on skills-first thinking, IBM launched an apprenticeship program a few years ago to develop the skills that were essential for future roles at the company, building a framework centered on learning courses and on-the-job training. Now, they’ve had a thousand apprentices across 35 roles including cybersecurity, software development, data science, and design. The success of the program led IBM to commit to investing $250 million toward their Registered Apprenticeship and other training programs by 2025.
Another company leading the way is Genpact. This global professional services company has built an AI-enabled, scalable learning platform that harnesses the collective intelligence of Genpact experts at scale and delivers personalized reskilling paths for their 115,000+ global workforce. For example, as soon as GenAI took off, they identified it as a key skill for everyone and were quick to curate training courses on the basics, including prompt engineering and how large language models can be leveraged for their clients. So far, over 75,000 people have taken the beginner course, contributing to Genpact’s remarkable threefold increase in learning since 2019 — totaling nearly 40 million learner hours to date.
To help companies assimilate to the AI-led changes, leaders need to foster a culture of learning. Not just to boost AI literacy, but to build great soft skills, like leadership and problem solving, and create a workforce that’s resilient and agile in the face of change. And AI will help us do this better too — features like AI-powered coaching in LinkedIn Learning can help offer employees real-time advice and tailored learning content recommendations all personalized based on job title, career goal, and skills they follow.
Embrace AI to focus teams on human-to-human collaboration.
We’re seeing that professionals are excited that AI can help improve their productivity and reduce their workloads. Microsoft’s Work Trend Index shows that 70% of employees would like to delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads and, at LinkedIn, our estimate is that more than 80% of our members are in a position to use AI to automate at least a quarter of the mundane and repetitive tasks that we do every day.
This is big news for leaders. It means, with the right AI tools in place, your employees will have more time for the tasks that require human innovation and strategy. For example, recruiters can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process — like speaking to and building relationships with candidates — while AI takes on the heavy lifting of helping find the right pipeline of candidates that have the right skills. Or salespeople can focus on deepening customer trust and enhancing relationships, as AI helps with lead qualification and sales forecasting.
At LinkedIn, we’ve already seen the benefits of AI with our customer service team. By embracing self-service AI-powered experiences, our teams are no longer spending time on the basic questions they get all the time (How do I edit my profile? How do I get more followers?) and instead are spending time solving complex inquiries that only humans have the skills to do (think: empathy, patience, and cross-company collaboration). As a result, we’re becoming more effective by the day at solving all customer inquiries.
While it’s easy to look at AI as a tool that’s going to take away parts of our work, now is the time to reframe your mindset to see all your teams stand to gain with the help of AI. Simply put, AI is helping people focus more on the people part of work, which is why we see 70% of U.S. executives agree that soft skills are more valuable to their organization than AI skills.
What’s possible when we get this right
As big a deal as AI is, it’s not the first time — even in our lifetime — when technological change upended everything in our lives. When the internet became more mainstream in the 1990s, the conversation was very similar to the one we’re having today. Some jobs were lost, but ultimately, many more were created — in fact, 60% of employment in 2018 was found in jobs that didn’t exist in 1940.
Today, we don’t talk about the “internet.” Instead, we talk about the things we do with the internet: e-commerce, content creation, remote work, and the list goes on. The same will be true with AI. Eventually, we won’t talk about “AI,” we’ll talk about the ways AI is changing how we work and live, and that’s what makes this such a defining moment.
Across history, leaders just like us built and rebuilt the world of work time and again. This is our moment to rebuild the systems and pathways in place today and make them more equal, dynamic, and transparent than ever before. In creating these new playbooks, we could see economic opportunity reach more people in more places than ever before for decades to come, leading to innovation and growth at levels previously unseen. That future is not decided or inevitable. It’s up to us to create together.Read more on Talent management or related topics Technology and analytics, AI and machine learning and AutomationRyan Roslansky  is the CEO of LinkedIn, the world’s largest and most powerful network of professionals.

PNB and AmBank employees share their experience working with Copilot for Microsoft 365
As generative AI becomes more widely available, many industries are seeking intelligent solutions to transform their capabilities. The financial services industry (FSI) is no exception. Already, AI-powered productivity tools like Copilot for Microsoft 365 is empowering people to be more efficient, productive, and creative at work. 
Introducing a new way of working with AI

Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), one of Malaysia’s largest fund management companies, is among the first in Malaysia to deploy Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
The organization first embarked on its digital transformation journey in 2021, leveraging Microsoft 365 to ease transition into a remote working environment. The experience made PNB realize the benefits of cloud solutions for an efficient, collaborative, and secure workspace, regardless of employees’ location.  
While technology can make work easier, AI is only as good as the quality of the data it uses. The benefits, however, are unprecedented in how quickly and easily AI can analyze the data and generate insights that are both reliable and relevant to the task at hand. With the wealth of data it holds, PNB experienced a significant difference after using Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
Ts. Izzat Aziz, Chief Technology Officer of PNB said, “The ability of Copilot for Microsoft 365 to decipher large amounts of context and generate relevant input in a matter of minutes, or even seconds, showcases the outstanding level of sophistication of the AI.” 
Echoing this sentiment, El Zahrul, Head of Application of the Technology Division at PNB shared his experience. “I’ve heard so much about Copilot for Microsoft 365, and after trying it myself, I must say that it truly opens up a new way of working. Using Copilot in my daily tasks has allowed me to save time, especially in simplifying information search. No more manual searches through countless documents or emails – Copilot’s intelligent search quickly locates the needed information.”
Simplifying financial services in the era of AI

AmBank, one of the largest banking groups in Malaysia, is also among the first financial services organizations in Malaysia to experience this next-generation AI innovation in their workplace. 
Since embarking on their journey with Copilot, employees have reported a positive change in their work quality and efficiency. For instance, they can easily create personalized and engaging presentations with Copilot in PowerPoint, schedule and prepare for meetings efficiently with Copilot in Outlook, and present data in a clear and concise manner with Copilot in Excel. 
Rozidatul Akmal Kamil, Project Manager at AmBank shared, “It has significantly improved my work experience. Copilot for Microsoft 365 helps me work smarter and faster, while enhancing the quality and impact of my output.” 
She elaborated, “Copilot on Teams is one of my favorite features. The recap function has helped me save about 40% of the time I usually spend on minute-taking. When enabled, it listens to, captures, and summarizes the meeting discussions and action items in a clear and concise way, providing the minutes within an hour after the meeting ends. This liberates users, including myself, from mundane tasks; allowing us to focus on more strategic and impactful work.” 
All around the world, early users of Copilot do not want to go back to working without it. In a Work Trend Index Special Report by Microsoft, 77% of users said they do not want to give up Copilot. This is consistent with the findings from our annual Work Trend Index report released in May 2023, which found that while 62% of people in Malaysia are worried AI will replace their jobs, even more (84%) would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.  
This shows that employees are excited about the benefits of AI for their work. Leaders also have a positive attitude towards AI in Malaysia, with managers being more interested in using AI to boost productivity than to cut costs. They are 1.4 times more likely to use AI for this purpose than to reduce headcount.
Our approach to AI 
For 30 years now, Microsoft Research has been at the forefront in advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific discoveries into innovative AI technologies to create value for our customers and benefit the broader society.  
A recent study by the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Access Partnership estimates that generative AI can unlock USD113.4 billion in productive capacity in Malaysia, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022. This highlights the transformative role that AI can play in driving economic growth and innovation. 
In our ongoing journey, we are committed to helping organizations unlock the potential of AI in an ethical manner – balancing innovation with responsibility – ensuring that privacy is protected, rights are upheld while still allowing for positive uses of the technology to continue.

Last year, a record 39% of the US workforce did freelance work, per the freelance platform Upwork. But this year, the growing popularity of ChatGPT is posing a threat to some of their jobs.A paper published in July by researchers from Washington University in St. Louis and New York University examined how the November 2022 rollout of the generative AI tool ChatGPT impacted the earnings of Upwork freelancers. The key finding: freelancers whose work was the most exposed to AI earned over 5% less in April 2023 than they did before that chatbot's release. Additionally, the researchers said workers who focused on writing-related tasks were among the most impacted.

By Sam Becker for the BBC
Humans already work alongside robots in industries such as manufacturing. Now, for knowledge workers, the threat of AI replacement is coming faster than they imagined.
In early 2023, OpenAI's ChatGPT ushered in a new era - one in which artificial intelligence went from a pipe dream to a very real, contentious issue for workers.
The stakes are high: an April report from Goldman Sachs estimates ChatGPT, and other similar generative AI tools, could increase global GDP by as much as 7 percent, while replacing 300 million full time workers.
Many workers may have believed that burger-flipping robots in fast food restaurants, or advanced fabrication machines in factories, would represent the first wave of AI-related job losses.
A threat to creative positions
Yet the light-speed adoption and evolution of generative AI tools may now mean knowledge-work jobs that were long considered ""safe"" could be threatened even faster than workers anticipated. That includes creative positions that many presumed would be hard to automate, in fields like marketing, music production and graphic design.
Accordingly, researchers have found that the ""exposure curve is upward-sloping"", said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, who focuses on the interplay of technology, people and places. This means people in what may have traditionally been thought of as higher-echelon, professional positions are the workers most at threat of replacement by AI.
That's because generative AI tools and technologies can - or will soon be better able - to do all many things that have, in years past, been left to highly skilled humans: think tasks such as putting together marketing plans, search strategies and much more.
Part of this is new technology hitting the market. Robots that act like AI colleagues are on the way - and in some cases, they're already here. While there is reason to think that AI may be a boon to workers, there are reasons that many people working in knowledge-work positions should be looking over their shoulders.
Artisan AI
In early December, Artisan AI - a San Francisco-based startup, founded by 22-year-old Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, who is from the UK - will unveil its first ""Artisan"", an AI-powered digital worker. It is designed to integrate with human teams, and for all practical purposes, become a member of those groups.
While Artisan AI plans to have several ""Artisans"" hit the market throughout the next year, the first, ""Ava"", will automate the job of a sales representative, marking a significant improvement over chatbots and similar AI tools already on the market.
""After a 15-minute conversation with Ava, it'll have the ability to build a knowledge base, and with that information, create prospects,"" said Carmichael-Jack. ""It's like having sales software, but it comes with a manager or account executive built-in - she can make suggestions, edit campaigns, join meetings and take notes,"" he said.
Carmichael-Jack said Artisans can function autonomously, in the background, with little or no input. As such, Artisans, added to an organisation's team, could and should help boost productivity significantly. The technology is already attracting the attention of investors; Artisan AI has raised more than two million USD in pre-seed money within two weeks, according to Carmichael-Jack.
""Our goal is to have digital workers who can do anything a human can do, like join a meeting or have a phone call,"" he said. ""The goal is to have Artisans working alongside humans directly and have cohesion, and we want the boring work to be shifted on the Artisan, which doesn't have feelings about whether something is boring or difficult.""
Playing catch-up to the threat of AI
The looming threat of AI to knowledge workers may feel new, but the foundation for the threat has been building for some time. Yet policymakers and others are playing catch-up in grappling with the potential economic effects. US President Biden, for instance, issued an executive order in October, putting in place guardrails for AI's continued use and development that future-proof American jobs.
Although much AI technology is already shaking up the workforce as we know it, ""we're still at the beginning"" when it comes to AI integration into the workplace, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University professor and Director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. ""I'm more of the belief that we ain't seen nothing yet - this is just the first wave"" of AI integration into the economy.
He said AI adoption will make its way through more of the economy, and as that happens, it should increase output, productivity and revenues for businesses.
Human toll from AI growth
The question, however, is what the human toll of that growth will be, particularly in terms of job losses.
Brynjolfsson said that ""the typical company has 15,000 to 20,000 distinct tasks carried out by employees, and software can run through and see where the biggest opportunity for automation lies"".
If some of those tasks can be automated or streamlined with AI or other technology, he said, there's no reason not to lean into those technologies, especially if there's a potential for cost-cutting.
Given the immediate potential benefits to businesses, knowledge workers likely should carry some degree of concern regarding their jobs.
""All things being equal, this is a white-collar issue,"" said The Brooking Institution's Muro. That's why paying attention to what Artisan AI is bringing to the market in the coming months is so important for workers - especially those who spend their time doing knowledge or creative work.
""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" he said. ""All of this is surrounded by tremendous uncertainty in part because the technology is somewhat mysterious and a black box, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""
Whether the white-collar workforce is diminished by AI technologies will, ultimately, be a societal choice. Workers will need to have a say in how AI is introduced and used in particular industries - and hopefully, that can lead to better outcomes for everyone, he said.
One example of this is the deal between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Hollywood studios that outlines limits for the use of AI in film and television production. The question is whether other industries will codify similar stipulations to preserve their workers' livelihoods.
Even Carmichael-Jack agrees that there will need to be some sort of plan or oversight for how AI continues to be rolled out into new industries. ""We will need regulation,"" he said, even if it does make growing Artisan AI, in the immediate term, more challenging. ""We are inevitably going to get to a point where AI makes much of human work redundant, and that'll be a painful period.""

More from At WorkWorker fired after X-rated reply-all emailWin for glam banker facing 120 fraud chargesHow some Aussies will get $21k super bumpAustralians are already experiencing job losses amid the artificial intelligence revolution – and many more across the country have been warned to prepare for a new reality.A 2023 survey revealed more than a third of Aussie small businesses already have, or are planning to, replace some of their workforce with AI.The survey found that 56 per cent of small business operators believe that AI will either reduce the number of people they employ or are unsure about the impact it will have on employee numbers.AI use by small businesses is growing, with 41 per cent of Aussie small businesses saying they use it, compared to just 26 per cent of UK small businesses.Of those Aussie small businesses using AI, the top three functions it’s being used for are administration tasks (39 per cent), creative writing (28 per cent) and drafting internal or company communications (20 per cent).This week, one employee who used to work in wine subscription sales spoke about 121 positions that were recently made redundant in his field.“All our jobs were replaced by chatbots, data scraping and email,” the anonymous worker said via the ABC.“We all got AI-ed.”The redundant worker said his former company, Endeavour Group, sold the job cuts as part of a wider plan to become a more “digitally-led offering”.But he says it was clear the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence had made online customer service workers obsolete in the eyes of the company’s executives.“From the perspective of anyone who was made redundant, there was nothing ambiguous going on. It’s pretty interesting to watch them twist themselves in knots to not say ‘AI’ when that’s exactly what it was,” he said.“There were people in their 60s who had been doing it forever, saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do now.‘”AI-related job losses often go unnoticed as employers attribute cuts to various factors and avoid explicitly mentioning AI. Reductions in work hours, rather than outright job losses, also contribute to the hidden impact of AI on employment in Australia.Despite the obvious problem of those being forced out of a job, business analysts believe artificial intelligence is actually creating more jobs than it eliminates, for the time being.Jobs in the AI field have seen a whopping five-fold increase since 2017, and a doubling of jobs in 2023 alone.While nobody can know for certain what the landscape looks like in 10 years, industry analysts have warned workers to adapt to the storm as technological disruption in the labour market continues.While nobody can know for certain what the landscape looks like in 10 years, industry analysts have warned workers to adapt to the storm as technological disruption in the labour market continues. Some occupations, like telemarketers, educators, events professionals and some legal professionals that have been pinned as particularly vulnerable.Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley Capital International ranked US industries by their estimated share of employment that could be exposed to AI-driven automation, using data from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.Office and administrative support is at the top of the list, with an estimated 46 per cent of these jobs in the US facing potential replacement by AI-driven automation.In Australia, there are 415,300 people whose main job is in administrative and support services, according to Jobs and Skills Australia’s latest labour market update in February.If 46 per cent of the Australian industry were at risk of AI-driven automation like the analysis predicts for the US, more than 191,000 Aussie jobs could be in trouble in this one industry alone.“Many common tasks in these roles, such as scheduling meetings, writing reports and data input are likely to be fully automated in the future,” the analysis says.As expected, MSCI reported industries that rely heavily on manual labour will be impacted the least.While some believe we have adopted AI too quickly, others say Australia should be investing more to maximise the benefits.While some believe we have adopted AI too quickly, others say Australia should be investing more to maximise the benefits as the tech tide rolls in. The cutting edge technology, which is now in the hands of children as young as kindergarten, has immediately sent a shockwave through the education system. Group of Eight chief Vicki Thomson sounded the alarm on the government’s need to step up on innovation during a parliamentary inquiry into the use of generative AI in the education sector.But university peak bodies agreed equity and fair access to the groundbreaking technology should be front and centre of any future government response.Ms Thomson said there was “no question” generative AI would shake up higher education but providers needed to be ahead of the curve.“What is concerning, given this is such an important, subject is that Australia is lagging behind competitor nations when it comes to our investment in AI and indeed research more broadly,” she told the inquiry.The federal government committed $100m in the last budget towards helping businesses to integrate quantum and AI tech.It’s compared to the European Union’s €20 billion per-year target towards AI to 2030.“We’ve got a lot of ground to make up,” she added.Read More

Artificial Intelligence has been used in design and manufacturing for some time, since the deep learning revolution of the early 2010s at least.

However, designers, engineers, and architects are finding that the power of newly emerging generative AI – such as the foundation models that power ChatGPT – is potentially even more transformative.


The principle is simple. Through a natural language interface, designers can just explain what they want to make, what materials they have available and how it should work.

Then, just like ChatGPT finds the best way to put words together to make sentences, it finds the best way to make your ideas a reality.

It’s not just an exciting vision of how designers will work in the near future - it’s already being implemented today.
So, here’s a peek at how generative AI is changing the face of design, covering what we’ve seen so far and some ideas about how it will evolve in the future.
PROMOTED
How Is Generative AI Used In Design?
One of the key use cases is in the design of physical objects, components or products. Factors like material efficiency and production speed can be optimized by AIs that have been taught about the qualities of different materials and the pros and cons of every manufacturing process.
Siemens, for example, envisions a future where a manufacturing technician can get instant answers to questions about how changes to manufacturing processes will impact the finished product.

Of course, there are problems caused by hallucination – the tendency of today’s generation of generative AI models to confidently make mistakes.
Errors in the design or manufacturing process of objects could lead to products that are defective in a dangerous way. It’s fair to say human skills are currently needed to mitigate this - not just in design but in every field where generative AI is used. Just one of the reasons why I believe human jobs will be changed by AI rather than replaced by them in the near future.

In graphic design, too, generative AI is quickly proving to be useful. Nutella used algorithms to create millions of different unique packaging designs for its Nutella Unica range. Each jar is stamped with a code, allowing it to be identified by collectors of unique packaging art.

And it also has potentially transformative applications in architecture and urban planning. According to a McKinsey report on the impact of generative AI, it is being used to design buildings, shape urban landscapes, and augment human designers' skill sets at integrating their work with the natural environment.
Architects can use it to manipulate elements like room layout and features like stairwells and facades. Then, they can just set the parameters they need and let AI spit out multiple prototypes and candidates that fit the bill.
It's also being found to be a useful tool in fashion design. Hong Kong-based computer scientist Calvin Wong has created an AI fashion design assistant that generates outfits in seconds based on specific requirements and information on available materials. Aida – the AI-based Design Assistant – creates finalized design images for clothing in around ten seconds. The process usually takes weeks for human designers.
One company that is confidently betting on generative AI as the future of design and manufacturing is the long-established provider of industry-standard tools, Autodesk.
I recently spoke to the head of research at Autodesk, Mike Haley. He told me that AI has played a role in generative design for some time but has traditionally posed challenges, particularly around the huge amount of compute resources that were required.
The development of cloud-based generative AI platforms, though, has caused these barriers to come down, enabling many more creatives to understand its benefits for themselves.
Haley said, “I'm very optimistic that we're now seeing the emergence of those kinds of tools that can take that real-world information, can help us reason about it, and help us produce better designs for the world.”
The Future of Generative Design?
It’s obvious to me that generative AI has a lot of potential to augment abilities and streamline working processes in design.
But there are challenges, too. One of the biggest will be balancing the ongoing need for true human creativity with the desire to create efficiency through automation. Sure, AI can throw out 100 designs a second, but can we be sure that they all express the creative and technical flair that businesses want to put in front of their customers?
And, of course, there are ethical concerns about data ownership, authorship and intellectual property rights that still need to be worked out.
But overall, I see a future where tools available to designers and makers in all fields continue to become more intuitive and more useful for assisting with tasks involving human creativity.
Looking ahead, I believe we will see tools that become capable of more than creating-to-order, that are more able to understand and anticipate the nuanced needs of individual designers and brands.
They will also become more tuned towards enabling personalization at scale. This might even start to upend the long-held expectations of uniformity and the cookie-cutter approach that we have of mass-produced goods and products. Which certainly has the potential to make the world more interesting.

Given the recent interest and proliferation of accessible generative AI tools, C-suite professionals must quickly educate themselves on the opportunities this technology offers.
A global survey of the C-suite by Accenture found that 94% of leaders anticipate spending more on technology in 2024, with 75% specifically mentioning AI and machine learning (ML) as key areas of investment. 
A basic understanding for all leaders
“We’re past the question of ‘if’ AI should be integrated into their business strategies,” says Christopher Lane, head of data and AI, Accenture UKI. “It’s more a question of: ‘How do I confidently harness AI for efficiency and growth while the road is still being built and the guardrails are not yet in place?’”
This lack of a roadmap is causing concern for leaders. “The more we apply AI, the more we see its potential to augment human performance in ways that just 18 months ago would have been unimaginable,” says Lane. “There is a fundamental concern we’re hearing about whether organisations can keep pace with the technology.”





So, what knowledge do leaders need to feel more confident and secure as they progress themselves and their companies during this uncertain but exciting time? 
While leaders may not need to learn the deep intricacies of an algorithm, they do need to have some understanding of how generative AI works. This is particularly true for CEOs, as they balance challenges and opportunities stewarding their companies. However, they will need support from the technical leadership within the organisation.
“Generative AI is progressing extremely quickly with significant upside, but also risk which needs to be managed,” Lane explains. “Decisions taken now could impact strategic positioning in the future so an understanding of some of the mechanics of the technology, how it works and how it is deployed is essential.
New responsibilities for technical leaders
“This is not all on the CEO,” says Lane. “It is critical they have a C-suite around them that is AI literate and contains individuals with a real depth of competence and understanding. For years we’ve championed the need for deep technical proficiency in the C-suite. In line with this, we believe the chief technology officer (CTO), chief information officer (CIO) or chief data officer (CDO) will continue to play a decisive role in providing the technical insight and assurance for key decisions.” 
Those leaders with remit over technology and data will need to keep fully abreast of the latest developments in the space, informing their peers and providing insight on the value of new investments. 
“Tech and business strategies will become increasingly intertwined, so the decisions that CTOs make have a determining effect on the future of the business,” says Lane. 
To fulfil this role, CTOs, CIOs and chief information security officers (CISOs) must develop both their own and their team’s data management capabilities, while also leading on migrating their company to the cloud, if they haven’t already. 
“To unlock the fundamental value of data and AI, businesses need a solid data foundation centred on a thoughtful data migration strategy, a modern enterprise data platform on cloud, and a trusted, democratised and reusable set of data products that improve efficiency and speed to uncover new and actionable insights,” says Lane. 
Developments for non-technical leaders
These evolutions will, of course, need new skills to be acquired in the business. Chief human resources officers (CHROs) or chief people officers (CPOs) will have crucial roles to play in talent acquisition and reskilling the existing workforce. 
“Our analysis suggests that up to 40% of all working hours across industries could be impacted by generative AI,” Lane explains. “In this context, the essence of the CPO role may remain the same, but the scale and pace at which the workforce will need to evolve will be unprecedented and the criticality of the role amplified.”
The scale and pace at which the workforce will need to evolve will be unprecedented
Lane says that CPOs must fulfil two key roles in this new paradigm. Identifying and acquiring the skills needed to develop new AI-powered applications and creating a continuous learning culture that helps all employees work alongside generative AI. 
One area of the business that may have a headstart in this endeavour is the marketing team. Data from Econsultancy shows that 75% of marketers are planning on or are already using generative AI. Therefore, chief marketing officers (CMOs) must understand the possibilities in content production and how much money they can potentially save. 
While CMOs will be glad of the ability to stretch their budgets, there are significant legal and ethical questions which must be considered. They will need to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in copyright law, as the battle for who owns the intellectual property of AI-generated content rattles on. Lane also points out the potential negative backlash against AI-generated creative. 
“I know many creatives are terrified that the temptation to save money through delegating to technology will outweigh the benefits of human-created assets that may be more likely to delight their customers. This poses a fascinating question for CMOs around what modern creative excellence looks like for their organisations.”
A collective challenge 
Collectively, the C-suite must work together to deliver value on their technological investment. Lane suggests that this comes from identifying the processes that can be improved by generative AI, before testing the company’s ability to adapt to those changes.
The chief financial officer (CFO) will be crucial here. They will be best placed to contextualise the value of adopting new technologies and prioritise different strategic needs across the business. Machine learning programmes will likely bring efficiency here, as access to business insight reports should allow financial leaders to easily spot opportunities and risks.
Addressing those potential stumbling blocks will again be a concern for the entire executive team. Accenture’s data shows that while 69% of businesses have started implementing responsible AI practices, only 6% have operationalised that capability from end to end. 
“The desire to capitalise on AI innovation should never come at the expense of algorithmic transparency, privacy and data security,” says Lane. “This cannot just be about frameworks and principles, it needs to be backed up with systemic monitoring of how they are being applied.”

Generative AI (genAI) is a disruptive force, but just how disruptive? We all know that “it will be big.” But we are not quite sure just how big. My colleagues have explored aspects of this via recent research: The Generative AI Advantage and Forrester’s 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast, US. I am kicking off a new research stream with Ted Schadler, Julie Mohr, and others to further explore this topic. Our focus is the disruptive impacts that genAI will have on industries, markets, and economies. Today, companies in every industry are pursuing value from genAI, but this pursuit kicks off a cycle that will ultimately change industries, tech priorities, and markets, labor forces, and governments. Last week, Ted published our first blog on the topic: GenAI Will Shatter And Reconstruct Every Company And Industry. He poses some big questions at a business level about the fundamental economic forces that are being unleashed and how they will extend far beyond the current productivity-boosting wave that is coming.
The next step of this research stream is diving into the why and the technical how. We have two beliefs:

GenAI drives the cost of knowledge activation toward zero. Information technology drove the cost of data to zero, but using data to create value is still expensive. GenAI will blow up markets built around these costs because it can distill information into knowledge, on demand, at an inhuman scale. No business is safe from this disruptive force, and natural language is just the tip of the iceberg — code generation, material discovery (chemistry alone is a $5.7 trillion industry), architecture and engineering planning, and others. No body of human knowledge or firm that depends on it is out of reach. This will also have a huge consumer impact.
GenAI closes the knowledge cycle. GenAI creates a virtuous loop of expanding knowledge that will elevate demand for more captured knowledge to drive genAI. In simple terms, the more a company gains from genAI, the more it will lean into it, investing more and in hopes of capturing more and more knowledge. This kicks off a continuous cycle that will accelerate the impact of GenAI in every company. This will create new channels of value delivery, new industries, and big threats for those that do not adapt. GPT-3 unleashed that engine a year ago, but it is just spinning up. This will feed the next-generation private knowledge models — around, apart, and up we will go.


But just because these two realities impact every industry does not mean that this disruption will hit every firm equally. We believe that the impact will be based on use of knowledge to create business value. For example:

Firms that capture high-expertise knowledge will create value through amplification as human know-how “shifts left.” This is exactly what Forrester is doing with Izola, our client-facing genAI research tool. Clients come to our analysts for their deep expertise gained over years of research. We are amplifying that knowledge with Izola so that clients can get past the basics and engage with our analysts on the deeper challenges they face. As another example, service firms are seeing the potential of genAI to amplify the human value they deliver. They are experimenting with genAI to support rearchitecting entire technology stacks with models that ingest and distill large bodies of IT service management and enterprise system data. I believe that high-expertise firms will see human “know-how” concentrate at the beginning of value-creation pipelines, with genAI distributing that knowledge in more automated ways to the right.
Firms with lots of data and repeatable processes will turn efficiency into growth. I believe that every firm that depends on repeatable processes with lots of data will feel this. In software development, code-generating TuringBots are just the beginning. In the future, humans will supervise bots in the development of most routine software. Another example is Google DeepMind’s GNoME, which has predicted the structures of 2.2 million novel materials, of which 700 are now being created and tested. Competitors that are not making efficiency improvements by an order of magnitude or more using capabilities like these won’t be able to keep up. Leaders will take these savings and repurpose human talent to new value generation.
New software and service competitors will capitalize on knowledge capture and private model delivery. The opportunity for new services built around the knowledge cycle is immense. GenAI models can deal with nonperfect data, but you will need many of them tuned to specific use cases. Vendors and partners will help you. Graph databases will rise in importance, but digitizing and linking data is not easy. For example, the business of capturing and linking medical research information for life sciences is virtually untapped, requiring new ideas, venture investments, and technology innovations to scale up what is possible.

This is just the beginning. Our research will go deeper. If you are seeing the knowledge cycle develop, are seeing some of the changes happening because of it, or are interested in its potential, please email inquiry@forrester.com, and we can set up some time to talk.

Uri Haramati



					CEO , Torii				




December 14, 2023




 








Uri Haramati, CEO of Torii, explores the transformative power of Generative AI for IT professionals. Learn how AI tackles manual tasks, enhances workflows, and elevates strategic thinking amid growing challenges.
With job growth and hiring slowing over the past few months, many IT teams still need to be more relaxed to manage increased workloads with less time and people to get the job done. On top of that, their list of tasks continues to get larger – as do their tech stacks as employees continue to adopt new SaaS apps without necessarily consulting IT. To get an accurate view of all the different apps contributing to the company’s tech stack, understanding the costs of those apps and continuing to manage and update them requires manual processes – and time that could be spent on more mission-critical work.  
Generative AI, however, could take some of this tedious workload off of IT’s hands. Uri can explain how generative AI and other automation technologies can help IT streamline workflows, collect and fill in information about application changes, and guide IT pros through SaaS challenges.  
Today’s IT Pro 
The fuel gauge is empty, but they keep driving. This is the plight of today’s IT pro. Overburdened, understaffed, and lacking resources, the situation is deteriorating.
IT is expected to achieve more with less—a concerning trend long in the making, with no end in sight. Challenges such as a tight labor market, an aging workforce, and inconsistent attempts at digital transformation increase the burden on IT departments.
Much stress originates from the proliferation of cloud applications. While employees continue integrating new apps into the corporate stack, only a subset is disclosed to IT. This leaves IT departments uninformed and vulnerable, especially during budget cuts or security audits. Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope ahead.
Artificial Intelligence and the Hype Cycle
 Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, “The test of first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” Those ideas are that AI is a game-changing technology with practical benefits and that much of today’s AI software is essentially vaporware built on OpenAI APIs. During this period, it’s important to figure out how to ensure that AI genuinely benefits the IT industry’s future.
Its implementation must be carefully considered to make AI genuinely beneficial for IT professionals. The focus should shift from “What can AI do well?” to “Where does IT struggle?” Rather than developing features and hoping for market fit, the best way to do that is to talk to IT and ask where the bottlenecks are today.
Often, the bottlenecks are simple and manageable undertakings, but instead, they are the mundane work that IT professionals don’t want to do. Usually, these tasks take up too much time or are boring or easy to mess up. A great example of this is manual data entry. No IT professional wants to manually type text into a field or copy and paste it from dozens of PDFs. This is just one example of where the bottlenecks emerge. Still, it’s also an example of where the opportunities for silent innovation rest, not in showy features but in the quiet removal of busywork.

Examples of Silent AI Innovation Already Helping IT
Those tiny yet endless busy tasks are finally receiving attention. Work that was previously difficult to automate, often because the semantics of human language prevented automation, are now more accessible thanks to the impact of Large Language Models, which can navigate the complexity of human language.
Here are a few more examples of silently exciting innovations that help IT:

Manual data entry: This impact is seen in multiple aspects of IT work, especially within the SaaS Management space. Instead of letting humans manually enter contract data into a contract lifecycle management system, platforms can automatically ingest the data and even let IT professionals build workflows based on the dates and dollar amounts embedded in those documents. Another great example is updating a SaaS System of Record. More and more of that information can be automatically generated with a single click, making the system of record more complete in less time.
Mapping and categorizing apps: Keeping up with cloud app discovery takes a lot of work. Employees in the organization are adopting new apps daily. This is one area where AI algorithms provide tremendous time savings. AI can help to discover and map new applications as they are adopted automatically. AI can categorize newly discovered apps based on their role within the company, reveal their risk levels, and even catch and consolidate multiple implementations of the same application. These AI capabilities provide IT managers with a complete picture of their SaaS stack and save countless hours manually researching this information, allowing them to focus on higher-value actions such as cost savings, governance, or something else.
Finding SaaS answers: IT pros couldn’t ask their SaaS tools anything before generative AI. However, today, more and more tools allow their data to be analyzed, synthesized, and contextualized through AI. This puts IT professionals on equal footing with the data analyst for getting basic insights. Making these insights more accessible allows IT decision-makers to lean on data and make quicker, more informed, and more strategic decisions about their work.

While these innovations are silently exciting, they are just scratching the surface of AI capabilities. As the experimentation continues, IT professionals must develop evaluation criteria—a set of principles to guide their decisions regarding new AI technology.
Principles for Adopting AI Tools
If IT departments are contemplating adopting a new AI tool or feature, it’s critical to remember that successful implementation is both a technical and strategic challenge. To facilitate effective AI adoption, IT teams should focus on four crucial principles:

Alignment with Business Objectives
Scalability and Integration
Governance and Compliance
Culture and Fit

By concentrating on these principles, IT teams can make informed decisions that ensure the AI tool meets technical specifications and aligns with broader organizational objectives.

Alignment with business objectives: AI presents opportunities and challenges like SaaS in its early days. The initial step in evaluating any AI technology is to check its alignment with business goals. Does it positively impact the KPIs for which IT departments are accountable? One pitfall with AI is its novelty, making it tempting to pursue the latest innovation. However, it’s crucial to curb such impulses and concentrate on technologies contributing to long-term success. Adopting a results-oriented approach will facilitate ROI evaluation and guide future investments in AI.
Scalability and integration: Integration is increasingly indispensable as technology stacks grow more complex. Applications need to communicate and manage one another effectively. In the case of AI, this means thoroughly evaluating how a new tool or feature will fit into IT departments’ integration strategy, especially concerning scalability. Adopting new technology, particularly AI, becomes critical if the organization is engaged in a digital transformation, perhaps through methodologies like the Strangler Pattern.
Governance and compliance: AI initiatives carry significant legal and ethical ramifications for organizations, and the rise of shadow AI unauthorized AI tools employed by employees compounds these challenges. An effective AI strategy must comply with rigorous ethical and legal frameworks, especially as data privacy and security issues intensify. A governance model should be established, encompassing data stewardship and model interpretability components. This framework needs regular audits to maintain compliance with evolving regulations such as GDPR.
Culture and fit: Organizational culture and fit are pivotal yet often underestimated factors in AI adoption. If an AI tool necessitates drastic changes to existing processes, its implementation becomes a change management project—likely one that IT departments don’t have time to supervise. Should IT departments still find AI technology valuable, effective change management frameworks like ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) can prepare the staff and realign the organizational culture, facilitating successful technology deployment.

The Future of the AI Buyer
If history serves as a guide, technology hype cycles often lead to a trough of disillusionment—a period of collective regret and questioning. During this phase, transformative technologies typically emerge, shedding the excess and vaporware.
Equipped with guiding principles and well-defined priorities, IT professionals will be poised to navigate the AI landscape effectively, identifying solutions that alleviate work bottlenecks by removing the manual busy work allowing them to focus on the strategic and thoughtful work that truly matters. In retrospect, this period may be recognized for its impact on IT professionals, ironically making their jobs more manageable—and even more human—through adopting AI technology.

Three months in, the company is already recognizing changes in workflows and cost reduction.   ""Klarna's integration of AI across certain areas of the company is automating mundane and uninteresting tasks that are now done more efficiently and with higher quality with AI,"" said Martin Elwin, Klarna's engineering director. ""That has led to millions of dollars in efficiency savings."" Klarna, which offers payments, financial services and buy now/pay later lending, uses gen AI from OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed lab that has become well known in the past year as the developer of ChatGPT. While Klarna is one of the first payment companies to use gen AI on a large scale, other firms such as Stripe, the major card networks and Block are also using gen AI — a form of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning and Large Language Models to produce original content. The technology has the potential to revolutionize IT work, customer service and even product development, but these changes will also impact jobs.   ""We're also encouraging wider adoption of these tools among our team,"" Elwin said. ""Greater engagement not only streamlines our workflows, but also promotes skill development and innovation.""Whose job is it anyway?Seventy-nine percent of professional technology workers across industries have had some exposure to gen AI in 2023, and 22% say they are using it regularly in their own work, according to McKinsey. AI could replace up to 300 million full-time jobs by 2023, according to Nexford University. Customer service representatives, receptionists and accountants were the three top jobs likely to be replaced by gen AI, according to Nexford.

   Nexford also cited research from Goldman Sachs that found gen AI could add 7% to global GDP during that time, a trend that would create technology jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told The Telegraph, a British newspaper,  last week, that AI will perform more job functions, and the Swedish financial institution would no longer hire staff outside of its engineering department. Siemiatkowski said certain tasks outside of engineering can be done faster and more efficiently via AI. Klarna is not planning layoffs; work will be transferred to AI via attrition of human staff. Siemiatkowski also told the British paper that the hiring strategy is based on the potential of AI and not on business performance. Klarna returned to profitability in its more recent quarter after four years of losses. The company laid off about 10% of its workforce about a year ago, as the larger technology market suffered through a slump that followed fast growth during the pandemic. More recently, Klarna settled a labor dispute with Engineers of Sweden and Unionen. Before the settlement, the union told American Banker that AI's impact on work roles was not part of the Klarna dispute. The union did not provide comment for this story. Klarna's public relations office said the company had ""nothing more to add"" beyond what was in the Telegraph story. In a recent interview with National Mortgage News, a sister publication of American Banker,  Katherine Campbell, former chief marketing officer at AnnieMac Home Mortgage, said AI will reduce jobs in the mortgage industry. ""We know there's many people working on capabilities, including tokenization of data from borrowers. Once data marries data, we won't really need people in the middle to get hard copies of data,"" Campbell told NMN, noting that AI will also reduce pressure to reach productivity goals in specific time windows. ""This move by Klarna is a signal that other fintechs are going to be looking in the same direction, particularly in the customer service area, where there continues to be pressure to reduce costs by pushing consumers to chatbots,"" said Aaron McPherson, a principal at AFM Consulting.  McPherson said he has seen numerous examples of AI-driven chatbots, and their capabilities are becoming more impressive as they are integrated into underlying applications.       Payments   9 new AI moves in the payments industry   November 3, 2023 10:10 AM   ""Klarna is actually being cautious here,"" McPherson said. ""While it has frozen hiring, it is not planning additional layoffs, which suggests that it wants to wait and see how successful its gen AI investments are.""And hiring engineers goes against the conventional wisdom that gen AI will put programmers out of work by automating coding, according to McPherson. ""Siemiatkowski seems to see AI as more of a growth opportunity than a cost-cutting one, but it is both. That makes it more likely that other companies will go further.""Gen AI at KlarnaOne of the early benefits of gen AI is streamlining customer service. The most common reason customers contact customer service is to ask why they have been denied credit, Elwin said. Traditionally, this required time-consuming investigations by human agents, sometimes involving expert analysts. Klarna recently started using Large Language Models to analyze plain-text questions from customer service agents on why a customer's purchase was denied. It then generates custom structured query language requests (SQL refers to a programming language that makes it easier to work with data).Klarna uses these SQL requests to gather information from various databases to be summarized by an LLM in a draft response, which the agent reviews before it's sent to the customer. ""This helps us get an answer to the customer's question in minutes rather than days,"" Elwin said. Another recently-launched gen-AI product for customer service has made solving merchant disputes more efficient, saving at a rate of more than 60,000 hours annually, according to Elwin. ""We see a massive opportunity to leverage AI in ways which will both improve our products for consumers, and also make work more interesting and engaging for Klarna employees,"" Elwin said.  ""By automating mundane tasks, Klarna employees can spend their time on more interesting work.""At other financial institutions, recent uses of gen AI include automating corporate travel at Brex, fintech investors funding companies that use gen AI to mitigate fraud and Commonwealth Bank of Australia using the technology to combat financial abuse. CBA is also considering how gen-AI-powered bots could test new products, though the bank insists the bots will not replace human testing. Few, if any of these uses, directly impact jobs at this point. AI is already having an impact across financial services, and the payments industry is no exception, said Aaron Press, research director for worldwide payment strategies at IDC Insights. ""Risk and fraud management have been leveraging AI for several years,"" Press said. With the advent of gen AI and LLMs, the biggest impacts will be on customer service, where there is already gen AI use in limited production, Press said, adding that gen AI will also be present in exception handling and dispute management. ""People will still be important, but AI will make them more efficient, which may mean fewer people will be needed in those roles. My hope is that AI-driven automation will mean re-deployment rather than layoffs,"" Press said.

According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, generative AI has the potential to automate tedious workplace tasks that absorb up to 70% of employees’ time, freeing up their availability for more meaningful and fulfilling functions of their jobs.One significant challenge in WFM is catering to deskless workers. These employees often face high turnover rates and may not have the opportunity or desire to undergo intensive software training. Enter generative AI. Imagine a world where all workforce management functions and deep expertise around compliance management or corporate policies are accessible through a simple conversation. No menus, no complicated interfaces—just natural dialogue that understands and executes requests. This is revolutionary for the large swath of frontline hourly workers who typically prefer immediacy and simplicity.Generative AI is poised to revolutionize software engagement, heralding a new era where WFM becomes seamlessly intuitive for the deskless worker. It will provide them with access to powerful WFM functions and tap into deep expertise through simple conversational interactions. By harnessing the power of natural language processing and intelligent automation, generative AI not only understands but also effectively executes user requests.Let’s explore three key ways generative AI can improve WFM processes.#1: Personalized, Knowledgeable, and Actionable Virtual Assistant From Siri to Alexa and beyond, virtual assistants already have a prolific presence in our daily lives – but generative AI is making them even more powerful and specific in their functions.When embedded in a WFM solution, an AI-powered virtual assistant can streamline the process of sourcing expert information into a simple dialogue of question-and-answer. With access to knowledge bases across the business, the WFM platform itself, and curated third-party sources – such as .gov websites for compliance inquiries – a generative AI assistant can instantly procure real-time insights that directly answer user questions. Not only can the virtual assistant source information, but it can also take immediate action on the information.Hourly workers, especially those in the service industries, can’t be tethered to a computer or tablet. And they don’t have the time to learn to navigate complex backend software programs. A personalized, knowledgeable, and actionable generative AI assistant will solve these woes by empowering workers to quickly access the information they need and autonomously act on that information. In doing so, it will boost employees’ skills and increase their engagement with the platform to achieve greater productivity.That said, there are privacy and security risks associated with a generative AI assistant. Administrators must ensure that the AI interface delivers contextual information. That way, associates aren’t accidentally given manager-only information, and managers aren’t locked out of any sensitive insights that may be critical to their specific role.As these technologies are in an early stage of development, they also carry the potential for erroneous outputs, or ‘hallucinations.’ Solutions that allow for any data to be included in the results set are at most risk. Look for solutions that carefully curate the data sources allowed to be accessed by the virtual assistant, such as trusted government sites, including the U.S. Department of Labor, and company handbooks and policy guides. #2: Facilitating employee actionsIt’s not enough for a generative AI assistant to simply disseminate information through the WFM platform; an effective program should also help employees automatically execute WFM tasks through voice or text commands to drive productivity.Employees could ask the system what shifts are open this week and automatically claim a shift. Managers would automatically be notified of the change to the schedule. Consultation with a virtual assistant will also become indispensable to managers, as the program can provide quick insights into business processes that will enable better management and decision-making. When managers have instant access to these insights, as well as recommended next steps, they’ll be less prone to error because they’ll have all the resources they need at their immediate disposal. This way, they can better guide their employees and set the whole business up for success.#3: Coaching and training employeesTraining new employees can be one of the most rewarding aspects of a manager’s job – but it can also be one of the most time-consuming. Deskless workers in labor-intensive industries often lack technical expertise and may struggle to learn new technologies, especially if those technologies are brought in to replace a system they may have been working with for years.Generative AI has the potential to further streamline employee learning and development by allowing employees to ask questions and execute actions through simple commands. Managers can get step-by-step guides for performing key WFM tasks like creating schedules or approving punch exceptions. Employees can get guidance on how to submit their schedule preferences, change their availability, claim an open shift, request time off, and many other key tasks. Employees and managers can get tailored answers based on their organization’s employee handbook, labor standards, and training content.Employees and managers get clear, direct answers, and the system can automatically take action based on the answers, reducing the risk of error and helping employees to be more productive in their jobs.Things to consider: Take caution with generative AIGenerative AI has indisputable potential to transform our work processes, but it also raises concerns about change management. Businesses must have buy-in from managers and help them understand that AI is meant to support them so they can do their job effectively: facilitate decision-making, spend more time training and coaching their teams, and improve the quality of customer interactions.While some tech leaders have expressed concerns about rapid generative AI development, it’s clear there is a growing need for these types of technologies, especially in labor-intensive industries like retail and hospitality. As with any new technology, there will be hurdles to jump through when adopting generative AI, but many businesses are already creating a foundation by leveraging AI in their workforce management processes. WFM solutions that include multiple AI techniques, such as machine learning, optimization, and generative AI, can help businesses transform labor efficiency and employee engagement.

The emergence of the Internet could have been a death blow, but the company survived — and thrived. Over the past 15 years, its stock price grew from a low of $20 in 2008 to $170 today as it diversified into new areas of business, research, and workflow products for legal, accounting, and tax professionals.
Most recently, in June, it spent $650 million to buy Casetext, a 104-employee company that offers an AI assistant for legal professionals powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, the same large language model (LLM) behind ChatGPT. But that’s not the only big bet the company is making on generative AI.
It also plans to spend $100 million per year to add generative AI technology to its flagship products, and has already built its Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform, and released its first generative AI assistant for its legal research tool, Westlaw Precision. A more powerful AI assistant is planned to become the interface across other Thomson Reuters products next year. The goal is to shift the company from simply providing information to enterprises, says Mary-Alice Vuicic, chief people officer.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s about how you shift roles to become more of a strategic partner, with more creative problem solving and more influencing,” she says. “We see huge value unlock in that.”

Generative AI will be key, improving the speed and quality of work in order to free up employee time to focus on these higher-value activities. Training and upskilling are also integral to this transformation, she says. “We’re taking this very seriously.”
In April, the company launched its generative AI education initiative with a global learning day, attended by 14,000 people. It covered the basics of AI and machine learning, generative AI and LLMs. This was followed by a six-hour course on AI and ML foundations, taken by 9,000 employees — with 3,000 more in progress.
 
 
 













 
 

“And the marketing department has launched Generative AI University in the marketing team curriculum,” Vuicic says. For more technical employees, there’s another course, about eight hours long, for 6,000 developers and engineers.
The bulk of the learning material was developed in-house, she says, with involvement from the head of product engineering and other technology and lab team members. Next year, this will be extended with the creation of new job roles inside different functional units, specifically dedicated to reskilling and integration.
“These reskiller and integrator roles are going to be essential to large-scale adoption of generative AI,” she says. “You have to dedicate headcount and resources to this, otherwise, it’ll be lost in the day-to-day.”
 
 
 













 
 

She says that Thomson Reuters is already seeing a positive business impact from the generative AI training.

“In areas like product engineering and customer services, we’re automating lower-level tasks and administrative work, and improving quality,” she says. “We’re seeing people able to better solve customer problems in significantly less time. The next set in training is about how we capture that augmentation and elevation. What does it mean to be a business partner? How do you apply strategic problem-solving?”
This is a new era of business transformation, she says, and will require a comprehensive rethinking of how jobs are structured.
 
 
 













 
 

Thomson Reuters isn’t alone in adopting generative AI, and needing to respond to the transformative pressures and opportunities this creates. As enterprises race to integrate cutting-edge tools and platforms, a greater focus to reskill employees on responsible and effective deployment becomes mission-critical.
According to an Ernst & Young survey of 1,200 global CEOs released in late October, a staggering 99% are either planning or are already making significant investments in generative AI.
Meanwhile, according to a Nash Squared survey of over 2,100 tech leaders, released in November, 54% say skill shortages prevent them from keeping up with the pace of change. At the basic level, every employee who uses AI applications will need to be somewhat familiar with prompt engineering, says Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.
 
 
 













 
 

Prompt engineering, at the end-user level, is about knowing how to ask questions in a way that gets the best response from a generative AI tool. At the developer level, it has additional nuances, involving, for example, embedding supplemental information from a vector database. Engineers might also need to learn how to fine-tune models, he says, and some employees should learn how to safely, ethically, and responsibly deploy AI models.
“Generative AI systems carry a lot of risk for enterprises,” he says. “There are risks around hallucinations, and the fact they’re black boxes in nature. And then there are the legal risks.”
Integrating gen AI in product, employee workflows
PhotoRoom is a 54-employee company that has developed AI-photo editing software, downloaded by more than 100 million people, but it has two main challenges related to generative AI. The first, says Eliot Andres, co-founder and CTO, is to add the latest AI features to the app itself to keep it competitive. The second is to enable everyone at the company to use generative AI tools in their own workflows.
 
 
 













 
 

As soon as Stable Diffusion, the first open-source diffusion model, came out in mid-2023, the company immediately pivoted.
“We stopped everything,” says Andres. “We said, ‘Stop what you’re doing. This is going to be a game-changer for photography. We need to learn how to use those tools and integrate them into our product. This is a big deal.’”
To jump-start the process, the company held a three-day hackathon to understand what the new diffusion models were capable of.
 
 
 













 
 

“Since then, every time there’s a new technology, we tell people to use the latest tools,” he says. “There are new diffusion models coming out, and we’re always encouraging employees to play with them.”

The company also has an internal channel where the latest research papers are shared. One popular source of information on latest developments is @_akhaliq on X (formerly Twitter).
For internal workflows, the challenge is slightly different. Here, instead of learning about the underlying technical aspects of creating generative AI models, employees have to learn how to use generative AI tools.
 
 
 













 
 

PhotoRoom doesn’t have a formal training program, he says. Instead, the company uses a teach-by-example approach, with employees who find useful new tools educating their peers using Slack and other channels. Andres’ advice? Give employees the freedom to experiment.
“If you limit your employees to a single tool approved by the company, you might be missing huge opportunities or something that’s transformational for your company,” he says. “Let them find the best tools for their job. If someone uncovers a tool that boosts their productivity, encourage them and try to spread the word to other employees.”
Leveling up for generative AI
Healthcare technology vendor athenahealth has over 6,500 employees, more than 1,200 of whom are engineers, and generative AI is core to the company’s product development roadmap — and to internal productivity improvements. And training is how the company will get there.
 
 
 













 
 

“We’ve offered a number of rounds of training, including third-party prompt engineering training, and workshops,” says Heather Lane, the company’s senior architect of data science. “There’s an enormous amount of training material out there, so we don’t have to develop it all in-house. We’ve also brought in external speakers who’ve talked about both the high-level state of generative AI and specific materials about how it may be reflected in the healthcare space, where they see the technological development going, where they see the risk.”
So far, more than 700 people have attended generative AI knowledge sessions, more than 1,200 hours of generative AI training have been consumed, and 300 developers have completed a generative AI bootcamp.
The problem, she says, is there’s too much material out there, and most of it isn’t useful. Filtering down to the part you care about is the challenge, as well as the pace of change. “It’s not like drinking from a firehose,” she adds. “It’s like standing under Niagara Falls and trying to take a sip. It’s absolutely insane.”
 
 
 













 
 

Marketing takes the lead on gen AI
IT services firm Ensono has over 3,400 employees, just 27 of whom are in marketing. But it’s the marketing department that’s been spearheading generative AI.
“It’s helping us do more with less,” says Jonathan Bumba, the company’s chief marketing officer. “Things that used to take several hours now take a few minutes; things that used to take several days now get done in a few hours; and things that we couldn’t do before at all we can now do in a reasonable amount of time.”

The company is using a wide variety of generative AI tools to create content and connect with customers, including ChatGPT, Dall-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and Salesloft among others.
 
 
 













 
 

“We started playing with it right away,” he says.
When the technology first started coming out, the team was mesmerized. “Then we were disillusioned pretty quickly,” he says. “We’re just not prompt engineers. I wanted my team to lean in and embrace this, but I could feel the frustration of not getting the output we were looking for.” He tried Coursera and LinkedIn courses, but they just weren’t specific enough, Bumba says.
Even vendor-provided courses were too general. “Without knowing our workflows and what we’re trying to do, none of it was terribly helpful,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

His team struggled to figure things out on their own until the middle of this year. Then in September, Bumba brought in a boutique consulting firm, AI Technology Partners, to identify specific generative AI use cases, figure out the right tooling, and create customized training workshops for employees based on his team’s actual workflows.

“After the training workshop was over, we still put them on retainer so we can reach out to them with real-world projects,” he says. “They walk us through it and help us build prompts so we can continue to do this after they’re gone.”
Looking back, he says he wishes he’d gotten help sooner.
“I waited too long to ask for help, wasting months thinking we could figure this out ourselves,” he says. “I’d like to have those months back. In this new world, a three-month delay means someone else had a three-month head start on me. In the world of AI, this matters. He or she who learns first, wins.”
 
 
 













 
 

Large-scale upskilling
“PricewaterhouseCoopers has the commitment to give its people the most in-demand skills for today and tomorrow,” says PwC partner Robin Stein. “We realized very quickly we had to upskill our 75,000 people on the foundations of generative AI, how to apply gen AI responsibly, and how to become a prompt engineer.”
Because the company has a multi-generational workforce, it’s using a wide array of modalities, training approaches, and learning pathways, she says — everything from gamification to in-person seminars.
“Some people want to read an article and some want to listen to a podcast,” she says. “And there’s some gamification, including a live trivia game where people can earn rewards, which helps drive excitement about some of these programs.”
The final element is to give people tools they can use to apply these new skills.
“The adoption and engagement has been incredible, and people are highly interested and highly motivated to figure out how this will affect them,” she says.
Completing gen AI 101
Wipro Technologies is a technology and consulting firm with 245,000 employees. Of those, 200,000 have already completed basic generative AI training, says COO Amit Choudhary.
“We want all our people to be trained on generative AI,” he says.
The basic level of training includes a definition of what generative AI is, its history, and what responsible AI is all about.
“We want to educate our team members that there are risks to doing this,” he says. “And responsible AI means different things for legal people, for financial team members, or for cybersecurity experts.”
This program was developed in-house, he says, because the company started training earlier this year and there wasn’t enough external material available at the time.
Then employees move on to external training from external partners. That includes Udemy, Coursera, and LinkedIn, he says, as well as vendor-provided materials from companies like Microsoft, AWS, and Google for employees working on specific platforms.
Once the foundations are in place, Wipro offers industry- and function-specific training, such as what gen AI means for manufacturing, finance, HR, and supply chain management. As this is all created in-house, Wipro created an AI council earlier this year to handle it, tasked with building advanced courses customized to the individual requirements of the company.
There are hundreds of people involved in the training development process, Choudhary says, with a core team of over two dozen that creates the learning content and tracks its progress through the organization. Then there are all the people involved to execute the training plan, such as practice managers and service managers.
“We have consultants who are industry and domain-specific,” he says. “We have technologists who are high-end engineers, and a team of designers. We put all these people together, plus our partners and vendors. Our AI council sees the content coming in from outside, and the content we develop inside.” 
And it’s not enough just to get the theoretical knowledge, he says. “Just telling them what it means is the first step. We’re also doing hackathons, and are now working on gamification of the training we already have. We also have our own platform for coders, where we give them live projects to work on as competitions. Once they’ve done some advanced courses, this is a problem they can solve.”

AI Is Transforming Corporate Learning Even Faster Than I Expected

Of all the domains to be impacted by AI, perhaps the biggest transformation is taking place in corporate learning. After a year of experimentation, it’s now clear that AI will revolutionize this space.
Let’s discuss what L&D is all about. Corporate training is everywhere, and that’s why it’s a $340 billion market. Everything that happens at work (from onboarding to filling out an expense account to complex operational procedures) somehow requires training. And even during recessions, the corporate spending on L&D remains steady at $1200-1500 per person on average.
Yet as L&D professionals know, the problem is highly complex. There are hundreds of training platforms, tools, content libraries, and approaches. I estimate the L&D technology space at over $14 billion in size, and that doesn’t even include systems like search engines, knowledge management tools, and platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex. And over the years we’ve been through many evolutions: e-learning, blended learning, micro-learning, and now learning in the flow of work.
Generative AI is about to change all this forever.







Consider the problem we face. Corporate training is not really about teaching, it’s about creating an environment of learning. Traditional instructional design, which is teacher-led and process-focused, often falls short at work. People learn in many ways, often without a teacher, and they look for reference materials, copy what others are doing, and rely on managers, peers, and experts to help. So traditional instructional design models must be extended to help people learn what they need.
Enter generative AI, a technology that’s designed to synthesize information. Generative AI tools like Galileo™ can understand, consolidate, reorganize, and deliver information from a large corpus in ways that traditional instructional designers could not. This AI-driven approach to learning is not only more efficient but also more effective, enabling learning in the flow of work. And users can ask whatever question they want, with answers relevant to their need.
In the early days learning in the flow of work meant searching for information and hoping to find something relevant. This process was time-consuming and often fruitless. Generative AI, through its magic of neural networking, is now poised to solve these problems, acting as a Swiss Army knife for L&D.
Here’s a simple example. I asked Galileo™, which is powered by 25 years of research and case studies, “How do I deal with an employee who’s always late? And please give me a narrative to help?” Rather than take me to a course on management or show me a bunch of videos, it simply answered the question. This type of interaction is where much of corporate learning is going.







Let me summarize four major use cases for AI in L&D:
Generating Content: AI can dramatically reduce the time and complexity involved in content creation. For instance, Arist, a mobile learning tool, has an AI generation feature Sidekick that can convert comprehensive operational information into a series of instructional activities. This process, which could take weeks or even months, can now be completed in days or even hours.
We use Arist in The Josh Bersin Academy, and our new mobile courses are coming out almost monthly now. Other tools like Sana, Docebo Shape and the user-focused learning platform 360 Learning are just as exciting.
Personalizing the Learner Experience: AI can help tailor learning paths to individual needs, improving upon traditional models that assign learning paths based on job roles. AI can understand the details of content and use that information to personalize the learning experience. This approach is far more effective than the cluttered learning experience platforms (LXPs) that often fail to truly understand the details of the content.
Uplimit, a startup dedicated to building an AI platform to help teach AI, is using its Cobot and other tools to personalize coaching and tips for technical professionals learning about AI. Cornerstone’s new AI fabric recommends courses by skill, Sana’s platform connects tools like Galileo to learning, and the new AI-features in SuccessFactors also give users a curated view of learning based on role and activity.
Identifying and Developing Skills: AI can help identify skills within content and infer the skills of individuals. This aids in delivering the right training and determining its effectiveness. While many companies are working on high-level skills taxonomy strategies, the real value lies in the granular, domain-specific skills that can be identified and developed through AI.
Eightfold, Gloat, and SeekOut, pioneers in talent intelligence, can infer employee skills and immediately recommend learning solutions. We are actually using this technology to introduce our HR Career Navigator, coming early next year.
Replacing Training With Knowledge Tools: Perhaps the most disruptive use case of AI in L&D is the potential to replace certain types of training altogether. AI can create intelligent agents or chatbots that provide information and solve problems, potentially eliminating the need for certain types of training. This approach is not only more efficient but also more effective, as it provides individuals with the information they need when they need it.
Walmart is implementing this today, and our new platform Galileo is helping companies like Mastercard and Rolls Royce find HR information and policy information on-demand without training. LinkedIn Learning is opening up its soft-skills content to Gen AI search and soon enough the Microsoft Copilot will locate training through Viva Learning.
One important “gotcha” here: we are going to have to teach ourselves (and employees) how to “prompt” these systems. I’m sure our AI tools will get smarter and more conversational quickly, but for 2024 we’re going to spend quite a bit of time teaching users how to prompt AI systems to give us the answer we want.
The Potential Here Is Massive
In all my years as an analyst, I’ve never seen a technology with so much potential. AI will revolutionize the L&D landscape, reinventing how we do our work so L&D professionals can spend time consulting with the business.
What should L&D professionals do? Take some time to learn about this technology, or join some of our new AI courses in The Josh Bersin Academy to learn more.
As you get access to tools like Galileo, I know you will be astounded by the opportunities ahead. The future of L&D has arrived, and it’s all powered by AI.

After a year of experimentation, it&#039;s now clear that AI will revolutionize this space.  Let&#039;s discuss what L&amp;D is all about. Corporate training is everywhere, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s a $340 billion market. Everything that happens at work (from onboarding to filling out an expense account to complex operational procedures) somehow requires training. And even during recessions, the corporate spending on L&amp;D remains steady at $1200-1500 per person on average.  Yet as L&amp;D professionals know, the problem is highly complex. There are hundreds of training platforms, tools, content libraries, and approaches. I estimate the L&amp;D technology space at over $14 billion in size, and that doesn&#039;t even include systems like search engines, knowledge management tools, and platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex. And over the years we&#039;ve been through many evolutions: e-learning, blended learning, micro-learning, and now learning in the flow of work.

“If a copyrightable work is used as the starting point for a finished work that will contain generative material, that may open a loophole…to ensuring copyright protection over subsequent exploitations of the finished work, and the portions of the work that may not be entirely human creation.”

SURYAST – Source: U.S. Copyright Office letter
On December 11, the Review Board of the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) released a letter affirming the USCO’s refusal to register a work created with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. The decision to affirm the refusal marks the fourth time a registrant has been documented as being denied the ability to obtain a copyright registration over the output of an AI system following requests for reconsideration.
The work in question is a two-dimensional computer-generated image titled “SURYAST” that was created by Ankit Sahni, in part, using a custom-developed software program named RAGHAV. The USCO’s analysis focuses on issues such as lack of human control, contradictory descriptions of the tool (such as whether it is a filter or a more robust generative tool), and whether the expressive elements of the work were human authored.
Meet RAGHAV
Sahni submitted an application to register the work in December 2021 and listed himself and the AI painting app as the two authors. More specifically, Sahni noted an original photograph as part of his authorship, while the software was listed as solely contributing the “2-D artwork.”
In response to the USCO’s request for additional information, Sahni provided a 17-page supplement explaining the technology and how it was used. He explained the process involved use of his original photograph of a sunset along with an image of Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night for the “style” to be copied by the AI tool.
In June 2022, the USCO issued its initial refusal to register the work because of the lack of human authorship, noting the inability to separate the human authorship from “the final work produced by the computer program.” It also noted that the work was a “classic example[] of derivative authorship” because, as the Review Board writes, “it was a digital adaptation of a photograph.”
Source: U.S. Copyright Office letter
In September 2022, Sahni requested a reconsideration. He argued “the human authorship requirement does not and cannot mean a work must be created entirely by a human author.” However, the USCO upheld the initial refusal and denied the first request for reconsideration.
The second request for reconsideration came in July 2023 and presented three arguments. The first argument involved an assertion that RAGHAV’s role was only as an “assistive software tool” with ultimate creative control in the hands of Sahni through the selection of his original starting photograph, the inclusion of The Starry Night, and the additional variables under his control. The second argument focused on the human-authored elements in the work that he sought to register. The third argument sought to attack the classification of the machine-generated work as a derivative work due to its lack of substantial similarity and that the “human author’s total creative input in both the original photograph and the Work should be considered together […]”. For example, Sahni pointed to the way in which a painter might sketch on their canvas or a sculptor assembles clay before reaching a final form.
A large portion of the USCO’s analysis is spent exploring the discrepancies between Sahni’s recounting of the creative process and functionality of his tool. The USCO focuses on the level of control Sahni retained over RAGHAV, noting the description provided in the second request for reconsideration “inaccurately minimizes RAGHAV’s role in the creation of the Work and conflicts with other information in the record.”
After reviewing the provided research, the USCO concludes: “RAGHAV’s interpretation of Mr. Sahni’s photograph in the style of another painting is a function of how the model works and the images on which it was trained on—not specific contributions or instructions received from Mr. Sahni.”
Fourth Time, Not the Charm
In June, the USCO reiterated its focus on the application of the de minimis standard when determining whether or not a work that contains generative material is eligible for copyright protection. The standard, taken from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Feist v. Rural Telephone and solidified as policy in the USCO’s Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence, requires that “AI-generated content that is more than de minimis should be explicitly [disclosed and] excluded from the application.” The generative material is not protectable and would be considered public domain.
Beginning in February 2022, the Review Board upheld the USCO’s first documented refusal to register “A Recent Entrance to Paradise” when Dr. Stephen Thaler attempted to register the work originally with the AI software as the author and himself as the claimant. The refusal to register was challenged in federal court as part of a continued effort of Thaler and his supporters to exhaust a multitude of legal theories attacking the human authorship requirement that the USCO identified as well-established. As of August, the district court decided in favor of the USCO and leaves Thaler in pursuant of an appeal to overturn the decision.
The second documented refusal to register a generative AI work came in February, following a series of investigations beginning in the fall of 2022 into a previously granted registration of a graphic novel by Kris Kashtanova. The USCO ultimately decided to partially cancel its previously issued registration due to the “randomly generated noise that evolves into a final image” when using the AI-powered text-to-image generation tool Midjourney. Kashtanova has since decided against pursuing a challenge to the partial cancellation, and now works as a Senior Creative Evangelist in AI at Adobe.
In September, the Review Board upheld the USCO’s third documented refusal to register a generative AI work, Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, that became internet famous for winning in the digital arts category at the 2022 Colorado State Fair’s annual fine art competition.
It’s also worth noting that the United States isn’t the first jurisdiction in which Sahni attempted to register the SURYAST work. In 2020, the work was recognized for copyright protection by the copyright office in India when Sahni filed a second application listing himself and the AI software as the authors. The registration later received a withdrawal notice and became subject to an investigation over the use of a machine. Under India’s copyright law, the issue turns on whether or not: (i) AI is capable of meeting the originality requirement, and (ii) the ‘person’, a term that remains undefined in India’s Copyright Act, that is responsible for the computer-generated work (which are recognized under the country’s copyright law) must be a human.
Protecting Partially Generative Derivative Works
An important practical takeaway from this latest development is that the original photograph used as the grounding for a prompt is likely protectable human authorship. Meanwhile, the output of the digital manipulation is not a protectable derivative. This distinction is strategically important for creatives working with generative AI tools.
The USCO has made it clear that generative works are not protectable, and therefore considered public domain. If a copyrightable work is used as the starting point for a finished work that will contain generative material, that may open a loophole (for lack of a better term) to ensuring copyright protection over subsequent exploitations of the finished work, and the portions of the work that may not be entirely human creation.
For example, there may be enough of Sahni’s original photograph contained in the final version of SURYAST to bring claims of infringement if anyone copies, distributes, or otherwise uses the work in an unauthorized manner. It would require Sahni to register the original photograph and meet the other requirements for protection, but theoretically could strengthen any argument against the generative derivative work as being fully in the public domain.
Of course, another key takeaway is that creators should strongly consider having a fully developed legal strategy when communicating with the USCO. This latest letter from the USCO contains critical examples of where changing descriptions of an artistic process, and the tools used, can prove to be detrimental to creators and undermine their attempts to bring clarity as the USCO reviews their application.
Alex Garens of Day Pitney, LLP, is listed as the counsel for Sahni to receive the correspondence with the USCO.

More than half of workers using generative AI in the workplace are doing so without the formal approval of their employers.
That’s according to a global study by Salesforce involving over 14,000 global workers across 14 countries, shedding light on the challenges and risks associated with the unregulated use of this transformative technology.
Despite coordinated efforts by governments worldwide, including the U.S. and the EU, to establish guidelines for responsible AI use, the research suggests that businesses are lagging behind in implementing clear policies. This lack of defined policies poses potential risks to businesses, as employees are leveraging generative AI without proper training, guidance, or approval.









Surprisingly, almost 4 in 10 (39%) global workers state that their employers do not hold a strong opinion about generative AI use in the workplace.
Growing use of generative AI
A striking 28% of workers currently use generative AI at work, with over half doing so without formal approval. An additional 32% expect to incorporate generative AI into their workflow soon, indicating a trend that will persist with or without oversight, found Salesforce.
Even as workers engage in the use of unapproved generative AI tools, they acknowledge the importance of ethical and safe use by adopting company-approved programs. However, alarming trends emerge as 64% of users admit to passing off generative AI work as their own, and 41% would consider overstating their skills to secure job opportunities.
The responsibility does not solely lie with the workers; the survey reveals that nearly 7 in 10 global workers have never received training on the safe and ethical use of generative AI at work. Furthermore, workers express dissatisfaction with their employers' lack of clearly defined or non-existent generative AI policies.
Certain industries, such as healthcare, are identified as laggards in implementing policies, with 87% of workers claiming their companies lack clear guidelines. This raises urgent concerns, especially considering the confidential data involved in such industries, highlighting the need to skill up workers on responsible use.

Clear guidelines needed for AI
Workers, cognizant of the impact of generative AI on their careers, express the belief that mastering the technology would make them more sought after (47%), result in increased job satisfaction (51%), and potentially lead to higher pay (44%).
“To realize AI’s full potential, it’s critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself,” emphasized Paula Goldman, Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer at Salesforce. ""With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers.""
The study, conducted in partnership with YouGov from October 18 to 31, 2023, surveyed over 14,000 full-time employees across various sectors in 14 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, the Nordics, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates.

Recent findings from a survey of more than 14,000 workers across 14 countries uncovers that many users of generative AI in the workplace are leveraging the technology without training, guidance, or approval by their employer. Workers have recognized how critical generative AI is in advancing their own careers, and businesses must quickly respond with clear, trusted guidelines to ensure the technology is enterprise-ready and used responsibly. GenAI tools penetrating workplace without oversightOver a quarter (28%) of workers are currently using generative AI at work, and over half without the formal approval of their employers. With an additional 32% expecting to use generative AI at work soon, it&rsquo;s clear that penetration of the technology will continue &mdash; with or without oversight.  Not only do workplace users tap into unapproved generative AI tools at work, they do so while still recognizing that the ethical and safe use of generative AI means adopting company-approved programs. Users are also engaging in additional ethically questionable activities at work when using generative AI &mdash; for example, by passing off AI as their own work or inflating their ability to use the technology. 64% have passed off generative AI work as their own41% of workers would consider overstating their generative AI skills to secure a work opportunity  The onus doesn&rsquo;t fall entirely on the workers themselves &mdash; nearly 7 in 10 global workers have never completed or received training on how to use generative AI safely and ethically at work. Ambiguous GenAI policies at workNot only do respondents report a lack of training, workers around the world note their employers&rsquo; generative AI policies are not clearly defined or non-existent. Certain industries lag behind more than others &mdash; for example, 87% of global workers in the healthcare industry claim their company lacks clear policies. With the level of confidential data held in this industry and others, there is an urgency to skill up workers on responsible use. In fact, nearly 4 in 10 (39%) global workers say their employer doesn&rsquo;t hold a strong opinion about generative AI use in the workplace. To seize the benefits of generative AI, businesses must guide their workforce on responsible useWhether or not they use generative AI in the workplace, workers recognize the impact of the technology on their careers &mdash; nearly half (47%) of workers believe mastering generative AI would make them more sought after in the workplace, over half (51%) believe it would result in increased job satisfaction, and 44% say it would mean they would be paid more than those who don&rsquo;t master the technology.  Users also say they are more productive and engaged since using the technology. And half of global workers surveyed &mdash; regardless of whether they use generative AI or not &mdash; believe mastering generative AI will result in: Increased job satisfaction (51%)Being sought after in the workplace (47%) Being paid more than those who do not master the technology (44%) &ldquo;To realize AI&rsquo;s full potential, it&rsquo;s critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself,&rdquo; said Paula Goldman, Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer at Salesforce. &ldquo;With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI&rsquo;s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers.&rdquo; ",Artificial Intelligence,https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Online Bureau', 'url': 'https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/author/479261596/online-bureau'}, {'@type': 'Thing', 'name': 'ET CIO', 'url': 'https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'ETCIO', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564648-et-cio-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-106010063,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4/.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}]","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",ETCIO,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564648-et-cio-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@etcio.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helpful Or Harmful? How AI Shaped Education In 2023
Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the classroom. Students and educators weigh in on the way forward.

When artificial intelligence went mainstream with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, it immediately sent ripples through the world of education. Concerns about equity in AI, data privacy, and how to teach ethical AI skills became heated topics at faculty meetings and in classrooms. Two things have become clear: This technology is already transforming education—and people have many questions.
Science Friday hosted a virtual conversation with experts in AI and education in October 2023 to understand the potential AI holds for education and some of the pitfalls to be confronted as it comes to schools across the country. While the path forward may be challenging and occasionally confusing, our guests suggest that by allowing students to lead and guiding them to use AI responsibly, education stands to benefit from innovative tools that will, no doubt, change our world. Here, we recap some of the ideas and insights that came out of that conversation.
Just The Right Amount Of Regulation
A recurring theme around AI in education is that students could use these generative tools to complete their assignments, especially written assignments. Educators are worried that students may not build essential skills if it becomes too easy to misrepresent machine-generated work as their own. In addition to concerns that such use may contribute to cheating, it’s also known that AI can “hallucinate” by returning misinformation that may mislead students. As a result, many schools have banned generative AI completely. But is that realistic?
The answer is no, says Sebastian Rao, a Virginia STEM magnet school senior who has studied the use of AI by students. Instead, he advocates for AI policies that provide “guardrails” for students and educators to make the technology accessible but provide appropriate boundaries. “How do we structure a classroom that uses [AI]?” asks Rao. He says the focus should be to thoughtfully integrate AI technology into classrooms so that students can use it to enhance their education and build new skills.
When schools place strict bans on AI, students (and educators) may be confused and unsure about what they can and can’t use. “We’re having a moment now in education,” notes Andy Forest, founder and executive director of Steamlabs, a non-profit organization focused on innovating around education and equitable access to STEM. “AI tools are just suddenly so capable and competent they are completely disrupting education.” Many students use AI in ways educators and administrators didn’t predict, compounding the problem of regulating their use in the classroom. Meanwhile, the technology is evolving quickly and becoming integrated into an ever-growing range of tools.
Academic tools like Grammarly now use AI, as do search engines like Google and Bing. Khan Academy recently released a free AI-powered tutoring app, Khanmigo, to provide one-on-one tutoring and homework help to students who may not otherwise have access to a live tutor, providing academic equity for low-income learners. “A lot of students don’t really know what to think about a lot of these technologies. Some are confused about, you know, ‘What does AI mean? Is it cheating in certain circumstances?’” explains Rao.
Rather than framing the use of AI as cheating, the U.S. Department of Education is integrating AI into policy because the technology allows educators to support students with a valuable, personalized approach to learning. Knowing how to use AI effectively and ethically will be necessary for students’ future careers. Even the White House is on board. President Biden wrote in a recent executive order that AI will make the world “more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure.”
Change Is Never Easy
AI will almost certainly change how education looks in the classroom, just as computers and the Internet did decades ago. Krystal Chatman, an Instructional Technology Facilitator in the Jackson Public School District in Jackson, Mississippi, believes educators must develop a growth mindset and let students take a leadership role in policy and implementation. “[B]e comfortable taking a backseat to the knowledgeable student,” Chatman advises educators. “You’re used to being the person they seek knowledge from, but teaching them that they too can be experts provides them with a skill that will take them throughout life.”
Students need to be part of the discussion to understand digital citizenship and where the boundaries lie between, for example, using a tool for brainstorming and being academically dishonest. AI can’t and won’t replace human educators. Students will always need adult guides to help them use AI safely. The key to implementation will be developing a nuanced approach where policy creates an environment that protects students’ privacy and ensures academic integrity.
For all its benefits, AI technology does bring challenges that go beyond cheating or ethics. Many parents, educators, and students are concerned about privacy and safety when using AI tools. Forest explains that governmental regulations on data privacy and intellectual property haven’t caught up to the explosion of AI applications becoming available. “[J]ust continuously ask… ‘What are they doing with my data?’ The more you know about AI and how it can use your data, the better because then you can evaluate those policies,” he says.
There are also many concerns about disparities created by AI for students of minoritized racial backgrounds, students with disabilities, and students who are multilingual. Rao explains that students are concerned about AI detectors because the software can incorrectly label written works as AI-generated when they are not, especially for people whose primary language is not English. That may lead to some students being unfairly accused of cheating, which can derail their education or subject them to stigma. However, the AI detectors can be improved and trained on diverse texts to be more representative and inclusive. “Hold these companies accountable,” Rao says.
Chatman agrees and suggests that any accusation of cheating with AI must include humans who can step in and ensure accusations don’t do unnecessary or unjust harm to students. “I know my students better than any platform ever could,” she says. Perhaps most importantly, Chatman stresses that students must advocate for their rights and lead the way. “[W]hen there’s a school board meeting, you can talk directly to the superintendent, with your school principal, your school leadership. Ask them, ‘How are you protecting us?’”

In July 2022, just a few newsrooms around the world had guidelines or policies for how their journalists and editors could use digital tools that run on artificial intelligence. One year later, dozens of influential, global newsrooms had formal documents related to the use of AI.
In between, artificial intelligence research firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot that can produce all sorts of written material when prompted: lines of code, plays, essays, jokes and news-style stories. Elon Musk and Sam Altman founded OpenAI in 2015, with multibillion dollar investments over the years from Microsoft.
Newsrooms including USA Today, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Financial Times have since developed AI guidelines or policies — a wave of recognition that AI chatbots could fundamentally change the way journalists do their work and how the public thinks about journalism.
Research posted during September 2023 on preprint server SocArXiv is among the first to examine how newsrooms are handling the proliferating capabilities of AI-based platforms. Preprints have not undergone formal peer review and have not been published in an academic journal, though the current paper is under review at a prominent international journal according to one of the authors, Kim Björn Becker, a lecturer at Trier University in Germany and a staff writer for the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
The analysis provides a snapshot of the current state of AI policies and documents for 52 news organizations, including newsrooms in Brazil, India, North America, Scandinavia and Western Europe.
Notably, the authors write that AI policies and documents from commercial news organizations, compared with those that receive public funding, “seem to be more fine-grained and contain significantly more information on permitted and prohibited applications.”
Commercial news organizations were also more apt to emphasize source protection, urging journalists to take caution when, for example, using AI tools for help making sense of large amounts of confidential or background information, “perhaps owing to the risk legal liability poses to their business model,” they write.
Keep reading to learn what else the researchers found, including a strong focus on journalistic ethics across the documents, as well as real world examples of AI being used in newsrooms — plus, how the findings compare with other recent research.
AI guidance and rules focus on preserving journalistic values
AI chatbots are a type of generative AI, meaning they create content when prompted. They are based on large language models, which themselves are trained on huge amounts of existing text. (OpenAI rivals Google and Meta in the past year have announced their own large language models).
So, when you ask an AI chatbot to write a three-act play, in the style of 19th century Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, about the struggle for human self-determination in a future dominated by robots, it is able to do this because it has processed Ibsen’s work along with the corpus of science fiction about robots overtaking humanity.
Some news organizations for years have used generative AI for published stories, notably the Associated Press for simple coverage of earnings reports and college basketball game previews. Others that have dabbled in AI-generated content have come under scrutiny for publishing confusing or misleading information.
The authors of the recent preprint paper analyzed the AI policies and guidelines, most of them related to generative AI, to understand how publishers “address both expectations and concerns when it comes to using AI in the news,” they write.
The most recent AI document in the dataset is from NPR, dated July 2023. The oldest is from the Council for Mass Media, a self-regulatory body of news organizations in Finland, dated January 2020.
“One thing that was remarkable to me is that the way in which organizations dealt with AI at this stage did exhibit a very strong sense of conserving journalistic values,” says Becker. “Many organizations were really concerned about not losing their credibility, not losing their audience, not trying to give away what makes journalism stand out — especially in a world where misinformation is around in a much larger scale than ever before.”
Other early adopters include the BBC and German broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, “which have gained widespread attention through industry publications and conferences,” and “have served as influential benchmarks for others,” the authors write.
Many of the documents were guidelines — frameworks, or best practices for thinking about how journalists interact with and use AI, says Christopher Crum, a doctoral candidate at Oxford University and another co-author. But a few were prescriptive policies, Crum says.
Among the findings:

Just over 71% of the documents mention one or more journalistic values, such as public service, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy — meaning publishing or broadcasting news quickly — and ethics.
Nearly 70% of the AI documents were designed for editorial staff, while most of the rest applied to an entire organization. This would include the business side, which might use AI for advertising or hiring purposes. One policy only applied to the business side.
And 69% mentioned AI pitfalls, such as “hallucinations,” the authors write, in which an AI system makes up facts.
About 63% specified the guidelines would be updated at some point in the future — 6% of those “specified a particular interval for updates,” the authors write — while 37% did not indicate if or when the policies would be updated.
Around 54% of the documents cautioned journalists to be careful to protect sources when using AI, with several addressing the potential risk of revealing confidential sources when feeding information into an AI chatbot.
Some 44% allow journalists to use AI to gather information and develop story ideas, angles and outlines. Another 4% disallow this use, while half do not specify.
Meanwhile, 42% allow journalists to use AI to alter editorial content, such as editing and updating stories, while 6% disallow this use and half do not specify.
Only 8% state how the AI policies would be enforced, while the rest did not mention accountability mechanisms.

How the research was conducted
The authors found about two-thirds of the AI policy documents online and obtained the remainder through professional and personal contacts. About two-fifths were written in English. The authors translated the rest into English using DeepL, a translation service based on neural learning, a backbone of AI.
They then used statistical software to break the documents into five-word blocks, to assess their similarity. It’s a standard way to linguistically compare texts, Crum says. He explains that the phrase “I see the dog run fast” would have two five-word blocks: “I see the dog run,” and “see the dog run fast.”
If one document said, “I see the dog run fast” while another said, “I see the dog run quickly,” the first block of five words would be the same, the second block different — and the overall similarity between the documents would be lower than if the sentences were identical.
As a benchmark for comparison, the authors performed the same analysis on the news organizations’ editorial guidelines. The editorial guidelines were a bit more similar than the AI guidelines, the authors find.
“Because of the additional uncertainty in the [AI] space, the finding is that the AI guidelines are coalescing at a slightly lower degree than existing editorial guidelines,” Crum says. “The potential explanation might be, and this is speculative and not in the paper, something along the lines of, editorial guidelines have had more time to coalesce, whereas AI guidelines at this stage, while often influenced by existing AI guidelines, are still in the nascent stages of development.”
The authors also manually identified overarching characteristics of the documents relating to journalistic ethics, transparency and human supervision of AI. About nine-tenths of the documents specified that if AI were used in a story or investigation, that had to be disclosed. 
“My impression is not that organizations are afraid of AI,” Becker says. “They encourage employees to experiment with this new technology and try to make some good things out of it — for example, being faster in their reporting, being more accurate, if possible, finding new angles, stuff like that. But at the same time, indicating that, under no circumstances, shall they pose a risk on journalistic credibility.”
AI in the newsroom is evolving
The future of AI in the newsroom is taking shape, whether that means journalists primarily using AI as a tool in their work, or whether newsrooms become broadly comfortable with using AI to produce publicly facing content. The Journalist’s Resource has used DALL.E 2, an OpenAI product, to create images to accompany human-reported and written research roundups and articles.
Journalists, editors and newsroom leaders should, “engage with these new tools, explore them and their potential, and learn how to pragmatically apply them in creating and delivering value to audiences,” researcher and consultant David Caswell writes in a September 2023 report for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford. “There are no best practices, textbooks or shortcuts for this yet, only engaging, doing and learning until a viable way forward appears. Caution is advisable, but waiting for complete clarity is not.”
The Associated Press in 2015 began using AI to generate stories on publicly traded firms’ quarterly earnings reports. But recently, the organization’s AI guidelines released during August 2023 specify that AI “cannot be used to create publishable content and images for the news service.”
The AP had partnered with AI-content generation firm Automated Insights to produce the earnings stories, The Verge reported in January 2015. The AP also used Automated Insights to generate more than 5,000 previews for NCAA Division I men’s basketball games during the 2018 season.
Early this year, Futurism staff writer Frank Landymore wrote that tech news outlet CNET had been publishing AI-generated articles. Over the summer, Axios’ Tyler Buchanan reported USA Today was pausing its use of AI to create high school sports stories after several such articles in The Columbus Dispatch went viral for peculiar phrasing, such as “a close encounter of the athletic kind.”
And on Nov. 27, Futurism published an article by Maggie Harrison citing anonymous sources alleging that Sports Illustrated has recently been using AI-generated content and authors, with AI-generated headshots, for articles on product reviews.
Senior media writer Tom Jones of the Poynter Institute wrote the next day that the “story has again unsettled journalists concerned about AI-created content, especially when you see a name such as Sports Illustrated involved.”
The Arena Group, which publishes Sports Illustrated, posted a statement on X the same day the Futurism article was published, denying that Sports Illustrated had published AI-generated articles. According to the statement, the product review articles produced by a third-party company, AdVon Commerce, were “written and edited by humans,” but “AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy — actions we strongly condemn — and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership.”
On Dec. 11, the Arena Group fired its CEO. Arena’s board of directors “met and took actions to improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company,” the company said in a brief statement, which did not mention the AI allegations. Several other high level Arena Group executives were also fired last week, including the COO, according to the statement.
Many of the 52 policies reviewed for the preprint paper take a measured approach. About half caution journalists against feeding unpublished work into AI chatbots. Many of those that did were from commercial organizations.
For example, reporters may obtain voluminous government documents, or have hundreds of pages of interview notes or transcripts and may want to use AI to help make sense of it all. At least one policy advised reporters to treat anything that goes into an AI chatbot as published — and publicly accessible, Becker says.
Crum adds that the research team was “agnostic” in its approach — not for or against newsrooms using AI — with the goal of conveying the current landscape of newsroom AI guidelines and policies.
Themes on human oversight in other recent research
Becker, Crum and their coauthor on the preprint, Felix Simon, a communication researcher and doctoral student at Oxford, are among a growing body of scholars and journalists interested in informing how newsrooms use AI.
In July, University of Amsterdam postdoctoral researcher Hannes Cools and Northwestern University communications professor Nick Diakopoulos published an article for the Generative AI in the Newsroom project, which Diakopoulos edits, examining publicly available AI guidelines from 21 newsrooms.
Cools and Diakopoulos read the documents and identified themes. The guidelines generally stress the need for human oversight. Cools and Diakopoulos examined AI documents from many of the same newsrooms as the preprint authors, including the CBC, Insider, Reuters, Nucleo, Wired and Mediahuis, among others.
“At least for the externally facing policies, I don’t see them as enforceable policies,” says Diakopoulos. “It’s more like principal statements: ‘Here’s our goals as an organization.’
As for feeding confidential material into AI chatbots, Diakopoulos says that the underlying issue is about potentially sharing that information with a third party — OpenAI, for example — not in using the chatbot itself. There are “versions of generative AI that run locally on your own computer or on your own server,” and those should be unproblematic to use as a journalistic tool, he says.
“There was also what I call hybridity,” Diakopoulos says. “Kind of the need to have humans and algorithms working together, hybridized into human-computer systems, in order to keep the quality of journalism high while also leveraging the capabilities of AI and automation and algorithms for making things more efficient or trying to improve the comprehensiveness of investigations.”
For local and regional newsrooms interested in developing their own guidelines, there may be little need to reinvent the wheel. The Paris Charter, developed among 16 organizations and initiated by Reporters Without Borders, is a good place to start for understanding the fundamental ethics of using AI in journalism, Diakopoulos says.

RACEThis article is the second in a series about modern artificial intelligence.At 1 p.m. on a Friday shortly before Christmas last year, Kent Walker, Google’s top lawyer, summoned four of his employees and ruined their weekend.The group worked in SL1001, a bland building with a blue glass facade betraying no sign that dozens of lawyers inside were toiling to protect the interests of one of the world’s most influential companies. For weeks they had been prepping for a meeting of powerful executives to discuss the safety of Google’s products. The deck was done. But that afternoon Mr. Walker told his team the agenda had changed, and they would have to spend the next few days preparing new slides and graphs.Listen to This ArticleListen · 29:25 minIn fact, the entire agenda of the company had changed — all in the course of nine days. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, had decided to ready a slate of products based on artificial intelligence — immediately. He turned to Mr. Walker, the same lawyer he was trusting to defend the company in a profit-threatening antitrust case in Washington, D.C. Mr. Walker knew he would need to persuade the Advanced Technology Review Council, as Google called the group of executives, to throw off their customary caution and do as they were told.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt was an edict, and edicts didn’t happen very often at Google. But Google was staring at a real crisis. Its business model was potentially at risk.What had set off Mr. Pichai and the rest of Silicon Valley was ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence program that had been released on Nov. 30, 2022, by an upstart called OpenAI. It had captured the imagination of millions of people who had thought A.I. was science fiction until they started playing with the thing. It was a sensation. It was also a problem.At the Googleplex, famed for its free food, massages, fitness classes and laundry services, Mr. Pichai was also playing with ChatGPT. Its wonders did not wow him. Google had been developing its own A.I. technology that did many of the same things. Mr. Pichai was focused on ChatGPT’s flaws — that it got stuff wrong, that sometimes it turned into a biased pig. What amazed him was that OpenAI had gone ahead and released it anyway, and that consumers loved it. If OpenAI could do that, why couldn’t Google?Why not plow ahead? That’s the question that loomed over A.I.’s adolescence — the year or so after the technology made the leap from lab to living room. There was hand-wringing over chatbots writing seductive phishing emails and spewing disinformation, or high schoolers using them to cheat their way to an A. Doomsayers insisted that unfettered A.I. could lead to the end of humankind.For tech company bosses, the decision of when and how to turn A.I. into a (hopefully) profitable business was a more simple risk-reward calculus. But to win, you had to have a product.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBy Monday morning, Dec. 12, the team at SL1001 had a new agenda with a deck labeled “Privileged and Confidential/Need to Know.” Most attendees tuned in over videoconference. Mr. Walker started the meeting by announcing that Google was moving ahead with a chatbot and A.I. capabilities that would be added to cloud, search and other products.“What are your concerns? Let’s get in line,” Mr. Walker said, according to Jen Gennai, the director of responsible innovation.There would be guardrails, but approvals would be fast-tracked. Mr. Walker called it the “green lane” approach. It was all laid out in the deck. Opportunities for “Green Lane streamlining” were identified. Dangers were color-coded. Blue indicated risks where “mitigations” were “required.” Risks that were “controllable with minimum thresholds/mitigations” were rendered in orange.In one chart, under “Hate & Toxicity,” the plan was to “curb stereotypes, toxicity and hate speech in outputs.” One topic was: “What are we missing in order to fast-track approvals?”Not everyone was on board. “My standards are as high if not higher than they usually are, and we will be going through a review process with all of this,” Ms. Gennai remembered a cloud executive saying.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEventually a compromise was reached. They would limit the rollout, Ms. Gennai said. And they would avoid calling anything a product. For Google, it would be an experiment. That way it didn’t have to be perfect. (A Google spokeswoman said the A.T.R.C. did not have the power to decide how the products would be released.)What played out at Google was repeated at other tech giants after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. They all had technology in various stages of development that relied on neural networks — A.I. systems that recognized sounds, generated images and chatted like a human. That technology had been pioneered by Geoffrey Hinton, an academic who had worked briefly with Microsoft and was now at Google. But the tech companies had been slowed by fears of rogue chatbots, and economic and legal mayhem.Once ChatGPT was unleashed, none of that mattered as much, according to interviews with more than 80 executives and researchers, as well as corporate documents and audio recordings. The instinct to be first or biggest or richest — or all three — took over. The leaders of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies set a new course and pulled their employees along with them.Over 12 months, Silicon Valley was transformed. Turning artificial intelligence into actual products that individuals and companies could use became the priority. Worries about safety and whether machines would turn on their creators were not ignored, but they were shunted aside — at least for the moment.At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, who had once proclaimed the metaverse to be the future, reorganized parts of the company formerly known as Facebook around A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTElon Musk, the billionaire who co-founded OpenAI but had left the lab in a huff, vowed to create his own A.I. company. He called it X.AI and added it to his already full plate.Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, had invested in OpenAI three years before and was letting the start-up’s cowboys tap into its computing power. He sped up his plans to incorporate A.I. into Microsoft’s products — and give Google a poke in its searching eye.“Speed is even more important than ever,” Sam Schillace, a top executive, wrote Microsoft employees. It would be, he added, an “absolutely fatal error in this moment to worry about things that can be fixed later.”ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimA ‘Low Key Research Preview’The strange thing was that the leaders of OpenAI never thought ChatGPT would shake up Silicon Valley. In early November 2022, a few weeks before it was released to the world, it didn’t really exist as a product. Most of the 375 employees working in their new offices, a former mayonnaise factory, were focused on a more powerful version of technology, called GPT-4, that could answer almost any question using information gleaned from an enormous collection of data scraped from seemingly everywhere.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt was revolutionary, but there were problems. Sometimes the tech spewed hate speech and misinformation. The engineers at OpenAI kept postponing the launch and talking about what to do.One option was to release an older, less powerful version of the technology — and just see what happened. The idea, according to four people familiar with OpenAI’s work, was to watch the public’s reaction and use it to work out the kinks.And though some executives have downplayed it, they wanted to beat the competition. Lots of tech companies were working on their own A.I. chatbots. But the people to beat were at Anthropic, started the year before by researchers and engineers who left OpenAI because they thought that Sam Altman, its chief executive, had not made safety a priority as A.I. grew more powerful. The defectors had helped build the technology that OpenAI was so excited about before they trooped out the door.In mid-November 2022, Mr. Altman; Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president; and others met in a top-floor conference room to discuss the problems with their breakthrough tech yet again. Suddenly Mr. Altman made the decision — they would release the old, less-powerful technology.The plan was to call it Chat with GPT 3.5 and put it out by the end of the month. They referred to it as a “low key research preview.” It didn’t feel like a big-deal decision to anyone in the room.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We plan to frame it as a research release,” Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, told staff over Slack. “This reduces risk in all dimensions while allowing us to learn a lot,” she wrote. “We are aiming to move quickly over the next few days to make it happen.”The underlying code was a bit of a blob. It needed to be converted into something regular people without Ph.D.s could interact with. Mr. Altman and other executives asked a group of engineers to graft a graphical user interface — a GUI, pronounced gooey — onto the blob. A GUI is the face of an application, where you type and press buttons.A GUI had been created earlier that year to show the technology to Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, at his home outside Seattle. They stuck the same GUI on and changed the name to ChatGPT. About two weeks after Mr. Altman made his decision, they were good to go.On Nov. 29, the night before the launch, Mr. Brockman hosted drinks for the team. He didn’t think ChatGPT would attract a lot of attention, he said. His prediction: “no more than one tweet thread with 5k likes.”Mr. Brockman was wrong. On the morning of Nov. 30, Mr. Altman tweeted about OpenAI’s new product, and the company posted a jargon-heavy blog item. And then, ChatGPT took off. Almost immediately, sign-ups overwhelmed the company’s servers. Engineers rushed in and out of a messy space near the office kitchen, huddling over laptops to pull computing power from other projects. In five days, more than a million people had used ChatGPT. Within a few weeks, that number would top 100 million. Though nobody was quite sure why, it was a hit. Network news programs tried to explain how it worked. A late-night comedy show even used it to write (sort of funny) jokes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAfter things settled down, OpenAI employees used DALL-E, the company’s A.I. image generator, to make a laptop sticker labeled “Low key research preview.” It showed a computer about to be consumed by flames.Zuckerberg Gets WarnedActually, months earlier Meta had released its own chatbot — to very little notice.BlenderBot was a flop. The A.I.-powered bot, released in August 2022, was built to carry on conversations — and that it did. It said that Donald J. Trump was still president and that President Biden had lost in 2020. Mark Zuckerberg, it told a user, was “creepy.” Then two weeks before ChatGPT was released, Meta introduced Galactica. Designed for scientific research, it could instantly write academic articles and solve math problems. Someone asked it to write a research paper about the history of bears in space. It did. After three days, Galactica was shut down.Mr. Zuckerberg’s head was elsewhere. He had spent the entire year reorienting the company around the metaverse and was focused on virtual and augmented reality.But ChatGPT would demand his attention. His top A.I. scientist, Yann LeCun, arrived in the Bay Area from New York about six weeks later for a routine management meeting at Meta, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Dr. LeCun led a double life — as Meta’s chief A.I. scientist and a professor at New York University. The Frenchman had won the Turing Award, computer science’s most prestigious honor, alongside Dr. Hinton, for work on neural networks.As they waited in line for lunch at a cafe in Meta’s Frank Gehry-designed headquarters, Dr. LeCun delivered a warning to Mr. Zuckerberg. He said Meta should match OpenAI’s technology and also push forward with work on an A.I. assistant that could do stuff on the internet on your behalf. Websites like Facebook and Instagram could become extinct, he warned. A.I. was the future.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Zuckerberg didn’t say much, but he was listening. There was plenty of A.I. at work across Meta’s apps — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp — but it was under the hood. Mr. Zuckerberg was frustrated. He wanted the world to recognize the power of Meta’s A.I. Dr. LeCun had always argued that going open-source, making the code public, would attract countless researchers and developers to Meta’s technology, and help improve it at a far faster pace. That would allow Meta to catch up — and put Mr. Zuckerberg back in league with his fellow moguls. But it would also allow anyone to manipulate the technology to do bad things.At dinner that evening, Mr. Zuckerberg approached Dr. LeCun. “I have been thinking about what you said,” Mr. Zuckerberg told his chief A.I. scientist, according to a person familiar with the conversation. “And I think you’re right.”In Paris, Dr. LeCun’s scientists had developed an A.I.-powered bot that they wanted to release as open-source technology. Open source meant that anyone could tinker with its code. They called it Genesis, and it was pretty much ready to go. But when they sought permission to release it, Meta’s legal and policy teams pushed back, according to five people familiar with the discussion.Caution versus speed was furiously debated among the executive team in early 2023 as Mr. Zuckerberg considered Meta’s course in the wake of ChatGPT.Had everyone forgotten about the last seven years of Facebook’s history? That was the question asked by the legal and policy teams. They reminded Mr. Zuckerberg about the uproar over hate speech and misinformation on Meta’s platforms and the scrutiny the company had endured by the news media and Congress after the 2016 election.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOpen sourcing the code might put powerful tech into the hands of those with bad intentions and Meta would take the blame. Jennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, told Mr. Zuckerberg that an open-source approach to A.I. could attract the attention of regulators who already had the company in their cross hairs, according to two people familiar with her concerns.At a meeting in late January in his office, called the aquarium because it looked like one, Mr. Zuckerberg told executives that he had made his decision. Parts of Meta would be reorganized and its priorities changed. There would be weekly meetings to update executives on A.I. progress. Hundreds of employees would be moved around. Mr. Zuckerberg declared in a Facebook post that Meta would “turbocharge” its work on A.I.Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to push out a project fast. The researchers in Paris were ready with Genesis. The name was changed to LLaMA, short for “Large Language Model Meta AI,” and released to 4,000 researchers outside the company. Soon Meta received over 100,000 requests for access to the code.But within days of LLaMA’s release, someone put the code on 4chan, the fringe online message board. Meta had lost control of its chatbot, raising the possibility that the worst fears of its legal and policy teams would come true. Researchers at Stanford University showed that the Meta system could easily do things like generate racist material.On June 6, Mr. Zuckerberg received a letter about LLaMA from Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Richard Blumental of Connecticut. “Hawley and Blumental demand answers from Meta,” said a news release.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe letter called Meta’s approach risky and vulnerable to abuse and compared it unfavorably with ChatGPT. Why, the senators seemed to want to know, couldn’t Meta be more like OpenAI?Under the Tent at MicrosoftFor Mr. Nadella, the realization that OpenAI’s tech could change everything did not come as an “Aha!” moment. After investing $1 billion in 2019, Microsoft slowly started playing with the start-up’s code. First up was GitHub, the company’s code storage service. A few teams of engineers started experimenting with OpenAI’s tech to help them write code.Over dinner in Microsoft’s boardroom with a friend in the summer of 2021, Mr. Nadella said he was beginning to see the technology as a game changer. It would touch every part of Microsoft’s business and every human being, he predicted. (The GitHub experiment eventually became a product: GitHub Copilot.)A year later, Mr. Nadella got a peek at what would become GPT-4. Mr. Nadella asked it to translate a poem written in Persian by Rumi, who died in 1273, into Urdu. It did. He asked it to transliterate the Urdu into English characters. It did that, too. “Then I said, ‘God, this thing,’” Mr. Nadella recalled in an interview. From that moment, he was all in.Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI had already grown to $3 billion. Now Microsoft was planning to increase that to $10 billion.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEven for Microsoft, which was sitting on $105 billion in cash, that was real money. OpenAI was structured as a nonprofit. Microsoft would not get a board seat. But it had the right to use OpenAI’s code. That meant Microsoft and OpenAI were partners and competitors.At the end of the summer of 2022, Microsoft’s offices weren’t yet back to their prepandemic bustle. But on Sept. 13, Mr. Nadella summoned his top executives to a meeting at Building 34, Microsoft’s executive nerve center. It was two months before Mr. Altman made the decision to release ChatGPT.He and Mr. Brockman demonstrated GPT-4 for the group. First they asked it biology questions. Then Mr. Brockman let the executives try to stump the chatbot. At one point the chatbot was asked a question about photosynthesis. Not only did it answer, but it ruled out other possibilities. Peter Lee, the head of Microsoft Research, was surprised it seemed to know how to reason. He turned to Microsoft’s chief scientist, who was sitting next to him, and asked, “What is going on there?!”Then Mr. Nadella took the lectern to tell his lieutenants that everything was about to change. This was an executive order from a leader who typically favored consensus. “We are pivoting the whole company on this technology,” Eric Horvitz, the chief scientist, later remembered him saying. “This is a central advancement in the history of computing, and we are going to be on that wave at the front of it.”It all had to stay secret for the time being. Not everyone would be brought into the tent, and at Microsoft, tents were where the important stuff happened. Three “tented projects” were set up in early October to get the big pivot started. They were devoted to cybersecurity, the Bing search engine, Microsoft Word and related software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAbout two months later, Yusuf Mehdi, a marketing executive, demonstrated the Bing chatbot for some members of the board. They weren’t sold on it. They found the product overly complicated and without a clear vision to communicate to consumers. Mr. Nadella’s team hadn’t nailed it.Two weeks later, Mr. Mehdi met with the full board. This time the version he demonstrated was more simple and consumer-friendly. It was a go.Microsoft invited journalists to its Redmond, Wash., campus on Feb. 7 to introduce a chatbot in Bing to the world. They were instructed not to tell anybody they were going to a Microsoft event, and the topic wasn’t disclosed.But somehow, Google found out. On Feb. 6, to get out ahead of Microsoft, it put up a blog post by Mr. Pichai announcing that Google would be introducing its own chatbot, Bard. It didn’t say exactly when.ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimMr. Altman had just arrived at Microsoft’s conference center for a dry run of the show when Mr. Mehdi grabbed him and showed him Mr. Pichai’s post.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“‘Oh my gosh, this is hysterical,’” Mr. Mehdi recalled Mr. Altman saying. Just then Mr. Nadella walked out of the room where he had been rehearsing. Mr. Altman suggested that he and Mr. Nadella take a selfie. He posted it on Twitter to tweak Google.“Hello from redmond! excited for the event tomorrow,” tweeted Mr. Altman, who had more than 1.3 million Twitter followers.By the morning of Feb. 8, the day after Microsoft announced the chatbot, its shares were up 5 percent. But for Google, the rushed announcement became an embarrassment. Researchers spotted errors in Google’s blog post. An accompanying GIF simulated Bard saying that the Webb telescope had captured the first pictures of an exoplanet, a planet outside the solar system. In fact, a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in northern Chile got the first image of an exoplanet in 2004. Bard had gotten it wrong, and Google was ribbed in the news media and on social media.It was, as Mr. Pichai later said in an interview, “unfortunate.” Google’s stock dropped almost 8 percent, wiping out more than $100 billion in value.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt turned out that there were errors in Microsoft’s presentation, too. But nobody had noticed.ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimA Google GoodbyeThere was no question the Bing chatbot put Microsoft ahead of Google, and in spring 2023 Mr. Nadella bought more than $2 billion in computer chips to keep it that way, according to two people familiar with the budget. “We have a big order coming to you, a really big order coming to you,” Mr. Nadella gleefully told Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, Mr. Huang said.Mr. Pichai, at Google, felt like a scuba diver. The fallout from Google’s announcement about Bard was tumultuous, and that was like navigating the rough top foot of an ocean. But underneath the surface, the water was calm, and he was focused on the coming release of Google’s A.I. products.Mr. Pichai oversaw more than 2,000 researchers divided between two labs, Google Brain and DeepMind. In April, he merged them. Google DeepMind would develop an A.I. system called Gemini. To run it, Mr. Pichai chose Demis Hassabis, a founder of DeepMind. Mr. Hassabis had long and loudly warned that A.I. could destroy humanity. Now he would be in charge of leading Google to artificial intelligence supremacy.Geoffrey Hinton, Google’s best-known scientist, had always poked fun at people like Dr. Hassabis — the doomers, rationalists and effective altruists who worried that A.I would end mankind in the near future. He had developed much of the science behind artificial intelligence as a professor at the University of Toronto and became a wealthy man after joining Google in 2013. He is often called the godfather of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut the new chatbots changed everything for him. The science had moved more quickly than he had expected. Microsoft’s introduction of its chatbot convinced him that Google would have no choice but to try to catch up. And the corporate race shaping up between tech giants seemed dangerous.“If you think of Google as a company whose aim is to make profits,” Dr. Hinton said in April, “they can’t just let Bing take over from Google search. They’ve got to compete with that. When Microsoft decided to release a chatbot as the interface for Bing, that was the end of the holiday period.”Dr. Hinton spent a lot of time mulling his own role in the development of A.I. Sometimes he felt regretful. Other times he jokingly sent friends a video of Edith Piaf singing “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien.” But finally, he decided to quit.For the first time in more than 50 years, he stepped away from research. And then in April, he called Mr. Pichai and said goodbye. Susan Beachy contributed research.Audio produced by Tally AbecassisKaren Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.

In a recent AI report, it was uncovered that Artificial Intelligence-induced job losses have been on the rise, aggravating concerns from top tech leaders like Elon Musk.
AI Technology Driving More Job Losses
AI gained significant prominence this year with the launch of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT from OpenAI. The multiple innovative functionalities of this technology have thrown several employees out of their jobs. Precisely, AI can complete several tasks including designing documents and coding.

A report from ResumeBuilder’s research of 750 businesses showed that a significant percentage of these businesses agree with the job losses report. About 37% confirmed that AI technology replaced workers this year. Another 44% see the possibility of having more layoffs in the coming year. Similarly,  Asana’s State of AI at Work 2023 report shows that employees believed 29% of their tasks had been taken over by AI. 
It is worth noting that Asana supports “human-centered AI,” which involves the enhancement of human abilities and collaboration with this technology, not the outright replacement of people.
Artificial Intelligence Focusing on Enhanced Intelligence





For the second group of ResumeBuilder’s survey, their projection finds its foundation on the basis that AI is becoming more efficient with more functionalities. Google recently teased the capabilities of its AI chatbot dubbed Gemini. According to a shared demonstration video, Gemini displayed its highly interactive capability by accurately naming a duck that was created using lines and shapes.

Musk once said that Artificial Intelligence is taking humans to a point where no job is needed. Google’s Gemini and many other emerging AI tools are showing a new frontier in LLM design and the potential of Musk’s prediction becoming true. However, some experts do not share this same sentiment even though they acknowledge the innovative offerings of AI.
Julia Toothacre, a resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder noted that the research may not be a true representation of the broad business landscape. Hence, it would not be wise to conclude from the results. 





“There are still so many traditional organizations and small businesses that do not embrace technology the way that some of the larger companies do,” Toothacre clarified.
While these layoffs are increasing, it is pertinent to understand that AI is not the only driver. Many of these businesses are going through restructuring and AI comes off as a viable alternative.

Artificial intelligence has been around for decades, but with the launch of ChatGPT last year, generative AI has become a tool that is impacting nearly every business. For CPG companies and retailers who are tasked with staying ahead of ever-evolving consumer behaviors and new economic pressures, AI can solve several challenges and turn data into actionable insights. It can transform systems and processes throughout the supply chain, elevate shopper experiences with highly personalized product content, and help companies more clearly understand consumer-buying behavior to create actionable strategies. However, AI is not magic. To fully take advantage of what it can offer, companies must first ensure they are working with high-quality data, use AI to address the right challenges and never underestimate the power of human touch. Big data and high-quality data are both critical to power strategic decision makingMcKinsey has predicted that by 2025, data will be embedded in every interaction, and process. And as AI starts to impact numerous parts of a business, how the two components work together becomes key. AI requires a tremendous amount of data to effectively learn and make decisions, and big data needs to leverage AI for better analysis. However, you’re only as strong as your weakest data point. High-quality data is required to train AI models in order for them to be high quality models. Simply put: The more accurate the data, the more accurate the model prediction. Inaccurate data creates exponential errors. For example, if the AI is missing information, it will fill in the blanks with what seems correct, based on algorithms. It will also assume that it has all the data it needs. If the data is out of date, the decisions AI makes may leave out critical updates.Companies embracing AI need to champion data quality. They need to ensure that datasets are complete, with no empty cells. The industry is also exploring ways to accurately fill in these gaps based on high-quality data. For example, generative AI may be used for predictive text, filling in missing receipt information to inform insights. The datasets should also include consistent variables. And of course, accuracy and validity, at every level, is critical. Successful AI implementations require iterations on the underlying data. To get the most out of your AI, you want to make sure you are pulling from a trusted source providing data that is updated regularly and carefully reviewed. Manage data sprawl to more efficiently act on insights  In today’s dynamic retail and CPG landscape, data and analytics are critical to success. But vast ecosystems of disparate data formats and sources make it more difficult than ever to prepare, visualize, interpret, and act on insights. Incorporating AI into this analysis can be a game changer. For example, AI can enhance supply chains, helping companies more efficiently manage and optimize logistics. Another common application for retailers is using AI to automate item coding and classification, which is especially critical as the volume of e-commerce information skyrockets. AI can also provide automation on retailer-defined hierarchy definitions, generating automatic rules that can code characteristics a retailer is looking for. And the new generation of Intelligent Voice Assistants can deliver hyper-personalized responses by reviewing data analytics, previous conversations, location, and product information.What once felt like an overwhelming amount of data can be quickly analyzed and acted on by AI. But frequently, this too is complicated by disconnected or isolated data stacks. Multiple datasets are only valuable when they can talk to each other. Retailers must connect the right sources of data to successfully analyze omnichannel behavior. They need to evaluate how and when data is collected across platforms and simplify and accelerate access to massive sources of data—ideally accessing and querying data instantaneously. And they also need to scale effortlessly as their business grows. A human touch is still a requirement While the possibilities may seem endless, AI is still often met with both excitement and concern. While the biggest transformation of generative AI is its ability to allow more non-technical people to effectively ask and answer questions, one of the most common concerns is the fear that AI will replace humans in the workforce. While AI can process data and identify patterns in amounts and at speeds that humans simply cannot, it can’t replace the human touch.  For a successful future using AI, humans must continue to play a key role—in both the planning and the execution. The best results will come from combining AI with critical thinking. What humans bring to the table that AI cannot is real life experience, creativity, and intuition. And the ability to check the work and prevent dreaded AI hallucinations—outputs of confident and authoritative language which is nonetheless completely incorrect.​ The bottom line is that to successfully work at scale, CPG companies and retailers must embrace AI and prioritize high-quality data. As AI becomes an increasingly prominent part of the equation, agile platforms that can easily adapt to changing requirements will be essential. New tools democratize like never before, but to take full advantage, companies still must focus on structure, unified systems, and simplified approaches. And they must ensure they are partnering with trusted data and insights providers who are taking a deliberate approach to enhancing and operationalizing their models, thoughtfully integrating cutting-edge technologies, and continually assessing and improving performance.

As artificial intelligence tools become cheaper and more widely available, government agencies and private companies are rapidly deploying them to perform basic functions and increase productivity. Indeed, by one estimate, global spending on artificial intelligence, including software, hardware, and services, will reach $154 billion this year, and more than double that by 2026. As in other government and private-sector offices, election officials around the country already use AI to perform important but limited functions effectively. Most election offices, facing budget and staff constraints, will undoubtedly face substantial pressure to expand the use of AI to improve efficiency and service to voters, particularly as the rest of the world adopts this technology more widely.
In the course of writing this resource, we spoke with several election officials who are currently using or considering how to integrate AI into their work. While a number of election officials were excited about the ways in which new AI capabilities could improve the functioning of their offices, most expressed concern that they didn’t have the proper tools to determine whether and how to incorporate these new technologies safely. They have good reason to worry. Countless examples of faulty AI deployment in recent years illustrate how AI systems can exacerbate bias, “hallucinate” false information, and otherwise make mistakes that human supervisors fail to notice.
Any office that works with AI should ensure that it does so with appropriate attention to quality, transparency, and consistency. These standards are especially vital for election offices, where accuracy and public trust are essential to preserving the health of our democracy and protecting the right to vote. In this resource, we examine how AI is already being used in election offices and how that use could evolve as the technology advances and becomes more widely available. We also offer election officials a set of preliminary recommendations for implementing safeguards for any deployed or planned AI systems ahead of the 2024 vote. A checklist summarizing these recommendations appears at the end of this resource. 
As AI adoption expands across the election administration space, federal and state governments must develop certification standards and monitoring regimes for its use both in election offices and by vendors. President Joe Biden’s October 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence marks a pivotal first step, as it requires federal regulators to develop guidelines for AI use by critical infrastructure owners and operators (a designation that has included owners of election infrastructure since 2017) by late spring 2024.
Under its recently announced artificial intelligence roadmap, CISA will provide guidance for secure and resilient AI development and deployment, alongside recommendations for mitigating AI-enabled threats to critical infrastructure. But this is only a start. It remains unclear how far the development of these guidelines will go and what election systems they will cover. The recommendations in this resource are meant to assist election officials as they determine whether and how to integrate and use AI in election administration, whether before or after new federal guidelines are published next year.

Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats



R Street Cybersecurity-Artificial Intelligence Working Group 





Overview
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies has opened the floodgates to novel opportunities and applications. Alongside these opportunities, attendant cybersecurity threats are also expected to rise. In September 2023, the R Street Institute launched a six-month-long working group bringing together experts from government, the private sector, academia and civil society to examine use cases; existing regulatory and legislative proposals; and best practices and possible paths forward for policymakers and their staff, as well as the broader community, during this innovative and transformative era. 
Cybersecurity is constantly evolving. Organizations and individuals are leveraging AI to automate and/or aid detection, response and remediation of cyber incidents and to automate repetitive processes so responders can focus on higher priority threats, among many other uses. Meanwhile, others are exploring how AI may be used to further protect national security systems as threat actors and criminals use it to improve their tactics, techniques and procedures for infiltrating organizations or compromising individuals. 
The group will meet monthly in the beginning to consider a range of topics from uses to safeguards, intending to identify current and future cases for AI applications in cybersecurity and offer best practices for addressing concerns and weighing them against potential benefits. The working group will produce written products and host public and private events and briefings for members and other experts to address and educate on the nexus between AI and cybersecurity as it pertains to the group’s ongoing work and emerging developments.

The Department of Energy has dissolved its Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office and transferred much of its work to its Office of Science and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, an agency spokesperson confirmed to FedScoop. 
The update came just after DOE announced the creation of a new Office of Critical and Emergency Technology, which is set to focus on areas including AI and semiconductors. Helena Fu was named that office’s director, as well as the agency’s new chief AI officer. 
Energy also has a new responsible AI official: Bridget Carper, deputy chief information officer for architecture, engineering, technology, and innovation in the Office of the Chief Information Officer.
“DOE is committed to U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, and the Department has a significant role to play. The recent growth in modern AI capabilities calls for a dedicated, cross-departmental effort on AI. Leveraging AI models in conjunction with other critical and emerging technologies, including biotechnology and quantum computing, will be transformative,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement to FedScoop.

They continued: “In October, President Biden, in his executive order on AI, directed DOE to create an office to coordinate the Department’s work on critical and emerging technologies, including AI. The work of the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office will be absorbed into other areas of the Department, particularly the Office of Science and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.”

Each month, HBJ plans on bringing you interesting topics led by our new contributing expert writer, Carl Holden. 
This series will also introduce another new “writer” to our journal: Artificial Intelligence itself. Using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), we plan on bringing our readers an “article” written directly by AI. 
While AI cannot currently write a news article with fully original sources, this series hopefully will introduce our readers to the nuances of Artificial Intelligence in the modern age of business. The first article in this series is written from our contributing expert writer, Carl Holden. One the next page, you can find an article using ChatGPT. 
Oops, We Accidentally Hired ChatGPT
At our booth during the National Cyber Security Summit, I met a well-known government contractor who accidentally hired ChatGPT. The contractor was thrilled initially with their talented hire, who impressed the company with a perfect resume and astute answers in the online interview. 
However, the facade crumbled when the individual asked, “Hey, why is ChatGPT blocked at work?” There had been suspicions that this person was unable to do recent assignments.
The manager responded, “We aren’t allowed to use ChatGPT in government.” Half the Huntsville population sitting at Redstone gates every morning should know that fact!
Carl Holden, Creative Director of Zellus Marketing
The young person soon confessed to using AI to make it match their resume precisely to the job posting. They also aced the remote interviewing questions with ChatGPT, confidently spewing all the terminology they needed.
Before this company told me of their “artificial applicant,” they expressly told me they DO NOT use AI when they first approached my booth. After I heard this hiring horror story, I made it clear to them that AI can USE you. Cybersecurity and risk management should include non-human threats and liabilities, even in the HR department. Because it did not expect or prepare for this, the company will likely incur the cost of firing an unqualified hire.
Many stopped by my booth, unaware that Microsoft, powering their computers and email, owns a significant share of ChatGPT. Moreover, only some recognized the video I was playing of Microsoft CoPilot, the AI that has already launched in the latest version of Windows. Microsoft has successfully monopolized the government’s operating systems. Isn’t it naive to think that they aren’t going to get the government to buy into their AI as well?
Over recent years, my company has been using AI to assist in content and data activities. The November 2022 release of ChatGPT marked the first time I felt an AI had formidable capabilities. Since then, a flood of new technologies has entered the market, and we have been consulting local businesses on navigating or implementing the technology effectively and ethically. It was a very popular topic with visitors at our Security Summit booth.
This hiring mishap isn’t merely a humorous tale but a profound lesson. A 24-year-old with a ChatGPT Pro account outsmarted a multi-million dollar contractor employing hundreds of people. As AI continues to weave itself into the fabric of the modern workplace, resisting its effects seems futile. Even these capable bastions of data security must adopt this technology one day or risk losing to a company full of 24-year-olds and a “government-approved” AI.

After years of discussion, and seemingly little progress, the sudden boom of AI caught the majority of the population by surprise. 
Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of database, analytics, and machine learning (ML) at Amazon Web Services (AWS), believes this explosion of interest is due to the technology finally reaching its “tipping point.” AI and ML models are now at a level of sophistication and functionality at sufficient scale for value to be generated from their use. 
“Generative AI has captured our imagination,” Sivasubramanian says. “I believe it will transform every application, industry and business.”
Key to this advancement is the breakthrough in the variety of data that models can consume and the multiple outputs they can produce. Previously, ML algorithms would require highly specific or ‘labelled’ data to produce a defined output. 
I believe it will transform every application, industry and business
Now, foundational models (FMs) are trained using a wider range of information, and can produce a variety of complex outputs such as video or imagery. Crucially, FMs can be tuned to fit the requirements of an application or use case, reducing the time to market for new products or functionality.
“We can leverage massive amounts of complex data, to capture and present knowledge in more advanced ways, mapping complicated inputs to complicated outputs,” says Sivasubramanian. “What used to take months of scientists developing a machine learning model for one task can now be done relatively easily with one model and fine tuning.”
Every business sector can reap the benefits of these advancements. For example, an ability to generate video, audio and written content at speed can help enhance worker efficiency across many functions of an organisation. And customer experience could be improved through higher-quality chatbot interactions. 
Generative AI could have truly transformative capabilities in accelerating time to market in key research and development sectors, including health and life services and transportation. 
“The potential is huge,” says Phil Le Brun, enterprise strategist and evangelist at AWS. “Imagine pharmaceutical companies accelerating the design of gene therapies, borrowers having rich conversational experiences with mortgage providers that quickly approve their loans, or everyone everywhere gaining opportunities through broadening access to ongoing knowledge and educational pathways.”
AWS is helping its clients access these new capabilities through Amazon Bedrock, a cloud-based fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing FMs that offers access to generative AI applications through a single API. 





Amazon Bedrock features universally helpful applications such as fielding customer complaints through ‘AI agents’, leveraging existing company data without any manual input from human staff. Through Amazon QuickSight, data can be collated from across organisations, and generated into business intelligence reports from written language prompts, rapidly accelerating decision-making. For medical clients, AWS HealthScribe can automate paperwork through speech input, allowing doctors and nurses to spend more time treating their patients. 
Accessing these services through a single API offers massive potential for companies to work more efficiently, and produce innovative applications of their own at speed.
To make the most of these innovations, organisations must take some important steps. Sivasubramanian said companies must first ensure they have access to best-in-class FMs to leverage their apps and to build their own company’s capability. To do so, they will need a secure and private cloud-based environment, where they can customise models using their own data.
This should then allow companies to take the heavy lift away from staff, creating easy-to-use generative-AI-based tools that increase productivity. Finally, a machine-learning optimised infrastructure, which can be built at low cost and with low latency is vital. Le Brun stresses the role of the cloud in delivering these pillars of success. 
“Do you remember those TV programmes you used to watch as children, the ones that warned: ‘Don’t try this at home’? I’d give a variant of this warning with generative AI: ‘Don’t try this without the cloud,’” he says. 




“The cloud is the enabler for generative AI, making available cost-effective data lakes, sustainably provisioned GPUs and compute, high-speed networking, and consumption-based costing.”
The cloud is the enabler for generative AI
Le Brun also says that companies should address their data management before undertaking a generative AI strategy, as siloed or fragmented information will stymie their adoption. Leaders will have to address the company’s values to ensure that the technology is used in a way that benefits stakeholders at every level of the organisation.
“The world of generative AI is incredibly exciting, but technology rarely operates in a vacuum,” Le Brun says. “Face the law of unintended consequences. Start by considering your stance on ethics, transparency, data attribution, security, and privacy with AI. How can you ensure the technology is used accurately, fairly, and appropriately?”
Sivasubramanian says the widespread adoption of FMs should democratise the use of generative AI throughout an organisation. If these steps are achieved, leaders should be able to achieve that goal, while also rapidly scaling innovations that drive value for their customers and shareholders.

2023 was the year of artificial intelligence. 
There were certainly highs around the technology — companies rapidly deployed AI tools to speed up work processes, new capabilities were unlocked, and unique roles around AI were created. 
But, there were also some major lows. As people began using generative AI over the past year, some serious mistakes were made, which serve as a stark reminder that this generative tech — and our ability to utilize it — is still very much in its infancy, albeit not for long.
“There are companies who are excited and launching things, and maybe it’s a bit of a trial and error approach of ‘let’s see what happens,’” said Karthik Ramakrishnan, CEO and cofounder of Armilla AI, an insurance policy platform for AI blunders. “Sometimes it’s ‘what am I even protecting against? What will happen?’ If we don’t know those scenarios, people might take that approach.”
However in other cases, these blunders are calming people’s concerns that AI will take over because it shows there is still a long way to go.

“One shouldn’t use AI for AI’s sake,” said Ramakrishnan. “Let’s make sure there’s a true value proposition, a business case where AI can actually solve tough problems.”

                Karthik Ramakrishnan, CEO and cofounder of Armilla AI.            







Not everyone followed such sound judgment though. We compiled a list of the six biggest generative AI blunders in the past year to find out what actually went wrong. Here they are:

1. Sports Illustrated uses AI-generated authors and articles
The media industry is still navigating the best way to use AI, but this trial really missed the mark. In November, Sports Illustrated made headlines for publishing articles written by fake AI-generated authors, Drew (who spends a lot of time outdoors) and Sora (a fitness guru). Those biographies, along with their photos, were created by AI. You can find their photos available on sites selling AI-generated headshots. 
Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after being outed by a report published by Futurism. 
The Arena Group, the publisher of Sports Illustrated, announced in December that its board of directors terminated its CEO, Ross Levinsohn. The Arena Group issued a statement explaining that the articles with the AI-generated headshots had been provided by a contractor called AdVon Commerce. They disputed the claim that the articles themselves had been AI-generated.
2. Fake AI-generated women on tech conference agenda
What’s worse: the fact this conference couldn’t possibly find one woman in tech to speak or the fact they decided to make someone up in the meantime?
According to the Associated Press, DevTernity organizer Eduards Sizovs admitted on social media that one of the featured speakers was an “auto-generated” woman with a fake title. He was responding to allegations about a number of suspicious profiles on his conference websites that appeared to be generated by AI.
But he denied that the fake profile was intended to mask the “worse-than-expected level of diversity of speakers” in this year’s lineup and refused to apologize in a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter.
It led to tech executives at Microsoft and Amazon to drop out of the conference, which was planned for Dec. 7.
3. Fake citations from ChatGPT used by an attorney
In May, the news broke that Steven Schwartz will be charged in a New York court for using fake citations from OpenAI’s ChatGPT in legal research for a case he was handling.
The cases ChatGPT presented the lawyer in his research were Varghese v. China South Airlines, Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Shaboon v. EgyptAir, Petersen v. Iran Air, Miller v. United Airlines, and Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines — all bogus. These cases did not exist and had fake judicial warnings.
“One of the worst AI blunders we saw this year was the case where lawyers used ChatGPT to create legal briefs without checking any of its work,” said Stanley Seibert, senior director of community innovation at data science platform Anaconda. “It is a pattern we will see repeated as users unfamiliar with AI assume it is more accurate than it really is. Even skilled professionals can be duped by AI ‘hallucinations’ if they don’t critically evaluate the output of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.”
Examples like this show the need for industry-specific generative AI tools, like Harvey, which builds custom large language models for law firms to tackle their legal challenges.
4. An automated poll appeared on an MSN article about a woman who was found dead
Another attempt by the news industry to take advantage of AI fell completely short and somewhat tarnished the industry’s reputation around using new tools like AI. 
The Guardian sent an angry email to Microsoft after an automated poll appeared on an MSN/Guardian article about a woman who was found dead. The poll asked: What do you think is the reason behind the woman’s death? The choices were murder, accident, and suicide. 
Microsoft removed the poll that was embedded in its own version of the story, but the string of comments remains. 
MSN is known for using AI to generate a lot of its articles. It landed in hot water after an AI headline dubbed the late Brandon Hunter as “useless at 42” following the NBA star’s sudden death. 
Microsoft has been quietly removing poorly written AI articles from its site for some time now. Business Insider reported that in August, the company removed one MSN piece that listed a food bank in Ottawa as a tourist attraction.
5. Uber Eats began using AI-generated food images
Take care when ordering takeouts. Uber Eats is using AI for pictures of food when none are provided by the restaurant but the tech couldn’t tell the difference when the same term — “medium pie” — was used to describe a pizza at an Italian restaurant and a sweet dessert. In the same example, it invented a brand of ranch dressing called “Lelnach” and showed a bottle of that in the picture. 
“Your brand and reputation takes a hit,” said Ramakrishnan. “Yes, it didn’t harm anyone, but it did harm the company. There are many types of damages with AI — economic, societal, but there is also reputational harm. Will there be legal consequences to that? No, but then you’re like ‘is this food really real? Will it actually look like this when I get it?’ You start questioning everything, and your brand reputation goes down as a result.”
6. Samsung employees paste confidential source code into ChatGPT
Technology manufacturer Samsung banned its employees from using ChatGPT after engineers leaked confidential elements of the company’s source code into the chatbot. Employees leaked sensitive data on three separate occasions, emphasizing the importance of training your employees to be aware of what kind of data they are putting into generative AI models.
“It’s very difficult for some companies to understand their data and figure out what’s sensitive,” said Sarah Hospelhorn, CMO at software firm BigID. “But everyone wants to take advantage of the latest tech to show innovation. But if you’re using sets with unknown data, you’re amplifying risks.”







            ""Everyone wants to take advantage of the latest tech to show innovation. But if you’re using sets with unknown data, you’re amplifying risks.”        


 

                Sarah Hospelhorn, CMO at BigID.             







It’s one reason why BigID published the course “How to Accelerate AI Initiatives,” that shared what organizations need to do to adopt AI responsibly, from governing LLMs to prevent data leaks, to avoiding non-compliance and reducing risks associated with employing generative AI usage.
“It’s becoming more and more important,” said Hospelhorn. “We’re seeing it as the top priority for 2024 in terms of how teams are going to handle security around AI so that everyone can take advantage of the latest technology.”

In 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) truly entered our daily lives. The latest data shows four in five teenagers in the United Kingdom are using generative AI tools. About two-thirds of Australian employees report using generative AI for work.
At first, many people used these tools because they were curious about generative AI or wanted to be entertained. Now, people ask generative AI for help with studies, for advice, or use it to find or synthesise information. Other uses include getting help coding and making images, videos, or audio. 
So-called “prompt whisperers” or prompt engineers offer guides on not just designing the best AI prompts, but even how to blend different AI services to achieve fantastical outputs.
AI uses and functions have also shifted over the past 12 months as technological development, regulation and social factors have shaped what’s possible. Here’s where we’re at, and what might come in 2024.

AI changed how we work and pray
Generative AI made waves early in the year when it was used to enter and even win photography competitions, and tested for its ability to pass school exams.
ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s become a household name, reached a user base of 100 million by February – about four times the size of Australia’s population. 
Some musicians used AI voice cloning to create synthetic music that sounds like popular artists, such as Eminem. Google launched its chatbot, Bard. Microsoft integrated AI into Bing search. Snapchat launched MyAI, a ChatGPT-powered tool that allows users to ask questions and receive suggestions.
GPT-4, the latest iteration of the AI that powers ChatGPT, launched in March. This release brought new features, such as analysing documents or longer pieces of text.
Also in March, corporate giants like Coca-Cola began generating ads partly through AI, while Levi’s said it would use AI for creating virtual models. The now-infamous image of the Pope wearing a white Balenciaga puffer jacket went viral. A cohort of tech evangelists also called for an AI development pause.

Amazon began integrating generative AI tools into its products and services in April. Meanwhile, Japan ruled there would be no no copyright restrictions for training generative AI in the country. 
In the United States, screenwriters went on strike in May, demanding a ban of AI-generated scripts. Another AI-generated image, allegedly of the Pentagon on fire, went viral.
In July, worshippers experienced some of the first religious services led by AI. 
In August, two months after AI-generated summaries became available in Zoom, the company faced intense scrutiny for changes to its terms of service around consumer data and AI. The company later clarified its policy and pledged not to use customers’ data without consent to train AI.
In September, voice and image functionalities came to ChatGPT for paid users. Adobe began integrating generative AI into its applications like Illustrator and Photoshop.
By December, we saw an increased shift to “Edge AI”, where AI processes are handled locally, on devices themselves, rather than in the cloud, which has benefits in contexts when privacy and security are paramount. Meanwhile, the EU announced the world’s first “AI Law”.

Where to from here?
Given the whirlwind of AI developments in the past 12 months, we’re likely to see more incremental changes in the next year and beyond.
In particular, we expect to see changes in these four areas.
Increased bundling of AI services and functions
ChatGTP was initially just a chatbot that could generate text. Now, it can generate text, images and audio. Google’s Bard can now interface among Gmail, Docs and Drive, and complete tasks across these services.
By bundling generative AI into existing services and combining functions, companies will try to maintain their market share and make AI services more intuitive, accessible and useful. 
At the same time, bundled services make users more vulnerable when inevitable data breaches happen.
Higher quality, more realistic generations
Earlier this year, AI struggled with rendering human hands and limbs. By now, AI generators have markedly improved on these tasks.
At the same time, research has found how biased many AI generators can be. 
Some developers have created models with diversity and inclusivity in mind. Companies will likely see a benefit in providing services that reflect the diversity of their customer bases.
Growing calls for transparency and media standards
Various news platforms have been slammed in 2023 for producing AI-generated content without transparently communicating this. 
AI-generated images of world leaders and other newsworthy events abound on social media, with high potential to mislead and deceive. 
Media industry standards that transparently and consistently denote when AI has been used to create or augment content will need to be developed to improve public trust.
Expansion of sovereign AI capacity
In these early days, many have been content playfully exploring AI’s possibilities. However, as these AI tools begin to unlock rapid advancements across all sectors of our society, more fine-grained control over who governs these foundational technologies will become increasingly important.
In 2024, we will likely see future-focused leaders incentivising the development of their sovereign capabilities through increased research and development funding, training programs and other investments.
For the rest of us, whether you’re using generative AI for fun, work, or school, understanding the strengths and limitations of the technology is essential for using it in responsible, respectful and productive ways. 
Similarly, understanding how others – from governments to doctors – are increasingly using AI in ways that affect you, is equally important.

I was recently at a dinner party where another guest asked me to explain what I do for work. When I mentioned that part of my job involves thought leadership around digital trends like generative AI, the first comment was, “Wow, you must be busy this year.”
It’s a natural conclusion to come to: Even for those of us who don’t work with emerging technologies day to day, the speed at which headlines come out means it’s been almost impossible to avoid conversations and debates about the rise of generative AI. Applications like ChatGPT have become household names in the same way “to Google” has become a household verb. Adobe Photoshop now includes a “generative fill” option to let AI take a pass at edits.
According to research sponsored by Iron Mountain, 93% of organizations are already using generative AI in one way or another. In under a year, generative AI has secured a spot as a defining element in the technological zeitgeist. To borrow the cliche being used in newscasts around the world, Pandora’s box is open, and we’re well past the point of trying to close it.
Iron Mountain
Based on global research with 700 IT and data decision-makers conducted by Vanson Bourne, sponsored by Iron Mountain, October 2023.
New ways to get answers
In the same way that my current generation of young professionals learned to search for immediate answers on the Internet, the next generation of young professionals in the workforce must know how to get the answers they need through generative AI prompt engineering. Since January, I’ve noticed my own first instinct shifting from looking up instructions on Google to asking ChatGPT for an answer – after all, with an increasing number of demands on workers’ days, software that can provide time-saving shortcuts is a welcome addition to the corporate toolkit.
I wanted to put the scope of ChatGPT’s on-the-job training to the test. Early on in my career, whenever I was responsible for setting up a meeting, I would “google” step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish that task. When I asked ChatGPT for the same information, it gave me an identical set of instructions – not totally surprising. Where ChatGPT got the edge was its ability to answer queries beyond my original question. What should I include in the body of the message? What’s the appropriate tone to take if it’s a call with my peers and my supervisor? Can you write a meeting description that fulfills the requirements listed above? In a matter of seconds, ChatGPT had written a professional and succinct meeting invite that would have taken me multiple revisions to get right.
Early literacy creates effective users
Starting in early elementary school, computer classes were a mandatory part of the curriculum. The expectation was that as soon as a student could read a sentence, Mavis Beacon would teach them how to type it into a word processor. When I started my first corporate job, digital literacy and applications like Microsoft Office were second nature because I’d had exposure to them throughout my entire education. The same can be true for generative AI; based on the number of resources available, specifically to train educators, it already is. The largest variable remains the question of how. How schools choose to introduce generative AI into their curriculums, as either a friend or foe, will make a difference in the way the next generations of professionals approach and engage with it. If a person is empowered to use generative AI for good, there’s no limit to the innovative ideas that can be fostered.
The adoption of generative AI tools is not and shouldn’t be limited to students; it needs to go beyond and be included as part of a robust workplace strategy. The value that generative AI holds at every level of work can’t be ignored or brushed under the rug. According to McKinsey, “Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work…automating work activities that take up 60-70% of peoples’ time today.” AI is the solution to the increasing number of hours people spend on mind-numbing tasks. Reducing the amount of time spent on processes that can be automated empowers existing employees to focus on the jobs that they were hired to do without the weight of busy work.
Going forward with confidence
It’s important to look critically at new and developing technologies, especially in cases like generative AI that necessitate a discussion about ethical training and use. However, that doesn’t mean that organizations should create strategies that exclude or prevent usage. From both an education and enterprise perspective, students must be informed about the technology and the impact that implementing–or, conversely, not implementing–will have on businesses. Generative AI is here, and once new technology is introduced, it’s almost always here to stay. What will change is the way that jobs are performed and the people who have the skills to hold those jobs. In the wake of emerging technology, employees who are unable to adapt are going to be at a disadvantage as the next generation of professionals enter the workforce.
So, whether you’re building proficiency through a more formal education from a university or simply taking a professional development class from providers such as Coursera or LinkedIn, there are ways to stay ahead of the curve – and you may just find a new topic for discussion at your next dinner party.

This phenomenon has been dubbed “fear of obsolescence” or “FOBO” – the notion that we will create or evolve ourselves into irrelevance.Or, to put it another way …Imagine waking up one day and finding your job has been automated overnight by intelligent machines. Then you discover even the career you dreamed of pursuing next has already been mastered by AI. Quickly, more and more human domains once thought impossible to replicate – art, music, emotion – fall prey to advancing algorithms until all uniquely human talent and purpose dwindles in the face of superior robotic counterparts. Soon your very existence becomes trivial … unnecessary.Sounds terrifying, doesn’t it? But also, if we’re being honest, a little odd. That’s because none of the above was written by a human – AI wrote it. Claude.ai responded to a human prompt for an intro about FOBO (in the first paragraph) and then a refined prompt asking for it to be more creative and add some suspense (in the two above).Here’s what you actually need to know about the phenomenon.What is FOBO?FOBO is a real feeling – over a fifth of workers in the US are worried technology will make their jobs obsolete, according to a Gallup poll in September 2023.Workers’ fears over obsolescence are growing. Image: GallupIt’s not a new phenomenon. Gallup has been tracking the sentiment since 2017. But the fear has grown over the period between 2021 and 2023 – coinciding with generative AI going mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. While the number of workers without a college degree who expressed concern stayed almost unchanged at 24%, there was a rise in the number of worried college-educated workers – from 8% to 20%. Concern has also risen more in the younger generation – with an 11 percentage point change among those aged between 18 and 34.College graduates are growing more concerned about being replaced by AI. Image: GallupShould people be worried about AI taking their jobs?Is FOBO justified? It largely depends on the profession you’re in as to how many tasks can be automated, but humans will always need to be kept in the loop to some extent – with their work augmented by AI. Routine and repetitive tasks are the ones AI is most likely to automate, according to the World Economic Forum’s Jobs of Tomorrow whitepaper, whereas critical thinking and complex problem-solving could be augmented by the technology.Only 16.1% of an HR manager’s job, for example, shows potential for automation and 22.2% for augmentation, according to the report.But there are some roles AI will never be able to replace, and in fact, careers in agriculture, education and supply chain and logistics will likely see growth.Businesses are introducing automation into their operations more slowly than expected, according to the Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023. Just over a third (34%) of all business-related tasks today are performed by machines, with the remaining 66% performed by humans. That’s only a 1% increase compared to the 2020 Future of Jobs Survey.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. In fact, respondents lowered their expectations for future automation to predict that, by 2027, 42% of business tasks will be automated, down from a predicted 47% in the 2020 survey. Although AI is expected to lead to higher churn rates and three-quarters of companies are looking to adopt the technology, more businesses expect AI adoption to lead to job growth than job loss – at 50% and 25% respectively. Why upskilling will be crucial for the jobs of the futureIn the next five years, employees estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted, meaning upskilling and life-long learning are now more essential, says the Future of Jobs Report 2023.The skills most in demand are those that AI can’t replace, including analytical thinking, empathy and active listening, and leadership and social influence.AI will also create new fields of work, with growing opportunities for: “trainers”, “explainers” and “sustainers”, the Forum’s white paper, Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs, found.When asked whether humans should fear AI taking their jobs, Anthropic’s Claude responded: “I have no independent desires to take jobs from humans or render anyone obsolete. I am designed solely to be assistive to human goals and values – not replace them … “I am only an interface focused on providing helpful information to you, not pushing any autonomous motivations. My role is to collaborate with human creativity as a tool – not rival or replace it.”Have you read?These are the jobs that AI can’t replaceWe often hear that AI will take our jobs.

In the year since OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT chatbot, generative artificial intelligence has burst into the public consciousness and jumped to the top of most corporate agendas.
Most companies and business leaders are still finding their way with this new technology, from understanding more about how generative AI works and how it will affect businesses and workers to anticipating how it will be regulated. There is also growing emphasis on how to make sure it is used responsibly.
Researchers at MIT Sloan have been examining generative AI and the best ways to use it in the enterprise. Here’s what they’ve found.
AI and workers 
Inexperienced workers stand to benefit the most from generative AI, according to research by MIT Sloan associate professor Danielle Li, MIT Sloan PhD candidate Lindsey Raymond, and Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson, PhD ’91.

The researchers found that contact center agents with access to a conversational assistant saw a 14% boost in productivity, with the largest gains impacting new or low-skilled workers.
“Generative AI seems to be able to decrease inequality in productivity, helping lower-skilled workers significantly but with little effect on high-skilled workers,” Li said. “Without access to an AI tool, less-experienced workers would slowly get better at their jobs. Now they can get better faster.”
Generative AI can boost highly skilled workers’ productivity too, according to a research paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor Kate Kellogg — though it has to be introduced the right way.
It is not always obvious to highly skilled knowledge workers which of their everyday tasks could easily be performed by AI, the researchers found. To introduce generative AI to highly skilled workers and boost productivity, organizations should establish a culture of accountability, reward peer training, and encourage role reconfiguration.
And MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton notes that several factors have to be in place for a human-AI interaction to be worthwhile. He recommends that leaders consider four points before swapping in AI for human labor: how much time the task will take without assistance, how much the employee performing a task is paid, whether AI is capable of performing the task correctly, and how easy it is for humans to determine whether the AI output is accurate. 
Generative AI could also help people get hired. Job applicants who were randomly assigned algorithmic assistance with their resumes — such as suggestions to improve spelling and grammar — were 8% more likely to be hired, according to an experiment conducted by Horton, MIT Sloan PhD student Emma van Inwegen, and MIT Sloan PhD student Zanele Munyikwa.
“If you take two identical workers with the same skills and background, the one with the better-written resume is more likely to get hired,” van Inwegen said. “The takeaway is that employers actually care about the writing in the resume — it’s not just a correlation.” That means that AI assistance can be a useful tool for those hoping to get hired, she said.
Using AI to the best advantage 
It’s time for everyone in your organization to understand generative AI, according to MIT Sloan senior lecturer George Westerman. In a webinar, he outlined early use cases, such as summarizing documents, creating personalized shopping experiments, and writing code. Generative AI is the latest in a line of advanced analytics tools, he noted, which vary in how much data and domain expertise is needed to use them, whether their results are repeatable, and how easy it is to understand how they generate results.
For businesses, using work generated by AI will depend in part on how consumers perceive that work. With this in mind, MIT Sloan senior lecturer and research scientist Renee Richardson Gosline and Yunhao Zhang SM ’20, PhD ’23, a postdoctoral fellow at the Psychology of Technology Institute, studied how people perceive work created by generative AI, humans, or some combination of the two.
They found that when people knew a product’s source, they expressed a positive bias toward content created by humans. Yet at the same time, and contrary to the traditional idea of “algorithmic aversion,” people did not express a negative bias toward AI-generated content when they knew how it was created. In fact, when respondents were not told how content was created, they preferred AI-generated content.

Users can make the most of generative AI by using it in concert with external tools to answer complex questions and execute actions. MIT Sloan professor of the practice Rama Ramakrishnan looked at how to use ChatGPT as an agent to do things like search the web, order groceries, purchase plane tickets, or send emails.
And businesses that find success with generative AI will also harness human-centric capabilities, such as creativity, curiosity, and compassion, according to MIT Sloan senior lecturer Paul McDonagh-Smith. The key is figuring out how humans and machines can best work together, resulting in humans’ abilities being multiplied, rather than divided, by machines’ capabilities, McDonagh-Smith said during a webinar.
AI policy 
It’s time to talk about how to rechart the course of technology so it complements human capabilities, according to MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson. In their new book, “Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,” they decry the economic and social damage caused by the concentrated power of business and show how the tremendous computing advances of the past half century can become empowering and democratizing tools.
“Society and its powerful gatekeepers need to stop being mesmerized by tech billionaires and their agenda,” they write in an excerpt from the book. “Debates on new technology ought to center not just on the brilliance of new products and algorithms but also on whether they are working for the people or against the people.”
In a policy memo co-authored with MIT professor David Autor, Acemoglu and Johnson suggested five policies that could steer AI implementation in a direction that complements humans and augments their skills. These include equalizing tax rates on employing workers and owning equipment or algorithms, updating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to create safeguards against worker surveillance, and creating an AI center of expertise within government.
When President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October on AI safety and security, one part of it addressed using content labels to identify content generated by artificial intelligence. A new working paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand looked at the right terms to use for those labels. The researchers found that people associated certain terms, such as “AI generated” and “AI manipulated,” most closely with content created using AI. Conversely, the labels “deepfake” and “manipulated” were most associated with misleading content, whether AI created it or not.

As generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion accumulate millions of registered users, the tools’ image-creation abilities have sparked waves of criticism. Some critics point to the use of AI to generate illegal and nonconsensual images. Others speak about theft of intellectual property, suggesting a kind of “automated plagiarism.” Image generators are trained on hundreds of thousands of images made by human creators. The Biden administration and the Group of Seven (G7) both affirm copyright protection as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy AI, but what this would mean for an artist whose work has been “stolen” to train these models remains murky at best.
The evolving landscape of generative AI reveals shortcomings in current copyright regulations, including outdated notions of intellectual property and compensation as well as undue burdens on creators. The solution needs to be rooted in collective negotiation and international consensus.

Brushstrokes and pixels

What is art? Plato held that art is imitation. Indian philosopher Bharata described rasa (flavor) in art. In contemporary philosophy, there are numerous aesthetic definitions, which define qualities inherent to the art, as well as disjunctive definitions, such as where art is a product of the aesthetic of its time or is part of a recognized tradition or institution. In other words, there is no one definition of art, leading some proponents of AI art to argue that anything we deem to be art becomes art.
However, can something be art if there is no artist? Critics and proponents of AI art agree on one thing—there needs to be a human holding the brush. As computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum famously wrote in 1976: “No other organism, and certainly no computer, can be made to confront genuine human problems in human terms.” Last year an AI-generated entry won the Colorado state fair’s fine arts competition in the “digitally manipulated art” category. The winner, who had never dabbled in art before the advent of generative AI, said that AI “is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.”

Neurons and code

The principles published by the G7 after its May 2023 meeting in Hiroshima began with this preface: “Different jurisdictions may take their own unique approaches to implementing these actions in different ways.” Indeed, countries’ approaches to the emerging question of “authorship” where human beings are not necessarily involved fall along a bewildering spectrum. The US Copyright Office only grants copyright to “works created by human beings.” Famously, in the 2018 case of a selfie taken by a crested macaque named Naruto using the camera of photographer David Slater, a US court declared that non-humans do not have statutory standing under the Copyright Act. However, according to the Copyright Office, works created through text prompts and lacking any further creative input by the human user, as in the case of generative AI tools, would not be copyrightable because “these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist.”
China’s draft rules on generative AI, released in April, require that these services and products respect intellectual property rights, both at a commercial and personal level. The wording is broad—perhaps excessively so. It requires generative AI service providers to ensure their models meet legal requirements and would likely require a new licensing architecture for data mining. Chinese copyright law recognizes individuals and organizations (leaning heavily toward companies), but not “entities” like AI models, as copyright holders. It recognizes the rights of adaptation and compilation—the right to transform a work and arrange existing ones—but also requires publishers of such adapted work to compensate the authors of the original. As in the US case, this approach leaves some gray area for generative AI systems, depending on whether a generated work is viewed as an adaptation with sufficient original input. Interestingly, in 2020, a Shenzhen court ruled that an AI-generated news article qualified for copyright protection, as it met the threshold for originality.
According to India’s Copyright Act, the “author” of a copyrightable work is, “in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, the person who causes the work to be created.” According to a July 2023 report by New Delhi law firm Ikigai Law, “In India, a work must involve a minimum degree of creativity and not be a product of only skill and labor. Output produced by AI tools may not satisfy the requirement of ‘creativity’ required for copyright protection, if they are viewed as a collection of data compiled from already existing sources without any infusion of creativity.” In this sense, Indian and US copyright law agree that a certain class of AI-generated works would not qualify for copyright.
Japan is tackling the gray area generated by foundational models as well. In July and September, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs convened panels to deliberate the required threshold for “creative contributions” of human authors. At the same time, the government has stated that Japanese copyright will not protect holders/creators of data used for AI training.
All these regulatory measures are grappling with the fact that, counterintuitively, generative AI is not always a “tool,” and there can be cases where the AI is doing most of the creative “labor,” albeit by drawing upon the creative output of hundreds of thousands of human artists. On top of that, the sheer size of datasets used to train image generators makes it difficult for individuals to prove copyright infringement (not to mention that many artists who post their work online do not register copyright). In a recent federal court ruling in California, the presiding judge dismissed a class action lawsuit by three artists against DeviantArt, an online art community, and MidJourney. The ruling stated that it would be impossible for the defendants to audit every single image in the database for potential copyright infringement (complicated by the fact that the database in question, LAION, is open-source), and it is difficult for an artist to prove a generated image is derived from their work, absent “substantial similarity.”

Unregulatable AI?

Generative AI is certainly unlike any paintbrush humans have used before. It is only as “creative” as the artists whose works were fed into the model, but also, as some countries’ positions imply, reflects the creative vision of the person who uses it.
Scrolling through the nearly ten thousand public comments received by the Copyright Office as part of its AI study (a task for which an AI assistant would have been welcome), the common themes that emerge are consent and compensation. As one commenter states: “As an artist, I never gave permission for AI to regurgitate my work. I was never asked if it would be all right with me.”
What further complicates copyright is that these laws are national in scope, whereas datasets are not. And as the analysis above has shown, different jurisdictions are approaching this issue in divergent ways (if they are at all). Therefore, it is wholly possible that if certain countries impose rules that are seen as harsh by companies, they can relocate their operations to safer havens.
Copyright collectives or copyright societies offer one potential lifeline for artists. This has been a model for collective negotiation of multiple works, where the collective negotiates copyright and compensation on behalf of a group. However, in the internet age, such collectives would need to be international in scope, or part of a network of collectives. They would also need to lower their membership fees, which many artists—who publish their works online in good faith and with no expectation of remuneration—would not be able to afford.
Another potential pathway is the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which 181 countries have signed onto. While the convention is limited by the copyright laws of the nations that are party to it, it can serve as a forum for countries to agree to a baseline set of protections for artists with regard to companies building generative AI models.
As generative AI becomes more advanced and widely accessible, and is applied in unexpected ways, it has become quite evident that current copyright law—which often places undue onus on those whose work is being used without their consent—offers inadequate solutions. Any tenable resolution to the challenge posed by generative AI to copyright would need collective bargaining and international buy-in.

Infusion of generative AI into analytics a work in progress


Many vendors have introduced tools that integrate LLM technology with their platforms, but most are still refining the tools to ensure their accuracy and security.

The integration between generative AI and analytics remains under development.
Many vendors have unveiled plans to enable customers to query and analyze data using conversational language rather than code or business-specific natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.







In addition, many have also introduced AI assistants that users can ask for help while executing various tasks and tools that automatically summarize and explain data products such as reports, dashboards and models.
Some have also introduced SQL generation features that reduce the coding requirements needed to model data and automated tools that offer suggestions as developers build data products.
Sisense was perhaps the first analytics vendor to reveal plans to integrate its platform with generative AI (GenAI) capabilities, introducing an integration with OpenAI -- developer of ChatGPT -- in January 2023. Two months later, ThoughtSpot unveiled Sage, a tool that combined the vendor's existing natural language search capabilities with large language model (LLM) capabilities to enable conversational language interactions with data.
By summer, Tableau and Qlik were among the vendors that had introduced generative AI plans. In addition, tech giants AWS, Google and Microsoft -- developers of analytics platforms QuickSight, Looker and Power BI, respectively -- were all working to add generative AI to their BI tools.
But as the end of 2023 nears, most analytics vendors' generative AI capabilities are still in some stage of development and have not yet been made generally available.
There are exceptions.
For example, MicroStrategy in October made NLP and text-to-code translation capabilities generally available. Similarly, Domo in August released NLP and AI model management capabilities as part of its Domo AI suite.
Most others, however, are still being refined, according to David Menninger, an analyst at Ventana Research.
""There are some that are available today, but the majority are still in preview,"" he said.
Perhaps the main reason for the holdup is that it's difficult to take a new technology and make it one of the most significant parts of a platform.
It takes time to get it right, and vendors are attempting to get it right before they release tools to the public, according to Sumeet Arora, ThoughtSpot's chief development officer. Before releasing tools, vendors need to make sure responses to natural language queries are accurate and the data organizations load into analytics tools that are integrating with LLMs remains private and secure.
""The most difficult technical problem is how to leverage GenAI to answer natural language questions with 100% accuracy in the enterprise. That is not a straightforward problem,"" Arora said.
He noted that OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini answer questions with just under 80% accuracy.
""That is not good enough in analytics,"" Arora said. ""The question is how to get to 100% accuracy in analytics. That has been the journey of the last year.""

Seven benefits of generative AI for the enterprise.






The promise
There are two big reasons so many vendors have made generative AI a focal point of product development.
One is the potential to expand BI use within organizations beyond a small group of highly trained users. The other is the possibility of making existing data experts more efficient. Both come down the simplification of previously complex processes, according to Francois Ajenstat, now the chief product officer at digital analytics platform vendor Amplitude after 13 years at Tableau.
""GenAI really drives radical simplicity in the user experience,"" he said. ""It will open up analytics to a wider range of people and it will enable better analysis by doing a lot of the hard work on their behalf so they can get to the insights faster and focus on what matters.""
Analytics use has been stuck for more than a decade, according to studies.
Because BI platforms are complicated, requiring coding skills for many tasks and necessitating data literacy training even for low-code/no-code tools aimed at self-service users, only about a quarter of employees within organizations use analytics as a regular part of their job.
Generative AI can change that by enabling true conversational interactions with data.
Many vendors developed their own NLP capabilities in recent years. But those NLP tools had limited vocabularies. They required highly specific business phrasing to understand queries and generate relevant responses.
The generative AI platforms developed by OpenAI, Google, Hugging Face and others have LLMs trained with extensive vocabularies and eliminated at least some of the data literacy training required by previous NLP tools.
Meanwhile, by reducing the need to code, generative AI tools can make trained data workers more efficient.
Developing data pipelines that feed data products takes copious amounts of time-consuming coding. Text-to-code translation capabilities enable data workers to use conversational language to write commands that get translated to code. They greatly reduce time-consuming tasks and free data workers to do other things.
MicroStrategy and AWS are among the vendors that have introduced generative AI tools that enable natural language query and analysis. They also released capabilities that automatically summarize and explain data.
In addition, Qlik with Staige and Domo with Domo AI -- along with a spate of data management vendors -- are among those that have gone further and introduced text-to-code translation capabilities.
Ultimately, one of the key reasons analytics vendors are developing so many generative AI tools is the promise of improved communication, according to Donald Farmer, founder and principal of TreeHive Strategy.
""The most obvious [benefit of generative AI] is that it has an ability to communicate what it finds,"" Farmer said. ""Ninety percent of the problem of analytics is explaining your answers to people or getting people to understand what has been discovered.""
Two more benefits -- perhaps geared more toward developers and data engineers -- are its intuitiveness related to data integration and its ability to generate test code to help develop algorithms, Farmer added.
With respect to the generative AI capabilities themselves, some vendors are experimenting a bit more radically than others.
NLP, AI assistants and text-to-code translation capabilities are the most common features that vendors have introduced to simplify data preparation and analysis. Others, however, represent the cutting edge.
Menninger cited Tableau Pulse, a tool that learns Tableau users' behavior to automatically surface relevant insights, as something beyond what most vendors so far have publicly revealed. In addition, he noted that some vendors are working on features that automate tasks such as metadata creation and data cataloging that otherwise take significant time and manual effort.
""The cutting edge is metadata awareness and creation, building a semantic model with little or no intervention by the user,"" Menninger said. ""Take away NLP and the other great value of GenAI is automation. It can automate various steps that have been obstacles to analytics success in the past.""
Farmer, meanwhile, named Microsoft Copilot, Amazon Q from AWS and Duet AI from Google as the comprising the current cutting edge.
Unlike analytics specialists whose tools deal only with analyzing data, the tech giants have the advantage of managing an entire data ecosystem and thus gaining deep understanding of a particular business. Their generative AI tools, therefore, are being integrated not only with BI tools but also data management, supply chain management, customer service and other tools.
""The stuff that looks most interesting is the copilot stuff -- the idea of AI as something that is there in everything you do and absolutely pervasive,"" Farmer said. ""It's only the big platform people that can do that.""


The delay
Often, after tools are unveiled in preview, it takes only a few months for vendors to make whatever alterations are needed and release the tools to the public.
That hasn't been the case with generative AI capabilities.
For example, Sage was introduced by ThoughtSpot nine months ago and is not yet generally available. It was in private preview for a couple of months and then moved to public preview. But the vendor is still working to make sure it's enterprise-ready.
Similarly, Tableau unveiled Tableau GPT and Tableau Pulse in May, but both are still in preview. The same is true of Microsoft's Copilot in Power BI, Google's Duet AI in Looker and Spotfire's Copilot, among many other generative AI tools.
At the core of ensuring generative AI tools are enterprise ready are accuracy, data privacy and data security, as noted by Arora.
AI hallucinations -- incorrect responses -- have been an ongoing problem for LLMs. In addition, their security is suspect, and they have been susceptible to data breaches.
Reducing incorrect responses takes training, which is what vendors are now doing, according to Arora.
He noted that by working with customers using Sage in preview, ThoughtSpot has been able to improve Sage's accuracy to over 95% by combining generative AI with human training.
""What we have figured out is that it takes a human-plus-AI approach to get to accuracy,"" Arora said. ""ThoughtSpot is automatically learning the business language of the organization. But we have made sure that there is human input into how the business language is being interpreted by the data.""
A formula that seems to result in the highest level of accuracy from Sage -- up to 98%, according to Arora -- is to first roll the tool out to power users within an organization for a few weeks. Those power users are able to train Sage to some degree so the tool begins to understand the business.
Then, after those few weeks, Sage's use can be expanded to more users.



The most difficult technical problem is how to leverage GenAI to answer natural language questions with 100% accuracy in the enterprise. That is not a straightforward problem.

""There is no easy button for GenAI,"" Arora said. ""But there is a flow that if you follow, you can get amazing results. Once the system is properly used by the power users and data analysts, it becomes ready for prime time.""
But there's more to the lag time between introducing generative AI analytics capabilities and their general availability than just concerns and risks related to accuracy, security and privacy, according to Ajenstat.
Generative AI represents a complete shift for analytics vendors.
It has been less than 13 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, a significant improvement in generative AI and LLM capabilities.
Before then, some analytics vendors offered traditional AI and machine learning capabilities but not generative AI. Once ChatGPT was released, the ways it could make data workers more efficient while enabling more people within organizations to use analytics tools were clear.
But truly integrating the technologies -- ensuring accurate natural language query responses, training chatbots to be able to assist as customers use various tools, and putting governance measures in place to guarantee data privacy and security -- takes time.
""The speed of adoption of ChatGPT took the technology industry by storm,"" Ajenstat said. ""We realized this is a tectonic plate shifting in the landscape where everyone will lean into it. As a result of that, we're at the peak of the hype cycle. That's exciting. It also means there are a lot of ideas.""
Getting the ideas from the planning stage to the production stage, however, is not a simple, quick process, he continued.
In particular, analytics vendors need to make sure users can trust their generative AI tools.
""We see the potential, but can users trust the results?"" Ajenstat said. ""There's also trust in terms of the training data -- sending it to [a third party]. There's trust in terms of bias and ethics. There's a lot below the surface that technology providers and the industry as a whole have to figure out to make sure we're delivering great products that actually solve customers' problems.""
Beyond the difficulty related to getting tools ready for enterprise-level consumption, the speed of generative AI innovation is delaying the release of some capabilities, according to Farmer.
He noted that once a feature is made generally available, a vendor is making a commitment to that feature. They're committing to improve it with updates, offer support to users and so forth. But because generative AI is now evolving so quickly, vendors are unsure whether some of the capabilities they've revealed in preview are the ones they want to commit to long term.
""If you come out with an enterprise product, you're committed to supporting it over the lifetime of an enterprise product,"" Farmer said. ""It's really difficult to say something is stable enough and complete enough and supportable enough to build an enterprise agreement around it.""


The future
The natural language query capabilities, AI assistants and summarization tools that many analytics vendors are developing -- and a few have made generally available -- are the first generation of generative AI capabilities.
At a certain point, perhaps during the first half of 2024, most will be ready for widespread use. At that point, vendors will turn their attention to a different set of generative AI features, which will represent a second generation.
Process automation might be a primary theme of that second generation after simplification was the primary theme of the first generation, according to Ajenstat.
""It will be interesting to see how long we stay in the first generation because we haven't actually gotten the mass adoption there,"" he said. ""But for me, the next phase is going to be about automation. It will be using generative AI as an agent that can automate tasks on your behalf, augmenting the human by removing some of the drudgery that's out there.""
Arora likewise predicted that task automation will mark the next generation of generative AI, eventually followed by systems themselves becoming autonomous.
Many of the tasks needed to inform natural language queries such as data curation and defining metrics still require manual effort, he noted. But automation of those data preparation tasks is coming.
As for when those automation capabilities will be in production, Arora predicted it could be as early as the second half of 2024 and early 2025.
""Users will be able to connect to a data system and then start asking questions,"" Arora said. ""The system will automatically define metrics, automatically find the right data tables and answer questions with accuracy. There will be complete automation.""
Similarly, Menninger cited automation as a likely centerpiece of the next phase of generative AI development. However, he said automation will go beyond merely reducing the drudgery of data preparation.
Menninger expects that the first-generation tools now under development will be available by the end of the first half of next year. Vendors will then not simply turn their attention to automation but turn their attention to the automation of AI.
Generative AI is not the same as AI, Menninger noted. It is not predictive analytics. It still takes the rare expertise of data scientists and PhDs to train data and develop AI models that can do predictive analysis.
However, generative AI can eventually be trained to create AI models.
""In the same way GenAI can now generate SQL code, we're going to get to a point where GenAI can generate predictive models that are of a high enough quality that we can rely on them,"" Menninger said. ""And if they're not of a high enough quality, they'll be close enough that we can at least have more productivity around creating AI models.""
He added that research from ISG -- now Ventana's parent company -- shows that the number one problem organizations have developing AI models is a lack of skills.
""To the extent we can use GenAI to overcome that skills gap, that's what the future is about.""

Generative AI and Personalization won’t work without a Customer Data Operations Strategy
December 18, 2023


At the recent AWS re:Invent sessions, you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing about Generative AI. There was also a ton of focus on elevating experiences and personalization. What I heard less about is the importance of the quality of underlying data in making cutting edge AI or personalization tools actually work. And that’s a huge mistake.
Data quality isn’t nearly as sexy as Generative AI, but if you don’t get the input right, that magical-seeming output will be wrong. Building and iterating custom models is extremely expensive – do you want to waste time and resources building models on bad inputs? What good is the ability to customize outreach emails if the data is inaccurate? How useful is it to generate marketing messages at scale or send well-timed push notifications if the details are wrong?
The tricky thing is, “good data” isn’t a static thing. For consumer brands, it requires an ongoing end-to-end management of workflows that turn raw customer data into a valuable and usable asset to fuel customer engagement teams and tools. I like to think of it as “customer data operations.”
Unfortunately, this isn’t as easy as it sounds, and it’s more involved than many believe it to be (or than most customer data tool vendors make it out to be).

Data unification and use is not set-and-forget — it takes upkeep
Unifying customer data is a complex challenge because of the sheer volume and diversity of data points, the fragmentation of data across different siloed systems, and the lack of standardization in how data is collected.
On top of all that, customer lives are dynamic and constantly evolving, with changes in demographics, interests, and behaviors often not explicitly captured in the data you collect. This is to say nothing of the ever increasing diversity of places where this data needs to be collected as new channels continue to proliferate.
What this means is that building and maintaining unified customer profiles is not “one and done.” It’s hard enough to set up a unified customer view, but even when you accomplish that it’s only the beginning.
First is the resource-intensive job of creating a foundational customer data asset, which includes:

Ingesting data
Resolving known (key-based) identities
Resolving identities for “everything else” (the data without linking keys)
Modeling the customer data
Shaping the customer data
Building data workflows

Then you need to maintain steady-state functioning for that foundational asset, which involves:

Data quality control
Updating data assets and transformations as upstream data evolves
Monitoring workflows
Handling compliance obligations, including rights to erasure
Error resolution
Data governance

Finally, if any new data sources or downstream destinations are introduced, there needs to be a thorough process for change management, including a safe environment to test workflows so nothing breaks in production and causes costly downtime.
If there’s one thing you should take away from this article, it’s the scope and complexity of keeping your data working for you.
If you want to dig deeper, read on. I’ll lay out the elements in greater detail, along with common approaches and why they fall short.

Customer identity is difficult and specialized
Resolving identities and unifying customer data into a usable asset is time-consuming, expensive, and leaves room for error as new and often conflicting data enters the mix. But this is the critical first step toward getting all the rest of marketing and analytics to work properly — if you don’t do this right, you end up feeding downstream tools and processes with inaccurate and incomplete data.
Things get time-consuming when your approach uses custom match-merge to do identity resolution that’s slow, inaccurate, and difficult to maintain, as with legacy approaches like those in MDM or ETL solutions. Running this also requires teams to take data workflows down, often for weeks at a time.
It gets expensive if you’re outsourcing identity resolution to providers that rely on third-party data signals, which costs more and performs poorly due to rapidly deteriorating third-party fidelity. If your approach involves doing identity resolution in your data warehouse, it requires spending computing credits and the costs increase exponentially over time.
As for errors, there are common problems that lead to inaccuracies and profile collapse with both a composable CDP (Customer Data Platform) approach and packaged CDPs. When performing deterministic matching in a data warehouse, as with a naive “composable” approach, identity becomes inaccurate as PII data changes over time, and profiles aren’t guaranteed to be stable. When using a typical CDP in-product identity resolution with deterministic & probabilistic matching, quality suffers whenever the platform drops historical data. And third-party-augmented identity resolution isn’t just expensive as mentioned above, it’s also becoming less and less accurate as cookies are phased out and privacy regulations evolve. 

Data needs are constantly changing
Business users constantly ask for fast access to new data sources and insights that require extensive data modeling and governance, often across multiple systems. Adding a new data source and then using that data to build an attribute and generate insights is a lot of work.
There’s significant data mapping from system to system so each knows what the new data field is, where it should live on a profile, and who to make that data point available to. This is where data engineers waste a lot of time on profile maintenance, and is a common problem with reverse ETL tools that need to be given permission to view datasets, tables, or views for every change. For example, you may have a customer table that has ten fields, each representing a different attribute. If you add an eleventh column, a reverse ETL vendor would not automatically expose it, since these tools only expose and track changes in columns in the original ten mapped fields that are part of the sync configuration. This type of challenge is typical when tools assume your data is already unified, when in fact it rarely is.
There are also challenges with accuracy when accounting for data changes. One common approach is to create new attributes using coding/SQL, as is usually the case with packaged CDPs, but the lack of universal ID across underlying data adds complexity to building attributes and can lead to inaccurate attribute values. Some products calculate attributes and generate insights in a data warehouse or off-platform through code, but if the CDP lacks historical data, calculated attributes will be off.
Finally, you need to account for multiple views of the data. Packaged CDPs typically offer every user the same view of the data, though their needs (and permissions) may be different. This gets even more complex when it’s multiple views across brands and geographies. 

Change management is complex and risky
Updating data workflows takes forever because IT teams must work across multiple SaaS tools that lack any environment (let alone a unified one) for testing and monitoring. Most solutions force you to make changes in production, which puts downstream workflows at risk and makes rolling back changes extremely hard.  
These challenges persist no matter what your approach to customer data is. Whatever your overall data strategy approach, you have a tech stack, and making all the pieces work together is no small feat.
Change management risks breaking or disrupting all downstream systems that rely on the customer data feeds. This is an obvious enough pitfall in the many tools that force you to make changes live in production. Another common approach is to create a copy production environment for testing, then map workflows to the copy, but that presents difficulty in rolling back changes if workflows fail. Finally, some opt to test changes in a non-production environment that only has access to some dummy sample data. This leaves you with a big unknown of whether workflows will work at scale when the sandbox is promoted to production.
Monitoring is often resource-intensive. There are typically two approaches: purchase additional software to monitor the end-to-end data workflow, or hire a team to monitor end-to-end data workflows across all of the disparate elements of a composable CDP.
Maintenance is complicated across multiple tools and environments. You need proficiency in every tool involved and have to go through each individual product’s support when issues arise. In a composable CDP, this could be up to five different platforms. Many opt to build and maintain an entirely separate development environment, which can be cumbersome.
Quality assurance is often manual and time-consuming. Standard approaches have no ability to mass pass/unpause when platform errors occur, and there’s no built-in alert system or tools to do quality assurance checks. You’re left to coordinate the workflow between these tools yourself.
Costs can quickly stack up. When a vendor is completely offloading their storage and computation to your data warehouse, incentives are misaligned. It’s to the vendor’s benefit to rapidly add new capabilities rather than optimizing their efficiency, and you get stuck with the bill.

Customizing tooling is difficult
Adding new technologies to your stack often traps data in silos or forces you into a specific way of working that’s difficult to customize for your business.
There are so many useful tools out there, and it would be great to put them all together to gain the benefit of their capabilities — tools for storage, data science & modeling, analytics, reverse ETL, and others. The problem is that these tools tend to be highly opinionated on how they work. That means there’s no common concept of “customer,” data risks getting trapped in more silos, and you can’t customize the underlying data model.
IT needs to make herculean efforts to get all the parts working together (and keep them that way). It’s often not as fast as intended because IT has to learn multiple systems and be able to pivot between them; it’s often not as cheap as expected since costs escalate as you scale. You end up constantly being at the mercy of how well your tech stack is performing. 
What to look for to make customer data operations successful
I’ve laid out a host of problems here that brands commonly face when trying to handle their customer data operations. My goal isn’t to make you lose hope, but rather to help you understand the scope of the challenge.
We founded Amperity with the aim to help brands finally solve the foundational data quality problem that affects every single thing they want to do with customer data. In the process of building a platform to do this, we came to understand that the data quality problem requires so much maintenance and attention that can’t just be hand-waved away. We realized how hard this stuff is, and we devote all our time and energy to it — consumer brands whose main focus is making the best outdoor gear or providing top-notch hotel experiences or helping people achieve their financial goals shouldn’t have to worry about the million technical ways their customer data strategy could fall apart.
That’s why we built Amperity to answer all the pains of customer data operations. AI-powered, comprehensive identity resolution and a unified customer view with transparency, flexibility, control, stability, speed, and scale. Managing access for business users with multi-brand and multi-database views, role-based views, householding, and custom calculated attributes. Change management with 24/7 data monitoring and alerts, fully integrated live sandboxes for safe testing, and automatic data lineage and audit logs. Flexibility in the tech stack with data egress in any format, automatically-shaped data assets, modular functionality for interoperability, flexible data retention rules, and a cloud-agnostic platform.
Amperity makes customer data operations easy; it’s possible to do it in other ways, but you’ll probably find it’s a lot harder. That’s what we’ve heard for years from brands who have tried to do it on their own.
Either way, the key thing to account for is the size and complexity of the job to be done. Getting value from customer data, powering generative AI, making personalization work right — all of this depends on managing an end-to-end workflow pulling together massive amounts of data and multiple tools. And that just doesn’t happen on its own.

A new report from Salesforce suggests that the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in Canadian workplaces is mostly unsupervised. 

64 percent of global respondents admitted to passing off AI-generated work as their own. 

The report is based on a double-blind online survey of over 14,000 full-time employees across 14 countries, including 1,020 in Canada. It found that over a quarter of these Canadian employees are using generative AI at work and, of those, over half are using it without the formal approval of their employers. 
The wide release of generative AI tools based on large language models, such as ChatGPT, has started an arms race of investment in the sector, which Goldman Sachs forecasts to approach $200 billion USD by 2025. There has also been a race to launch new products and tools, with Google recently unveiling its own AI model in Gemini, making an increase of workplace use seem inevitable, whether sanctioned or not.  
Alongside 56 percent of the surveyed Canadians using unapproved generative AI tools at work, 28 percent said they have even used tools that were explicitly banned by their workplaces. As workers navigate generative AI in the workplace, 64 percent of global respondents admitted to passing off AI-generated work as their own. 
The unchecked use of AI in the workplace comes with a lack of workplace training or policies, with the report asserting that nearly seven in 10 global workers have never completed or received training on how to use generative AI safely and ethically at work.

As a result, just 13 percent of Canadian workers said they have clearly defined policies for using generative AI at work, with 41 percent reporting that they had no policies on using AI at work and 33 percent saying they did not even know if their workplace had policies.
Despite the general lack of clarity around AI use in the workplace, 63 percent of the surveyed Canadian workers said generative AI makes them more productive at work, while 45 percent claimed it makes them more engaged. 
With the Canadian government seeking guidance on generative AI regulation, the report calls for businesses to implement clear guidelines to ensure generative AI technology is enterprise-ready and used responsibly.
“To realize AI’s full potential, it’s critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself,” Paula Goldman, Salesforce’s chief ethical and humane use officer, said in a statement. “With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers.”

Bulent Cinarkaya



					General Manager of Field Service Management, ServiceNow				




December 18, 2023




 








In the dynamic field service landscape, Bulent Cinarkaya of ServiceNow explores how generative AI is reshaping operations, offering efficiency, and meeting rising customer expectations.
Talent shortages impact nearly every industry and are especially challenging for field service organizations. According to a recent studyOpens a new window , the retiring workforce will impact 70% of service organizations over the next five to ten years. 
At the same time, customer expectations have increased, requiring faster and more reliable service delivery. But field service teams struggle to keep up with demand. That same study found that 50% of organizations don’t have the resources to keep up with service demand. 
Field service organizations are under pressure to improve the efficiency of their shrinking teams, reduce costs, and increase profits, all while keeping customers and employees happy.
Field service organizations must adopt new strategies and solutions to cope with this challenge. Combining digital platforms, “classic” AI, and generative AI is critical to helping field service organizations overcome labor challenges and improve service quality.
Cutting Back on Busywork
AI and digital tools have transformed the field service industry by automating tedious and time-consuming manual tasks. This transformation has accelerated over the past year through the introduction of generative AI.
One of the manual tasks that field service organizations are streamlining with generative AI is customer debriefs that summarize their history and issue details or the process of documenting work order closure notes. It is an essential part of field service operations, as it helps to track performance, identify issues, and provide feedback. However, it can be a burden for technicians, who must manually draft and submit work order closure notes after each visit. This time-consuming process can slow agents down, reduce their productivity, and contribute to job dissatisfaction.
Generative AI can help automate work order closure notes by accurately distilling the work order information, including customer or incident details, previous touchpoints, actions taken by involved parties, and the eventual resolution, to create case summary notes in seconds for the technician to review. 
By using generative AI to automate tasks such as work order closure notes, field service organizations can improve their efficiency and reduce the workload and stress for their agents, who can focus more on helping customers. They can also improve their data quality and availability, as they can collect more complete and consistent information from each visit.

Enabling Proactive Service
Simplifying time-consuming tasks such as compiling work order closure notes is the tip of the iceberg. AI has the potential to help field service teams open new revenue streams and improve customer experiences through better, faster, more proactive service. 
Implementing proactive service models, or anticipating and preventing potential issues before they affect customers or equipment, has been a key objective for field service organizations for years because it can improve customer satisfaction and drive cost savings. However, proactive, predictive service can be challenging to implement. It requires a significant degree of data analysis, forecasting, and planning.
AI can help field service organizations overcome these challenges and enhance their proactive and predictive service capabilities in three main ways:

AI can analyze historical device data and use predictive analytics to identify potential issues before they occur. This can help organizations reduce downtime and improve overall efficiency. For example, consider a scenario where a retailer must manage point-of-sale (POS) systems across multiple locations. Using AI to analyze data from POS systems directly, the retailer can identify the potential for system crashes or connectivity problems and then automatically schedule a technician site visit to avoid future problems.
AI can speed up diagnostics and analysis and help with installation, parts, and troubleshooting. This allows organizations to improve their overall efficiency while also reducing costs. For example, if a technician is assigned to troubleshoot an issue with a piece of equipment, the technician would typically need to manually diagnose it by testing different components until they find the root cause. With AI’s help, the technician can quickly access diagnostic information that identifies the cause of the issue and resolve it quickly while also reducing downtime. 
AI can cluster similar work orders and discover trends based on trusted work order data and customer history, helping organizations optimize scheduling and better allocate resources. This can drive customer satisfaction and loyalty by assisting organizations in providing efficient service and tailoring service offerings. For example, AI can group work orders based on location, priority, skill level, or equipment type, allowing organizations to assign the right technician to the right job at the right time. 

Providing Better Virtual Experiences
Virtual agents allow customers or technicians to self-serve without relying on human intervention. However, predefined scripts, rules, and keywords have historically limited virtual agents. They cannot understand natural language, generate human-like responses, or learn from feedback, often leading to customer and employee frustration. 
Powered by natural-language understanding (NLU), generative AI-powered virtual agents are better equipped to answer common questions, resolve simple issues, and escalate complex cases to human agents as needed. 
Generative AI-powered virtual agents are even more powerful when integrated with a digital platform. They can dynamically assign field service agents based on requests, reducing workloads for back-office teams. They can also provide real-time information and advice through step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, or safety alerts and help schedule appointments, report g incidents, and request parts. 
Optimizing the Workforce
As the workforce continues to change, field service organizations must prioritize training while ensuring technicians, both full-time employees and contract team members, have the right tools, resources, and optimal schedules to do their jobs effectively. 
AI can help field service organizations better optimize and manage their shifting workforce in three main ways:

It can deliver real-time training and repair recommendations with personalized instructions for the device repairs needed on the spot.  AI can recognize a device and its components, identify the issue and its cause, and generate customized instructions for the repair. It can then use augmented reality to overlay images and text on the technician’s field of view, providing them with visual guidance and feedback. This can help technicians learn new skills, solve problems faster, and deliver better customer service.
It can help reskill and upskill technicians, offering them continuous learning opportunities and feedback by dynamically monitoring and evaluating their performance, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and providing constructive feedback in their daily work. It can also generate personalized learning paths and materials for technicians based on their skill level, learning style, or career goals. This can help technicians improve their knowledge, skills, and confidence.
It can proactively recommend solutions to technicians and agents and suggest and summarize knowledge articles to help teams resolve issues quickly and accurately. Generative AI can quickly understand the context and content of a case, such as the customer or device details, the problem description, or the previous actions taken. This information can generate relevant and concise solutions or suggestions for technicians, such as troubleshooting steps, best practices, or tips. It can also search and summarize knowledge articles from various sources, such as manuals, databases, or forums, to provide additional information or guidance.

Building Trust in AI
To ensure the long-term success of generative AI, field service organizations need to build trust. This comes from a carefully laid foundation prioritizing high-quality data, safety, governance, and security. 
Monitoring and measuring the impact of generative AI is also crucial. Field service organizations must regularly monitor and evaluate their generative AI performance and impact to ensure they meet goals and expectations. This can help identify and address any issues or risks arising from their generative AI usage.
The Future of Field Service
Generative AI has the potential to radically change the world of work, allowing organizations to drive greater speed, productivity, and value. Companies that harness its power quickly and responsibly can expect new levels of efficiency and productivity for their employees and customers. 
It’s the combination of generative AI with other technologies, such as automation, machine learning, and digital platforms, that will help field service organizations solve their biggest problems by breaking down silos, automating manual processes, and helping teams do more with less.

An AI hallucination is an instance in which an AI model produces a wholly unexpected output; it may be negative and offensive, wildly inaccurate, humorous, or simply creative and unusual.
AI hallucinations are not inherently harmful — in fact, in certain creative and artistic contexts, they can be incredibly interesting — but they are statements that aren’t grounded in fact or logic and should be treated as such.
Some AI hallucinations are easy to spot, while others may be more subtle and go undetected. If users fail to identify an AI hallucination when it occurs and so pass off this output as fact, it can lead to a range of issues. In any case, if your work relies on an generative AI program, it’s essential to prevent AI hallucinations – see our 7 methods below.

Understanding AI Hallucinations
AI models — especially generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) — have grown in the complexity of the data and queries they can handle, generating intelligent responses, imagery, audio, and other outputs that typically align with the users’ requests and expectations.
However, artificial intelligence (AI) models aren’t foolproof; because of the massive amounts of training data, complicated algorithms, and other less-than-transparent factors that go into preparing these models for the market, many AI platforms have run into issues where they “hallucinate” and deliver incorrect information.
For instance, in this example, ChatGPT AI chatbot attempts to translate “Lojban” – which is a fake language – into English, with semi-hilarious results:

However, an AI hallucination is not always a negative thing, as long as you know what you’re dealing with; certain AI hallucinations, especially with audio and visuals, can lead to interesting elements for creative brainstorming and project development.
7 Methods for Detecting and Preventing AI Hallucinations
The following techniques are designed for AI model developers and vendors as well as for organizations that are deploying AI as part of their business operations, but not necessarily developing their own models.
Please note: These techniques are not focused on the actual inputs users may be putting into the consumer-facing sides of these models. But if you’re a consumer looking to optimize AI outcomes and avoid hallucinatory responses, here are a few quick tips:

Submit clear and focused prompts that stick to one core topic; you can always follow up with a separate query if you have multiple parts to your question.
Ensure you provide enough contextual information for the AI to provide an accurate and well-rounded response.
Avoid acronyms, slang, and other confusing language in your prompts.
Verify AI outputs with your own research.
Pay attention; in many cases, AI hallucinations give themselves away with odd or outlandish language or images.

Now, here’s a closer look at how tech leaders and organizations can prevent, detect, and mitigate AI hallucinations in the AI models they develop and manage:
1) Clean and Prepare Training Data for Better Outcomes
Appropriately cleansing and preparing your training data for AI model development and fine-tuning is one of the best steps you can take toward avoiding AI hallucinations.
A thorough data preparation process improves the quality of the data you’re using and gives you the time and testing space to recognize and eliminate issues in the dataset, including certain biases that could feed into hallucinations.
Data preprocessing, normalization, anomaly detection, and other big data preparation work should be completed from the outset and in some form each time you update training data or retrain your model. For retraining in particular, going through data preparation again ensures that the model has not learned or retained any behavior that will feed back into the training data and lead to deeper problems in the future.
2) Design Models With Interpretability and Explainability
The larger AI models that so many enterprises are moving toward have massive capabilities but can also become so dense with information and training that even their developers struggle to interpret and explain what these models are doing.
Issues with interpretability and explainability become most apparent when models begin to produce hallucinatory or inaccurate information. In this case, model developers aren’t always sure what’s causing the problem or how they can fix it, which can lead to frustration within the company and among end users.
To remove some of this doubt and confusion from the beginning, plan to design AI models with interpretability and explainability, incorporating features that focus on these two priorities into your blueprint design. While building your own models, document your processes, maintain transparency among key stakeholders, and select an architecture format that is easy to interpret and explain, no matter how data and user expectations grow.
One type of architecture that works well for interpretability, explainability, and overall accuracy is an ensemble model; this type of AI/ML approach pulls predicted outcomes from multiple models and aggregates them for more accurate, well-rounded, and transparent outputs.
3) Test Models and Training Data for Performance Issues
Before you deploy an AI model and even after the fact, your team should spend significant time testing both the AI models and any training data or algorithms for performance issues that may arise in real-world scenarios.
Comprehensive testing should cover not only more common queries and input formats but also edge cases and complex queries. Testing your AI on how it responds to a wide range of possible inputs predicts how the model will perform for different use cases. It also gives your team the chance to improve data and model architecture before end users become frustrated with inaccurate or hallucinatory results.
If the AI model you’re working with can accept data in different formats, be sure to test it both with alphanumeric and audio or visual data inputs. Also, consider completing adversarial testing to intentionally try to mislead the model and determine if it falls for the bait. Many of these tests can be automated with the right tools in place.
4) Incorporate Human Quality Assurance Management
Several data quality, AI management, and model monitoring tools can assist your organization in maintaining high-quality AI models that deliver the best possible outputs. However, these tools aren’t always the best for detecting more obscure or subtle AI hallucinations; in these cases and many others, it’s a good idea to include a team of humans who can assist with AI quality assurance management.
Using a human-in-the-loop review format can help to catch oddities that machines may miss and also give your AI developers real-world recommendations for how improvements should be made. The individuals who handle this type of work should have a healthy balance of AI/technology skills and experience, customer service experience, and perhaps even compliance experience. This blended background will give them the knowledge they need to identify issues and create better outcomes for your end users.
5) Collect User Feedback Regularly
Especially once an AI model is already in operation, the users themselves are your best source of information when it comes to AI hallucinations and other performance aberrations. If appropriate feedback channels are put in place, users can inform model developers and AI vendors of real scenarios where the model’s outputs went amiss.
With this specific knowledge, developers can identify both one-off outcomes and trending errors, and, from there, they can use this knowledge to improve the model’s training data and responses to similar queries in future iterations of the platform.
6) Partner With Ethical and Transparent Vendors
Whether you’re an AI developer or an enterprise that uses AI technology, it’s important to partner with other ethical AI vendors that emphasize transparent and compliant data collection, model training, model design, and model deployment practices.
This will ensure you know how the models you use are trained and what safeguards are in place to protect user data and prevent hallucinatory outcomes. Ideally, you’ll want to work with vendors that can clearly articulate the work they’re doing to achieve ethical outcomes and produce products that balance accuracy with scalability.

7) Monitor and Update Your Models Over Time
AI models work best when they are continuously updated and improved. These improvements should be made based on user feedback, your team’s research, trends in the greater industry, and any performance data your quality management and monitoring tools collect. Regularly monitoring AI model performance from all these angles and committing to improving models based on these analytics can help you avoid previous hallucination scenarios and other performance problems in the future.

How and Why Do AI Hallucinations Occur?
It’s not always clear how and why AI hallucinations occur, which is part of why they have become such a problem. Users aren’t always able to identify hallucinations when they happen and AI developers often can’t determine what anomaly, training issue, or other factor may have led to such an outcome.
The algorithms on which modern neural networks and larger AI models are trained are highly complex and designed to mimic the human brain. This gives them the ability to handle more complex and multifaceted user requests, but it also gives them a level of independence and seeming autonomy that makes it more difficult to understand how they arrive at certain decisions.
While it does not appear that AI hallucinations can be eliminated at this time, especially in more intricate AI models, these are a few of the most common issues that contribute to AI hallucinations:

Incomplete training data.
Biased training data.
Overfitting and lack of context.
Unclear or inappropriately sized model parameters.
Unclear prompts.

Issues That May Arise From AI Hallucinations
AI hallucinations can lead to a number of different problems for your organization, its data, and its customers. These are just a handful of the issues that may arise based on hallucinatory outputs:

Inaccurate decision-making and diagnostics: AI instances may confidently make an inaccurate statement of fact that leads healthcare workers, insurance providers, and other professionals to make inaccurate decisions or diagnoses that negatively impact other people and/or their reputations. For example, based on a query it receives about a patient’s blood glucose levels, an AI model may diagnose a patient with diabetes when their blood work does not indicate this health problem exists.
Discriminatory, offensive, harmful, or otherwise outlandish outputs: Whether it’s the result of biased training data or the rationale is completely obscure, an AI model may suddenly begin to generate harmfully stereotypical, rude, or even threatening outputs. While these kinds of outlandish outputs are typically easy to detect, they can lead to a range of issues, including offending the end user.
Unreliable data for analytics and other business decisions: AI models aren’t always perfect with numbers, but instead of stating when they are unable to come to the correct answer, some AI models have hallucinated and produced inaccurate data results. If business users are not careful, they may unknowingly rely on this inaccurate business analytics data when making important decisions.
Ethical and legal concerns: AI hallucinations may expose private data or other sensitive information that can lead to cybersecurity and legal issues. Additionally, offensive or discriminatory statements may lead to ethical dilemmas for the organization that hosts this AI platform.
Misinformation related to global news and current events: When users work with AI platforms to fact-check, especially for real-time news and ongoing current events, depending on how the question is phrased and how recent and comprehensive the AI model’s training is, the model may confidently produce misinformation that the user may spread without realizing its inaccuracies.
Poor user experience: If an AI model regularly produces offensive, incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise confusing content, users will likely become frustrated and choose to stop using the model and/or switch to a competitor. This can alienate your core audience and limit opportunities for building a larger audience of users.

Bottom Line: Preventing AI Hallucinations When Using Large-Scale AI Models
The biggest AI innovators recognize that AI hallucinations create real problems and are taking major steps to counteract hallucinations and misinformation, but AI models continue to produce hallucinatory content on occasion.
Whether you’re an AI developer or an enterprise user, it’s important to recognize that these hallucinations are happening, but, fortunately, there are steps you can take to better identify hallucinations and correct for the negative outcomes that accompany them. It requires the right combination of comprehensive training and testing, monitoring and quality management tools, well-trained internal teams, and a process that emphasizes continual feedback loops and improvement. With this strategy in place, your team can better address and mitigate AI hallucinations before they lead to cybersecurity, compliance, and reputation issues for the organization.

As organizations continue to navigate the future of work, global HR research and advisory firm McLean & Company suggests that preparing workforces for disruption from generative artificial intelligence (AI) will require evolving strategic HR initiatives to better address the talent gap driven by emerging technologies.TORONTO, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to influence the way work gets done by assisting with and substituting tasks. However, alongside the ample benefits come complications, such as disrupting existing roles, shifting skill requirements, and affecting workforce composition, according to the latest research from McLean & Company, a global HR research and advisory firm. The newly published industry resource, Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI, provides insights that will help HR leaders understand the workforce planning implications of generative AI and adjust initiatives to fill the talent gap.

According to McLean & Company’s new research, workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce; however, even without a formal workforce planning process, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption. (CNW Group/McLean & Company)







""Generative AI has the potential to disrupt organizations by automating tasks, reshaping roles, and shifting talent requirements,"" says Lisa Highfield, principal director of Human Resources Technology & Artificial Intelligence at McLean & Company. ""The success of organizations in leveraging generative AI to drive organizational objectives hinges on HR to address the underlying impacts on talent.""

Organizations that adopt generative AI are more likely to gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and performance, the firm's resource explains. To successfully leverage new technologies, McLean & Company highlights in the blueprint that organizations must first determine how generative AI use supports the organization's strategic objectives to discover its impact on the workforce, and in turn, the talent demand, supply, and gap.
""HR can address the talent gap driven by generative AI by adjusting and developing strategic HR initiatives to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent,"" explains Highfield.To support HR leaders in the future of work, which continues to be heavily impacted by generative AI developments, McLean & Company offers research insights on how to navigate the impact of AI on talent, split into two key sections in the blueprint. An overview of the research is outlined below:1.  Section One: Understand workforce planning implications. The first section discusses the anticipated influence of generative AI on roles, tasks, skills, and workforce demographics. For example, roles requiring a higher degree of decision-making and problem solving, organizational knowledge, creativity and innovation, and social and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated.The guidance and insights in section one can also help HR leaders understand the impact of generative AI on roles, how it will change the demand for technical and non-technical skills, and how generative AI may contribute to the digital divide and disproportionately affect certain populations.2.  Section Two: Address talent gaps. The second section identifies actions HR can take to reduce talent gaps driven by generative AI and ensure the organization has the right talent in place to meet objectives. Examples of these actions include understanding when to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent in order to respond to organizational needs appropriately, and determining the next steps needed to address talent gaps. Additionally, section two will support HR leaders in planning to address generative AI's impact on workforce planning initiatives and adjusting HR initiatives to plan for the talent gap driven by the new technologies.McLean & Company suggests that while workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption even without a formal workforce planning process.To access the full research and insights, please visit Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI.In addition to industry resources, McLean & Company also offers workshops to HR professionals to support them in program building and navigating other nuances of their roles.

The Shortcomings of Generative AI Detection: How Schools Should Approach Declining Teacher Trust In Students

[ PDF version ]
Generative AI – systems that use machine learning to produce new content (e.g., text or images) in response to user prompts – has infiltrated the education system and fundamentally shifted the relationships between teachers and their students.
Across the country, educators have expressed high levels of anxiety about students using generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, to cheat on assignments, exams, and essays in addition to fears of students losing critical thinking skills. One professor even described it as having “infected [the education system] like a deathwatch beetle, hollowing out sound structures from the inside until the imminent collapse.” In response to these fears, school districts, like New York City and Los Angeles, quickly imposed bans on its use by both educators and students. Schools have turned to tools like generative AI detectors to attempt to restore educator control and trust; however, detection efforts have fallen short in both their implementation and efficacy.
CDT Research Affirms Declining Trust…
One significant finding from our polling research of teachers, parents, and students is that teacher perception of widespread generative AI use for cheating appears to be largely unfounded. Forty percent of teachers who say that their students have used generative AI for school think their students have used it to write and submit a paper. But only 19 percent of students who report having used generative AI say they have used it to write and submit a paper – a finding that is supported by other survey research. 
Even despite the reality that a large majority of students are not using generative AI for nefarious academic purposes, teachers have still become more mistrustful of students’ work – perhaps due to the widespread, fear-stoking coverage of cheating instances. Sixty two percent of teachers agreed with the statement that “[g]enerative AI has made me more distrustful of whether my students’ work is actually theirs.” And this mistrust is bleeding into certain groups of students being disciplined at disproportionate rates for using or being accused of using generative AI – Title I and licensed special education teachers report higher rates of disciplinary actions for generative AI use among their students.
These high levels of mistrust among teachers and subsequent disciplinary action have led to frustration among students and parents about erroneous accusations of cheating, which can cause an even further rift between teachers and students. This erosion of trust is potentially damaging to school communities where strong relationships between educators and their students are imperative in providing a safe, quality learning environment.
…And Insufficient Detection Tools And Training
Tools designed to detect when generative AI was used to produce content are the only technological solutions currently available to help teachers attempt to combat generative AI-based cheating; however, they fall short of solving existing trust issues. To begin, school policies on content detection tool use is spotty – only 17 percent of teachers say that their school provides a content detection tool as part of its larger technology platform, and 26 percent say their school recommends their use, but leaves it up to the educator to choose one and implement it. Without strong guidance on the use and implementation of content detection tools, teachers appear uneasy about utilizing them as a defense mechanism for cheating. Only 38 percent of teachers report using a generative AI content detection tool regularly, and just 18 percent of teachers strongly agree that these tools “are an accurate and effective way to determine whether a student is using AI-generated content.” Teachers’ lack of confidence is well-founded as, at least at this point, these tools are not consistently effective at differentiating between AI-generated and human-written text.
Beyond using tools for detection, teacher confidence in their own effectiveness at detecting generative AI created writing is low – 22 percent say they are very effective and 43 percent say they are somewhat effective. This is particularly concerning given that most teachers have not received guidance on how to detect cheating. Only 23 percent of teachers who have received training on their schools’ policies and procedures regarding generative AI have gotten guidance on how to detect student use of ChatGPT (or another generative AI tool) when submitting school assignments.
How Should Schools Approach Declining Teacher Trust?
Given our research and what we know about generative AI content detection tools, they are not the answer, at least for now. These tools suffer from accuracy issues, and may disproportionately flag non-native speakers. Instead, schools need to:

Offer teacher training on how to assess student work in light of generative AI: To help teachers feel like they have more control over academic integrity in the classroom, schools must properly equip them to deal with the new reality of generative AI. This means providing them with training on the limitations of detectors and how to respond if they reasonably suspect that a student is cheating.
Craft and implement clear policies about which uses are allowed and prohibited: Our polling from this past summer shows that schools are failing to provide guidance on what is defined as “improper use” of generative AI, with 37 percent of teachers reporting that their school has no policy or they are not sure if there is a policy in place on generative AI. It is imperative for both teachers and students to know this, so that everyone is on the same page about responsible generative AI use. 
Encourage teachers to modify assignments to minimize the effectiveness of generative AI: Understanding what generative AI systems are not good at can help teachers design assignments where using generative AI will not be helpful to students. For instance, generative AI systems are often ineffective at providing accurate sources for their claims. Requiring students to provide citations for any claims they make will likely require students to go far beyond a generated response.

At present, it isn’t easy to find a topic more relevant and rapidly developing than the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Philosophers have been around much longer than computers, and are trying to solve some of the questions about AI which have arisen lately. How does the mind work? Is it possible for machines to act intelligently like humans, and if so, do they have real, “conscious” minds? What are the ethical implications of intelligent machines? And finally, is it possible to create true artificial intelligence?

From Descartes to Turing, the evolution of modern philosophy’s perception of artificial intelligence has been highlighted by conflicting opinions and outlooks.





 
If your phone beats you at chess, it might make you think that artificial intelligence is preparing to take over the world. However, what is artificial intelligence really, and what types of AI exist? What are the latest developments in this area? Should we fear or hope for a future with AI?
 
Artificial intelligence is the ability of digital computers and robots controlled by them to perform tasks that were previously the prerogative of humans.

Modern projects for the development of artificial intelligence systems replicate intellectual processes characteristic of human thinking, such as reasoning, generalization, experience, and data analysis.





 
Artificial intelligence in the contemporary world is a huge range of algorithms and mechanized learning tools that allow you to get data, identify patterns, and optimize processes quickly.
 
The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. AI systems work by using large amounts of data that are analyzed for patterns and correlations and then used to predict events.
 
AI programming focuses on three core skills: learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI systems can be used to create chatbots that generate text, as well as image and voice recognition, machine vision, natural language processing, robotics, and self-driving cars.
 
How Did Artificial Intelligence Originate?

The basic idea of artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since ancient times, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that it got its name. AIs are intelligent machines that can act and think like humans, or even better than humans. In the decades since, AI has become increasingly powerful as various methods have been developed to improve its effectiveness.





 
In the 1950s, a group of scientists at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire decided to explore the possibilities of AI. They developed the LISP programming language, which allowed for more flexibility in machine learning, i.e., created the ability of computers to learn from “experience” and data.
 
This was a critical step towards building machines with something resembling true intelligence. They were able to make their machines “learn” by rewarding them when they got the right answers and punishing them when they got the wrong answer.





 
Significant progress was made over the next decade, and in 1961 the British scientist Joseph Weizenbaum wrote Eliza, the first conversational computer program. Then, subsequent programs laid the foundations of modern technology.
 
These included game programs, such as a checkers-playing machine, which could play at the level of a grandmaster. Additionally, scientists created systems based on vision, natural language processing, and robotic systems designed to mimic human behavior in a physical environment (for example, in factories).

In the 1970s, more significant advances were made. Expert systems have been developed that can make decisions in complex areas such as medical diagnostics or legal disputes.





 
In addition, neural networks emerged. These simulated parts of the brain in software form and were used to create advanced algorithms designed specifically for robotic applications such as self-driving cars or uncrewed aerial vehicles (drones).
 
The 1980s and 1990s and beyond saw a boom in technology that led to a plethora of new AI applications, from virtual agents able to communicate with customers over the phone or online chats and automated stock trading to products such as Apple’s Siri, which understands users requests in natural language using voice commands.
 
Today, artificial intelligence is being used more and more in many areas—from healthcare, where it makes diagnoses based on thousands of images and medical records, to finance, where banks use predictive analytics and even help traders/investors make better decisions faster than ever before.





 
However, what does philosophy have to the development of artificial intelligence?
 
René Descartes’ Philosophical Justifications for the Existence of Artificial Intelligence
René Descartes, created by the author using an Artificial Intelligence (Midjourney)
 
René Descartes, one of the most influential philosophers in the modern era, has been credited with groundbreaking contributions to philosophical thought, including his views on artificial intelligence. In his famous work, Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes laid down a foundation for the possibility of having machines that act as if they had minds and consciousness like humans.





 
Descartes began by positing that human beings are composed of two distinct substances—the physical body and the immaterial mind (or soul). He argued that while physical bodies can be examined objectively, thoughts and mental states can only be known through introspection. This idea is often summarized as “cogito ergo sum” or “I think therefore I am.”
 
He further argued that since thinking is essential to an individual’s existence, it must necessarily be possible for a being to think without possessing a physical body. This led him to believe in the possibility of creating a thinking machine that could operate much like a human being.
 
For Descartes, the key factor in determining whether something was capable of thinking was language processing. He believed that if we could create a machine capable of understanding and using language fluently, then it would demonstrate evidence of true intelligence.





 
In other words, he saw language processing as an essential marker for consciousness, reasoning that there must be some kind of inner capacity within such a machine that holds concepts and thoughts through languages like us humans. Descartes’ contributions and justifications set up an important conceptual foundation for artificial intelligence.
 
Can Machines Think?

“Can machines think?”—this important question was raised in 1950 by the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing. He emphasizes that the traditional approach to this issue is first to define the concepts of “machine” and “intelligence.”





 
Turing, however, took a different path; instead, he replaced the original question (which he found to be nearly impossible to answer) with another “which is closely related to the original and is relatively unambiguous.” Essentially, he proposed to replace the question “Can machines think?” with the simpler question “Can machines do what we (as thinking creatures) can do?”
 
A computer can be considered intelligent if it can make us believe that we are not dealing with a machine but with a person. The advantage of the new question, according to Turing, is that it draws a clear line between the physical and intellectual capabilities of a person, for which Turing offers an empirical test.

The essence of an actual, practical Turing test is as follows. A judge, a man, and a machine are all put in different rooms. The judge is in correspondence with both the man and the machine, not knowing in advance which of the interlocutors is a man and which is a machine. The response time to a question is fixed so that the judge cannot determine the machine by this feature (in Turing’s time, machines were slower than humans, but now they react faster and this limit is not important anymore).





 
If the judge cannot determine which of his interlocutors is a machine, then the machine has passed the Turing test and can be considered thinking. Moreover, the machine will not just be a semblance of the human mind—it will simply count as a mind. We will have no way of distinguishing its behavior from human behavior. This interpretation of artificial intelligence as a full-fledged equivalent of natural human intelligence has been called “strong AI.”
 
Let’s pay attention to the fact that the Turing test does not mean at all that the machine should “understand” the essence of the words and expressions with which it operates. The machine only needs to successfully imitate meaningful responses to be considered truly intelligent.





 
A Criticism of the Turing Test: Searle’s Chinese Room Experiment

In 1980, John Rogers Searle, an American philosopher, proposed a thought experiment that criticized the Turing test and the notion that an intelligent mind can exist without understanding.





 
The essence of the Chinese room experiment is as follows. A scientist places a men in a room in which baskets full of Chinese characters are placed.
 
The man is given a textbook, in English, which provides rules for combining Chinese characters. The man can easily apply these rules, even though he does not speak Chinese; he can rely on the shape of the symbols described in the textbook without understanding the meaning of the symbols.
 
Searle imagines that people outside the room who understand Chinese are transmitting character sets into the room and that, in response, the man inside opens the textbook, manipulates the characters according to the rules, and feeds back a set of characters through the door.
 
Thus, the man in the room passes a kind of Turing test for knowledge of the Chinese language, which he actually does not know. Searle shows that the Turing test is not a criterion for the presence of consciousness at all, but only a criterion for the ability to successfully manipulating symbols.
 
The essence of Searle’s position on the issue of artificial intelligence is as follows: the mind operates with semantic content (semantics) or meaning, while a computer program is completely determined by its syntactic structure (the form of the symbols it operates with). Therefore, passing the Turing test does not imply the presence of a mind.
 
What is the Modern Take on the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence?





Philosophy of artificial intelligence, created by the author using an Artificial Intelligence (Midjourney)
 
The modern philosophical perception of artificial intelligence has evolved significantly since Descartes and Turing. Today, many philosophers recognize that machines can simulate aspects of human cognition and decision-making, but they are less convinced that machines are truly conscious or possess a mind in the same sense as humans.





 
One important aspect of contemporary philosophy concerned with AI is its reliance on cognitive science. Cognitive scientists view the mind as a computational system and have therefore sought to understand how algorithms and programs could mimic the functioning of a human mind.
 
However, they tend to be cautious about the extent to which artificial systems can really “understand” meaning or truly “reason” about information in the way humans do.
 
There is also an area within philosophy called philosophy of mind that deals with questions about consciousness and whether it arises from computational processes. Some philosophers argue that consciousness emerges from complex computations, whereas others claim consciousness cannot be mechanized at all.
 
Another approach towards AI in philosophy comes from ethics. Philosophers are keen to explore what ethical issues arise when developing AI technologies, such as where responsibility for machine actions is located (who bears the blame for errors) or the responsibility for a machine’s behavior as compared with human behavior.
 
While skepticism remains to some extent around true intelligence being possible through computational mechanics alone, most philosophers do acknowledge that AI systems can achieve remarkable feats, particularly when experts build them with complex decision-making components resembling human reasoning processes.

Generative AI: Catalyst for job growth or automation threat?

        Tech Mahindra’s CEO CP Gurnani sees generative AI creating more jobs, challenging fears of workforce disruptions, and advocating adaptability.

While anxieties surrounding generative AI’s potential to disrupt the workforce, Tech Mahindra’s outgoing CEO, CP Gurnani, contended that generative AI has the capacity to generate more employment opportunities than it is anticipated to eliminate. Despite widespread concerns on social media regarding AI’s impact on the job market, Gurnani emphasised that the full spectrum of generative AI use cases is still evolving, suggesting a wealth of untapped potential for job creation.
“The use cases of generative AI are still being defined, which means that it has the potential to create more job opportunities in the future,” Gurnani said. He highlighted the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, citing their ability to generate human-quality writing, poetry, and even complex code.
Unlike some industry leaders who predict significant job losses due to automation, Gurnani, one of the longest-serving CEOs in the US$245 billion Indian IT sector, believed skilled professionals will remain irreplaceable. “New jobs will also get created. The market will expand,” he added.
This optimistic outlook aligns with other prominent voices like NR Narayana Murthy, Co-Founder of Infosys, who dismissed fears of coders being replaced by generative AI tools. The evidence so far also supports Gurnani’s stance. A recent study by the European Central Bank and International Labour Organization found no significant job losses directly attributable to generative AI automation, reported The Business Times.

Recognising the need for workforce adaptation, Gurnani urged young engineers to embrace lifelong learning and independent skill development. He suggested a departure from the conventional approach of organisations like Infosys, known for its expansive training centre in Mysuru, Karnataka. This shift may signify a broader transformation in the operational model of Indian IT organisations, moving away from campus recruitment and centralised training towards a more agile and skill-oriented approach.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






In the new 2024 Player’s Handbook, all of the core character classes in Dungeons & Dragons will get full-color illustrations like this one, which depicts a fighter. (Nestor Ossandón for Wizards of the Coast)
In response to social media criticism, Wizards of the Coast has released a statement that further clarifies its stance on the use of generative AI in material for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game.
The statement, made via a post on the digital storefront D&D Beyond, indicates that all creative contributors to D&D will be required “to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&D products.”
This comes four months after an incident in August where an artist admitted he’d used AI tools to “polish” several illustrations that he’d contributed to a new D&D sourcebook. In response, Wizards pledged to amend its artistic guidelines to prohibit creators from using generative AI.
Today’s updated statement appears to come as a response to an online discussion. On Dec. 1, a piece of artwork appeared on the official Dungeons & Dragons X (formerly Twitter) account to tease the upcoming 2024 rules update for D&D, which will include brand-new editions of the game’s 3 core rulebooks.



The artwork in question, by Chilean illustrator Nestor Ossandón, depicts a dwarf warrior. It’s one of many new illustrations that are planned to run in the updated D&D Player’s Handbook, and made its public debut earlier this month at a panel at the Penny Arcade Expo Unplugged in Philadelphia.
In response to the teaser, many fans wondered if it had been created using AI tools, citing issues such as the seeming absence of the dwarf’s left arm. Wizards first responded on Dec. 18 via the official D&D Beyond X account, saying that it had checked with the original artist to ensure that no generative AI had been used.



Wizards further clarified its stance on Tuesday by announcing its blanket prohibition.
“We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world,” according to the blog post, “and we believe those people are what makes D&D great.”
The response comes a week after reports that multiple workers at Renton, Wash.-based Wizards of the Coast had been impacted by a round of layoffs instituted by parent company Hasbro, including several senior employees who worked on both Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering.

4 Ways Finance and Accounting Pros Can Adapt Now to Working With Generative AI
AI-powered tools for finance and accounting organizations have been around for years, helping to automate data entry and bookkeeping, invoice processing, budgeting, and many other processes. But generative AI is different.

Accounting and finance professionals are always on the lookout for tools that can help them become more efficient, productive and accurate in their work. And for well over a third (38%) of workers in the profession recently surveyed by Robert Half, generative AI is one technology that they expect will make a positive impact on their careers. That includes creating more demand for their skills.
Of course, to stay in demand, finance and accounting pros will need to ensure that they maintain relevant skills, especially when it comes to working with generative AI. AI-powered tools for finance and accounting organizations have been around for years, helping to automate data entry and bookkeeping, invoice processing, budgeting, and many other processes. But generative AI is different. It is more than just a helper — it has the potential to fundamentally transform finance and accounting roles.
Mark D. McDonald, a senior director at Gartner, said as much in a recent Wall Street Journal article that examined CFOs’ “ambitious plans” for generative AI — and their hopes that the technology can help them to overcome the skilled talent shortage. McDonald predicted, “Ten years from now, finance and accounting professionals will have a totally different set of skills than the experienced professional of today and will largely look more like data scientists and systems engineers.”

There is no time to waste in growing your understanding of AI
You may not have anticipated a need for data science and systems engineering skills when you decided to become an accountant — and depending on your role, it may turn out you don’t need them. However, your work is likely to become more challenging regardless, and in a good way. Another key message in that Wall Street Journal article is that generative AI can give accounting and finance professionals more time to engage in work that they find fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.
Robert Half’s research indicates that many workers in the field are already experiencing this change because of AI. Nearly one-third (30%) of accounting and finance pros we surveyed said that one of the greatest benefits of using generative AI on the job is that it allows them to focus more on strategic thinking and problem-solving. (Increased efficiency and productivity was the top benefit cited.)
That’s certainly a positive development, and a shift in the nature of work that many accounting and finance professionals have been hoping for. If you are eager to seize that opportunity yourself, know that it will require two things: preparation and a willingness to adapt.
In other words, don’t wait for the day when you’re told you need to learn to work with generative AI. It is to your benefit to begin building a productive relationship with this powerful technology today. Here are four ways to do it:
1. Start with the fundamentals
You didn’t become an accountant or CPA overnight. Learning to work effectively with AI will require time and effort, too, and it starts with building up your fundamental knowledge about the technology. You don’t need to become an AI expert, but it is worth your while to grow your understanding of basic AI concepts and related technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.
Consider enrolling in online courses and training programs that specifically focus on the role of AI in finance and accounting. Workshops and webinars conducted by industry experts and companies that specialize in AI can also be highly valuable. Also, engage with professional organizations and networks where finance and accounting professionals discuss AI integration and best practices.
2.  Identify practical use cases for AI
As you increase your understanding of generative AI and gain practical insights into working with it, it will become clearer how to use the technology to enhance your role and responsibilities. You can then start to identify specific use cases where AI can bring value not only to your own work, but potentially, your whole team. Data analysis, forecasting and compiling reports are just some examples you may find.
While you may not be able to fully control the extent to which your organization adopts AI capabilities, your efforts to find practical applications for the technology can help to inform decision-making around what types of tools to implement that can benefit everyone. Your interest and enthusiasm can also help to foster a team environment that encourages collaboration and collective learning around AI.
3. Step up your soft skills
Evolving your technical abilities is a must if you want to make the most of generative AI tools for finance and accounting, but growing your soft skills is also vital. You will need to expand and refine skills like communication, problem-solving, strategic thinking and even empathy so that you can step into the other, nontechnical types of work that AI will eventually free you to focus on.
So, be sure to take advantage of professional and leadership development programs that your firm may offer. If needed, consider investing in relevant learning opportunities outside of the organization as well. Increasing the depth and range of your abilities can help position you for new career opportunities, as well, considering that 95% of hiring managers in finance and accounting face challenges in locating skilled candidates, according to Robert Half’s research.
4. Commit to continuous learning
You may want to ramp up your AI skills fast, and it’s certainly possible. But know that AI-related learning will be an ongoing process. The technology is rapidly evolving, and you will need to make a concerted effort to stay abreast of the latest developments, especially as they relate to finance and accounting.
Subscribing to newsletters, following industry blogs and participating in forums are some simple, everyday approaches to staying informed about AI tools and trends. Also seek to forge relationships with people in your organization or professional network who have deep knowledge of AI and extensive hands-on experience working with technology. Getting to know the data scientists and systems engineers in your orbit isn’t a bad idea either, seeing as your work in the future might echo theirs.
No matter how you might feel about generative AI’s recent and rapid rise in the workplace, it is a wave of change that all accountants must embrace at some level. Consider recent research conducted by Thomson Reuters Institute that found one in 10 professionals in accounting firms and corporate tax departments are already using some form of generative AI on a widescale basis. And 51% reported that they expect their firms to start using the technology within the next six to 12 months.
So, generative AI is likely at the doorstep of your CPA firm, if it isn’t already working with you at your desk. In either case, now is the time to adapt and expand your skills and knowledge so that you will be prepared to thrive in a profession that AI is poised to change significantly — and soon.

								AI talent wanted: The federal government is searching far and wide to fill new cutting-edge positions							

								With a shortage of domestic talent, the Biden administration is searching “everywhere” to boost the AI workforce, offering training opportunities and creating employment pathways as it checks off hiring boxes from the White House’s executive order.

As the White House moves forward with the implementation of its executive order on artificial intelligence, a shortage of domestic workers skilled in AI is creating opportunities for experts around the world to seek sponsored employment with the U.S. government.
The long-awaited order arrived with a laundry list of requirements for agencies, which are now tasked with growing the federal talent pool with workers who have experience in AI research, development, procurement and deployment. 
To fill that pool, the Biden administration is “putting a lot of emphasis on bringing in talent from everywhere,” White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Arati Prabhakar said in an interview with FedScoop, underlining the importance foreign nationals will play in getting the federal government up to speed on AI.
The executive order’s callouts to boost the AI workforce within federal agencies “is just the next chapter of a long American story of people, American kids going into science and technology and making huge contributions,” Prabhakar said. “Also coupled with being able to attract some amazing talent from around the world and who come here for these tremendous opportunities in our country. [White House officials] very much want to make sure both of those continue to happen.”

At AI.gov, the Biden administration has highlighted both immigrant and nonimmigrant pathways for foreign nationals to bring their knowledge of AI to the federal government. 
And in cases where agencies face challenges in the form of lengthy hiring processes or other roadblocks for meeting workforce requirements laid out in the order, OSTP is providing “levers” to help, Prabhakar said. That includes AI-specific cohorts, created by the Presidential Innovation Fellows and the U.S. Digital Corps, bringing talent from the private sector to the public sector.
Lynne Parker, a former deputy U.S. chief technology officer who assisted with the Trump White House’s 2020 executive order that called on agencies to annually create AI use case inventories, said in an interview with FedScoop that there is a “shortage” of AI talent. There’s also the challenge, Parker added, of the government competing for AI talent with industry,  where individuals are able to solve “interesting problems” for higher pay. 
“If you’re going to be training the talent in our universities here, then obviously it makes a lot of sense for us to try to recruit them to stay here to benefit the United States,” Parker said. “Since there’s such a huge shortfall of talent, I think there’s that emphasis on immigration, [which] is a recognition of the fact that … a high percentage of people who are getting that expert-level training [in AI] are coming from overseas. That’s where I think the most immediate pipeline of available talent is.”
Parker said it’s possible that “many Ph.D. graduates would like to go into academia, but they may feel like it’s too difficult to get the research funding that they need in order to be successful.” But if funding were available to train more students, and funding was easier to attain, then individuals may be more inclined to go into academia to train the next generation, she said.

Prabhakar, meanwhile, noted the various open roles for AI across the government makes clear the “need to learn how to use this powerful technology in really creative ways that are deeply responsible as a great way for government to lead by example in the use of AI.” 
“We were thrilled with the response to the AI talent surge when the executive order came out,” she added. “Just an enormous volume of wonderful resumes that came in —  people who have built all the data systems and the computational capacity that you have to have [in order] to use AI intelligently.”
OSTP is trying to leverage effective tech talent programs deployed over the past decade to bring more tech-centric skills into government, Prabhakar said, with the aim of providing those interested in working on AI with more opportunities in federal agencies. 
The feedback from agencies on the EO’s actions, including workforce requirements, has so far been positive, according to Olivia Zhu, a senior policy adviser with OSTP. In an interview with FedScoop, Zhu said the White House is “super optimistic that we’ve gotten a really large influx of interest from the public.”
“When we were creating this executive order, the president directed the team to pull every lever,” Zhu said. “The feedback is reflecting our intentions of understanding that AI has such broad applications in various areas, right from the workforce to the use in government, to ensuring that we have safety standards.”

Is Africa ready for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in today’s world?

December 18, 2023 0 




FacebookTwitterWhatsAppEmailPrint







Advances in technology have modified the way people work. AI is everywhere, and machine thinking is now in our homes, offices, schools and hospitals. Computer algorithms are driving cars, diagnosing patients at hospitals and telling us what to read on our smartphones. The question to confront is: Is Africa ready for artificial intelligence in today’s world?
Yes. More than five decades ago, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah stirringly called Africa to the promise of technology. Indeed, the clarion call echoed by Ghana’s most loved first president and outstanding African leader, Osagyefo Dr. Nkrumah, to African leaders and the African Union (AU) on the need to embrace science and technology as the lifeblood of our continent is as important today as it was a little over fifty (50) years ago.



Indeed, to a large extent Africa missed the first, second and third industrial revolutions, but I am confident that our continent will not miss the fourth and fifth.
With the rise of artificial intelligence, the future appears promising. However, several analysts have also raised concerns about the potential for job displacement.
Experts predict that AI could replace certain jobs or make them obsolete, leading to job losses and a need for employees to adapt and learn new skills. Therefore, we must strategically invest in the capacity of our human resources to rise to the occasion.
Although Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour, it cannot fully replace human intelligence. Artificial intelligence lacks some human qualities such as empathy, creativity and critical thinking. Human beings by nature possess unique cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence that are essential in many domains, including complex decision-making, social interactions and ethical considerations. Therefore, AI and human intelligence can work together synergistically to achieve a better outcome.
Artificial intelligence and big data technologies have penetrated many markets. Here are just a few examples:
In the education sector, for example, AI-based learning platforms like ChatGBT have gained popularity due to their ability to engage students conversationally. Students now have access to personalised learning; they can ask questions in a local vernacular, and the English tutor will support them. AI can automate grading, giving educators more time for other tasks.
In Agriculture
There is an AI mobile app that can recommend what type of fertiliser to use in crop farming, which is a game-changer for farmers – but many of them will still have to grapple with issues of connectivity and literacy.
Banking and finance
The AI chatbots used by some banks help with basic transactions or provide appropriate solutions to various consumer inquiries, such as account balance information. Bank customers can get 24/7 service from a Chabot or an AI-powered banker, and can expect to receive swift financial counsel based on their money history, risk tolerance and financial goals.
AI in transportation
AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.
The Current State of AI in Africa
Africa has made significant strides in adopting AI technologies over recent years. Several countries, including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, have established AI research centres and innovation hubs. These initiatives aim to foster collaboration, research and development in AI, with a focus on addressing local challenges and driving economic growth.
Furthermore, African governments have recognised the importance of AI and started implementing policies for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, and strategies to support its integration. For instance, the African Union launched the ‘AI for Development Initiative’ to promote AI-driven solutions for sustainable development across the continent.
Challenges and Opportunities
While progress has been made on the continent, Africa still faces several challenges in fully harnessing the potential of AI. One significant obstacle is access to reliable Internet connectivity and affordable technology, which is limited in many parts of the continent.
Finally, despite these challenges, the continent is making significant progress in preparing for an AI-driven future.

[+] and alarmist. What kind of impact can the job market really expect from AI?getty
After a year defined by a fresh buzz around artificial intelligence, the question on my mind heading into 2024 is where we’ll start to see the long-term impact of AI. One obvious candidate is the job market.


Here’s how I think the evolving impact of AI will create trends, challenges, and opportunities in the professional world.

AI’s Influence on Recruitment
AI has already been a mainstay with recruiters for years. They use intelligent technology to identify ideal candidates and weed through mountains of applications. In 2024, candidates are turning the tide when it comes to AI in recruitment.

PROMOTED
This is largely because many tools are becoming more accessible to the average job seeker. Teal, for example, offers those searching for employment a suite of AI-powered tools, including a resume builder, cover letter generator, LinkedIn profile analysis, and job application tracker.

As the job market evolves, both employers and the employed will implement a growing number of AI solutions to give themselves a cutting-edge advantage. It is a trend that is set to grow in the coming months.

AI Will Alter Existing Roles
AI is often seen as a job killer, but it is more accurate to refer to it as a job redefiner. In most cases, AI doesn’t remove the need for important work. On the contrary, even as it develops greater capabilities, it still addresses the simple stuff compared to its human counterparts.

According to a recent LinkedIn article, “Repetitive tasks, by their very nature, consume a significant chunk of time and resources. They often require human intervention, prone to errors, fatigue, and inconsistency. Enter AI: a technology capable of performing these tasks tirelessly, consistently, and without the typical human-induced variations.”

This creates new opportunities for employees to focus on meaningful, high-value activities. The result is jobs with more specific, nuanced requirements. At the same time, these positions won’t be bogged down with simple, time-consuming minutiae.
AI Will Naturally Create New Opportunities
The existence and rapid adoption of AI will naturally create a demand for jobs in that field. As companies seek ways to capitalize on the efficiencies and profitability of AI systems, they will need humans to lead the charge.
This pioneering phase will require software engineers, data scientists, and other specialized personnel. It will open up new skills that employees can learn to give themselves a competitive edge.
AI Will Have Negative Repercussions on Jobs, Too
Of course, it’s not all good news for those working alongside AI. One recent survey from ResumeBuilder reported that 44% of companies expect layoffs to occur in 2024 due to new AI capabilities.
With that said, it’s worth pointing out that this appears to be largely connected to the culling of simpler activities within daily business pursuits. Of the respondents, 83% clarified that, as far as existing employees are concerned, AI skills will be a factor in helping them retain their jobs.
For those willing to embrace AI, the future is bright. For those working jobs AI can quickly replace, they must begin developing new skills.
The Shift to AI Isn’t Going to Be Instant
It’s tempting to look ahead and ring the alarm on AI. There’s no doubt that change is coming, and some hard-working employees will lose their jobs before long.
However, the thought that we’re looking at an apocalyptic future in the coming months is alarmist. Pew Research reports that the transition to AI will likely take half a century or more.
In addition, as much of the above data shows, most of the change will be either a horizontal shift or an improvement. Will some jobs be automated? Yes. Will others evolve with the times? Absolutely. Still others will grow out of the need for AI, as well. The one surety heading in 2024 is that AI will be a major factor in the workforce, and human workers and employers must be ready to adapt on a daily basis.

What’s more, the pace of change is startling, with more than 90% of surveyed employers predicting that they will use AI-related solutions in their organizations by 2028.To better understand where workplaces might be headed, Access Partnership and Amazon Web Services (AWS) collaborated on a new survey of 3,297 employees and 1,340 organizations in the U.S., across industries.Here are five takeaways from the report.1. Most organizations will use AI and expect to benefit from itAlmost all organizations in the U.S. will be AI-enabled. According to the report, 92% of the organizations surveyed plan to use AI-powered solutions by 2028.While most employers (92%) believe their IT departments will be the biggest beneficiary of AI, they also believe other departments, from sales and marketing (85%) to human resources (78%), will derive significant value from it as well.Most see AI offering significant benefits for their organizations by automating employees’ tasks (64%), highlighting this as a key benefit; improving workflows and outcomes (58%); enhancing communications (54%); and helping their employees learn new skills (50%).2. Generative AI tools will become commonplace at workGenerative AI—a type of AI that can create new content and ideas quickly, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and more—has captured mainstream attention in the past year.Considering this momentum, it is not surprising that more than 93% of employers and 86% of employees expect to use generative AI within the next five years to increase innovation and creativity, automate repetitive tasks, and boost learning.3. Acquiring AI skills could boost paychecks and accelerate career growthAmazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitmentAmazon’s AI Ready initiative comes as new AWS study finds strong demand for AI talent and the potential for workers with AI skills to earn up to 47% more in salaries.Read moreWith substantial potential to improve operational efficiency, worker productivity, and decision-making, surveyed employers are willing to pay higher wages to employees with AI skills and expertise. Notably, while employers are willing to pay an average of 47% more for IT workers with AI skills, the study found that pay benefits will extend across departments. Employers said that they would be willing to pay workers with AI skills a premium in sales and marketing (43% higher salary); finance (42%); business operations (41%); legal, regulatory, and compliance (37%); and human resources (35%).Overall, nearly 80% of workers surveyed mentioned that they would be interested in developing AI skills to advance their careers. The study also found that this interest in AI transcends generations. For example, about two-thirds of workers over the age of 55, a demographic usually thinking about retirement, say they would enroll in AI upskilling courses if employers offered them.4. AI’s productivity payoff could be profoundAmong workers, 88% expect to use AI in their daily work by 2028. By hastening ideas and creativity, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling better decisions, surveyed employers believe AI could boost overall productivity by as much as 49%.These findings are remarkable when one considers average nonfarm labor productivity growth in the United States has averaged 1.3% per year since 2019.5. Employers report an AI skills gapUnderstanding the potential benefits of AI, 73% of surveyed employers consider hiring talent with AI skills and experience a priority. But, nearly three in four (75%) of them say that they can’t find the talent they need.7 free and low-cost AWS courses that can help you use generative AIAWS skills trainings on generative AI offerings are available to everyone, with all levels of experience.Learn moreThe survey also reveals employers are not solely focused on workers with technical skills such as coding. In fact, critical and creative thinking are even more in demand by employers.In short, the survey confirms that employers face a growing AI skills gap that can only be addressed through training and education programs. Unfortunately, the report also shows that 82% of employers and employees aren’t sure which specific skills they should pursue, and nearly 80% don’t know what outside training might exist for them.Looking ahead, it’s clear that employers and employees are expecting AI tools to deliver tremendous benefits in the workplace on a daily basis.

 20-year-old Sandra Ubege is in her final year of studying Media Studies at the University of Huddersfield. Like most soon-to-be graduates, she’s worried about securing her first job after university. But for Sandra’s cohort and the cohorts which come after, these anxieties about securing work are becoming exacerbated by the growing power of AI.
Sandra is a creative, and is particularly keen to get into screenwriting and film directing. “This year we’ve seen how easy it is for studios to implement AI in production and push out humans that put in the effort,” she says. “My understanding is that AI steals from human artists, and that’s how it learns, and as such studios will take advantage of the fact they don’t have to pay AI like they pay human artists.” She refers to the Hollywood strikers who walked out over issues regarding AI as a potent example of just how much of an impact new technology is having on the creative industries. “I’m too disconcerted by the growth of this technology to even look at the positives.”

 “One of my modules is about short film, and another is about journalistic writing; in both of these we’ve had a few lectures where we talk about AI and what it’s doing to the industry. Professors are basically saying that this is going to be a part of the arts industry now, and we have to embrace it. I really hated that,” Sandra continues. “I’m extremely worried about AI’s impact on my career prospects, because it can only get worse from here [...]  I’m trying to be optimistic but I just can’t.”
Sandra isn’t alone: a new study from Kingston University has found that half of current students at university think their job prospects could be under threat from AI. This chimes with BMG resarch for the i, which found that some 52 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds are worried about the impact of the technology on their future employment prospects, compared to 39 per cent of the general population. The situation across the pond is identical, where half of US college and university graduates also feel threatened by the growth of AI.
Since the launch of OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT in November last year, conversations surrounding artificial intelligence’s capabilities have grown increasingly urgent. Many have expressed concern over the possibility of AI supplanting workers from their jobs, leaving swathes of the population unemployed. And it’s unsurprising that students are particularly concerned about the impact AI could have on the graduate job market: competition for graduate jobs hit a record high in the UK in 2021 post-COVID, with companies receiving an average of 91 applications per graduate vacancy. While the graduate job market has since improved, the situation is still bleak: data from Reed, one of the UK’s largest employment platforms, shows the number of available graduate jobs is still about 40 per cent below 2018 levels, with wages remaining stagnant in the face of the rising cost of living. Graduates from 2020 onwards currently face an unemployment rate of 12 per cent, which equates to over 96,000 unemployed graduates each academic year.
 
“I would be so much less worried if the government did more for university students and graduates, especially those in the arts” – Sandra Ubege

 It’s been estimated that 10 to 30 per cent of jobs are automatable, and with all this in mind, it tracks that students are conscious of anything which may hinder their already dwindling prospects. Sandra’s degree is in Media Studies, but students studying other courses have cause for concern too. AI has many capabilities, including writing, creating art, coding, and translating – potentially threatening jobs which use these skills, such as copywriting, graphic design, software development, and translation to name a few. 
David Spencer is an economics professor at the University of Leeds and author of Making Light Work: An End to Toil in the 21st Century, and he explains that it is not surprising that so many students and graduates are concerned, given how frequently the media is reporting on mass job losses due to AI. But he stresses that all hope is not lost. “Whether there will be fewer jobs in the future remains a moot point. New jobs have been created in the past and there is no reason why they won’t be created in the future,” he says. “AI, like other technologies, may change the skills required by employers but graduates will likely retain advantages in the labour market.” He adds that this not only applies to STEM graduates, but arts graduates too, “who will have the creative skills to undertake tasks that AI won’t be able to replace”.
“I think the problem of graduates not getting graduate jobs reflects an economy that cannot produce enough graduate jobs,” he continues. “The UK economy is too focused around the promotion of low paid and low productivity work, which means it cannot absorb more graduates.” He adds that students would be less concerned about AI “if investment levels in the economy could be improved and the demand for graduate employment raised,” while a better welfare ‘safety net’ would “benefit all workers but more so non-graduates who face fewer prospects for moving on to better-paid work or worse, underemployment or unemployment”.
 
“I think the problem of graduates not getting graduate jobs reflects an economy that cannot produce enough graduate jobs” – David Spencer

 This chimes with Sandra. “Even after university, a lot of jobs ask for years of experience, and if we’re really busy studying we often don’t have time for that or there aren’t appropriate internship or placement opportunities there in the first place,” she says. “I would be so much less worried if the government did more for university students and graduates, especially those in the arts.”
Ultimately, it isn’t unequivocally a ‘bad’ thing if AI ends up doing jobs previously done by humans. AI could actually make life better for us, by making work more efficient and productive and granting us more leisure time. What is worrying, though, is the government’s lack of preparation for the advent of AI. While Rishi Sunak has postured as a technocrat and even hosted the world’s first AI safety summit at Bletchley Park this autumn, his government and the past decade of Tory rule has done very little to actually brace UK society for the ways AI will revolutionise the workforce – conversely, they’ve made us as ill-prepared as possible by slashing the welfare system and doing little to provide enough highly-skilled jobs for graduates and other workers.
Still, the potential for a better future is there. “AI should be used to generate productivity gains that can be used to lighten work,” Spencer surmises. But, he adds, the future of work depends on ensuring that AI is governed democratically. “A better future of work and life for all will depend on ensuring that AI is operated in the interests of people, not profits.”

Over the last year, generative AI—a form of artificial intelligence that can compose original text, images, computer code, and other content—has gone from experimental curiosity to a tech revolution that could be one of the biggest business disruptors of our generation. Along the way, business leaders in every industry have been scrambling to develop their generative AI strategies, address potential risks, and figure out the best next action while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.
The challenge now, of course, is separating the hype from reality to move forward on a path that makes sense for real businesses.  Fortunately, while the spotlight on generative AI may be new, the underlying technology has been around for quite some time, and many pioneering companies have already begun paving the way for successful commercial-grade implementations. In fact, our team has been working with generative and conversational AI in complex professional services applications like insurance, banking, and healthcare for the better part of a decade, and we’ve learned some important lessons along the way.
Where will the biggest transformation occur first?
First, it is clear that generative AI will transform business. The rate at which the technology continues to grow, and its amazing ability to keep getting better, is nothing short of remarkable. Any job function that involves working through large amounts of information to synthesize insights will be touched by generative AI. Importantly, however, that does not mean humans will be removed from the loop. It just means the way we do our jobs will change.
Second, the leaders in the generative AI arms race will be those who are able to get their data organized and accessible quickly. While off-the-shelf generative AI technology from the likes of OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and others is incredibly powerful, the key to successful commercial generative AI initiatives is having authoritative, comprehensive reference data to train the system for a specific use case.
For example, some of the specific use cases where we are currently seeing the fastest and most impactful commercial applications of generative AI are in the following four areas:

Agent Assist in Customer Experience: These are AI-powered applications that leverage previous customer activity, payment histories, transactions, and investment records to equip live customer service agents with effective response scripts. Examples include insurance prior authorizations to check eligibility for a prescription and robo-enhanced investment guidance and advice in financial services.

2. Contract Analysis/Drafting: Generative AI solutions in finance, insurance, and legal sectors that extract key information from contracts and legal documents, address inconsistencies, identify risks, and even draft legal text.
3. Audit: In finance and accounting, businesses are deploying generative AI to analyze 100% of compliance documents, replacing the outdated sample-based compliance approach.
4. Code Generation: Across all sectors, we are seeing clients utilizing generative AI to write code, detect bugs and streamline product development.
Strong data governance and human expertise: Essential ingredients
Across all these examples, reliable data and human expertise are critical differentiators between genuine, commercial-grade solutions and mere technological novelties. In complex, highly regulated industries like insurance and financial services simply applying an off-the-shelf AI chatbot to a front-end interface is not an option. To provide real value, and mitigate risk, these applications must comprehend the entire customer data landscape, be trained on specific use case nuances, and produce accurate results that are easily verifiable.
Early leaders are already recognizing that rock-solid data governance and cloud migration capabilities are the critical prerequisites for a strong generative AI strategy. Likewise, they realize that human talent will be central to success. From programming and training large language models to integrating the technology into existing workflows to interpreting nuances in specialized subject matter, effective generative AI will continue to require human intermediation. After all, generative AI’s true potential lies in augmenting our strengths and mitigating our weaknesses, not rendering us redundant.
As more commercial-grade generative AI solutions come to market, the distinction between those that systematically improve workflows and drive better customer engagement and those who claim to automate everything effortlessly with the push of a button will become abundantly clear. While we are currently at the beginning of a massive surge in new innovation involving generative AI, it is crucial for companies integrating and building these technologies to see beyond the hype and embrace this exceptional opportunity to strengthen their products, services, and workforce.

That’s why we’re in this case.” The Authors Guild, which is building a tool that will help generative AI companies pay to license its members’ works, believes there can be perfectly ethical ways to train AI. “It’s very simple: get permission,” she said. In most cases, permission will come for a fee.Mike Masnick, CEO of the Techdirt blog and also the Copia Institute, a tech policy think tank, has a different view. “I’m going to say the opposite of everything Mary just said,” he said. Generative AI is fair use, he argued, noting the similarities of the recent legal disputes with past lawsuits, some involving the Author’s Guild, in which indexing creative works so that search engines could efficiently find them survived challenges.A win for artist groups would not necessarily be of much help to individual writers, Masnick added, calling the very concept of copyright a scheme that was intended to enrich publishers, rather than protect artists. He referenced what he called a “corrupt” system of music licensing that sends little value to its creators.AdvertisementWhile any future courtroom verdicts will likely depend on legal arguments over fair use, Matthew Butterick, a lawyer who has filed a number of lawsuits against generative AI companies, says the debate is really about tech companies that are trying to accrue more power—and hold onto it. “They’re not competing to see who can be the richest anymore; they’re competing to be the most powerful,” he said. “What they don’t want is for people with copyrights to have a veto over what they want to do.”Masnick responded that he was also concerned about who gains power from AI, arguing that requiring tech companies to pay artists would further entrench the largest AI players by making it too expensive for insurgents to train their systems.Rasenberger scoffed at the suggestion of a balance of power between tech players and the authors she represents, comparing the $20,000 per year average earnings for full-time authors to the recent $90 billion valuation of OpenAI. “They’ve got the money. The artist community does not,” she said.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena Kelly",BreadcrumbList,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/business/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'The Generative AI Copyright Fight Is Just Getting Started'}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/livewired-generative-ai-copyright/'}",The Generative AI Copyright Fight Is Just Getting Started,2023-12-07T07:00:00.000-05:00,2023-12-07T07:00:00.000-05:00,"The biggest fight of the generative AI revolution is headed to the courtroom—and no, it’s not about the latest boardroom drama at OpenAI.

Generative AI is fair use, he argued, noting the similarities of the recent legal disputes with past lawsuits, some involving the Author’s Guild, in which indexing creative works so that search engines could efficiently find them survived challenges.
A win for artist groups would not necessarily be of much help to individual writers, Masnick added, calling the very concept of copyright a scheme that was intended to enrich publishers, rather than protect artists. He referenced what he called a “corrupt” system of music licensing that sends little value to its creators.
While any future courtroom verdicts will likely depend on legal arguments over fair use, Matthew Butterick, a lawyer who has filed a number of lawsuits against generative AI companies, says the debate is really about tech companies that are trying to accrue more power—and hold onto it. “They’re not competing to see who can be the richest anymore; they’re competing to be the most powerful,” he said. “What they don’t want is for people with copyrights to have a veto over what they want to do.”
Masnick responded that he was also concerned about who gains power from AI, arguing that requiring tech companies to pay artists would further entrench the largest AI players by making it too expensive for insurgents to train their systems.
Rasenberger scoffed at the suggestion of a balance of power between tech players and the authors she represents, comparing the $20,000 per year average earnings for full-time authors to the recent $90 billion valuation of OpenAI. “They’ve got the money. The artist community does not,” she said.",business,https://www.wired.com/story/livewired-generative-ai-copyright/,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Gregory Barber', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/gregory-barber/'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}","['https://media.wired.com/photos/6570eb0ff9e8dff57a4b1111/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/AI-IP-Panel-LiveWIRED-Business-1833911753.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/6570eb0ff9e8dff57a4b1111/4:3/w_2132,h_1599,c_limit/AI-IP-Panel-LiveWIRED-Business-1833911753.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/6570eb0ff9e8dff57a4b1111/1:1/w_1260,h_1260,c_limit/AI-IP-Panel-LiveWIRED-Business-1833911753.jpg']",,,,,,,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/6570eb0ff9e8dff57a4b1111/2:3/w_1066,h_1599,c_limit/AI-IP-Panel-LiveWIRED-Business-1833911753.jpg",,True,,The Authors Guild and other artists’ groups say that it's unfair to train AI algorithms on their work without permission.

  Generative AI Can Boost Productivity Without Replacing Workers



The first large-scale study of a ChatGPT-like assistant in the workplace finds that it can benefit less experienced employees — and make customers happier.

Since generative AI went mainstream a year ago, it has inspired an equal measure of hype and fear. Boosters of tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E predict that they will transform our economy, while skeptics worry about their potential to produce inaccurate or harmful results and ultimately replace workers. But until recently, no one had tested what really happens when companies unleash generative AI at scale in real workplaces.
The first such study, released as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper earlier this year, found the best-case scenario: Providing workers with a generative AI tool similar to ChatGPT can lead to more productive workers, happier customers, and higher employee retention.
Researchers studied nearly 5,200 customer support agents at a Fortune 500 software firm who gained access to a generative AI-based assistant in a phased rollout between November 2020 and February 2021. During support chats, the generative AI tool shared real-time recommendations with operators, suggesting how to respond to customers and supplying links to internal documents about technical issues.
Compared to a group of workers operating without the tool, those who had help from the chatbot were 14% more productive, on average, based on the number of issues they resolved per hour. The AI-supported agents ended conversations faster, handled more chats per hour, and were slightly more successful in resolving problems. Notably, the effect was largest for the least skilled and least experienced workers, who saw productivity gains of up to 35%.
Big Gains With Fewer Pains
“These are huge numbers,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor (by courtesy) at Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “I’ve done lots of work on the introduction of new information technology over the years, and often companies are happy to get 1% or 2% productivity gains.”

Brynjolfsson was also surprised that productivity rose so quickly. “Often with new technologies, there’s a bit of a decline before it takes off, because it’s difficult and costly to implement changes, retrain workers, and change business processes,” he says. “In this case, we did not see a lull, and performance took off over just a few months.”
The reason for the boost, according to Brynjolfsson and coauthors Danielle Liopen in new window, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Lindsey Raymondopen in new window, a PhD student at MIT Sloan, was that the bot learned what the most successful agents were doing right by digesting millions of transcripts of service interactions. It then disseminated these lessons — often tacit knowledge that’s hard to distill into employee trainings — to the wider workforce. With help from AI, agents who’d been on the job for two months performed as well as unsupported agents with six months of experience.
“For most of the past 30 years, computers and digital technologies have helped higher-skilled workers more than less-skilled workers, which has led to a growing gap in wages and income inequality,” Brynjolfsson says. “It was fascinating to see that this technology goes the other way around — it’s a good sign.”
The intervention also led to happier customers, as measured by both customer surveys and a textual analysis of their language in conversations. “People like it when you solve their problems, and the system seems to be doing a better job of that,” Brynjolfsson says. The team didn’t find much evidence that customers were more satisfied simply because agents with the AI assistant used more positive language — the research found that agents tended to use a peppy tone even before the system was introduced.
Far from resenting an AI coach, agents with access to the tool were less likely to quit, a significant finding in an industry with chronically high turnover. “We don’t know for sure why this occurred, but I would guess that it’s more enjoyable to be in a job where the customers like you and you can solve customer problems faster,” Brynjolfsson says.
AI vs. Inequality
Overall, the researchers concluded that generative AI was a win for the company’s employees, customers, and stockholders alike. “It wasn’t squeezing one group for the benefit of the others — all three were better off,” Brynjolfsson says. In 2021, he co-founded a startup called Workhelix to help other companies apply generative AI to boost productivity.
Taking a broader view, Brynjolfsson says the study signals that generative AI will turbocharge productivity in the U.S. economy over the coming decade. He was so confident in his prediction that he placed a $400 bet on Longbets.org that non-agricultural productivity growth would average over 1.8% annually through 2029 (compared to the Congressional Budget Office estimate of less than 1.5%).
“That would mean we could raise living standards and address a lot of problems, like the budget deficit, healthcare, and the environment,” he says. “And if it’s helping less-skilled workers more, that can help reduce inequality.”
Brynjolfsson cautions that the study doesn’t illuminate how generative AI will reshape the broader labor market. Yet he argues that employers who interpret the research as an excuse to lay off higher-skilled workers are missing the point. “The lesson is that, more often than not, you’ll benefit by augmenting workers rather than trying to replace them,” he says. “A smart company is going to make sure they compensate and retain the high-skilled workers, so the system can continue to learn from them.”

Published: 08 Dec 2023


 
NEW YORK -- A year after the introduction of AI chatbot ChatGPT, many organizations have realized that a key value of generative AI systems is their ability to augment humans' work rather than replace workers.







As generative AI has grown quickly in popularity and many vendors released their own generative AI chatbots and platforms, it has seemed at times that the popular technology would replace workers such as artists, lawyers, white-collar office employees and even writers.
Similarly, there were concerns that the new technology was not secure enough to use in an enterprise environment, especially in industries working with personal and sensitive data.
However, amid the barrage of new generative AI tools, the landscape appears to be settling down for enterprises looking to benefit from the technology as a way to supplement their existing workforce.

Edward Jones
For financial advisory and wealth management firm Edward Jones, the value of generative AI has come from using the technology to help advisers support clients while removing some of the drudgery from work, said Shannon Favazza, principal and head of analytics at the firm.
""We think AI can be a great copilot to the adviser [and] augment that adviser's intelligence to make the adviser more productive,"" Favazza said during a presentation at the AI Summit New York 2023 conference on Dec. 7. ""AI brings a great opportunity for advisers to become more productive and be able to serve clients and serve investors who desperately need financial advice and otherwise wouldn't have access to it.""



We want people to say, 'Hey, this is the copilot. This is not a job replacement.'


Shannon FavazzaPrincipal and head of analytics, Edward Jones




Edward Jones took steps internally to help financial advisers and C-suite executives see the value from this application of generative AI in finance, Favazza said.
For example, using GPT 3.5 from OpenAI, Favazza and her team created generative AI-powered chatbots for Edward Jones employees to experiment with.
""The point [we made is that] the future is here, it's now, and we're able to do these things -- and everybody else is able to do these things,"" Favazza said.
The goal was to boost trust in generative AI, she said.
""There's a lot of natural distrust by what people see in the news,"" she continued. ""We want people to say, 'Hey, this is the copilot. This is not a job replacement.'""

Shannon Favazza, principal and head of analytics at Edward Jones, discusses the firm's approach to generative AI.







Moody's Analytics
Like Edward Jones, risk analytics firm Moody's Analytics -- a subsidiary of finance giant Moody's -- took an internal approach to generative AI before introducing a product to customers.
While advanced AI technologies such as quantum computing and blockchain have long been a part of Moody's Analytics' IT arsenal, generative AI has spun off many complex models. That can be challenging for a company with large data sets that is concerned about data privacy and security, said Caroline Casey, general manager for customer experience and innovation at the company, in an interview.
Before releasing its Research Assistant product on Dec. 4, Moody's created an internal copilot product -- not to be confused with Microsoft Copilot. Research Assistant is a search and analytical tool built on Azure OpenAI and uses OpenAI's GPT-4.
""We know that the purpose of this is not to replace a human,"" Casey said. ""It's to take out the kind of mundane work -- the trying to find information, the retrieval, the searching -- and actually help them to focus on where they've got the best expertise.""
Moody's began its journey in the summer after the CEO encouraged all employees of Moody's Corp. to be innovators.
Bouncing off that idea, the finance company created a cross-organizational team that included members from Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service called the generative intelligence group. This group helped build the copilot platform that enabled all parts of the organization to experiment with generative AI technology.
""It was important for us as well to make sure everyone was on the journey,"" Casey said.
The first stage of building the platform was making sure it was secure. To do this, Moody's used Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.
""The key for us and a lot of organizations is we don't want our proprietary data to essentially train someone else's language model,"" Casey said.
Therefore, although OpenAI's GPT-3.5 powered Moody's internal copilot, the organization felt confident that it was not compromising its confidential data.
Azure OpenAI is meant for enterprise use and has added security embedded within it. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is a little risky to enterprises that do not want their proprietary data to be used to train the model.
The second stage was educating all employees with mandatory training for how to use generative AI. The training consisted of discussions about generative AI ethics, governance and prompt writing.
Moody's also set up an idea board enabling everyone in the organization to submit their ideas about generative AI. To date, employees have submitted 500 ideas to the board, with 20 of those ideas now being implemented in one way or another externally, Casey said.
""That's enabled us to work in a really distributed way and get things done much faster,"" Casey said.
It also enabled different units within the parent company to remain connected by the underlying technologies such as Meta's Llama.


Avatar tutor
Finance is among a number of industries experimenting with using generative AI as a copilot.
David Grewell, dean of the College of Engineering and Engineering Technology at Northern Illinois University, came to the conference to find a partner for a generative AI product idea he's developing for students. He is looking to develop an avatar tutor, he said in an interview.
""Often, when I see students struggle with fundamentals, I want to do what we can to make sure they're successful,"" Grewell said.
The avatar would augment students' learning and walk them through the process of getting a solution to certain engineering problems, while ensuring the generative AI tool is trustworthy.
""The other thing is to make sure we keep the AI within the rails so the student can't trick it,"" Grewell said.
At the conference, Grewell looked at conversational AI systems such as Amelia and IBM Watsonx.
""I want an interface that's easy for the student,"" he said. ""I don't want them struggling learning how to use it. I want the interface to be seamless and totally intuitive.""

Ever get bogged down by confusing AI terms? In the past year, countless AI-infused products and services have become available, offering a dizzying variety of features frequently wrapped in hard-to-discern jargon.With this handy glossary, you'll now know the difference between AI and AGI, what really happens when ChatGPT ""hallucinates,"" and know what it means when you hear GPT-4 described as an LLM with a transformer model built using deep neural networks. Let's dive in.AgentAn agent, in the context of AI, is a model or software program that can autonomously perform some kind of task. Examples of agents range from smart home devices that control temperature and lighting, to sensors in robot vacuums and driverless cars, to chatbots like ChatGPT that learn and respond to user prompts. Autonomous agents that carry out complex tasks are often cited as examples of what the next leap forward in AI might look like.AGI (Artificial general intelligence) AGI is a type of program or model that has the full intellectual capabilities of a human, i.e. general intelligence. AGI has abilities like reasoning, common sense, abstract knowledge, and creativity. Essentially it is able to autonomously perform tasks without human instruction. True AGI doesn't exist yet, but experts believe it could be achieved in the near future (although opinions vary on exactly when). Companies like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic are committed to trying to create AGI. See also: Strong AIAlgorithm An algorithm is a set of rules or instructions for a computer program to follow. In the context of AI, algorithms are the basis for building its intelligence. Think of an action within the human brain being broken down into a series of steps. Algorithms mimic that process by building a series of if-then statements.AlignmentAlignment refers to how successfully AI is able to achieve goals not explicitly included in a prompt or request. These can include accuracy, security, and harm prevention. If an AI is misaligned, it's veering off its intended uses and applications, i.e. it gives wrong or inappropriate responses. Alignment is a big part of the ethics conversation, because a model that doesn't have proper alignment has the potential to spread misinformation, create cybersecurity threats, and share dangerous or harmful information.

AI (Artificial intelligence)AI is the blanket term for technology that can automate or execute certain tasks designed by humans. Lately, when people talk about AI (""AI is going to destroy humanity"" or ""AI is going to replace our jobs"") they're talking about AGI and generative AI. But AI is a huge concept that encompasses many technologies we've been using for years, such as algorithms that recommend content or products, self-driving cars, or voice assistants. Black boxCertain AI models are sometimes referred to as black boxes, which means users are unable to see or understand the inner workings of the technology. The black box problem has become especially relevant in the generative AI conversation, since companies like OpenAI and Google are notoriously secretive about how they work. But also, because generative AI is somewhat autonomous, even the developers don't fully understand how the algorithm generates outputs. As ethicists and policymakers call for more accountability and transparency of AI companies, it has raised the importance of cracking open the black boxes. ChatbotA chatbot is a type of program or model that can have a conversation with a human, like ChatGPT, but the term can also refer to customer service chatbots that provide alternatives to talking to a customer service rep on the phone or over text. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, and Character.AI have all received attention for their ability to hold sophisticated human-like conversations with users, but chatbots have been around for a while. ELIZA is considered the first chatbot, developed in 1966 by MIT scientist Joseph Weizenbaum.Deep learningDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that mimics the way humans learn. Powered by neural networks, deep learning uses multiple layers of algorithms to understand complex and abstract concepts, like conversations and images. Applications of deep learning include facial recognition technology, chatbots like ChatGPT, and driverless cars.

Diffusion modelA diffusion model is a machine learning model that can generate a response similar to the one it's trained on. In technical terms, it is a Markov chain trained using variational inference. Markov chain and variational inference are mathematical terms used to predict sequences and approximate information within large amounts of data. But what you need to understand is that diffusion models are what make AI image generation possible. Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E, and Midjourney are all examples of products that use diffusion models.Generative AIThanks to OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has entered the mainstream. Generative AI is a type of AI that can create text, images, video, audio, and code based on prompts from a user. Generative AI is what powers AI chatbots like ChatGPT. It works by initially learning patterns from data (see Training below), and continues to learn as it builds on new data from prompts. Generative AI typically exists in the form of a chat interface, like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard, so it can have a back-and-forth conversation with the user. The launch of ChatGPT created such a frenzy because it was an easy and accessible way for people to understand and harness the capabilities of generative AI. For all of its benefits, generative AI's widespread use has dangers since it tends to hallucinate, or confidently make things up. Unlike simpler forms of AI, generative AI is able to create entirely new content from training data, as opposed to a sensor with finite objectives or a voice assistant that parrots pre-existing information.Ethicists and policymakers have called for the regulation of generative AI because of its potential to spread misinformation, entrench biases, or enable cybercrime. Generative AI models also use datasets scraped from the web, which has raised concerns about privacy and copyright violations. Its ability to quickly generate content and automate tasks has also raised concerns about replacing jobs, particularly in the media and entertainment industries. GPU (Graphics processing unit)A GPU is a powerful chip or graphics card that is able to process multiple complicated computations. GPUs were initially developed to process images and graphics, as the name suggests, but they've been adapted for AI for their ability to handle the massive amount of computing power required by machine learning. It's estimated that ChatGPT uses 20,000 GPUs and will eventually need 30,000 graphics cards to power its model.HallucinationGenerative AI, particularly text-based chatbots, has a tendency to make things up. It's described as ""hallucination,"" because generative AI can sometimes go off on a total tangent, confidently talking about something that isn't true.

For example, a generative AI chatbot might hallucinate by saying Steve Jobs was a close-up magician, popular in Las Vegas during the Rat Pack era. But more commonly (and worryingly), generative AI chatbots hallucinate subtly, by mixing in fact with fiction. For example, it might say Steve Jobs was the founder of Apple (true), who oversaw the launch of the iPhone (true), for which he was declared Time's Person of the Year (not true). This happens because generative AI models work by predicting words based on probabilistic relation to the previous word. It isn't capable of understanding what it's generating. Let that be a reminder that ChatGPT might act sentient, but it's not.

JailbreakingJailbreaking a chatbot is getting it to do something outside of its intended uses. Using a certain kind of prompt, a jailbreak enables the user to bypass rules or guardrails, essentially tricking it into doing something it's not supposed to do according to its alignment. Jailbreaking can range from making a chatbot say offensive or inappropriate stuff just for fun, to making it share dangerous and actionable information, like how to make napalm. Large language model (LLM)A large language model is an AI software program that is trained on vast amounts of data to understand and generate text. LLMs string together sentences by predicting the next word based on probability. Since LLMs have been trained with so much data — basically the entirety of the internet — they are very successful at generating human-like text using this method. OpenAI's GPT models, Google's PaLM models, and Meta's Llama models are all examples of LLMs. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are what power ChatGPT and PaLM 2 and for Bard.Licensed dataLicensed data is information from the web that is purchased or accessed by a business or organization for the purpose of training AI. You might hear instances of companies saying they trained their models using licensed data. That's to say the data was legally obtained. The issue of licensed data has come up a lot recently due to the mass amounts of data needed to train AI models like ChatGPT. It gets murky in legal terms, because of the argument about what constitutes public domain, the original creator's intent, and how companies should be allowed to use that data.

Machine learningMachine learning is a method within artificial intelligence where a model is trained on data to learn and improve over time. Machine learning models use data to recognize patterns, classify information, and make predictions. Examples include filtering out spam emails (classification learning), using housing data to predict the price of a house (regression learning), or identifying images of dogs (deep learning). AI and machine learning are terms often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of AI, that's defined by being trained with data to build its intelligence.ModelYou've likely heard this term thrown around a lot in relation to AI. A model is a program or algorithm designed for a specific purpose. An AI model is a general term for a program designed to replicate and/or automate certain tasks.Natural language processing (NLP)The reason why ChatGPT's responses read as so eerily human is because of natural language processing. The term refers to the discipline of training a model on text and speech so that it understands and expresses itself like a human might. Natural language processing also involves linguistics research so that models can understand the complexities and nuances of language. Neural networkInspired by the way the human brain works, neural networks are algorithms composed of artificial ""neurons'' or nodes that communicate with each other. Each connection between two neurons carries a certain value or ""weight"". These weights automatically make certain assessments about inputs, and the neuron will ""fire"" if a certain threshold is reached, which will pass along information to other neurons in the network. Neural networks power deep learning.

'ChatGPT Voice' is now available to free users. Here's how to speak with it.



Open-sourceOpen-source means the source code of a software program is open and free to the public (whereas a black box is closed). That means developers can use, modify, and build their own products with it. An open-source AI model is seen as a way of democratizing the development of AI, which is often shrouded in secrecy. Unlike Google and OpenAI's models which are closed-source, Meta recently released an open-source LLM (Llama 2). Other open-source models include Falcon, MPT, and RedPajama. ParameterA parameter is a variable in an LLM that can be weighted or adjusted during training to determine a specific outcome. You may have heard about parameters in relation to how powerful an LLM is — for example, GPT-4 has 1.7 trillion parameters. The more parameters an LLM has, the more complex it is and the more capacity it has to learn. Think of parameters as settings on a high-quality camera. On the camera you can adjust light, film speed, zoom, aperture, change out the lenses, etc. and every configuration produces a slightly different result. Now multiply that by billions or trillions, and that's what parameters do.PromptA prompt is a request or question that a user sends to a chatbot. There's a whole subculture devoted to ensuring the best response from large language models. Whether it's for code-generation, jailbreaking, or just getting the best answer you're looking for, prompts depend on clarity, conciseness, context, and intent. See also: Prompt engineer.

Are 'prompt engineer' jobs real? Yes, but maybe not for long.



Prompt engineerWith the rise of generative AI chatbots, there's suddenly demand for expertise in crafting the right prompts. That's where prompt engineering comes in. A prompt engineer is someone with deep knowledge of LLMs who can optimize the best prompts for different purposes. That could be ensuring the chatbot successfully understands the request, or poking around the model to find threats and vulnerabilities. Prompt injection attackThe rise of LLMs has led to a new kind of cyberattack called prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection, similar to jailbreaking, is the act of using a carefully crafted prompt to manipulate models like ChatGPT for nefarious purposes. Through prompt injection, hackers exploit a vulnerability within a chatbot to share confidential information, or bypass the model's guardrails. Attackers use this directly, by interacting with the chatbot, or indirectly by hiding a prompt within a plugin or webpage, to secretly access personal or payment information. Recommendation algorithm/systemBefore the rise of ChatGPT, AI was already a big part of our lives. One of the more ubiquitous examples of this is the recommendation algorithm (or system). It's a term for a machine learning algorithm that makes recommendations based on user data and behavior. Your recommended shows on Netflix, products on Amazon, videos on YouTube and TikTok, and posts on Instagram are some examples of recommendation algorithms at work.

Strong AIStrong AI is another term for AGI or artificial general intelligence. It is a theoretical (for now) form of artificial intelligence that can autonomously ""think"" and act like a human.TokenA token is a unit of information within a large language model. It can be a word, part of a word, punctuation mark, or a segment of code — essentially the most fundamental form of something with meaning. When you hear that an LLM is trained on a certain number of tokens or a pricing model costs a certain number of cents per 1,000 tokens, this is what it's referring to. TrainingTraining is the process of feeding data to a machine learning model. There are two types of training: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is training a model with data that has already been labeled or classified in some way, whereas unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data which forces it to learn patterns and associations on its own. Each type of training has its own strengths and weaknesses. LLMs like GPT-4 use a combination of both unsupervised and supervised learning. Training dataTraining data is data that's used to train a machine learning model. Training data for LLMs consists of huge amounts of data called datasets, that are largely scraped from the internet. There are public datasets like Common Crawl and the Wikipedia database, and private or proprietary datasets gathered by companies like Google that have the resources to do so. Its dataset, MassiveWeb, for example, was created by Google-owned DeepMind and includes social media and blogging sites like Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Medium. So if you've ever posted on one of those sites, your data was probably used to train Bard. Transformer Did you know that GPT (as in ChatGPT) stands for generative pre-trained transformer? It's not just a tongue-tying acronym. A transformer is a type of neural network that powers the deep learning model used for generative AI. It works by embedding words (tokens) with context, using a ""self-attention"" mechanism, which enables it to predict what the next word might be. Otherwise, the model would just perceive words as bits of data without any association to each other. The transformer model, which kicked off the development of products like ChatGPT, originates from a paper by Google and University of Toronto researchers in 2017.

     LinkedIn      Twitter      Facebook      Email      Print    What You Should Know: Incredible Health, the fastest-growing healthcare career marketplace for healthcare workers, announced today that it has implemented generative AI across its platform, becoming the first within this essential field to do so.Logistical challenges within nurse hiring limit opportunity for nurses to find permanent positions that best suit them and contribute to the growing U.S. healthcare staffing crisis. But Incredible Health’s new generative AI features dramatically expand opportunity for nurses and speed up the hiring process for positions they actually want. Paving Way for A New Tomorrow: Incredible Health Implements Generative AI  Incredible Health has introduced advanced generative AI features, now available to all users, including the “Resume Wizard” for instant and optimized resume creation. Over 30% of nurses face challenges in resume creation, and the Resume Wizard on the Incredible Health mobile app allows them to generate impactful resumes in less than 5 minutes at no cost. This feature has helped thousands of nurses find new positions, expanding opportunities for those facing barriers in the job search process. To address the hyper-competitive nurse job market, Incredible Health utilizes generative AI for customized outreach to nurse candidates. This approach enables health systems to create tailored messages, highlighting crucial details about benefits and perks, resulting in a 20% increase in interview request accept rates from nurses. To expedite the hiring process, the platform employs generative AI to instantly process resumes and applications, reducing wait times from days to seconds. This feature addresses a common frustration for nurses and enhances their interaction with potential employers. Incredible Health plans to introduce more generative AI features, such as instant interview scheduling and personalized relocation campaigns. Currently, over 800,000 nurses and 750 hospitals, including notable healthcare organizations, benefit from the platform’s generative AI. Incredible Health is freely accessible for all U.S. nurses. “No company is investing in creating opportunity for nurses the way we are at Incredible Health,” said Iman Abuzeid, M.D, Co-Founder and CEO of Incredible Health. “For years, we’ve implemented machine learning within our marketplace, and adding new generative AI features are an essential step forward. Every new innovation puts nurses in the drivers seats of their careers and moves us closer to solving the healthcare hiring crisis.”        LinkedIn      Twitter      Facebook      Email      Print   Tap Native          Good Reading for HCPs     Ads By                  Urologist: Enlarged Prostate?

Job seekers are applying to more roles than years prior. Some say generative AI tools are to thank.
Six months ago, Anshita Verma was sending out a handful of job applications a day. Now, the 26-year-old data scientist is sending out 10 to 15 daily, and she says it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence tools.


“Instead of taking 30 minutes to fill out an application, it might take me 10,” says Verma. Plug-in AI browser tools that autofill the fields in job postings have greatly sped up the time she spends on applications, she says, letting her apply to more jobs more quickly.

Others are using generative AI programs like ChatGPT to create resumes and cover letters on demand that match the skills and qualifications of the job. Some are using job search automation tools such as LazyApply and SimplifyJobs to apply to jobs en masse. And AI tools such as Pyjama Jobs and Talentprise, which help candidates identify jobs their skill sets match, could also be boosting application rates.

Experts say the tools are one reason, coupled with a cooler labor market and inflation, that employers are getting inundated with more applications. Workers in the U.S. and the U.K. are applying to about 15% more roles compared to a year ago, according to recent data from LinkedIn.

“Job seekers are being more aggressive” compared to years past, says LinkedIn’s chief economist Karin Kimbrough, with AI helping people submit applications to more postings. “There’s a whole energy around AI right now, and if you have these tools that are going to help you craft that perfect message with personalized suggestions, it really gives you a little bit more confidence in applying.”
It can also prompt job seekers to apply more broadly. “Not only are they applying to more jobs, they’re actually applying to jobs they normally wouldn’t apply to,” says Michelle Volberg, founder and CEO of recruiting firm Giledan 360. “AI is like LinkedIn’s ‘Easy Apply’ tool on steroids. It's letting tech candidates apply to finance or healthcare roles if there’s some sort of overlap, or make their resume appear relevant when in reality it’s not.”

Experts say the increase in applications, due in part to AI, is swamping recruiters, leaving companies to sort through a flood of resumes. It’s causing “this really big need in the recruiting department to use AI to sort, filter, search and source resumes,” says Josh Bersin, a human resources industry analyst, who said he recently posted a job for an editor and got 300 responses in the first hour, with “90% of them looking like they were written by ChatGPT.” Says Bersin: “[Recruiters’] workload just went up because it's easier to apply.""
AI could also be making it harder for job seekers, as AI-assisted applications raise the bar for getting noticed and increase chances of getting missed amid the deluge. “People aren't finding a job as quickly as they might like, so they might feel the need to cover more bases and apply to more roles,” LinkedIn’s Kimbrough says.
Kimbrough and others say AI isn’t the whole reason job applications and competition are up. Add in slower hiring by companies, layoffs in many sectors and an uncertain economy, and it makes for an even more competitive job market.
Jon Stross, cofounder and president of hiring software company Greenhouse, says the amount of applications per job has more than doubled since June 2022. “The odds of getting a job are low,” he says, “so people are like, ‘how do you game the system?’” He says AI plays a part in the increased job applications, but the economic climate is having an impact, too.
James Neave, head of data science at job platform Adzuna, agrees: “AI is likely to be helping jobseekers speed up how long it takes to apply for jobs, which could mean they have the time and energy for more applications. But ultimately, AI isn’t the underlying cause behind greater job applications. That comes down to labor market dynamics.”
November job growth was slightly stronger than economists’ estimates as the U.S. added 199,000 jobs, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report. That’s up from October's 150,000—the lowest number of jobs added since January 2021. There were also more than 600,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year—a 198% increase from last year. The layoffs in the first nine months this year were the worst string of job cuts since 2020 and the second-worst stretch since 2009, according to staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Many companies use applicant tracking systems to help screen candidates’ applications for relevant skills and weed out those that don’t match certain keywords. But some say ATSs may not be able to keep up with the AI tools job seekers are using to better their chances of getting recognized, creating more work for recruiters and hiring managers.
When workers use AI tools to include keywords from job postings in their resumes, it can cause “a lot more resumes to potentially be getting through than there should be,” says career coach Jessica Mencunas. “That might work a little bit in the opposite of what the intention [of using an ATS] was: to really help recruiters be much more efficient.”
Some postings on LinkedIn even boast more than 1,000 applications. “It’s to the point where some companies don't even get through all the applications—it's just not possible,” says Volberg.
Some workers, such as Ronny Llerena, are still searching for jobs after being laid off earlier this year. “It’s insane,” says Llerena, 25, who has been looking for business operations opportunities in New York since the summer. “There are jobs that are posted for a day with 500 applicants already.” He says AI tools have helped him tailor his cover letters to specific jobs more quickly.
He doesn’t see AI as the sole reason the job market is so competitive, but says the increase in applications has pushed him to look for roles outside of tech and rely more on networking and referrals. Says Llerena: “AI certainly isn't helping alleviate the volume.”

Sign in Ohio is primed for growth, with low unemployment and high capital investment. In September, Joby Aviation announced it would invest up to $500 million to build air taxis in Dayton, confirming the state’s status as an elite manufacturing hub. Last year, Intel agreed to build two advanced semiconductor factories outside Columbus; at $20 billion, this is the largest private-sector investment in state history. Amazon is investing $7.8 billion to expand its data centers in central Ohio.All of this happened because the private and public sectors worked together to make Ohio an attractive place to do business. But we cannot be complacent. Rather, we need to recognize current and emerging problems, and address them. At the top of that list: the coming workforce gap.Ohio has only 75 workers available to fill every 100 open jobs, and our labor force participation rate is below the national average. Moreover, the demographic trends are not promising. By 2030, given our aging population and stagnant population growth, Ohio could have 600,000 fewer working-age residents (15-64) than in 2010. Employers are faced with a skill and site arbitrage problem — not having the right skills with ready workers in the right place.To exacerbate the challenge, there is the emergence of generative AI (gen AI), which will almost certainly disrupt workforce supply and demand. McKinsey has estimated that, accelerated by gen AI, up to 30% of current hours worked in the United States could be automated by 2030, requiring 12 million job shifts.Gen AI is a game-changer because it takes AI much deeper. It can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and generate content in new ways. For example, it could automate certain call center operations by providing customer support through chatbots or interactive voice response. In pharma, gen AI could speed up the clinical trial process by accelerating the identification of molecules for new drugs. Overall, the effect on the workforce will likely be substantial, particularly in office support, customer service and food service. McKinsey has estimated those earning less than $38,200 a year are 10 to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations by 2030 than the highest earners, due to AI and automation.At the same time, though, gen AI could also provide a significant productivity boost — 0.1 to 0.6% more a year through 2040. Combined with other technologies, that figure could reach 3.3%. And that boost matters: there is no prosperity without productivity.The challenge for Ohio is to get ahead of the curve, to enable workers to move from jobs in sectors with declining demand to higher-paid ones with a future and to use gen AI to build a truly sustainable and inclusive economy. This shift will require the public and private sectors to work together, as they have before, to develop a cohesive strategy and the capabilities our industries need.For the private sector, that means supporting workers in learning AI-related skills that will help businesses capitalize on the productivity opportunity. For example, as companies seek to capitalize on gen AI’s potential, how could they train people to be prompt engineers? Employers can also revisit hiring policies that historically focused on credentials, such as a four-year college degree, and instead focus those policies on skills gained through previous employment or other kinds of accreditation.The public sector also has an important role to play. One place to start is with information: analyzing trends to identify workforce gaps. To fill them, we need to ensure our schools and other organizations are giving young people the capabilities that employers want. For example, among Ohio’s college graduates, only 20% get degrees in STEM-related majors, compared to 22% in the country as a whole, and the rate of growth of these graduates (3% in 2021) is much slower than in the rest of the United States (9%). And finally, government leaders can work with the private sector to help spread the costs of training and re-skilling, and to facilitate workforce mobility and social support.Ohio has a history of resilience and competitiveness. We have reinvented ourselves before. The changing workforce and the rise of gen AI are another such challenge. The choice is clear: we can act now to build a workforce that is ready for the changes gen AI will bring and an economy that works for all of us. Or we can put it off and play catch up — when it might be too late.Brandon Carrus is the managing partner of McKinsey & Company’s Ohio office.

SINGAPORE: In the race to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI), Singapore aims to get ahead by more than tripling its AI workforce to 15,000 in the next three to five years.
This goal is achievable, according to industry observers, who see the figure as a starting point and as a critical mass needed for innovation.Advertisement 












But they also highlighted the need to look beyond numbers to ensure workers have the depth of skills needed as well as the ability to make interdisciplinary connections.
""It is certainly not just about the numbers, but more about specific talents and ideas,"" said Associate Professor Kan Min Yen of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) computing school.
""As with other areas of (information and communications technology), a single, uniquely integrative individual can catalyse the development of an entire sector of technology that we do not have today.""
Tripling the number of AI professionals will help contribute to breadth, but the field also requires deep expertise and cross-linking among industry, academia and start-ups, he added.
The Singapore government announced the 15,000 target on Monday (Dec 4), as part of a revised national AI strategy (NAIS) spurred by recent breakthroughs - particularly in generative AI.Advertisement 












The wide-ranging strategy also spans efforts to drive AI creation and usage by companies, support AI start-ups, update national research priorities, and strengthen data sharing and computing power.
Singapore also aims to accelerate the exchange of ideas, with plans to establish an ""iconic AI site"" to nurture a tight-knit knowledge community.
STATE OF PLAY
Singapore's general pipeline of tech talent took a hit when the country outsourced ICT jobs in the 1990s and 2000s, according to Associate Professor Damien Joseph of Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) business school.
This saw system development jobs going to India, or ICT call centre positions going to the Philippines and Ireland, for example.
But experts pointed out that Singapore is not alone in falling short of AI expertise today.Advertisement 












Thirty-five per cent of companies in the Asia-Pacific see a lack of AI skills as a major factor significantly limiting their evaluation of generative AI capabilities, according to a survey by market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC) in August.
This figure is actually lower among Singapore companies, at 22 per cent.
In fact, NUS' Assoc Prof Kan said that globally, Singapore contributes disproportionately more than other countries to the AI talent pool, as it does in many areas of advanced computing technology.

Some of the increase in AI workers that Singapore seeks will come from local universities. In 2020, the undergraduate intake for information and digital technologies degree courses was 3,100 across the country's six autonomous universities, according to the Education Ministry.
But not all graduates will specialise in AI, leaving a gap likely to be filled by other sources, including continuing education and overseas workers.Advertisement 












An apprenticeship scheme by AI Singapore – the national programme to develop AI capabilities – will be redesigned as part of NAIS 2.0.
Close to 300 people have graduated from the apprenticeship since it started in 2018. About 90 per cent have gone on to become data scientists, machine learning operations engineers, AI engineers, software engineers and other roles.
AI Singapore said its graduates have between five to 15 years of experience, with diverse backgrounds in engineering, banking and finance, teaching, law and human resources. 
Still, given a worldwide scarcity, Singapore will have to present itself as an attractive destination for AI talent - and it does have some advantages in this area.
Assoc Prof Kan pointed to the country's transparency, suitability as a testbed and interconnectivity. And speed of AI regulation and rollout can allow Singapore to serve as a role model for other countries facing more difficulties scaling up deployment, he said.
Mr Adrian Goh, co-founder of tech talent platform Nodeflair, said government support to foster tech trends and welcome innovation - as seen in cryptocurrency-friendly policies - has helped make Singapore attractive.
The country's strong English proficiency also attracts global companies like FAANG - Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - and Nvidia, while the high quality of life appeals to overseas AI talent.
Compared to the United States, where tech workers face challenges securing visas, Singapore has a streamlined employment pass system, Mr Goh added.
On the other hand, compared to Singapore, other countries in the region offer ""cost-efficient growth options"" with their emerging talent pools, he said.
Singapore's software engineers have the highest median salaries among seven Asian economies, according to a recent Nodeflair report. The median salary for a lead software engineer was about S$6,600, versus S$2,400 in Malaysia and S$2,100 in Vietnam, which had the next highest salaries.
Dr Lily Phan, IDC's research director for the future of work in the Asia-Pacific, also cited a lack of ""AI-readiness"" infrastructure, which was a limiting factor for 47 per cent of Singapore companies her market intelligence firm surveyed.
""It's the combination of different factors to make AI really work: Strategy, infrastructure, skills, governance (regulatory framework), data and culture,"" she said.






 










WHAT AI JOBS AND TRAINING COULD LOOK LIKE
Singapore's announcement also opened up questions about what the 15,000 jobs could look like, the skills needed, and how workers in other fields can take advantage of new opportunities.
The NAIS 2.0 report differentiates between AI creators who are ""top-tier AI talent"", AI users comprising enterprises and the general workforce, and AI practitioners who are tech workers. The 15,000 target applies to the latter group.
By that, the government is referring to workers with the skillset to create, implement and deploy AI systems, said Professor Lee Wee Sun of NUS' School of Computing.
To do this, software engineering skills are needed to create reliable systems that can be maintained at scale, he said.
Relevant roles could vary from training large language models to evaluating and making judgments based on AI recommendations, said Dr Phan.
NUS' Assoc Prof Kan said AI practitioners also help to bridge AI adoption in mainstream, commercial products.
And they are needed not just in companies but also in the public service, where they can help set up governmental frameworks and regulations to ensure fair and proper use of AI, he added.
This will require a general understanding of how AI is trained as well as its current limitations.
Assoc Prof Kan also pointed to the importance of interdisciplinary links – for instance, pairing AI understanding with subject matter expertise in a field wanting to benefit from the tech, such as healthcare or education.

Nodeflair's Mr Goh said that while software engineers and data analysts are already well-suited for transitioning into AI, domain-specific professionals trained in data science and machine learning also have an important role to play.
This is because understanding the nuances of a domain is valuable when working on AI applications.
While more training is required for such workers to make the career switch to AI, they are ""much more valuable talent"", he said.
The level of AI proficiency they would need to attain depends on the role, ranging from a developer creating large language models, to a developer working on a product that incorporates an application programming interface (API).
""To illustrate, it's like comparing building a car engine from scratch (the first scenario) to simply fitting a car engine into the rest of the car (the second scenario),"" said Mr Goh.
He stressed that even someone with software development experience will need continual learning to make sure their skills stay relevant, given the fast-evolving nature of the AI field.
And for those employed by tech companies, basic AI proficiency is increasingly expected as a core technical competency due to the pervasiveness of AI in business operations, said Mr Goh.
This is reflected in offerings at universities, where AI is being incorporated as a core subject for computer science students.
All of NUS' roughly 900 computer science students annually are required to take a compulsory AI module, and the university is in the process of setting up a graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster for its AI courses, said NUS' Prof Lee.
University programmes focusing on interdisciplinary AI knowledge are also coming up.
In November, NTU announced a new four-year bachelor of applied computing in finance, with integrated courses like machine learning in finance.
""By building a strong AI ecosystem, Singapore is in a strong position to be a regional AI hub,"" said Prof Lee.
""We have a strong education system that is able to develop the local talent. (And) we can attract some of the best talents in the region.""

In many cases, it's become a part of their daily routines.AI has gone from feeling like an abstract idea to a familiar tool that can streamline workflows and generate new ideas. But not everyone has welcomed the technology, and instead see it as a threat to their very careers. It's a push-and-pull that's defined this year.The biggest AI workplace trends of 2023 show how the technology has shaken up work as we know it. They also give us a peek into how AI might shape 2024, as the technology continues to evolve at lightning pace.Workers are already depending on AIMany employees have grown accustomed to using AI in their daily jobs for time-saving administrative tasks, particularly rudimentary writing and basic ideation. This is especially the case in knowledge-work positions, where AI shows potential to free up workers to do creative, more sophisticated tasks. (Some workers are even using the technology to write resumes and cover letters to get those jobs in the first place.)But as more workers utilise AI, some employers are responding by curbing the technology's use in the workplace. This has included tacitly suppressing or outright banning access to tools like ChatGPT, with organisations worried about potential misuse or data leaks, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US. Yet some employees who've come to heavily rely on the tools, whether for increased productivity or to get a leg up on colleagues, have had to backchannel to retain access. Social-media communities have even offered tips on how to secretly access the technology at work.AlamySome skilled jobs workers considered shielded from generative AI are now facing threats with evolving technology (Credit: Alamy)AI is evolving to target some office jobs Many people assumed AI would most likely replace humans in roles that are easily automated: think the customer service chatbots and grocery-delivering robots already busy at work.But as it has evolved in the past year, it's clear that it could impact more complex knowledge work roles once considered ""safe"". Some creative jobs are already being threatened. For example, text-to-image generative AI programs like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can create dazzling illustrations and photorealistic renders in moments – work that's typically reserved for highly skilled commercial art teams.Data shows there's validity to workers' worries. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans – equating to 300 million jobs lost across Europe and the US.""This isn't somebody else's problem now. It's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at US economic think tank organisation the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC. ""We don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""But some jobs won't be replaced – yetFor all the fear, however, there are many roles and tasks that AI won't be capable of performing in the near future. That's particularly the case with jobs that demand soft skills, such as emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything, believes workers whose job it is to come up with new business strategies may be relatively safe from automation. He also predicts roles that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships – for example, nurses and business consultants – are hard for machines to replace. These are jobs, he says, that require ""a very deep understanding of people. I think it'll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships"".Additionally, trade jobs that far pre-date digital work environments – such as electricians, plumbers and welders – are among the ""hardest of anything to automate"", says Ford. These jobs are less reliant on language-based tasks and typically require greater problem-solving ability, mobility and dexterity in unpredictable environments that machines cannot currently mimic.AlamyExperts say there are still jobs that require a human touch, such as doctors, that are not yet vulnerable to AI replacement (Credit: Alamy)We're also going to work with AIAs AI becomes more ubiquitous, some experts believe the technology is actually more likely to augment – rather than replace – human talent. Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, cites medical diagnoses as an example. While a robot may be able to detect cancer, for instance, most patients would prefer a qualified medical professional to break the news.Workers are already utilising ChatGPT as a personal assistant, using it to draft emails, plan itineraries and project costs and timelines. More broadly, professionals are already using AI to help eliminate bias in decision making – some large corporations are already employing data-driven recruitment to test candidates' qualities, with behavioural insights matching them with the right vacancy.And while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones; for example, data engineers, governance specialists and a host of ""training"" roles. Alongside much fear and uncertainty, there's optimismAI may be the technology of the day, but it's far from the first to disrupt the workforce. Technology has advanced exponentially over the decades, from the rise of automation in mechanics, to office computers and wireless internet. ""Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, it has the potential to automate or streamline work processes,"" says Scott Likens, global AI and innovation technology leader at PwC, based in Austin, US. ""However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements.""Experts recommend that rather than worry about the threat of AI, it's more useful to think of it as a tool. The best tactic? Adapt, learn and lean into the technology, says Likens. ""Education and training [are] key for employees to learn about AI and what it can do for their particular role, as well as help them develop new skills. Instead of shying away from AI, employees should plan to embrace and educate.""Artificial intelligenceWork cultureYear in review 2023FeaturesHow we work",NewsArticle,,,Panic and possibility: What workers learned about AI in 2023,2023-12-27T12:00:00.000Z,2023-12-27T12:00:55.369Z,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alex Christian', 'url': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0h0lyh1.jpg'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Employees Secretly Using Generative AI at Work and Why Employers Should Care

By Lin Grensing-Pophal, Contributing Editor
Dec 27, 2023
HR Technology

Updated: Dec 29, 2023




The rise in sophistication and availability of generative AI tools has opened up immense potential for humans to make their lives easier by shifting some of their tasks to such tools. And that potential certainly extends to the workplace where many employees have discovered generative AI can do a lot of their work for them, as Alex Christian discusses in an article for BBC Worklife. These AI applications range from writing assistance to more complex problem-solving tools.




While these tools can significantly enhance efficiency and creativity, their clandestine use raises several concerns for employers.



AI’s Accuracy Issues
AI, particularly in its generative forms, is not always accurate or reliable. Employers should be concerned about the potential for AI to produce erroneous results or suggestions, which could lead to flawed decision-making or inaccurate work outputs. The lack of oversight on AI-generated content could result in significant errors going unnoticed until they cause substantial problems.

	



Risk of Intellectual Property Violation
Generative AI may inadvertently produce content that violates intellectual property (IP) rights. This is particularly risky when AI tools are used to generate marketing materials, reports, or creative content. The AI could replicate or slightly modify existing copyrighted material without proper attribution or permission, potentially leading to legal issues for the company.



Sensitive Information at Risk
When employees use AI tools, especially those hosted on external platforms, there’s a risk of inputting sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information into these systems. This could lead to unintentional data breaches or unintended sharing of sensitive information, where sensitive company information is exposed or compromised. Employers need to be aware of the types of data being fed into AI tools and ensure that confidential information is adequately protected.



The secret use of AI tools by employees in the workplace is a multi-faced issue. While it can lead to increased efficiency and innovation, it also poses significant risks in terms of accuracy, intellectual property rights, and data security. Employers need to be proactive in addressing these issues, potentially by setting clear policies on AI tool usage and ensuring that employees are trained on the responsible and safe use of these technologies. By doing so, companies can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.

Starting with ChatGPT’s release in November 2022, this space has evolved so quickly that it’s hard to believe that it’s been just one year in which all these advancements have come out.While the results are quite amazing, the underlying complexity has led a lot of people to publicly speculate on how these large language models (LLMs) work. Some people have speculated that these models are pulling from a preformulated database of responses, and some have gone as far to speculate that these LLMs have gained a human-level of sentience. These are extreme stances, and as you might guess, both are incorrect.You may have heard that these LLMs are next-word predictors, meaning that they use probability to determine the next word that should come in a sentence. This understanding is technically correct, but it’s a little too high level to sufficiently understand these models. In order to build a stronger intuition, we need to go deeper.

The prompt asked for a 1,200 word article (a number it undercut by quite a margin) that explored both the potential negative and positive outcomes of the technology. We then asked it to include real world examples, which is apparently beyond its capabilities. We also asked it to include a section on the recent Sam Altman debacle which, as you will soon read, was also not a topic it was particularly capable at describing. Below is the unedited output with light changes for formatting.Navigating the future of Generative AI: Balancing exciting possibilities and potential pitfallsGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful force, reshaping the technological landscape with its ability to create content autonomously. From language models like GPT-3 to image-generating algorithms, generative AI holds immense promise for the future. However, this promising future is not without its challenges. In this article, we will explore the potential negative outcomes and the most exciting possibilities of generative AI, aiming to strike a balance between optimism and caution. Additionally, we'll address the recent leadership shift involving Sam Altman at OpenAI, shedding light on the ethical considerations associated with AI development.Sam Altman's Leadership Shift: Lessons in ethical AIIn recent months, the AI community witnessed a significant leadership shift at OpenAI involving Sam Altman. The CEO, known for his influential role in steering OpenAI's initiatives, faced a period of controversy surrounding his firing and subsequent re-hiring. This incident underscored the challenges associated with ethical considerations in AI development and management.Addressing ethical concerns: Sam Altman's leadership shift prompted a reevaluation of ethical considerations in AI development and organizational decision-making. The incident raised questions about transparency, accountability, and the need for robust ethical frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies.Transparency and accountability: The leadership transition emphasized the importance of transparency in organizational decision-making, especially in contexts where AI technologies with widespread implications are involved. It highlighted the necessity of holding leaders and organizations accountable for their actions and ensuring that ethical guidelines are followed.Community involvement: The controversy surrounding Sam Altman's leadership shift also brought to light the significance of involving the wider community in decisions related to AI development. The call for more inclusive decision-making processes gained momentum, reinforcing the idea that diverse perspectives are crucial in navigating the ethical challenges associated with AI technologies. Photoshop (AI prompt: ""The future of generative AI in manga style"")The potential negative outcomesEthical concerns and biasOne of the primary concerns with generative AI lies in its susceptibility to biases present in training data. If the data used to train these models reflects societal biases, the AI may inadvertently perpetuate and amplify those biases in its generated content. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent AI systems from unintentionally reinforcing and spreading harmful stereotypes.Security threats and DeepfakesThe ability of generative AI to produce highly realistic and convincing content raises serious security concerns. Deepfakes, for instance, are AI-generated images or videos that manipulate and superimpose content onto real footage. This technology can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating fake news, impersonating individuals, or spreading misinformation. As generative AI becomes more sophisticated, the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake content becomes increasingly difficult.Privacy invasionThe advancements in generative AI also raise concerns about privacy invasion. The ability to generate realistic images and videos of individuals who never participated in such content creation poses a risk to personal privacy. Protecting individuals from the unauthorized use of their likeness in AI-generated content will be a pressing issue in the coming years.Unemployment and Economic DisruptionThe automation capabilities of generative AI may lead to workforce displacement in certain industries. Jobs that involve routine and repetitive tasks, such as content creation, could be at risk. Striking a balance between technological advancement and societal well-being will be a challenge to ensure that AI complements human labor rather than replaces it.Moral and Ethical DilemmasAs AI systems become more proficient in generating content that mimics human creativity, ethical questions arise. For instance, who owns the rights to AI-generated art or literature? Determining the legal and moral implications of creations produced by non-human entities challenges our conventional understanding of authorship and intellectual property. Photoshop (AI prompt: ""futuristic AI utopia"")The Most Exciting PossibilitiesEnhanced Creativity and ProductivityGenerative AI has the potential to amplify human creativity and productivity by automating mundane tasks, allowing individuals to focus on more complex and strategic aspects of their work.

The New York Times Sues OpenAI and Microsoft for Training Generative AI Models With Copyrighted Work



Eric Hal Schwartz  on December 27, 2023 at 12:00 pm

The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement for using millions of Times articles without permission to train their generative AI models. Court documents filed this week in Manhattan’s Federal District Court contend that OpenAI and Microsoft copied substantial portions of the Times’ archive of articles without permission to develop the large language models powering products like ChatGPT and Copilot.
Times Training
The newspaper claims that OpenAI and Microsoft’s acts constitute willful copyright infringement under federal law. The Times is seeking an injunction that would require Microsoft and OpenAI to stop using its content, along with monetary compensation potentially in the billions of dollars based on the widespread use of the companies’ AI services. That use, according to the complaint, harmed the Times by allowing the AI systems to provide Times content for free.
“[OpenAI and Microsoft] seek to free-ride on the Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment,” the lawsuit states. “If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill. Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”
The core issue is whether web scraping done by generative AI companies to obtain training data from news sites and other sources qualifies as fair use under copyright law. Tech firms argue it does, while publishers contend their content cannot legally be copied at scale without permission or payment. Hundreds of media organizations, including The Times, have implemented technical measures to block their sites from being scraped without consent.
Access Allegations
The Times alleges OpenAI and Microsoft copied millions of articles dating back to the 1980s before those measures were implemented as a way to train LLMs and writing tools like that directly compete against its journalism. In addition, the hallucinations that the models produce can include made-up quotes and facts attributed to The New York Times, which might damage the factual integrity of its reporting. The lawsuit cites several such instances from Microsoft’s Bing generative AI chatbot.
“We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models. Our ongoing conversations with The New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”
This isn’t the first lawsuit OpenAI has faced over where it obtained generative AI training data. That has prompted the partnerships the company referenced in its statement. For instance, the Associated Press and OpenAI have struck a deal to allow OpenAI access to the AP’s archive of text, images, and video for training ChatGPT. OpenAI has also just announced a deal with Berlin-based publishing giant Axel Springer to integrate articles from its publications into ChatGPT, providing answers to users and a data pipeline for training OpenAI’s LLMs.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Video game companies are dipping their toes into the rapidly-evolving world of generative AI with behind-the-scenes development. It may soon be applied to actual gameplay. 
A recent example came earlier this month from the Seattle-based creators of the popular social app Rec Room, which debuted Fractura, an in-game room created as a “research project” to demonstrate how players can use generative AI to create their own content for Rec Room.
The Seattle startup evaluated more than 20 different tools in the process of designing Fractura, such as ChatGPT to develop and iterate on their ideas, including the creation of a “bible” for Fractura’s backstory. It visualized ideas via Midjourney and DALL-E, and turned the resulting images into 3D assets with CSM and Shap-E. Finally, Fractura’s alien skies were built out with Skybox, an AI tool from Blockade Labs.
“Despite some challenges,” Rec Room wrote in a blog post, “the future for 3D GenAI looks bright, and the team looks forward to further explorations!”
Like anywhere else in tech, the debate over AI has been one of the running themes of 2023 in the games industry. Much of that debate, however, has been crowded out of the limelight by other concerns, such as a year-long wave of layoffs that has cost roughly 10,000 developers their jobs since January. 
When work in the field is already unstable, no developer that I’ve spoken to has been enthusiastic about the advent of technology that could be (read: inevitably will be) used to automate and eliminate somebody’s position.
However, generative AI is already helping some studios behind the scenes.
(RoboSquad Image)
By giving ChatGPT access to the code base for its free-to-play arena shooter RoboSquad Revolution, New York-based Zollpa has turned it into a useful assistant for playtesting, training, code analysis, and integrating new programs.
Zollpa also trained AI to go through its recorded gameplay footage and pick out particular clips based upon recognizable keywords, such as “bug” or “Steam Play.” The AI can then organize a list and assign the potential issue to the most relevant members of the team.
“It’s definitely helped with our productivity in general, so we don’t have to watch and rewatch our gameplay videos,” said Joey Thigpen, co-lead developer.
There is an important distinction to be made between using generative AI to accelerate development processes, and using the technology to make a game with content generated by AI, said David Ryan Hunt, CEO of Noodle Cat Games in Salt Lake City.
“We’ve put a lot of attention on, ‘Oh, I made a cool picture by typing a few words!’” said Hunt. “But the reality of game development is that the majority of the work that goes into making a product is unseen.”
As Hunt notes, AI art and prose are what get all the attention in this conversation, and they also carry legal and ethical challenges.
Plagiarism stew
Generative AI tools are trained on data, much of which is scraped from publicly available online sources, which can include identifiable snippets from copyrighted work. Despite how it looks, and how it’s sold, publicly available AI isn’t creating anything; it’s grabbing everything it can find and boiling it for soup.
Professional artists such as Greg Rutkowski have discovered their online portfolios have been “harvested” by AI tools, which has flooded the internet with artwork that vaguely resembles their own styles. Some have gone so far as to fight back with tools like Nightshade, which “poisons” online artwork in ways that disrupt AI models using it as training data.
Several companies have preemptively banned AI tools for use in related projects. Valve Software made a few headlines in June when it rejected a game that was submitted for publication via its online storefront Steam, on the basis that it had been made using AI.
The game developer took to Reddit to complain on the subject, which spurred a public statement from Valve in response. According to Valve, it wasn’t the AI tools themselves, but rather, the significant risk that material produced with those tools has likely violated someone’s copyright.
“The introduction of AI can sometimes make it harder to show a developer has sufficient rights in using AI to create assets, including images, text, and music,” a Valve representative told GeekWire in July.
Valve continued: “In particular, there is some legal uncertainty relating to data used to train AI models. It is the developer’s responsibility to make sure they have the appropriate rights to ship their game. …While developers can use these AI technologies in their work with appropriate commercial licenses, they can not infringe on existing copyrights.”
Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve has consistently taken a zero-tolerance stance on any new technologies that could cause legal issues. It previously banned “play-to-earn” games on Steam in 2021, in which users could generate small amounts of cryptocurrency or collect special NFT drops by playing games.
Meanwhile, one of Steam’s competitors, the Epic Games Store, has stepped in as a storefront that will take Web3 projects, and as of September, may also be open to hosting AI-developed games.
AI content generation

It’s worth restating: the problem with generative AI in video games, at least for the time being, isn’t inherent to the tools. It’s typically with the data that’s been used to train those tools, and how the tools regurgitate that data. An AI that’s simply trained using whatever data it can find can pose some serious risks, up to and including the possibility of having illegal material in its dataset.
If best practices are pursued, though, generative AI has a number of potential applications in game design, particularly in the field of content created by users. 
Microsoft made headlines earlier this fall through its partnership with Inworld.AI, which promises to bring unspecified “AI-powered” upgrades to future Xbox games. In theory, AI could remove certain current limitations in game narrative, such as removing the need for generic NPC dialogue. Instead of having a few scripted lines and coded behaviors, AI-driven characters could react realistically to whatever happens to or around them.
For a more specific example, there’s Adventure Forge, scheduled for release on Steam Early Access in early 2024. It’s a no-code toolset by Seattle-area company Endless Adventures, which players can use to create their own original games, ranging from dungeon crawlers to visual novels.
This includes a built-in Stable Diffusion system by Scenario.GG that has only been trained on art assets that were created for the project by Endless Adventures. Everything that could be created for Adventure Forge with its built-in generative AI, such as new maps or in-game props, would thus fall under Endless Adventures’ copyright.
Adventure Forge will ship with over 1,500 environmental assets for players to use in their games, such as floors, walls, and furniture. In previous generations of homebrew software, those assets would be all users had to work with for the duration. With Scenario.GG’s system, though, players can simply create new Adventure Forge assets on the spot.
“This is not technology for technology’s sake,” Endless Adventures CEO Jordan Weisman told GeekWire. “This is from people whose whole lives have been about storytelling, and we want to empower storytelling, but we want to do it in a responsible way.”

The advancements from generative AI for game studios, for now, may not be massive. 
“A lot of the capabilities that we have now are not very far removed from procedural generation and various types of algorithms that we’ve been using in games for decades,” said Hunt. 
You’ve likely played a video game that uses procedural generation. These are created with a number of handcrafted assets, which are assembled algorithmically into a randomized order. The most famous example may be the dungeons in Blizzard’s action-RPG series Diablo, which are different every time you play the game.
The distinction between procedural generation and generative AI may seem academic from a player’s perspective, but under the hood, they’re doing two very different things. If you picture game design as a set of building blocks, then procedural generation rearranges building blocks according to a pre-programmed algorithm. Generative AI tries to create new blocks there on the spot, based on the data it’s accumulated on how blocks are supposed to work.
“We automate all sorts of different pieces of development,” said Hunt, who previously worked on Fortnite at Epic Games. “It’s not specific to AI. It’s just how the industry works.”
Current generative AI, from Hunt’s perspective, is a more advanced version of automated technologies that have already been in use in game development. Under the hood, many of the use cases for AI in game development are a simple step up from understood best practices, he said. 
“There’s a big gap to me,” Hunt said, “between the discourse around AI and the practical reality of what it’s likely to look like over time.”
Over the course of the last year, bad actors have used various AI/LLM tools to create everything from quick cash-grabs, such as churning out nonsensical children’s books or flooding a sci-fi magazine with submissions, to scams that involve cloning someone’s voice in order to extort money out of their relatives.
In the games industry, there are already stories of people using the same tools to turn out simple games in a week or less. The concern is that we’re on the verge of a dark age of auto-generated machine garbage, in a business where many open storefronts already have real issues with “troll games.”
It’s likely that as its usage increases, many of the problems with AI will get worse before they get better. In the meantime, that only makes it more important to find ways to filter the signal from the noise.

Grynbaum and Ryan MacDec. 27, 2023Leer en españolThe New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.” It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times.In its complaint, The Times said it approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to raise concerns about the use of its intellectual property and explore “an amicable resolution,” possibly involving a commercial agreement and “technological guardrails” around generative A.I. products. But it said the talks had not produced a resolution.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAn OpenAI spokeswoman, Lindsey Held, said in a statement that the company had been “moving forward constructively” in conversations with The Times and that it was “surprised and disappointed” by the lawsuit.“We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from A.I. technology and new revenue models,” Ms. Held said. “We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”Microsoft declined to comment on the case.The lawsuit could test the emerging legal contours of generative A.I. technologies — so called for the text, images and other content they can create after learning from large data sets — and could carry major implications for the news industry. The Times is among a small number of outlets that have built successful business models from online journalism, but dozens of newspapers and magazines have been hobbled by readers’ migration to the internet.At the same time, OpenAI and other A.I. tech firms — which use a wide variety of online texts, from newspaper articles to poems to screenplays, to train chatbots — are attracting billions of dollars in funding.OpenAI is now valued by investors at more than $80 billion. Microsoft has committed $13 billion to OpenAI and has incorporated the company’s technology into its Bing search engine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” the complaint says, accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of “using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.”The defendants have not had an opportunity to respond in court.Concerns about the uncompensated use of intellectual property by A.I. systems have coursed through creative industries, given the technology’s ability to mimic natural language and generate sophisticated written responses to virtually any prompt.The actress Sarah Silverman joined a pair of lawsuits in July that accused Meta and OpenAI of having “ingested” her memoir as a training text for A.I. programs. Novelists expressed alarm when it was revealed that A.I. systems had absorbed tens of thousands of books, leading to a lawsuit by authors including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham. Getty Images, the photography syndicate, sued one A.I. company that generates images based on written prompts, saying the platform relies on unauthorized use of Getty’s copyrighted visual materials.The boundaries of copyright law often get new scrutiny at moments of technological change — like the advent of broadcast radio or digital file-sharing programs like Napster — and the use of artificial intelligence is emerging as the latest frontier.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.“A Supreme Court decision is essentially inevitable,” Richard Tofel, a former president of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to the news business, said of the latest flurry of lawsuits. “Some of the publishers will settle for some period of time — including still possibly The Times — but enough publishers won’t that this novel and crucial issue of copyright law will need to be resolved.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMicrosoft has previously acknowledged potential copyright concerns over its A.I. products. In September, the company announced that if customers using its A.I. tools were hit with copyright complaints, it would indemnify them and cover the associated legal costs.Other voices in the technology industry have been more steadfast in their approach to copyright. In October, Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm and early backer of OpenAI, wrote in comments to the U.S. Copyright Office that exposing A.I. companies to copyright liability would “either kill or significantly hamper their development.”“The result will be far less competition, far less innovation and very likely the loss of the United States’ position as the leader in global A.I. development,” the investment firm said in its statement.Besides seeking to protect intellectual property, the lawsuit by The Times casts ChatGPT and other A.I. systems as potential competitors in the news business. When chatbots are asked about current events or other newsworthy topics, they can generate answers that rely on journalism by The Times. The newspaper expresses concern that readers will be satisfied with a response from a chatbot and decline to visit The Times’s website, thus reducing web traffic that can be translated into advertising and subscription revenue.The complaint cites several examples when a chatbot provided users with near-verbatim excerpts from Times articles that would otherwise require a paid subscription to view. It asserts that OpenAI and Microsoft placed particular emphasis on the use of Times journalism in training their A.I. programs because of the perceived reliability and accuracy of the material.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMedia organizations have spent the past year examining the legal, financial and journalistic implications of the boom in generative A.I. Some news outlets have already reached agreements for the use of their journalism: The Associated Press struck a licensing deal in July with OpenAI, and Axel Springer, the German publisher that owns Politico and Business Insider, did likewise this month. Terms for those agreements were not disclosed.The Times is exploring how to use the nascent technology itself. The newspaper recently hired an editorial director of artificial intelligence initiatives to establish protocols for the newsroom’s use of A.I. and examine ways to integrate the technology into the company’s journalism.In one example of how A.I. systems use The Times’s material, the suit showed that Browse With Bing, a Microsoft search feature powered by ChatGPT, reproduced almost verbatim results from Wirecutter, The Times’s product review site. The text results from Bing, however, did not link to the Wirecutter article, and they stripped away the referral links in the text that Wirecutter uses to generate commissions from sales based on its recommendations.“Decreased traffic to Wirecutter articles and, in turn, decreased traffic to affiliate links subsequently lead to a loss of revenue for Wirecutter,” the complaint states.The lawsuit also highlights the potential damage to The Times’s brand through so-called A.I. “hallucinations,” a phenomenon in which chatbots insert false information that is then wrongly attributed to a source. The complaint cites several cases in which Microsoft’s Bing Chat provided incorrect information that was said to have come from The Times, including results for “the 15 most heart-healthy foods,” 12 of which were not mentioned in an article by the paper.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” the complaint reads. It adds, “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”The Times has retained the law firms Susman Godfrey and Rothwell, Figg, Ernst & Manbeck as outside counsel for the litigation. Susman represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against Fox News, which resulted in a $787.5 million settlement in April. Susman also filed a proposed class action suit last month against Microsoft and OpenAI on behalf of nonfiction authors whose books and other copyrighted material were used to train the companies’ chatbots.Benjamin Mullin contributed reporting.Michael M.

Will artificial intelligence kill jobs and businesses?
 by Alisa Nelson | Dec 29, 2023Sadie St. Lawrence (Photo courtesy of the Missouri School Boards' Association)


A report by an international consulting firm says businesses who adopted artificial intelligence early on experienced a 100% cash flow increase. According to a McKinsey & Company report, if businesses don’t adopt AI, they will see a 20% cash flow decline.
One of the country’s leading artificial intelligence experts, Sadie St. Lawrence, said if businesses start using AI, they will still see a cash flow increase.
“The key message is just start, right? Just start because this wave is coming and it’s going to take you no matter what,” St. Lawrence told Missourinet.
Whether artificial intelligence will be a job killer is a question popping up by some people in the business world. St. Lawrence said a study by Open AI and a few other collaborators shows artificial intelligence cannot replace a worker’s entire job.
“What it did is it could do a few of the tasks within their job,” said St. Lawrence. “And that’s why I think it’s so important for individuals to realize it’s here to augment you. And that’s where those efficiency gains are given, right? It’s by having your employees work alongside it, work with it, but it can’t do everything that they do.”
AI has ranked in the 98 percentile of IQ tests. It has passed almost every AP, science, history, and writing exam, along with medical board exams and the LSATs. 
Artificial intelligence is making its way in the classroom, the workplace, the battlefield, and likely the 2024 elections. St. Lawrence said to protect your privacy, stay away from the free AI tools.
“Do I have concerns about, you know, my own privacy and then the privacy of others? But finally, how is it using that information? Is it spreading misinformation? So I think we’re about to really enter a privacy and information almost war than we’ve never seen before,” said St. Lawrence.
A top concern is how AI will affect the privacy of minors.

Generative AI has sparked a tremendous backlash across the internet, as the early promise of the technology has been overshadowed by the wide range of problems it has introduced.

Here are some of the reasons why the public is pushing back against AI in the arts:


Generative AI Is Impractical
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, and image generators like Midjourney and Dall-E, have introduced a new copyright conundrum, and provoked multiple lawsuits alleging copyright infringement.

PROMOTED
It’s true that no artist was asked if their work could be used to train these models. But even if the courts rule in favor of the machines, the practical application of the technology doesn’t seem worth the cost.

Generative AI is incredibly energy-intensive, surprisingly labor-intensive, and requires constant input — annotation — from human workers to keep it functional, lest it spiral into hallucinogenic nonsense.

Using ChatGPT for a playful Q&A session consumes an absurd amount of water; exchanging a mere 20 questions with the text generator is akin to pouring a 500ml bottle of clean freshwater down the drain.

Even with all this human effort to keep the technology anchored in reality, AI is predicted to damage itself when it inevitably starts consuming its own output, like a species inbred to extinction.
Not to mention, the constant slurry pouring out of the image generators are clogging up Google Image search.
In the future, children will learn about our era of climate catastrophe, and struggle to understand why we burned energy with such reckless abandon; billionaire space tourism, celebrity private jets, NFT minting, and now, generative AI.
What’s it all for?
What’s The Point of AI Art?
Generative AI has given the public the means to instantly create an image, or piece of writing, that looks as though it took time and effort. Art can now be manifested via the touch of a button, a prompt or two, as effortless as ordering fast food.
The technology is a solution to a problem that never existed. Artists, as much as they like to complain about the struggle of the creative process, enjoy making things. The creative process is incredibly rewarding, even if the final piece doesn’t match up to the original vision.
Artists are watching the skills that they have spent their life sharpening being devalued before their eyes.
Worse, their work was absorbed into the dataset without their knowledge or consent; they have been used to train their own replacement, and no one asked for permission.
Generative AI threatens the livelihood of artists, pitting their labor against the cheap slop produced by dead machines. The technology only benefits those who wish to produce content as quickly and cheaply as possible, by removing artists from the creative process.
If you think pop culture has become too bland and algorithmic nowadays, just wait until the content is being produced by actual algorithms — in hindsight, we probably shouldn’t have let the word “content” catch on.
AI-generated media will likely not result in thoughtful, imaginative, and groundbreaking stories; the concern is that the hype cycle will last long enough to damage the career prospects of working creatives.
AI Is Not Learning Like A Human
Many AI enthusiasts argue that machine learning is analogous to human learning, that stealing the work of artists to fill datasets is the same as humans taking artistic inspiration from others.
Generative AI, however, is not conscious. It’s not even close.
There’s a widely held belief among AI enthusiasts that the technology will only grow more intelligent as the years pass. Some have even been possessed with a kind of evangelical zeal, under the impression that AI will eventually evolve into a fully conscious being, AGI, that will lead humanity to the singularity.
Noam Chomsky and his co-authors argued against this reductive worldview in a NYTimes Op-Ed, writing:
“The human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of terabytes of data ... it seeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to create explanations.”
Credulous billionaire Elon Musk is a good example of a high-profile figure who firmly believes the AI hype. Musk spends much of his time repeating the wildest predictions of science fiction authors — that is, when he’s not endorsing the Great Replacement theory on “X,” the bot-riddled website formally known as Twitter.
Ironically, the decline of “X” shows the corrosive effects of generative AI; the technology has created an ocean of spam that clogs every post, turning replies into mindless mush. LLMs have given bots the ability to imitate human speech, but not to make interesting human conversation.
They never say anything worth listening to. How can they, when they have no ability to understand context, no perspective from which to view the world?
This lack of understanding results in boring output.
AI Art Is Boring
Have you ever seen generative AI create anything even remotely interesting, beyond grotesquely amusing memes? That might just be the best use for them; the uncanny, plastic sheen of AI imagery is perfect for the weird world of memes.
The most intriguing element of AI art is surely the mistakes — crowds with melted faces, hands with withered fingers, extra digits, and limbs sprouting from places they simply shouldn’t.
Zooming into AI images often reveals unsettling elements, evidence that the image was created by a dead machine, with none of the intent of a human creator.
When we immerse ourselves in art, we experience a touch of the unique perspective that an artist brings to their work, the smeared fingerprints that makes art worth talking about.
It is telling that AI can be used to write an essay, but never a good story; it has no perspective to speak from, no odd fixations, perversions or eccentricities that a person injects into their art. It’s just a bland amalgamation of what has come before.
AI could perhaps write a forgettable, formulaic superhero movie, but it could never surprise us with a fresh spin on a familiar genre — the dead machine can only reconstruct art from tattered pieces it has already eaten.
AI will not surprise us, or produce work that inspires a range of imitators; it will never mimic the insight of The Sopranos, the boundless imagination of One Piece, or even the lighthearted political commentary of Barbie — it certainly could never create something as wonderfully enigmatic as Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron.
In fact, when Miyazaki first encountered AI-generated art, he reacted with visceral disgust. A now-famous clip shows the legendary animator watching a presentation on Artificial Intelligence in animation, and being told that the intent is to create a machine that can “draw like a human.”
Miyazaki replied, ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""
