In May, Procore Technologies launched its IPO and the shares jumped by 31%. The company, which operates a leading cloud-based platform to manage construction projects, has over 800 customers and the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is more than $400 million.


But if you look at the S-1 filing, there are some interesting details about the construction industry. For example, the investment in technologies has generally lagged (this is based on research from McKinsey) and the levels are only more than for agriculture and hunting. 

“The construction industry has historically been comprised of fragmented project teams which used complex work processes that were executed in siloed systems,” said Karthik Venkatasubramanian, who is the Global Vice President of Data Strategy and Development at Oracle Construction and Engineering. “Given the hands-on nature of construction work, the industry has traditionally relied on human experience and expertise to complete projects, and the potential benefits of adopting technologies were often overshadowed.”

PROMOTED
Yet things are starting to change. One of the biggest catalysts has been the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has meant much more urgency for adopting digital solutions. 

“Venture capital investment continues to flow into the space,” said Lauren Weston, who is an associate at Thomvest Ventures.
But COVID-19 is just one of the factors. Some of the others include the increase in infrastructure investments from governments, the chronic labor shortages, the need for sustainable solutions, and supply-chain disruptions.

Yet traditional software is likely not to be enough. If anything, AI is poised to play a critical role in the transformation of the construction industry.
“AI can compute massive volumes of data that traditional approaches have not been able to previously,” said Vamshi Rachakonda, who is the Vice President and Sales Lead for Manufacturing, Auto and Life Sciences at Capgemini Americas. “This is especially true for processing and mining unstructured data such as photos, videos, and text and converting them to insights and intelligence.”

Another key to AI is that it allows for more proactive approaches. “Most of the current reports and dashboards are being used to focus on ‘what has happened’ or ‘what is happening’ on projects, typically after an event or task has occurred,” said Venkatasubramanian.  “But with AI, you can ask ‘what might happen?’ This can be a total game-changer when done right, as it has the potential to help deliver projects ahead of time, improve profit margins, and reduce risks significantly.”

Innovative AI Startups
An interesting startup that is leveraging the power of AI in construction is OpenSpace. The company has a 360° camera—which attaches to a hardhat—that seamlessly collects data at a job site. The OpenSpace platform then processes the images to create a digital twin of the project, which makes it easier for tracking and collaboration. 
“The company also recently launched a new product called ClearSight that uses AI to overlay images of framing, drywall, paint and more to allow for efficient project progress tracking via machine vision,” said Shawn Carolan, who is a Managing Partner at Menlo Ventures.
Another company that is successfully using AI for construction is Measure Square, which is a leader in measure estimating technology. Its platform manages 40,000 to 50,000 floorplans a month. With this data, its AI system is able to interpret paper-based floorplans and make them interactive. 
“We have two key steps for this,” said Steven Wang, who is the CEO and founder of Measure Square. “First, we use takeoff data from the plans, which helps detect the walls, doorways and so on. Then we have a sophisticated computer vision model to improve the results.”
The Future
Again, AI is still in the early phases when it comes to the construction industry. But given the advances in this technology and the innovative ways to collect data, the prospects look bright for digital transformation.
“AI can help reduce or remove a very real tech barrier when working on one-off, bespoke projects,” said Paul Donnelly, who is the marketing director for engineering, procurement and construction for AspenTech. “By sorting through and leveraging data from previous projects and industry standards, AI can help streamline the tech set up for each new project. This makes the use of newer tech in construction viable compared to when the tech has to be set up manually for each project.”

Over the past two years, the World Economic Forum has been working with a multi-stakeholder group to advance ethics in technology under a project titled Responsible Use of Technology. This group has identified a need to highlight and share best practices in the responsible design, development, deployment and use of technology. To this end, we have embarked on publishing a series of case studies that feature organizations that have made meaningful contributions and progress in technology ethics. Earlier this year, we began this series with a deep dive into Microsoft’s approach to responsible innovation. In the second edition of this series, we focus on IBM’s journey towards ethical AI technology. The insights from this effort are detailed in a report titled Responsible Use of Technology: The IBM Case Study, which is jointly authored by the World Economic Forum and the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. Below are the key lessons learned from our research, along with a brief overview of IBM's historical journey towards ethical technology.1. Trusting your employees to think and act ethicallyWhen Francesca Rossi joined IBM in 2015 with the mandate to work on AI ethics, she convened 40 colleagues to explore this topic. The work of this group of employees set in motion a critical chapter of IBM’s ethical AI technology journey. Image: IBMInitially, the group researched and published a paper titled Learning to trust AI systems, in which the company makes a set of commitments to advance its understanding and to put into effect the ethical development of AI. One of these commitments is to establish an internal 'AI ethics board', to discuss, advise and guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. With the leadership of Dr. Rossi and IBM’s chief privacy officer Christina Montgomery, this board is responsible for governing the company’s technology ethics efforts globally. However, a centralized ethics governance board is insufficient to oversee more than 345,000 employees working in over 175 countries. All employees are being trained in the 'ethics by design' methodology, and it is also a mandate for all of IBM's business units to adopt this methodology. The AI ethics board relies on a group of employees called 'focal points', who have official roles to support their business units on issues related to ethics. There is also a network of employee volunteers called the 'advocacy network', which promote the culture of ethical, responsible, and trustworthy technology. Empowering employees is an important part of making technology ethics work at IBM.  Image: IBM2. Operationalizing values and principles on AI ethicsTo operationalize ethics in an organizational setting, there must first be commitments made to values. To this end, IBM developed a set of 'principles and pillars' to direct its research and business towards supporting key values in AI. Implementation of these principles and pillars led to the development of technical toolkits so that ethics could penetrate to the level of code; IBM Research created five open-source toolkits, freely available to anyone: 1. AI Explainability 360: eight algorithms for making machine learning models more explainable2. AI Fairness 360: a set of 70 fairness metrics and 10 bias-mitigation algorithms3. Adversarial Robustness Toolbox: a large set of tools for overcoming an array of adversarial attacks on machine learning models.4. AI FactSheets 360: to make AI models transparent, factsheets collect data about the model in one place; this includes examples of FactSheets as well as a methodology for creating them.5. Uncertainty Quantification 360: a set of tools to test how reliable AI predictions are, which helps to place boundaries on model confidence.Any organization can make principles or other ethical commitments, but they have to be operationalized to become a reality. These toolkits help IBM fulfill its own ethical commitments, and by making them open-source IBM hopes to help other tech companies, and the machine learning community more broadly. 3. Aiming for broad impact on AI ethicsIBM recognizes that it is not separate from the tech industry or the world. Its actions will affect the reputation of the industry – and vice versa – and, ultimately, the entire tech industry together will affect human society. All this is to say that the stakes are high, so it is worth putting in the effort to get it right. One of the ways that IBM has been attempting to promote the broad positive impact of technology has been through partnerships with educational and research organizations and multistakeholder organizations. Within education, in 2011 IBM launched P-TECH, a programme that promotes career-applicable skill-building for high school students while working with an IBM mentor. Eventually, they can participate in paid summer internships at IBM and enroll in an associate’s degree programme at no cost.At the university level, IBM has several partnerships with schools, such as the Notre Dame - IBM Tech Ethics Lab, to support underrepresented communities in STEM subjects and their teachers, and to improve relevant curricula. By teaming up with research organizations, IBM is helping to train the next generation of technology professionals and creates communications channels, between academia and industry, which include promoting the discussion of ethical concerns from both sides.IBM is a founding member of several multistakeholders organizations, including the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (2017) and the Vatican’s 'Rome Call for AI Ethics' (2020). IBM also works on many World Economic Forum initiatives related to AI ethics, including the Global Future Council on AI for Humanity, the Global AI Council, and the Global AI Action Alliance. Besides these institutional partnerships, individual IBM employees are also involved in the IEEE’s Ethics in Action Initiative, the Future of Life Institute, the AAAI/ACM AI, Ethics, and Society conference, and the ITU AI for Good Global Summit. Have you read?How ethical, inclusive tech can help us create a better world9 ethical AI principles for organizations to followIt’s time to change the debate around AI ethics. Here's howIBM finds it worth its time and money to support these many initiatives for at least three reasons. First, IBM is committed to educating people and society about how technology and AI work. A better-educated society and especially better educated decision-makers are capable of making better decisions regarding the future role of AI in society.Second, IBM wants to gather input from society about the ways AI is affecting the world. In this way, IBM can be more responsive towards the social impact of AI and act more quickly to prevent or react to harms. This helps to make sure that AI is truly delivering on its promise as a beneficial technology.Third, IBM and its employees are committed to developing, deploying and using AI to benefit the world. By making sure that society is educated about AI and that tech companies know about the immediate impacts of AI on society, AI will be more likely to be directed towards good uses.More and more people are taking a longer look at ethics and responsible innovation – and in many cases, they and their organizations are making these ideas an integral part of their corporate culture. All of these efforts contribute to making AI a better – and therefore more trustworthy – technology.Looking aheadAlthough IBM’s size and scale allow it to invest significant resources in these important areas, the lessons learned from IBM’s journey around the ethical use of AI technology are relevant to any organization. As companies evolve and grow, it is unfeasible for leaders to oversee every aspect of their business. Leaders must trust and empower their employees to make ethical decisions. Leaders need to provide the principles, guidelines, training, tools and support that will enable their employees to feel empowered and ready to handle ethical issues. Lastly, the overall purpose of responsible technology is to deliver positive impacts to society. The scale and scope of the impacts will vary by organization, but the goal towards improving the state of society should be consistent. As more organizations share their experiences in adopting ethical technology practices, there is an opportunity to investigate the similarities and differences in their approaches. Over time, there might be ways to measure their successes and failures, while analyzing the paths that led them to such outcomes. This effort is in the hope that more organizations can learn from the experiences of others so that everyone is adopting methods and tools for the responsible use of technology.Don't miss any update on Artificial IntelligenceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

CopyArtificial intelligence is transforming how we design and build. By 2050, the effects of AI adoption will be widely felt across all aspects of our daily lives. As the world faces a number of urgent and complex challenges, from the climate crisis to housing, AI has the potential to make the difference between a dystopian future and a livable one. By looking ahead, we're taking stock of what's happening, and in turn, imagining how AI can shape our lives for the better.+ 6

Save this picture!Courtesy of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)Artificial intelligence is broadly defined as the theory and development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The term is often applied to a machine or system's ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Today, AI already utilizes algorithms to suggest what we should see, read, and listen to, and these systems have extended to everyday tasks like suggested travel routes, autonomous flying, optimized farming, and warehousing and logistic supply chains. Even if we are not aware of it, we are already feeling the effects of AI adoption.As Alex Hern explored at The Guardian, making predictions on the next 30 years is a mug's game. However, the act of following trend-lines to possible conclusions and imagining how we might live is a productive exercise. We're taking a closer look at how artificial intelligence will shape design by 2050. From air taxis and urban intelligence to construction and the Singularity, AI will continue to shape how we live, work and play.The Future of WorkSave this picture!© Iwan BaanAccording to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. These jobs will be lost as ""artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees."" Editorial Data & Content Manager Nicolás Valencia explored this idea two years ago and how automation will affect architects. The conclusion is that the most difficult jobs to replace require a high level of creativity and human interaction, and have a low percentage of repetitive activities. These will be the last to be replaced, but there will also be new jobs created that will become necessary to monitor and coordinate intelligent machines and systems.As we approach a time when the broad intelligence of AI exceeds human levels, existential questions arise. What should you study when any job can be programmed or replaced? Will universal income be adopted as a result? Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes so. “AI is just the latest in technologies that allow us to produce a lot more goods and services with less labor,” says Gates. How we work, and what we can work on, will begin to change at an increasingly faster rate. If half of all work can be done by robots or machines in the next 15 years, it's likely that all work will be shaped by AI before 2050.Urban Intelligence & Big DataSave this picture!© Foster + PartnersAI and the “Internet of Things” are changing how we live, and in turn, society at large. Architect Bettina Zerza has explored how data and intelligent systems will dramatically shape our cities. She gives the example of micro sensors and urban technology that will record air quality, noise pollution and soundscapes, as well as urban infrastructure at large. How people move, where emissions are worst, and how efficient city processes are represent just a few of these ideas. Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a number that will increase to 70% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. Here, AI can further analyze and monitor how we move about the city, work together, and unwind. In 30 years, we will also have entirely new versions of these modalities.TransportationSave this picture!Courtesy of Virgin Hyperloop OneHow we move is already undergoing widespread transformation. Transit is being reimagined on the street and in the air, from public transit transforming to more user-centric mobility services, to rethinking regulatory and organizational structures. Looking at the evolution of transportation, there have been new innovations and shifts in the status quo every 50 to 70 years throughout the last two centuries. From ships and trains to automobiles and airplanes, these advances have changed the way we communicate, trade and connect to one another. Today, there is a lot of talk about the Hyperloop systems, with Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT emerging as the leading teams rethinking transportation. The implications for 2050 are dramatic, where our current ideas and associations of cities, geography and resources will radically change. At the same time, companies like Uber and Volocopter are looking to the sky to design and develop the world's first vertiport and air taxi hubs around the world. Trying to anticipate the future of mobility, the Third Dimension will open up new possibilities for transit.ConstructionSave this picture!© Foster + PartnersConstruction has been one of the most challenging sectors for artificial intelligence. British multinational infrastructure company Balfour Beatty published their predictions for 2050 in their Innovation Paper. The report outlines a series of conclusions: robots will work in teams to build complex structures using dynamic new materials, while elements of a build will self-assemble. Drones flying overhead will scan the site, sending instructions to robotic cranes and diggers and automated builders with no need for human involvement. The result is a human-free construction process, one where the role of the builder moves to “overseer” and they are remotely managing projects.Moreover, if people are still on site before being phased out, they will be using robotically enhanced exoskeletons and neural-control technology to move and control machinery and other robots on site. These movements could eventually address the dangers of construction and make Zero Harm a reality. However, there are deeper ideological changes that come with human-free building. In terms of design and an appreciation for craft, we may begin to lose a “human touch” and the haptic qualities of construction. It is directly tied to the very meaning of tectonics; the science and art of construction, the activity of building, and the resulting details and connections.The SingularitySave this picture!© Dose Media on UnsplashLooking to the future, especially as far as 2050, there is a lot of discussion about the ""singularity"" moment in artificial intelligence. The Singularity is often defined as the point at which exponential technological advancements cross the threshold of “strong AI” and machines possess a broad intelligence that exceeds human levels. There is a very strong chance it will happen by 2050.The singularity also represents a point where human intelligence and AI merge. Human intelligence will undergo an extensive integration with AI, forming a symbiotic relationship where AIs are empowered by human talent for creative and lateral thinking. At the same time, humans could be empowered by AI’s memory and rapid computing. The design implications are, quite definitively, hard to grasp. To put it another way, we may begin to create designs we don't yet have the capacity to imagine.Save this picture!© ICD-ITKE, University of StuttgartArtificial intelligence will continue to inspire discussions on the precarity of work, our shared ethics, ideas like universal basic income and urban intelligence, as well as how we design. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live and how we shape the built environment. By doing so, we can being to imagine new creative and social processes, and hopefully, work with AI to lay the foundation for a better future.",,,,,,,https://www.archdaily.com/937523/how-artificial-intelligence-will-shape-design-by-2050,1304.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of artificial intelligence has been with us since 1955, when a group of researchers first proposed a study of “the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.” At the same time, it seems like not a day goes by without news about some development, making it feel very futuristic.
It’s also the purview of professors from a variety of fields at Fordham, such as Damian Lyons, Ph.D., a professor of computer science, R.P. Raghupathi Ph.D., a professor of information, technology and operations at Gabelli School of Business, and Lauri Goldkind, Ph.D., a professor at the Graduate School of Social Service.

FordhamNotes · The Promise and Peril of AI
Full transcript below:

Patrick Verel: Artificial intelligence is many things to many people, on the one hand, the concept has been with us since 1955 when a group of researchers first proposed a study of, “The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.” At the same time, it seems like there isn’t a day that goes by without news of some new development, making it feel very futuristic. Need to call your pharmacy, a chat bot will answer the call, approaching another car on the highway while in cruise control, don’t worry your car will slow itself down before you plow into it. Just this month, the New York Times reported that an Iranian scientist was assassinated in November by an AI assisted robot with a machine gun.
Damian Lyons
Here at Fordham, Damian Lyons is a professor of computer science on the faculty of arts and sciences. R.P. Raghupathi is a professor of information, technology and operations at the Gabelli School of Business. And Lauri Goldkind is a professor at the Graduate School of Social Service. I’m Patrick Verel, and this is Fordham News. 
Dr. Lyons, you’ve been following this field for 40 years and have witnessed some real ebbs and flows in it, why is this time different?
Damian Lyons: Well, the public perception of artificial intelligence has had some real ebbs and flows over the years. And while it’s true that humanity has been trying to create human-like machines almost since we started telling stories about ourselves, many would trace the official birth of AI as a field, to a workshop that occurred at Dartmouth University in the summer of ’56. And it’s interesting that two of the scientists at that workshop had already developed an AI system that could reason symbolically, something which was supposed to be only doable by humans up until then. And while there was some successes with those efforts, by and large AI did not meet the enthusiastic predictions of its proponents, and that brought on what has often been called the AI winter, when its reputation fell dramatically. In the 70s, things started to rise a little bit again, AI began to focus on what are called strong methods. Those are methods that make use of the main specific information rather than general-purpose information to do the reasoning.
So the domain expertise of a human expert could be embodied in a computer program, and that was called an expert system. For example, the MYCIN expert system was able to diagnose blood infections as well as some experts and much better than most junior physicians. So expert systems became among the first commercially successful AI technologies. The AI logistics software that was used in the 1991 Gulf War in a single application was reported to have paid back all the money that the government spent funding AI up until this point. So once again, AI was in the news and they were riding high, but expert systems again, lost their luster in the public eye because of the narrow application possibilities and AI reputation once again deemed, not as bad as before, but it deemed once again. But in the background coming up to the present date, there were two technology trends that were brewing.
The first was the burgeoning availability of big data via the web and the second was the advent of multi-core technology. So both of these together set the scene for the emergence of the latest round in the development of AI, the so-called deep learning systems. So in 2012, a deep learning system, not only surpassed its competitor programs at the task of image recognition but also surpassed human experts at the task of image recognition. And similar techniques were used to build AI systems to defeat the most experienced human players at games such as Go and chess and to autonomously drive 10 million miles on public roads without serious accidents. So once again, predictions about the implications of AI are sky-high.
PV: Now, of all the recent advances, I understand one of the most significant of them is something called AlphaFold. Can you tell me why is it such a big deal?
DL: AlphaFold in my opinion, is a poster child for the use of AI. So biotechnology addresses issues such as cures for disease, for congenital conditions, and maybe even for aging, I’ve got my fingers crossed for that one. So proteins are molecular chains of amino acids, and they’re an essential tool in biotechnology, in trying to construct cures for diseases, congenital conditions, and so forth. And the 3D shape of a protein is closely related to its function, but it’s exceptionally difficult to predict, the combinatorics in predicting the shape are astronomical. So this problem has occupied human attention as a grand challenge in biology for almost 50 years, and up until now, it requires an extensive trial and error approach to lab work and some very expensive machinery in order to do this prediction of shape. But just this summer Google’s DeepMind produced the AlphaFold 2 AI program, and AlphaFold 2 can predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino acid sequence with higher accuracy, much faster, and obviously much cheaper than experimental methods. This has been held in biology as a stunning breakthrough.
PV: R.P. and Lauri, do you have any thoughts on things that are unsung?
W.P. Raghupathi
R.P. Raghupathi: I would just add medicine is a good example, the whole space of medicine, and like Damian mentioned with the image recognition is one of the most successful in radiology. Where now radiologists are able to spend more time at a high level, looking at exception cases that are unusual as opposed to processing thousands and thousands of images, doing the busywork. So that’s been taken out, with a great deal of success. So Neuralink is another example, I’m just excited that we can hopefully solve some of our brain problems, whether through accidents or Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s with brain implants, chip implants, and that’s terrific progress. I mean, just more recently with drug discovery, extending what Damien said, vaccine development, drug development has accelerated with AI and machine learning. There’s of course, for me, the interest is also just quickly social and public policy and so Lauri will speak to that. I’m just looking at how even being data driven in our decision making in terms of the UN Sustainable Development Goals or poverty elevation or whatever, just looking at the data, analyzing it with AI and deep learning, give us more insight.
Lauri Goldkind: It’s funny R.P. I didn’t know that we were going to go in this direction in particular, but the UN has a research roadmap for a post-COVID world, which hopefully we’ll be in that world soon. But in this research roadmap, it talks a lot about using AI and it also talks about data interoperability and so data sharing at the country level in order to be both meet the sustainable development goals, but also to meet even possibly more pressing need. So pandemic recovery, cities recovering from natural disaster, and it definitely amplifies a need for data interoperability and deploying AI tools for these social good pieces and for using more evidence in policymaking. Because there’s the evidence and there’s advancements and then there’s the policymakers and building a bridge between those two components.
Lauri Goldkind
PV: Dr. Lyons, you mentioned this notion of talking about the advances for science or being a good thing and a positive thing. I know that there are also fears about AI that veer into the existential realm, on thinking of this notion that robots will become self-aware. And I’m gen X so of course, my frame of reference for everything is the Terminator movies and thinking about Skynet, which comes to life and endangers human existence, as we know it. But there’s also this idea within the field that the concept of silos will make that unlikely or not as likely as maybe people think. Can you explain it a little bit about that?
DL: Yeah, sure. That’s a very good point, Patrick. So games like chess and Go and so forth were an early target of AI applications because there’s an assumption there, there’s an assumption that a human who plays chess well must be intelligent and capable of impressive achievement in other avenues of life. As a matter of fact, you might even argue that the reason humans participate in these kind of games is to sharpen their strategic skills that they can then use to their profit and other commercial or military applications. However, when AI addresses chess, it does so by leveraging what I called previously, these strong methods, so they leverage domain expertise in chess. Despite its very impressive strategy at playing Go, the AlphaGo program from DeepMind, can’t automatically apply the same information to other fields. So for example, it couldn’t turn from playing, Go in the morning to running a multinational company effectively in the afternoon, as a human might, we learn skills which we can apply to other domains, that’s not the case with AI.
AI tools are siloed and I think an excellent warning case for all of us is IBM’s Watson. Where is Watson? Watson is a warning for hubris, I think in this regard, it has not remade the fortune of IBM or accomplished any of the great tasks foretold, they’ve tuned down their expectations, I believe in IBM and there are applications for which a technology such as Watson could be well used and profitable, but it was custom built for a quiz show, so it’s not going to do anything else very easily. AI tools and systems are still developed in domain silos, so I don’t believe that the sentient AI scenario is an imminent press. However, the domain-specific AI tools that we have developed could still be misused, so I believe the solution is educating the developers and designers of these systems to understand the social implications of the field. So we can ensure that the systems that are produced are safe and trustworthy and used in the public good.
PV: Dr. Raghupathi, now I know robots long ago replaced a lot of blue-collar jobs, I’m thinking for instance of car assembly lines, now I understand they’re coming for white-collar jobs as well. In 2019, for instance, a major multinational bank announced that as part of the plan to lay off 18,000 workers, it would turn to an army of robots as it were, what has changed?
RP: So I just go back to what Damien mentioned in the beginning. I mean, two trends have impacted organizations and businesses in general. So one is the rapid advances in hardware technologies, both storage as well as speed, so those have enabled us to do more complex and sophisticated things. And number two is the data, which also he mentioned, that all of a sudden corporations have found they’re sitting on mountains of data and they could actually use it with all this computing power. So those two trends confluence together to make it an ideal situation where companies are now using AI and other techniques to automate various processes. It is slow and we have a lot to learn because we don’t know how to handle displacement and layoffs and so on, so companies have started with basic robotic process automation, first automating routine and repetitive tasks. But we also see now more advanced work going on, like in the example you mentioned that banks, trading companies, hedge funds are using automated trading, algorithmic trading, that’s all machine learning and deep learning. So those are replacing traders.
PV: What kind of jobs do you think are going to be the most affected by AI going forward?
RP: Well, all at both ends, we know that the routine, for example, in a hospital admissions process or security checks or insurance crossing, all of those, any data-driven is already automated. And then from the prior examples, now you call your insurance company for good or bad, you’re going to go through this endless loop of automated voice recognition systems. Now the design of those is lacking quite a bit in terms of training them on different accents, they never understand my accent. So I just hit the zero button like five times and then I will have a human at the other end or I would say, blah, blah, blah and the system gets it and really it works.
Then we have now the more advanced, and so the financial trading is an example, but also in healthcare, the diagnosis, the diagnostic decision making like the example that was mentioned, reading MRI images and CT scan images and x-rays, that’s pretty advanced work by radiologists. And now the deep learning systems have taken over and they’re doing an excellent job and then the radiologists are there to supervise, keep an eye on outliers and exceptions for them.
PV: I’m glad to hear that I’m not the only one who, when I get an automated voice on the other end of the line that I just hit zero, just say, “Talk to a person, talk to a person, talk to a person.”
RP: Try blah, blah, blah, it works better, to cut to the chase.
LG: Even in my field in social work, automation, and chat is beginning to take over jobs. And so I’m working with a community partner, that’s using a chatbot as a coach for motivational interviewing, which is an evidence-based practice. And one of the challenges in evidence-based practices is how faithful the worker is to implementing the strategy of the practice. And we’re now seeing, instead of having a human coach to do technical assistance on implementing a particular practice, agencies are turning to chat because it’s efficient. So if I don’t have to pay a human coach, I can train three more workers using this chat strategy. And so we think in these highly professionalized settings that people have job security and job safety versus automation and that’s actually just not the case anymore.
PV: What implications do these advancements have for other countries?
DL: I think there are developed countries and undeveloped countries, one potential advantage that AI holds for the future is in my own area of research, which is the applications of AI and robotics. And that’s the area of what’s called precision agriculture, so the idea being that rather than spraying large areas with pesticides or covering areas with fertilizer, you use AI technology and the embodiment of AI technology in ground robots and robot drones to target specific areas, specific spatial areas. So that if you’ve got pests growing on a particular line of tomato plants or coffee plants, then you can target your pesticide to just those areas. You can even use mechanical means to pull up weeds just as people do rather than flying a plane overhead and spraying all kinds of nasty pesticides and other stuff which ruin the environment.
LG: I was thinking on the more positive side, the use of chat technologies in mental health and whole language processing in mental health and things like avatar therapy, in scenarios where there are no providers, the AI has a real possibility of benefit in order to serve people who might not otherwise be served. And so there’s a growing understanding that depression and social connection and wellbeing are interrelated and are mental health challenges that are certainly related to climate change and future work and all those other pieces. But one way to meet that growing mental health need is to use artificial intelligence to deliver services. And so on the positive side, I think there’s an opportunity to grow AI strategies in mental health.
RP: I think Patrick, some of these implications are not just for developing other countries, but even our country and the developed countries. I mean, take the retraining of the workforce that was alluded to, we don’t have any for even the transfer to clean technologies from the coal mines. I mean, what are those people going to do if we shut down the coal mines? Are we training them in the manufacture and use of advanced energy technologies? And likewise in the last election, there were some talk, Andrew Yang and others have had universal income, a lot of research is going on about it, the cost-benefit analysis, so some kind of safety net, some social policy as we handle this transition to an automated workforce is needed.
LG: I mean, let’s be really clear, the reason that Silicon Valley is interested in a universal basic income is because there’s a dramatic understanding about what the future of employment is going to look like. And as in the US is a global North country and we have a very strong ethos about work and a work identity. And when there are no jobs, it’s going to be really challenging even for traditional middle-class jobs to figure out their role with regard to working alongside AI.
PV: Now, Dr. Goldkind, this summer, you wrote a paper actually, and you said that social work must claim a place in the AI design and development, working to ensure that AI mechanisms are created, imagined and implemented to be congruent with ethical and just practice. Are you worried that your field is not as involved in decisions about AI development as it should be?
LG: I think that we have some catching up to do and I think that we have some deep thinking to do about how we can include content like AI and automated decision making and robotics and generalized intelligence versus specialized intelligence in AI into our curricula. And to Damien’s earlier point, I think that the same way that our engineering students should be trained with an ethical lens or minimally, a lens on who might be an end user of some of these tools and what those implications might be, that social work students and prospective social work professionals should also have a similar understanding of the consequences of AI use and AI mechanisms. And so I think that there’s a lot of room for growth in my discipline to catch up and to also be partners in how these systems are developed. Because social work is bringing this particular lens of an ecosystem model and a person in an environment approach and a respect for human dignity.
And by no means suggesting that a business student or a computer science student is not as un-respective of human dignity, but in social work, we have a set of core values that folks are opting into. And we are not, I think, preparing students to be critical about these issues and think deeply about the implications of when they’re seeing a client who’s been accessed by an AI or a robot, what are the tools and strategies we might use to help that person be synthesized back into their community in a way that’s meaningful, on one hand. And on the other hand in the AI world, there’s a huge conversation about fairness, accountability, and transparency, and ethics in AI, and social work has a code of ethics and has a long history of applying those codes. And so could be a real value add to the design and development process.
PV: Yeah. I feel like when we talked before this, you mentioned this idea of having graduates getting used to this idea of working alongside AI, not necessarily being replaced by it. Can you talk a little bit about that?
LG: Sure. I think the idea about AI augmentation rather than AI automation is whereas these pieces are evolving is where it seems to be headed. And I think it would be useful for us as social work educators to think about how are we helping our students become comfortable with an augmented practice that uses an AI in a positive light? And so, for example, in diagnosis, in the mental health world, AI can make a more accurate assessment than a human can, because the AI is built as to our peace point earlier about radiology, the AI is trained to do this one specific thing. And so similarly in mental health, it would be great if we were teaching students about how these tools can be deployed so they can work on higher-order decision making or alternative planning and strategies and use the AI in a complementary fashion as opposed to being just completely automated.
PV: I think about jobs, so much of this conversation revolves around jobs and oh, I’m going to lose my job to a robot. And in your field, it seems like that is never going to be the case because there’s such a huge demand for mental health services, that there’s no way the robots can physically replace all the people.
RP: Social services can be delivered, again, more effectively with now the AI, the technologies, but also the data-driven approaches. I mean, every agency is swamped with cases and workloads, sometimes it’s taking years to resolve whether it’s placing a child in a foster home or whatever. So I think these technologies will help process the data faster and more effectively and give that information, the insight to the counselors, to the managers, to the caseworkers. And so they could spend more time dealing with the high-level issues than with paper pushing or processing data, so there is really great benefit over there, again, to at least automate some of the routine and repetitive parts.
LG: Oh, absolutely. And also in terms of automated decision making and even operations research and bringing some of those strategies from predictive analytics and exploratory data analysis into mental health providers, or community health providers and other providers of human services. Where we could deploy resources in a really strategic way that the agencies don’t have the capacity to do in human decision making and AI or a good algorithm can make really efficient use of this data that people are already collecting.
DL: I just want to chime in on that. That’s such an interesting discussion and I guess I feel a little out of place because I’m going to say something I normally don’t say, which is that now you’re making me very worried about the application of AI. So we already know that there are lots of issues in the way people develop AI systems, engineers or computer scientists developing the systems don’t always take a great deal of care to ensure that their data is necessarily well-curated or represented from a public good perspective. But now if we’re going to use those systems to help to counsel, to interact with vulnerable humans, then there’s a tremendous opportunity for misuse, corruption, accidental mistake. So I’m a little worried. I think we have to be really careful if we do something like that, and I’m not saying that there isn’t an opportunity there, but I’m saying that that’s a case where the implications of the use of AI are pretty dramatic even with the current state of AI. So we probably want to be very careful how we do that.
LG: In a perfect world, I would have my social work students cross-trained with your CS students, because I do think that there’s a real value to having those interdisciplinary conversations where people become aware of unintended consequences, or possible biases that can be embedded in data and what that means for a particular application. But I also want to just note that the same way the universal basic income has been discussed as a bomb for future work type issues, predictive analytics, and automated decision making is in place in social services. And so it’s being used and not even tested, but really used in triaging cases in child welfare, as one could imagine, not without controversy. Allegheny County is probably the most developed county there in Pennsylvania, who’ve deployed automated decision-making to help triage cases of child welfare abuse and neglect. And it’s really another case of decision-making to support human workers, not supplanting human workers.
PV: Have any specific innovations in the field made you optimistic?
DL: Can you define what you mean by optimistic? So for example, if sentient AI was developed tomorrow, I’d be over the moon, I would think this would be great, but I would think that other people would say that this was the worst thing that could happen. So maybe you need to be a little more specific about what optimism means in this case.
PV: I guess the way I’m thinking about it is, when you think about the advances that we’ve made so far, and you see where things are going, in general, what do you feel is going to be the most positive thing we’ll be seeing?
RP: Medicine is I think one area, I mean, just so fascinating, the fact that we can give back people some of their lives in terms of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s as a result of wars and strokes. And then combined with what Damien said about the biological aspect, decoding proteins, et cetera, it’s just, so drug discovery of solving health and medical problems, I think is one area, it’s just outstanding and then stunning, I would continue to follow that one.
LG: I also think in robotics specifically, which is underneath the broad umbrella of AI, there’s some real advances in caregiving. And I think that that has broad application as we’re an aging society and not just in the US, but internationally with not enough caregivers to offer support and daily living skills and daily living support to older adults in facilities and out, and keeping people in their homes. There’s so many advances to support independent living for older persons that will be automated, from caregiving robots, to smart homes and internet of things advances, that use the big data we’ve been talking about to help support somebody be independent in a community. And I think that those pieces show significant promise in a way that humans won’t be able to catch up fast enough.
RP: I must add to that. I mean, I’ve been following the remote monitoring of senior citizens experiments done in various countries. We are a little behind, but Japan has been just so way ahead, 20 years ahead, that once a picture of this wonderful old lady, 85 years old sitting in a bathing machine, like a washing machine, and she was going through all the cycles and the article stopped it when she got into the spin cycle, you probably need an attendant to switch it off.
DL: One of the things that does make me feel good about the progress of AI in societies, that there’s been already attention to understanding the restrictions that need to be placed in AI. For example, winding back to one of the very first examples you gave in this talk, Patrick, lethal autonomous weapons. So there’s been a number of attempts and conferences and meetings to understand how we’re going to deal with this issue of legal autonomous weapons. There have been organizations such as the Future of Life and its objective is to understand how technologies such as AI, which present an existential threat to human lives could be dealt with and could be used effectively, but constrained enough, and early enough, constrained early enough, that it was useful.
So with AI, I think we’re at that point, we can talk about trying to get folks to sign on to a lethal autonomous weapons pledge, which the Future of Life organization is trying to do. Or at least understand what the issues involved are and ensure that everybody understands that now before the lethal autonomous weapons are really at a serious stage, where we can no longer control the genie, it’s out of the bottle at that point. So that’s something that makes me feel optimistic.

While the COVID pandemic response added urgency to the development of agencies’ IT and AI capabilities, these technologies are rooted in agencies’ long-term IT and R&D strategic plans.The Federal Artificial Intelligence Landscape, 2022 report, produced by Deltek’s Federal Market Analysis team, examines the major budgetary, policy, acquisition and workforce issues influencing federal AI priorities. That research has found that as government mission requirements grow, federal agencies are seeking ways to maximize the use of the vast data sets they collect and store.Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have emerged as key solutions enabling agencies to improve mission effectiveness, stretch workforce capacity, combat waste, fraud and abuse and drive operational efficiencies. The maturation of AI technology, a growing list of AI use cases and applications and the growth in commercial solutions, have all contributed to pushing AI beyond the R&D work at scientific agencies such as NASA and the Department of Energy to a broader pool of agencies.The convergence of mission requirements, legislation, policy and technology advances is driving federal agencies to explore AI and machine learning capabilities as data volume and mission complexity grow. Barriers to the broader deployment of AI technology still remain, such as questions about transparency, ethics and responsible AI. But trust and understanding in the technology is steadily beginning to increase, as shown by the growth in AI investment across federal government agencies.Here are three key findings from Deltek’s most recent artificial intelligence research:Federal AI spending is accelerating. Identifiable federal spending on artificial intelligence rose to nearly $1 billion in FY 2020, up 50 percent from FY 2018, making it one of the fastest growing emerging technology investment areas.The presence of small businesses is growing. Although federal customers spend more with large businesses, AI-related small business obligations grew 177 percent from $129 million in FY 2018 to $357 million in FY 2020.Legislation and policy are driving a focus on AI. Legislation and executive branch policies are key drivers of federal artificial intelligence investment. Recognizing the need for U.S. competitiveness in AI, Congress, the White House and agencies have all developed directives to encourage the implementation of AI and machine learning capabilities.On the whole, AI technologies hold a great deal of potential to transform industries such as national security, agriculture, transportation and healthcare, and they could also create an improvement in overall government operations.

The last in order of time, is a publication, edited by the Department of Science and Technology (S&T) of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), relative to the “Strategic Plan for Artificial Intelligence and Automatic Learning”.The purpose of the August work is, in the words of Under Secretary for Science and Technology, Kathryn Coulter Mitchell, to be proactive because: ‘Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary capability that offers substantial opportunities for DHS to more efficiently and effectively achieve our mission of protecting the homeland. Effective implementation will also require significant expertise, coordinated research and development, and targeted investment.”In fact, this Plan outlines three primary objectives, with related declinations:GOAL 1: Promote next-generation AI/ML technologies for cross-cutting internal security functionalitiesThree further objectives have been identified here, which run through:- Advance Trustworthy AI (interdisciplinary effort to research and provide actionable solutions for issues such as explainable AI, privacy protection, countering bias/bias and countering machine learning in hostile environments),- Advance Human Machine Teaming (optimising human-machine interactions by limiting their weaknesses) and- Leverage AI/ML for Secure Cyberinfrastructure (search for capabilities enabling data sharing and processing across systems, effective management of AI/ML models and AI/ML capabilities enabling threat detection and response).GOAL 2: Facilitate the use of proven AI/ML capabilities in homeland security missions, including by advancing capabilities that can be used by non-specialists to curate and process large data sets.GOAL 3: Build an interdisciplinary AI/ML-trained workforce by recruiting experts and training current personnel to improve AI/ML proficiency throughout the domestic workforce to more effectively achieve S&T missions.But what would be the missions of the Department of Homeland Security? They include, for example, managing cyber and physical risks to critical infrastructure, protecting US borders while facilitating legitimate trade and travel, preventing and investigating criminal activity, and responding to natural and man-made disasters.Created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Department’s S&T mission is to “safeguard the nation by responding to tomorrow’s threats and today’s needs through science, technology, and innovation.”The S&T AI/ML Strategy Working Group, led by the Technology Centers Division and including a matrix of members from across S&T, met in the summer of 2020 to identify and define key areas of research and development activity that will serve to inform, educate, and improve the program areas and Department activities impacted by this disruptive technology. This group responds to the principles set forth in Executive Order 13859 “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” (February 11, 2019) and Executive Order 13960 “Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government” (December 3, 2020), and ultimately in the National Institute of Science and Technology’s U.S. Leadership in AI Report: Plan for Federal Engagement in the Development of Technical Standards and Related Tools (August 9, 2019). In addition, S&T acts in accordance with the Artificial Intelligence Principle advanced by member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and adopted by the G20.The December 2020 strategy set five primary objectives / GOALS:(i) Assess the potential of AI in the homeland security enterprise;(ii) Invest in DHS AI capabilities;(iii) Mitigate AI risks to DHS and the United States as a whole;(iv) develop a DHS AI workforce; and(v) improve public trust and engagement.accompanied by three other goals to be achieved:(1) Promote next-generation AI/ML technologies for cross-cutting homeland security capabilities;(2) Facilitate the use of proven AI/ML capabilities in DHS missions; and(3) create an interdisciplinary workforce with AI/ML training.The first declination of GOAL 1, noted above, focuses on Advancing Trustworthy AI, a broad area of research that examines how to ensure trust in AI/ML systems. This research area is crucial for multiple reasons:- To enable DHS leaders and managers to effectively assess the performance of AI/ML systems against both technical and mission metrics, as well as to meet applicable legal and policy requirements;- Provide critical decision-makers with an appropriate level of confidence and trust in any AI/ML systems embedded in their mission; and- Inspire public confidence in AI/ML systems implemented by DHS.“Effective use of AI/ML requires understandable and meaningful explanations of how the systems work for DHS stakeholders, including oversight stakeholders. This requires technical research on how to effectively control an AI/ML system to understand how it arrived at its results. It also requires research into how humans understand and interpret explanations. This includes ensuring that the technical audit incorporates social, behavioural and ethical considerations, as well as legal, policy and privacy requirements.”Second declination is advanced human-machine collaboration, conducting research on how humans and AI/ML can work together more effectively to perform their assigned missions, through the fusion of technical research with social sciences, and optimising the human-in-the-Loop architecture.The last declination is fundamental as it relates to the exploitation of AI/ML for secure computing infrastructure, by continuously updating detection and defence systems and increasing the speed of reaction and response to threats, aiming at real-time reaction.The results, which will be indicative of progress in the DHS, will be through the curation and optimisation of collected data, security mechanisms that mitigate reverse engineering, as well as shifting human attention towards cognitively engaging tasks, delegating purely mechanical tasks to AI systems, freeing humans and directing them towards tasks requiring the comfort of judgement!In GOAL 3, related to building an interdisciplinary workforce, care will be taken to activate through an expansion of DHS fellowship programmes, which promote the development of AI/ML talent by offering faculty, PhDs, graduate students, and undergraduate students direct exposure to unique homeland security challenges.The need for the United States to “catch up”, or at least not lose international technological leadership, through studies and initiatives such as this one seems very evident. This will be followed by a subsequent S&T AI/ML implementation plan, which will describe, in detail, how this strategic plan will be made operational, which you can find at the following link.https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0730_st_ai_ml_strategic_plan_2021.pdfAll Rights ReservedRaffaella Aghemo, Lawyer",,,Recent Strategic Plan on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by the US Department of Homeland Security,,,['Raffaella Aghemo'],https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/recent-strategic-plan-on-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-by-the-us-department-of-835065b56e6a,,,,,,2021-09-30T08:17:24.742Z,835065b56e6a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world runs on data, and humans alone could never monitor or safeguard all of it. 
When applied thoughtfully, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced cybersecurity can add essential layers of protection for modern enterprise networks. 
AI in cybersecurity today
Research firm Technavio expects the AI-based cybersecurity market to grow by $19 billion from 2021 to 2025. The company cites the increased complexity of enterprise networking environments, which often include a mix of legacy, on-premises infrastructure, and cloud resources, all of which need to be accessed remotely. AI approaches add efficiency and accuracy and reduce the impact of the ongoing worker shortage in this field. 
As organizations have become more comfortable with autonomous applications that help streamline workflows and reduce human error, it’s only natural that we would see more AI in cybersecurity adoption as well. These five trends in cybersecurity underscore the overall shift toward AI business applications across many fields:
5 trends: AI in cybersecurity
1. AI will reduce burden of cybersecurity worker shortage
As workers around the world were sent home from their offices to work remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals were already lying in wait, ready to exploit vulnerabilities widened by the mass influx of unsecure network connections. Those same tactics have played out across the SecOps field, which has been dealing with a significant skilled worker shortage for several years. 
(ISC)2 estimates the cybersecurity market is in need of about 3 million qualified workers, according to its 2020 Cybersecurity Workforce report. Additionally, the report shows 64% of the cybersecurity professionals surveyed said their organization is impacted by the cybersecurity skills shortage. 
When SecOps teams are lacking in staffing, vulnerabilities naturally increase. No human could keep up with every viable threat, as cybercriminals know. 
AI is playing a role in these situations. Sophisticated AI-driven algorithms can recognize patterns of attacks, suspicious email activity, and identify the most vulnerable network endpoints. AI can also tackle repetitive, error-prone tasks, like data labeling, and generate automated reports for human analyst review. All of these features will help to reduce SecOps teams’ bandwidth, so team members can focus on other security functions. 
2. AI will automate identity and access management security measures
Identity and access management (IAM) is becoming more important than ever with the increased adoption of zero-trust security frameworks, which require every network user to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated. 
AI can greatly reduce the amount of manual labor required to carry out these goals by introducing smart automation into security systems. AI can monitor and analyze user activities, including typing and mouse movements. It can also power supervised algorithms and unsupervised learning, both of which help SecOps teams identify anomalous behavior. 
AI can improve security across the customer authentication experience as well, from the point of account creation and login to interacting with service accounts. AI monitoring of these activities helps organizations to assign risk scores related to potentially suspicious events, instead of simply locking users out or terminating their connections mid-session. This more nuanced approach improves efficiency and helps analysts zero in on genuine threats.

3. AI will improve blockchain
Blockchain adoption has been increasing dramatically, as cryptocurrencies have become more widely understood. Grandview Research values the global blockchain technology market size at around $3.67 billion in 2020 and expects that figure to skyrocket, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 82.4% from 2021 to 2028.
Bitcoin and other crypto coins are built on blockchain solutions that keep transactions secure and decentralized. Blockchain is also used within the medical field to better secure and monitor access to electronic records. 
Advances in AI-powered blockchain have reduced the need for time-consuming secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) “handshake” methods that involve verification keys. Instead, newer systems can analyze data chains in bulk using high-powered AI, which is a much faster and far more secure process overall.   
4. AI will enhance regulatory compliance efforts
AI can apply regulatory rules and requirements to data across complex networks, which is a quicker, more foolproof compliance method versus manual search processes.
AI-based data processing will be critical as over 300 million new regulations are expected over the next decade, according to LogicGate.
Enterprises can use AI to track regulatory agencies worldwide to help monitor and maintain ongoing compliance, as rules change and new rules are adopted, LogicGate says.
Regulatory compliance enhanced with AI is a smart investment, considering the financial ramifications of being found out of compliance with broad data laws, like GDPR and HIPAA.
5. AI will improve cloud network security
As more organizations move portions of their data to the cloud, cybersecurity has become more complex. Many legacy systems are incapable of monitoring cloud data, but newer AI-enhanced cybersecurity is specifically designed for the cloud. 
Hybrid cybersecurity solutions involving AI that are able to monitor and analyze data across multiple environments will become a must. Many organizations have been getting by with an ad hoc approach, where enterprise data is pulled from various architectures, compiled, and then analyzed by a software platform. Not only are these approaches complicated and expensive, they are also prone to missing important data.

The National Gallery’s Prized Peter Paul Rubens Painting Is Actually a Fake, New Artificial Intelligence Testing Has Found
Some critics have questioned the painting's authorship for decades.

A series of tests using artificial intelligence have found that the Peter Paul Rubens masterpiece Samson and Delilah (ca. 1609/10) at the National Gallery in London is most likely a fake.
After comparing the work against 148 uncontested Rubens paintings, the algorithm came to the “astonishing” conclusion that there was a 91 percent chance that the it was inauthentic.
The A.I. was powered by a “convolutional neural network” that analyzed brushstroke patterns and other aspects of Rubens’s known work and compared them to the National Gallery painting, the authorship of which has long been the subject of controversy.
“I was so shocked,” Carina Popovici, a scientist who cofounded the Swiss firm Art Recognition, which conducted the study, told the Guardian. “We repeated the experiments to be really sure that we were not making a mistake, and the result was always the same. Every patch, every single square, came out as fake, with more than 90 percent probability.”
The result lends credence to scholars who have doubted the work’s authenticity since the institution acquired it for £2.5 million ($5.4 million) in 1980. At the time, it was the third-most expensive work of art ever sold, according to the New York Times.
Frans Francken the Younger, Supper at the House of Burgomaster Rockox (ca. 1630–1635). The painting shows Peter Paul Rubens’s Samson and Delilah. Because Francken included Samson’s full foot, some people believe that the National Gallery in London’s painting of the same name, which crops out his toes, must be a copy. Collection of the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, Germany.
But the painting crops Samson’s toes—which appear in full in two 17th-century copies, a Jacob Matham engraving and a Frans Francken the Younger painting that shows the work on display in the home of its original owner. Detractors claim the truncated composition in the National Gallery picture proves the work to be a copy of a lost original.
Concerns about the work made headlines in 2005, when the National Gallery staged a blockbuster survey of the artist’s work, “Rubens: A Master in the Making.” (The show omitted both contemporary copies of the painting.)
“When I first saw the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah in 1987, immediately I thought it could not have been painted by Rubens and I supposed that it was a copy—a 20th century copy,” artist and independent scholar Euphrosyne Doxiadis told Spiegel International at the time. (She had submitted a report with her concerns to the museum in 1992, and still maintains an entire website dedicated to debunking the picture.)
Samson and Delilah skeptics also question the painting’s quality, as well as its style and color palette—though the museum claims the work represents a period of experimentation for Rubens. His best-known work from the same period, The Raising of the Cross, bears the more-familiar hallmarks of his style.
Peter Paul Rubens, The Raising of the Cross (ca. 1610/11). Collection of Onze Lieve Vrouwe-Kerk, Antwerp.
Even more damning is the painting’s provenance from the 20th century. A city official in Antwerp named Nicolaas Rockox was said to have commissioned the painting around 1609, after Rubens returned to the country following an eight-year stint in Italy. It disappeared following Rockox’s death in 1640.
When the work resurfaced in Paris in 1929, it was attributed to Gerrit van Honthorst. Then, Ludwig Burchard, an expert on Rubens, signed a certificate of authenticity attesting to his authorship. When Burchard died in 1960, it came to light that he had falsely authenticated work for his own commercial benefit.
“Over 60 Burchard Rubens attributions… ha[ve] subsequently been demoted in the Corpus Rubenianum itself,” according to ArtWatch UK, which has been following the Samson and Delilah saga for years.
Despite the controversy, the National Gallery continues to stand behind the work, and still features it as one of the 30 highlights in the museum’s collection.
“The gallery always takes note of new research,” the museum told the Guardian. “We await its publication in full so that any evidence can be properly assessed. Until such time, it will not be possible to comment further.”
Another Rubens work in the museum collection, A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning, fared better under the A.I. analysis, which found there was a 98.8 percent chance it was actually done by the artist.

Expo 2020 Dubai, postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic and set to open Friday, is expected to attract 25 million guests from around the world, and is a prototype for smart cities — communities that make use of IoT (internet of things) and other emerging technology such as AI and NLP (natural language processing) to enhance services such as energy, transportation and utilities.
The expo opens at a time when a broad range of enterprises and public administrations are deploying IoT and AI applications. The value of economic activity in AI, for example, is expected to grow 20% to 34% per year across the Middle East through the decade, with the fastest growth in UAE, followed by Saudi Arabia, according to a PWC report.
Accenture, one of the official technology partners of the Expo, was given the job of  building integrated AI systems for Expo teams, country pavilions, vendors and suppliers. “These intelligent systems support various Expo teams from employee to participants and from visitors to partners,” Accenture’s Managing Director and Expo 2020 Client Account Lead Angelo Lorusso said.











 
 
 
The Participant Portal, developed for Expo, is a one-stop shop for the more than 190 participating countries and partners to submit their pavilion designs, themes and content on an interactive platform that integrates authorizations, supply chain management and workforce licensing functions. The platform is based on a private cloud provided by UAE-based telecom operator Etisalat.

Accenture also developed the Services Delivery Platform, which integrates data from more than 80 different applications, including third-party solutions and government authorities. 
Leveraging AI, NLP for personalization

While many of the platforms address the needs of organizers and enterprises, Accenture has developed several visitor-facing digital platforms as well, including the Expo’s official mobile app, virtual assistant, and website. 











 
 
 
“The suite of digital channels leveraged AI, NLP and analytics, to ensure an accessible and relevant experience for all,” Lorusso said. 
All these emerging technologies were utilized in Amal, an AI-based digital assistant developed by Accenture and Smart Dubai, the Dubai government’s smart city initiative. The virtual assistant will gather information on shows and attractions and give feedback throughout the six months of the Expo. 
For Amal, Accenture has leveraged the Smart Dubai Government platform (Rashid) based on IBM Watson technology. 











 
 
 
“The main objective of leveraging this robust AI platform was to capitalize on the investment done at a government level for other virtual agent platforms already in use from other government entities,” an Accenture spokesperson said.

Ask




Amal, which will analyze volumes of information to answer visitors’ questions, has been designed to learn and improve responses through natural language processing. Accenture said it had “heavily trained” the AI NLP model on multiple interactions and conversations and on many topics. 
NLP — the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software — is a potentially huge area of growth for technology enterprises, particularly in the healthcare sector. The global market for the technology was valued at $10.72 billion in 2020, and is expected to be worth $48.46 billion by 2026, according to a Mordor Intelligence report.











 
 
 
Multicloud, 5G infrastructure hosts services

Accenture has been working alongside Etisalat Digital, a unit of the telecom operator, on the digital initiatives. Both companies were picked as joint ‘Premier Digital Services Partners’ in 2017 to develop the infrastructure required to make the Expo site ‘smart’.
Etisalat, which has deployed a 5G network in the Expo area, is also managing the event’s multicloud hosting infrastructure through its digital solutions arm (Etisalat Digital). Smart services and solutions have been deployed across the site to facilitate site operations and security through CCTV cameras with live feeds over the 5G network.
With the pandemic raging on, Accenture had to figure out a way to continue working on Expo projects. “Our entire team worked remotely, and we established new ways of working with Expo 2020 stakeholders to ensure business continuity,” Lorusso said.











 
 
 
The company clarified that the ‘new ways of working’ included adopting a hybrid work model, going to a client’s site or even working from home.
Remote working has become extremely popular in the wake of the pandemic. A recent Michael Page survey showed that more than 60 percent of UAE’s workforce would like to have the possibility of working remotely full time; In Abu Dhabi, that percentage is a high 70 percent, but also in Dubai (63%) and the other emirates (60%) where a vast majority of people would like to have the choice to work full time from home.
Expo is proving ground for IoT
MindSphere, a cloud-based IoT operating system from Siemens that stores operational data from connected devices, plays a big role in connecting devices and services throughout Expo. Mindshpere is a platform as a service (PaaS), on which IT managers can run analytics and other applications. For developers, it offers open APIs and development tools.











 
 
 
The IoT network will help to connect 137 buildings, and play a part in the operation of applications designed to maximize show-goer comfort and building energy performance. For example, Navigator is a cloud-based energy and systems performance platform that integrates data and analytics to control energy systems performance.
Expo 2020 is, in a sense, a prototype for smart cities – communities that make use of IT and operational technology such as IoT to optimize energy, transportation and utility services. For Expo 2020 show-goers, a trip to the Dubai fair will offer a glimpse into the future of cities around the world.

Video editing software is one example of a shift. When it comes to operating simple applications like video editing software, AI technology is starting to engage and even replace workers in some situations. The fundamental notion is that AI will learn from its mistakes and make more precise choices than a human ever could. For individuals who rely on their employment as video editors, this may seem frightening, but there are still numerous ways humans can help in the management that cannot be handled by an algorithm just yet..What is AI Video Editing?.AI video editing is a technique that will make novices and those who have never used video editing software more compatible with the industry's major guns..It promises to solve all of your issues and provide you with immediate pleasure without you having to bother about finding music or other tools! That's right, you'll never have to worry about exporting or uploading anything to the internet again..AI in Video Editing.Even if most people aren't aware of it, AI algorithms are behind most of today's most amazing YouTube videos. A unique piece of software built by Alphabet's AI-focused Jigsaw group is meant to automatically modify YouTube videos so that they are understandable to people from diverse areas..The program gathers information about who could be watching the movie and which portions, such as references or labels, they might not comprehend. It can then rearrange visual content to offer more context for people who are unfamiliar with the language or who originate from cultures other than the original speakers..Benefits of Using AI in Video Editing.AI can assist you in determining the optimal angles, shots, and edits.It may also help you apply filters and transitions to your movies.To utilize AI's editing tools, you don't need to know how to edit video.AI editing is more effective than human editing since it organizes your footage for you.AI may learn from your videos and make adjustments based on what it has learned.With AI's help, video editing gets faster and more efficient.In a shorter length of time, you'll be able to edit more film.It's simple to use and will take care of the majority of the work for you.AI may make a video more interesting by proposing changes that the user may not have considered.Colour correction and scene identification are automated, resulting in a better visual experience.Face detection in films aids in the creation of tailored messages.AI can edit videos more quickly than humans.Video editing may be sped up with artificial intelligence.AI can make a clip more engaging and interesting to watch by editing it. AI is less expensive than employing an editor, so you save money over the long term.AI can assist you in locating the most appropriate video clips and pictures for your film..Automatically Curating Video Footage.In 2016, IBM utilized its Watson supercomputer to curate material and produce a trailer for the horror-thriller Morgan, which was one of the first uses of AI in video editing. Watson essentially utilized machine learning to evaluate prior trailers, then used what it learned to curate and choose sequences from the movie that it thought would be appropriate for the trailer..That presentation demonstrated the influence AI might have on video content curation. A human editor would typically spend hours, days, or even weeks watching and curating all of the video material, but an AI might do it in a fraction of the time depending on specified characteristics. The human editor may then concentrate on creating the final film using the AI-curated clips..Since then, AI has been increasingly employed to assist with video curation. In certain situations, such as Google Clips, where the AI picks short and fascinating clips to shoot on its own and progressively learns and improves its decisions depending on how the user reacts to the clips it generates, it may even work fully on its own..More Intelligent and Automated Tools.Video curation isn't the only aspect of editing that may benefit from AI's automation; there is a slew of other tools that might benefit from AI in the same way..Because AI can 'interpret' films, it may be used in almost any type of editing tool, from color calibration to object elimination, visual effects, picture stabilization, and much more. Many of the technologies now used in these jobs seek to evaluate films using sophisticated algorithms, which AI might ultimately replace..Many platforms, like Adobe's Sensei platform, are already beginning to offer more intelligent AI-assisted editing capabilities. Other editors are beginning to implement their own AI solutions..In the not-too-distant future, it's predicted that more smart video editing tools will emerge, utilizing AI to understand and give recommendations for video editing. Video editing should be a lot easier for newbies with such tools, while more expert users will be able to reduce their effort significantly by having AI perform much of the heavy work..The Future of Fully Automated Video Editors.As you may have seen, while AI is revolutionizing video editing, it is only doing it as a tool to aid and support a human editor. Automatic video editing ignores your preferences and the topic of your video clips, whereas a video editing service cuts material to your specifications. The truth is that, while AI may be able to totally automated video editing, it is still a far way from being able to do it successfully..For the time being, consider AI as a useful tool that may help you simplify video editing and cut down on the time it takes to do it. Given that AI and machine learning are still in their infancy, it's impossible to predict what they'll become..Conclusion.Artificial intelligence is reshaping the video editing environment, and now is the moment for organizations to seize the opportunity. For decades, Hollywood has employed AI-driven technology in its films. Nonetheless, any business that wants to make compelling films with amazing images may now make use of this game-changing invention. How do you feel about artificial intelligence?

The applicants should have a strong grasp of statistics, NLP, applied mathematics, and analytics. The pay scale of an AI engineer is quite good due to the role's surging demands..Data Scientist.Data scientists assist in gathering relevant data from multiple sources to assess it to gain constructive inferences. The inferences gained are influential in tackling various issues concerned with the business. Depending upon different data patterns, past and present information, data scientists make various predictions. The performance of the business is positively impacted due to a data scientist..Robotics Scientist.A reduction in jobs will indeed take place due to the emergence of robotics in the field of AI. Conversely, jobs will also rise as robotics scientists are incessant demands by major industries for programming their machines. The robots will help in carrying out certain tasks efficiently..Software Developer.A Software developer is generally responsible for the development, design, and implementation of new or modified software products or ongoing business projects. Typically sitting within the IT team of a business, being a software developer, you will be involved in liaising with the business analysts and development managers to ensure software projects meet requirements..Computer Forensics.Computer forensics exists at the intersection of law and computer science. Computer forensics, also called data or digital forensics, deals with the recovery and analysis of digital evidence recovered from computers, networks, and digital storage devices. You might work in a crime lab, law enforcement department, or other public agency, or as a private contractor..Information Security Analyst.As an information security analyst, you will design and implement IT security systems to protect the organization's computer networks from cyber-attacks.

According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, its impact will be even greater than that of fire or electricity on our development as a species. This may seem like a very ambitious claim, but considering it is already being used to help us tackle climate change, explore space, and develop treatments for cancer, the potential is clearly there.
The 7 Biggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trends In 2022Adobe Stock

The full scale of the impact that giving machines the ability to make decisions – and therefore enable decision-making to take place far more quickly and accurately than could ever be done by humans – is very difficult to conceive right now. But one thing we can be certain of is that in 2022 breakthroughs and new developments will continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Here’s my pick of the key areas and fields where those breakthroughs will occur in 2022:

The augmented workforce 

There have always been fears that machines or robots will replace human workers and maybe even make some roles redundant. However, as companies navigate the process of creating data and AI-literate cultures within their teams, we will increasingly find ourselves working with or alongside machines that use smart and cognitive functionality to boost our own abilities and skills. In some functions, such as marketing, we’re already used to using tools that help us determine which leads are worth pursuing and what value we can expect from potential customers. In engineering roles, AI tools help us by providing predictive maintenance – letting us know ahead of time when machines will need servicing or repairing. In knowledge industries, such as law, we will increasingly use tools that help us sort through the ever-growing amount of data that's available to find the nuggets of information that we need for a particular task. In just about every occupation, smart tools and services are emerging that can help us do our jobs more efficiently, and in 2022 more of us will find that they are a part of our everyday working lives.

PROMOTED
Bigger and better language modeling
Language modeling is a process that allows machines to understand and communicate with us in language we understand – or even take natural human languages and turn them into computer code that can run programs and applications. We have recently seen the release of GPT-3 by OpenAI, the most advanced (and largest) language model ever created, consisting of around 175 billion “parameters”- variables and datapoints that machines can use to process language. OpenAI is known to be working on a successor, GPT-4, that will be even more powerful. Although details haven’t been confirmed, some estimate that it may contain up to 100 trillion parameters, making it 500 times larger than GPT-3, and in theory taking a big step closer to being able to create language and hold conversations that are indistinguishable from those of a human. It will also become much better at creating computer code.
AI in cybersecurity 
This year the World Economic Forum identified cybercrime as potentially posing a more significant risk to society than terrorism. As machines take over more of our lives, hacking and cybercrime inevitably become more of a problem, as every connected device you add to a network is inevitably a potential point-of-failure that an attacker could use against you. As networks of connected devices become more complex, identifying those points of failure becomes more complex. This is where AI can play a role, though. By analyzing network traffic and learning to recognize patterns that suggest nefarious intentions, smart algorithms are increasingly playing a role in keeping us safe from 21st-century crime. Some of the most significant applications of AI that we will see develop in 2022 are likely to be in this area.

AI and the Metaverse
The metaverse is the name given for a unified persistent digital environment, where users can work and play together. It’s a virtual world, like the internet, but with the emphasis on enabling immersive experiences, often created by the users themselves. The concept has become a hot topic since Mark Zuckerberg spoke about creating it by combing virtual reality technology with the social foundations of his Facebook platform.

AI will undoubtedly be a lynchpin of the metaverse. It will help to create online environments where humans will feel at home at having their creative impulses nurtured. We will also most likely become used to sharing our metaverse environments with AI beings that will help us with tasks we’re there to do, or just be our partner for a game of tennis or chess when we want to relax and unwind.

Low-code and no-code AI 
A big barrier to the adoption of AI-driven efficiency in many companies is the scarcity of skilled AI engineers who can create the necessary tools and algorithms. No-code and low-code solutions aim to overcome this by offering simple interfaces that can be used, in theory, to construct increasingly complex AI systems. Much like the way web design and no-code UI tools now let users create web pages and other interactive systems simply by dragging and dropping graphical elements together, no-code AI systems will let us create smart programs by plugging together different, pre-made modules and feeding them with our own domain-specific data. Technologies such as natural language processing and language modeling (see above) mean that soon it may be possible to use nothing more than our voice or written instructions. All of this will play a key role in the ongoing ""democratization” of AI and data technology.
Autonomous vehicles
AI is the ""brains"" that will guide the autonomous cars, boats, and aircraft that are set to revolutionize travel and society over the coming decade. 2022 should be a year to remember when we look back in the future and contemplate with horror the fact that we thought it was normal that 1.3 million people died of traffic accidents every year, 90% of which were caused by human error!
As well as increasingly effective autonomous cars – Tesla says its cars will demonstrate full self-driving capability by 2022, although it’s unlikely they will be ready for general use. Its competitors include Waymo (created by Google), Apple, GM, and Ford, and any of them can be expected to announce major leaps forward in the next year. The year will hopefully also see the first autonomous ship crossing the Atlantic, as the Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS), powered by IBM and designed in partnership with non-profit ProMare, will once again attempt the journey (having been forced to turn back during its initial attempt this year).
Creative AI
We know that AI can be used to create art, music, poetry, plays, and even video games. In 2022, as new models such as GPT-4 and Google’s Brain redefine the boundaries of what’s possible, we can expect more elaborate and seemingly “natural” creative output from our increasingly imaginative and capable electronic friends. Rather than these creations generally being demonstrations or experiments to show off the potential of AI, as is the case now, in 2022, we will increasingly see them applied to routine creative tasks, such as writing headlines for articles and newsletters, designing logos and infographics. Creativity is often seen as a very human skill, and the fact we are now seeing these capabilities emerging in machines means “artificial” intelligence is undeniably coming closer in terms of scope and function to the somewhat nebulous concept we have of what constitutes “real” intelligence.

  <li>
    <p>New National AI Research and Innovation Programme alongside review of nation’s future computing capacity will help make sure UK discovers and develops latest innovations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK today launches its first <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy</a> to help it strengthen its position as a global science superpower and seize the potential of modern technology to improve people’s lives and solve global challenges such as climate change and public health.</p>

<p>AI technologies underpin the tech and apps we use on a daily basis - from helping us navigate around cities and stopping online banking fraud to enabling voice recognition in smart speakers. They help clinicians improve their diagnosis of disease, are unlocking the potential for driverless cars and will deliver thousands of unforeseen benefits in everyday life.</p>

<p>The UK’s first <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">AI strategy</a> - published on the third day of London Tech Week - marks a step change in the country’s approach to the fastest growing emerging technology in the world. There are plans to launch a new national programme and approach to support research and development, publish a white paper on the governance and regulation of AI to build confidence in its use, plus moves to support organisations in every region and sector capitalise on the power of AI technologies.</p>

<p>The UK has a long and exceptional history in AI – from codebreaker Alan Turing’s early work through to London-based powerhouse DeepMind’s pioneering research which will enable quicker and more advanced drug discovery. The country is ranked third in the world for private venture capital investment into AI companies (2019 investment into the UK reached almost £2.5 billion) and home to a third of Europe’s total AI companies.</p>

<p>Alongside measures to develop the next generation of AI talent through continued  support for postgraduate learning, retraining and making sure children from wide backgrounds can access specialist courses, the strategy will position the UK as a global leader in raising the standards around the use of the technology while building the case for deeper investor confidence. It includes plans to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Launch a National AI Research and Innovation Programme to improve coordination and collaboration between the country’s researchers and help transform the UK’s AI capabilities, while boosting business and public sector adoption of AI technologies and their ability to take them to market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support the government’s levelling up agenda by launching a joint Office for AI (OAI) and UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) programme aimed at continuing to develop AI in sectors based outside of London and the South East. This would focus on the commercialisation of ideas and could see, for example, the government focusing investment, researchers and developers to work in areas which currently do not use much AI technology but have great potential, such as energy and farming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Publish a joint review with UKRI into the availability and capacity of computing power for UK researchers and organisations, including the physical hardware needed to drive a major roll out in AI technologies. The review will also consider wider needs for the commercialisation and deployment of AI, including its environmental impacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch a consultation on copyright and patents for AI through the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to make sure the UK is capitalising on the ideas it generates and by best supporting AI development and use through the copyright and patent system.  This consultation will also include a focus on how to protect AI generated inventions which would otherwise not meet inventorship criteria as well as measures to make it easier to use copyright protected material in AI development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trialing an AI Standards Hub to coordinate UK engagement in setting the rules globally, and working with The Alan Turing Institute to update guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector and create practical tools to make sure the technology is used ethically.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DCMS Minister Chris Philp said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial intelligence technologies generate billions for the economy and improve our lives. They power the technology we use on a daily basis and help save lives through better disease diagnosis and drug discovery.</p>

  <p>The UK already punches above its weight internationally and we are ranked third in the world behind the USA and China in the list of top countries for AI.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Today we’re laying the foundations for the next ten years’ growth with a strategy to help us seize the potential of artificial intelligence and play a leading role in shaping the way the world governs it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strategy comes in the week new data shows global investors poured £13.5 billion into more than 1,400 UK private technology firms between January and June this year - more than that achieved in other large tech markets Germany, France and Israel combined.</p>

<p>It follows government investment of more than £2.3 billion into AI since 2014, and has a ten-year vision to transform the UK’s capabilities in AI in parallel with the rapid technological expansion around the world. Its aim is to position the UK as the best place to live and work with AI, with clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment.</p>

<p>It focuses on three pillars which include making sure the country invests in the long term growth of AI; that it benefits all sectors and regions of the economy; and that it is governed effectively by adequate rules which encourage innovation, investment and protect the public and the country’s fundamental values.</p>

<p>This includes measures to support skills, including the country’s Turing Fellowships Programme, Centres for Doctoral Training and postgraduate industrial masters and conversion courses, alongside plans to support the National Centre for Computing Education to ensure programmes for children in AI are accessible and reach the widest demographic.</p>

<p>The government will also launch a Defence AI Strategy later this year, the new Defence AI Centre through the Ministry of Defence and begin engagement on the draft National Strategy for AI-driven technologies in Health and Social Care through the NHS AI Lab.</p>

<p>Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI technologies have the capacity to fundamentally transform many aspects of the way we live and work.</p>

                Throughout the project, Beethoven’s genius loomed.

When Ludwig von Beethoven died in 1827, he was three years removed from the completion of his Ninth Symphony, a work heralded by many as his magnum opus. He had started work on his Tenth Symphony but, due to deteriorating health, wasn’t able to make much headway: All he left behind were some musical sketches.
Ever since then, Beethoven fans and musicologists have puzzled and lamented over what could have been. His notes teased at some magnificent reward, albeit one that seemed forever out of reach.

Now, thanks to the work of a team of music historians, musicologists, composers and computer scientists, Beethoven’s vision will come to life.
I presided over the artificial intelligence side of the project, leading a group of scientists at the creative A.I. startup Playform AI that taught a machine both Beethoven’s entire body of work and his creative process.
A full recording of Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony is set to be released on October 9, 2021, the same day as the world premiere performance scheduled to take place in Bonn, Germany - the culmination of a two-year-plus effort.
Past attempts hit a wall
Around 1817, the Royal Philharmonic Society in London commissioned Beethoven to write his Ninth and Tenth symphonies. Written for an orchestra, symphonies often contain four movements: the first is performed at a fast tempo, the second at a slower one, the third at a medium or fast tempo, and the last at a fast tempo.
Beethoven completed his Ninth Symphony in 1824, which concludes with the timeless “Ode to Joy.”
But when it came to the Tenth Symphony, Beethoven didn’t leave much behind, other than some musical notes and a handful of ideas he had jotted down.

There have been some past attempts to reconstruct parts of Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony. Most famously, in 1988, musicologist Barry Cooper ventured to complete the first and second movements. He wove together 250 bars of music from the sketches to create what was, in his view, a production of the first movement that was faithful to Beethoven’s vision.
Yet the sparseness of Beethoven’s sketches made it impossible for symphony experts to go beyond that first movement.
Assembling the team
In early 2019, Dr. Matthias Röder, the director of the Karajan Institute, an organization in Salzburg, Austria, that promotes music technology, contacted me. He explained that he was putting together a team to complete Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony in celebration of the composer’s 250th birthday. Aware of my work on A.I.-generated art, he wanted to know if A.I. would be able to help fill in the blanks left by Beethoven.
The challenge seemed daunting. To pull it off, A.I. would need to do something it had never done before. But I said I would give it a shot.
Röder then compiled a team that included Austrian composer Walter Werzowa. Famous for writing Intel’s signature bong jingle, Werzowa was tasked with putting together a new kind of composition that would integrate what Beethoven left behind with what the A.I. would generate. Mark Gotham, a computational music expert, led the effort to transcribe Beethoven’s sketches and process his entire body of work so the A.I. could be properly trained.
The team also included Robert Levin, a musicologist at Harvard University who also happens to be an incredible pianist. Levin had previously finished a number of incomplete 18th-century works by Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach.
The project takes shape
In June 2019, the group gathered for a two-day workshop at Harvard’s music library. In a large room with a piano, a blackboard and a stack of Beethoven’s sketchbooks spanning most of his known works, we talked about how fragments could be turned into a complete piece of music and how A.I. could help solve this puzzle, while still remaining faithful to Beethoven’s process and vision.
The music experts in the room were eager to learn more about the sort of music A.I. had created in the past. I told them how A.I. had successfully generated music in the style of Bach. However, this was only a harmonization of an inputted melody that sounded like Bach. It didn’t come close to what we needed to do: construct an entire symphony from a handful of phrases.

Meanwhile, the scientists in the room - myself included - wanted to learn about what sort of materials were available, and how the experts envisioned using them to complete the symphony.
The task at hand eventually crystallized. We would need to use notes and completed compositions from Beethoven’s entire body of work - along with the available sketches from the Tenth Symphony - to create something that Beethoven himself might have written.
This was a tremendous challenge. We didn’t have a machine that we could feed sketches to, push a button and have it spit out a symphony. Most A.I. available at the time couldn’t continue an uncompleted piece of music beyond a few additional seconds.
We would need to push the boundaries of what creative A.I. could do by teaching the machine Beethoven’s creative process - how he would take a few bars of music and painstakingly develop them into stirring symphonies, quartets and sonatas.
Piecing together Beethoven’s creative process
As the project progressed, the human side and the machine side of the collaboration evolved. Werzowa, Gotham, Levin, and Röder deciphered and transcribed the sketches from the Tenth Symphony, trying to understand Beethoven’s intentions. Using his completed symphonies as a template, they attempted to piece together the puzzle of where the fragments of sketches should go - which movement, which part of the movement.
They had to make decisions, like determining whether a sketch indicated the starting point of a scherzo, which is a very lively part of the symphony, typically in the third movement. Or they might determine that a line of music was likely the basis of a fugue, which is a melody created by interweaving parts that all echo a central theme.
The A.I. side of the project - my side - found itself grappling with a range of challenging tasks.
First, and most fundamentally, we needed to figure out how to take a short phrase, or even just a motif, and use it to develop a longer, more complicated musical structure, just as Beethoven would have done. For example, the machine had to learn how Beethoven constructed the Fifth Symphony out of a basic four-note motif.

Next, because the continuation of a phrase also needs to follow a certain musical form, whether it’s a scherzo, trio or fugue, the A.I. needed to learn Beethoven’s process for developing these forms.
The to-do list grew: We had to teach the A.I. how to take a melodic line and harmonize it. The A.I. needed to learn how to bridge two sections of music together. And we realized the A.I. had to be able to compose a coda, which is a segment that brings a section of a piece of music to its conclusion.
Finally, once we had a full composition, the A.I. was going to have to figure out how to orchestrate it, which involves assigning different instruments for different parts.
And it had to pull off these tasks in the way Beethoven might do so.
Passing the first big test
In November 2019, the team met in person again - this time, in Bonn, at the Beethoven House Museum, where the composer was born and raised.
This meeting was the litmus test for determining whether A.I. could complete this project. We printed musical scores that had been developed by A.I. and built off the sketches from Beethoven’s Tenth. A pianist performed in a small concert hall in the museum before a group of journalists, music scholars and Beethoven experts.

We challenged the audience to determine where Beethoven’s phrases ended and where the A.I. extrapolation began. They couldn’t.
A few days later, one of these A.I.-generated scores was played by a string quartet in a news conference. Only those who intimately knew Beethoven’s sketches for the Tenth Symphony could determine when the A.I.-generated parts came in.
The success of these tests told us we were on the right track. But these were just a couple of minutes of music. There was still much more work to do.
Ready for the world
At every point, Beethoven’s genius loomed, challenging us to do better. As the project evolved, the A.I. did as well. Over the ensuing 18 months, we constructed and orchestrated two entire movements of more than 20 minutes apiece.
We anticipate some pushback to this work - those who will say that the arts should be off-limits from A.I., and that A.I. has no business trying to replicate the human creative process. Yet when it comes to the arts, I see A.I. not as a replacement, but as a tool - one that opens doors for artists to express themselves in new ways.
This project would not have been possible without the expertise of human historians and musicians. It took an immense amount of work - and, yes, creative thinking - to accomplish this goal.
At one point, one of the music experts on the team said that the A.I. reminded him of an eager music student who practices every day, learns, and becomes better and better.
Now that student, having taken the baton from Beethoven, is ready to present the Tenth Symphony to the world.

        7 Revealing Ways AIs Fail
    Neural networks can be disastrously brittle, forgetful, and surprisingly bad at mathCharles Q. Choi21 Sep 20218 min read 37

    LightBlueArtificial intelligence could perform more quickly, accurately, reliably, and impartially than humans on a wide range of problems, from detecting cancer to deciding who receives an interview for a job. But AIs have also suffered numerous, sometimes deadly, failures. And the increasing ubiquity of AI means that failures can affect not just individuals but millions of people.
	Increasingly, the AI community is 
	cataloging these failures with an eye toward monitoring the risks they may pose. ""There tends to be very little information for users to understand how these systems work and what it means to them,"" says Charlie Pownall, founder of the AI, Algorithmic and Automation Incident & Controversy Repository. ""I think this directly impacts trust and confidence in these systems. There are lots of possible reasons why organizations are reluctant to get into the nitty-gritty of what exactly happened in an AI incident or controversy, not the least being potential legal exposure, but if looked at through the lens of trustworthiness, it's in their best interest to do so.""
This article is part of our special report on AI, “The Great AI Reckoning.”
	Part of the problem is that the neural network technology that drives many AI systems can break down in ways that remain a mystery to researchers. ""It's unpredictable which problems artificial intelligence will be good at, because we don't understand intelligence itself very well,"" says computer scientist 
	Dan Hendrycks at the University of California, Berkeley.

	Here are seven examples of AI failures and what current weaknesses they reveal about artificial intelligence. Scientists discuss possible ways to deal with some of these problems; others currently defy explanation or may, philosophically speaking, lack any conclusive solution altogether.
1) BrittlenessChris Philpot
	Take a picture of a school bus. Flip it so it lays on its side, as it might be found in the case of an accident in the real world.
	 A 2018 study found that state-of-the-art AIs that would normally correctly identify the school bus right-side-up failed to do so on average 97 percent of the time when it was rotated.

	""They will say the school bus is a snowplow with very high confidence,"" says computer scientist 
	Anh Nguyen at Auburn University, in Alabama. The AIs are not capable of a task of mental rotation ""that even my 3-year-old son could do,"" he says.

	Such a failure is an example of brittleness. An AI often ""can only recognize a pattern it has seen before,"" Nguyen says. ""If you show it a new pattern, it is easily fooled.""

	There are numerous troubling cases of AI brittleness.
	 Fastening stickers on a stop sign can make an AI misread it. Changing a single pixel on an image can make an AI think a horse is a frog. Neural networks can be 99.99 percent confident that multicolor static is a picture of a lion. Medical images can get modified in a way imperceptible to the human eye so medical scans misdiagnose cancer 100 percent of the time. And so on.

	One possible way to make AIs more robust against such failures is to expose them to as many confounding ""adversarial"" examples as possible, Hendrycks says. However, they may still fail against rare ""
	black swan"" events. ""Black-swan problems such as COVID or the recession are hard for even humans to address—they may not be problems just specific to machine learning,"" he notes.
2) Embedded Bias Chris Philpot
	Increasingly, AI is used to help support major decisions, such as who receives a loan, the length of a jail sentence, and who gets health care first. The hope is that AIs can make decisions more impartially than people often have, but much research has found that biases embedded in the data on which these AIs are trained can result in automated discrimination en masse, posing immense risks to society.

	For example, in 2019, scientists found
	 a nationally deployed health care algorithm in the United States 
	was racially biased, affecting millions of Americans. The AI was designed to identify which patients would benefit most from intensive-care programs, but it routinely enrolled healthier white patients into such programs ahead of black patients who were sicker.

	Physician and researcher
	 Ziad Obermeyer at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues found the algorithm mistakenly assumed that people with high health care costs were also the sickest patients and most in need of care. However, due to systemic racism, ""black patients are less likely to get health care when they need it, so are less likely to generate costs,"" he explains.

	After working with the software's developer, Obermeyer and his colleagues helped design a new algorithm that analyzed other variables and displayed 84 percent less bias. ""It's a lot more work, but accounting for bias is not at all impossible,"" he says. They recently
	 drafted a playbook that outlines a few basic steps that governments, businesses, and other groups can implement to detect and prevent bias in existing and future software they use. These include identifying all the algorithms they employ, understanding this software's ideal target and its performance toward that goal, retraining the AI if needed, and creating a high-level oversight body.
3) Catastrophic Forgetting Chris PhilpotDeepfakes—highly realistic artificially generated fake images and videos, often of celebrities, politicians, and other public figures—are becoming increasingly common on the Internet and social media, and could wreak plenty of havoc by fraudulently depicting people saying or doing things that never really happened. To develop an AI that could detect deepfakes, computer scientist Shahroz Tariq and his colleagues at Sungkyunkwan University, in South Korea, created a website where people could upload images to check their authenticity.

	In the beginning, the researchers trained their neural network to spot one kind of deepfake. However, after a few months, many new types of deepfake emerged, and when they trained their AI to identify these new varieties of deepfake, it quickly forgot how to detect the old ones.

	This was an example of catastrophic forgetting—the tendency of an AI to entirely and abruptly forget information it previously knew after learning new information, essentially overwriting past knowledge with new knowledge. ""Artificial neural networks have a terrible memory,"" Tariq says.

	AI researchers are pursuing a variety of strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting so that neural networks can, as humans seem to do, continuously learn effortlessly. A simple technique is to create a specialized neural network for each new task one wants performed—say, distinguishing cats from dogs or apples from oranges—""but this is obviously not scalable, as the number of networks increases linearly with the number of tasks,"" says machine-learning researcher
	 Sam Kessler at the University of Oxford, in England.

	One alternative
	 Tariq and his colleagues explored as they trained their AI to spot new kinds of deepfakes was to supply it with a small amount of data on how it identified older types so it would not forget how to detect them. Essentially, this is like reviewing a summary of a textbook chapter before an exam, Tariq says.

	However, AIs may not always have access to past knowledge—for instance, when dealing with private information such as medical records. Tariq and his colleagues were trying to prevent an AI from relying on data from prior tasks. They had it train itself how to spot new deepfake types
	 while also learning from another AI that was previously trained how to recognize older deepfake varieties. They found this ""knowledge distillation"" strategy was roughly 87 percent accurate at detecting the kind of low-quality deepfakes typically shared on social media.
4) Explainability Chris Philpot
	Why 
	does an AI suspect a person might be a criminal or have cancer? The explanation for this and other high-stakes predictions can have many legal, medical, and other consequences. The way in which AIs reach conclusions has long been considered a mysterious black box, leading to many attempts to devise ways to explain AIs' inner workings. ""However, my recent work suggests the field of explainability is getting somewhat stuck,"" says Auburn's Nguyen.

	Nguyen and his colleagues
	 investigated seven different techniques that researchers have developed to attribute explanations for AI decisions—for instance, what makes an image of a matchstick a matchstick? Is it the flame or the wooden stick? They discovered that many of these methods ""are quite unstable,"" Nguyen says. ""They can give you different explanations every time.""

	In addition, while one attribution method might work on one set of neural networks, ""it might fail completely on another set,"" Nguyen adds. The future of explainability may involve building databases of correct explanations, Nguyen says. Attribution methods can then go to such knowledge bases ""and search for facts that might explain decisions,"" he says.
5) Quantifying Uncertainty Chris Philpot
	In 2016, a Tesla Model S car on autopilot collided with a truck that was turning left in front of it in northern Florida, killing its driver—
	the automated driving system's 
	first reported fatality. According to Tesla's official blog, neither the autopilot system nor the driver ""noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.""

	One potential way Tesla, Uber, and other companies may avoid such disasters is for their cars to do a better job at calculating and dealing with uncertainty. Currently AIs ""can be very certain even though they're very wrong,"" Oxford's Kessler says that if an algorithm makes a decision, ""we should have a robust idea of how confident it is in that decision, especially for a medical diagnosis or a self-driving car, and if it's very uncertain, then a human can intervene and give [their] own verdict or assessment of the situation.""

	For example, computer scientist
	 Moloud Abdar at Deakin University in Australia and his colleagues applied several different uncertainty quantification techniques as an AI classified skin-cancer images as malignant or benign, or melanoma or not. The researcher found these methods helped prevent the AI from making overconfident diagnoses.

	Autonomous vehicles remain challenging for uncertainty quantification, as current uncertainty-quantification techniques are often relatively time consuming, ""and cars cannot wait for them,"" Abdar says. ""We need to have much faster approaches.""
6) Common Sense Chris Philpot
	AIs lack common sense—the ability to reach acceptable, logical conclusions based on a vast context of everyday knowledge that people usually take for granted, says computer scientist
	 Xiang Ren at the University of Southern California. ""If you don't pay very much attention to what these models are actually learning, they can learn shortcuts that lead them to misbehave,"" he says.

	For instance, scientists may train AIs to detect hate speech on data where such speech is unusually high, such as white supremacist forums. However,
	 when this software is 
	exposed to the real world, it can fail to recognize that black and gay people may respectively use the words ""black"" and ""gay"" more often than other groups. ""Even if a post is quoting a news article mentioning Jewish or black or gay people without any particular sentiment, it might be misclassified as hate speech,"" Ren says. In contrast, ""humans reading through a whole sentence can recognize when an adjective is used in a hateful context.""

	Previous research suggested that state-of-the-art AIs could draw logical inferences about the world with up to roughly 90 percent accuracy, suggesting they were making progress at achieving common sense. However,
	 when Ren and his colleagues 
	tested these models, they found even the best AI could generate logically coherent sentences with slightly less than 32 percent accuracy. When it comes to developing common sense, ""one thing we care a lot [about] these days in the AI community is employing more comprehensive checklists to look at the behavior of models on multiple dimensions,"" he says.
7) Math 
            Chris Philpot
        
	Although conventional computers are good at crunching numbers, AIs ""are surprisingly not good at mathematics at all,"" Berkeley's Hendrycks says. ""You might have the latest and greatest models that take hundreds of GPUs to train, and they're still just not as reliable as a pocket calculator.""

	For example, Hendrycks and his colleagues trained an AI on hundreds of thousands of math problems with step-by-step solutions. However,
	 when 
	tested on 12,500 problems from high school math competitions, ""it only got something like 5 percent accuracy,"" he says. In comparison, a three-time International Mathematical Olympiad gold medalist attained 90 percent success on such problems ""without a calculator,"" he adds.

	Neural networks nowadays can learn to solve nearly every kind of problem ""if you just give it enough data and enough resources, but not math,"" Hendrycks says. Many problems in science require a lot of math, so this current weakness of AI can limit its application in scientific research, he notes.

	It remains uncertain why AI is currently bad at math. One possibility is that neural networks attack problems in a highly parallel manner like human brains, whereas math problems typically require a long series of steps to solve, so maybe the way AIs process data is not as suitable for such tasks, ""in the same way that humans generally can't do huge calculations in their head,"" Hendrycks says. However, AI's poor performance on math ""is still a niche topic: There hasn't been much traction on the problem,"" he adds.

Benefits can add to service, maintenance and more.

   The loss of expert know-how, already a problem for years, has been made worse due to the coronavirus pandemic. A network of expertise, optimized by artificial intelligence, may be the way to get ahead of the problem.
 Companies for years have been dealing with an aging workforce—losing talent and knowledge to retirement. The pandemic has accelerated this, particularly in water treatment. How do treatment plants replace the 20-year service or maintenance veterans and their expertise? Right now, the best technicians are supporting users and newer techs. Imagine that one of them calls their boss tomorrow and says they are suddenly retiring. How can companies make up for their knowledge once they walk out the door?
 The baby boomer generation of workers did not change jobs too often. One study says the average job tenure for baby boomers is eight years. That is a lot of time to build up expertise. On the other hand, the same study says millennials’ average job tenure is just under two and a half years. So, the boomers are retiring, and it is likely their replacements will not stay around as long. How should companies plan for this?
 








The pandemic changed many users’ habits, and now end users are wanting to do more problem resolution themselves without having to rely on support and a potential site visit from an engineer. For field service organizations, sending a service tech on-site has always been the last resort. How can water treatment plant operators be upskilled so they can resolve more issues themselves?
 The pandemic has seen a rise in solutions such as augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/MR) and other remote service tools. For these solutions to work, there still needs to be an expert on one end or the other. Also, AR/MR, knowledge bases, chatbots—none of these solutions improve skill levels. 
 These tools can be compared to having someone driving to an unfamiliar destination in a car. How much does the passenger remember afterward how to get to that destination? Research shows that humans forget 50% of what they learn within an hour. So, current remote service solutions may not be the answer. It could be possible to upskill technicians and users and enable them to retain and grow their new skill sets.
 An on-demand network of expertise that workers can access on-site to help resolve issues with all of the major machines and components at the plant may be the answer. The network would be capable of being automatically enriched and optimized based on the success and experience of its users.
 In water treatment, end users face the following challenges:

Experts are stretched thin and spend too much of their time helping lesser-skilled workers with simpler issues.
Plant managers often lack the skills to troubleshoot an issue without outside support.
Many workers cannot interpret alarms or identify the root cause of a problem on their own.
When there is an issue, it is often a third-party component that is the source of the problem, which means long wait times for a service engineer to come to repair it. Or the local operator is left using Google to find a troubleshooting manual so they can fix it themselves.

 








The benefits of artificial intelligence are valuable, innovative and can apply to service, maintenance, installations, calibrations, training and more. AI can:

Enable plant operators to resolve more issues, improving plant productivity.
Upskill technicians so they can perform tasks above their paygrade and not always rely on the experts.
Capture unwritten knowledge gained over decades of experience. 
Shorten onboarding time for new hires, enabling them to perform most tasks in weeks instead of months or longer.
Reduce the burden on experts so that they can spend more of their time on the less common, more complex issues.
Company experts’ “know-how” may be the most important IP. Keep IP for the long term.
Improve organizational learning so that the team can do its job better.

Electronic health records have been widely adopted with the hope they would save time and improve the quality of patient care. But due to fragmented interfaces and tedious data entry procedures, physicians often spend more time navigating these systems than they do interacting with patients.

Researchers at MIT and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center are combining machine learning and human-computer interaction to create a better electronic health record (EHR). They developed MedKnowts, a system that unifies the processes of looking up medical records and documenting patient information into a single, interactive interface.

Driven by artificial intelligence, this “smart” EHR automatically displays customized, patient-specific medical records when a clinician needs them. MedKnowts also provides autocomplete for clinical terms and auto-populates fields with patient information to help doctors work more efficiently.

“In the origins of EHRs, there was this tremendous enthusiasm that getting all this information organized would be helpful to be able to track billing records, report statistics to the government, and provide data for scientific research. But few stopped to ask the deep questions around whether they would be of use for the clinician. I think a lot of clinicians feel they have had this burden of EHRs put on them for the benefit of bureaucracies and scientists and accountants. We came into this project asking how EHRs might actually benefit clinicians,” says David Karger, professor of computer science in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and senior author of the paper.

The research was co-authored by CSAIL graduate students Luke Murray, who is the lead author, Divya Gopinath, and Monica Agrawal. Other authors include Steven Horng, an emergency medicine attending physician and clinical lead for machine learning at the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and David Sontag, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of CSAIL and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and a principal investigator at the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. It will be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology next month.

A problem-oriented tool

To design an EHR that would benefit doctors, the researchers had to think like doctors.

They created a note-taking editor with a side panel that displays relevant information from the patient’s medical history. That historical information appears in the form of cards that are focused on particular problems or concepts.

For instance, if MedKnowts identifies the clinical term “diabetes” in the text as a clinician types, the system automatically displays a “diabetes card” containing medications, lab values, and snippets from past records that are relevant to diabetes treatment.

Most EHRs store historical information on separate pages and list medications or lab values alphabetically or chronologically, forcing the clinician to search through data to find the information they need, Murray says. MedKnowts only displays information relevant to the particular concept the clinician is writing about.

“This is a closer match to the way doctors think about information. A lot of times, doctors will do this subconsciously. They will look through a medications page and only focus on the medications that are relevant to the current conditions. We are helping to do that process automatically and hopefully move some things out of the doctor’s head so they have more time to think about the complex part, which is determining what is wrong with the patient and coming up with a treatment plan,” Murray says.

Pieces of interactive text called chips serve as links to related cards. As a physician types a note, the autocomplete system recognizes clinical terms, such as medications, lab values, or conditions, and transforms them into chips. Each chip is displayed as a word or phrase that has been highlighted in a certain color depending on its category (red for a medical condition, green for a medication, yellow for a procedure, etc.)

Through the use of autocomplete, structured data on the patient’s conditions, symptoms, and medication usage is collected with no additional effort from the physician.

Sontag says he hopes the advance will “change the paradigm of how to create large-scale health datasets for studying disease progression and assessing the real-world effectiveness of treatments.”

In practice

After a year-long iterative design process, the researchers tested MedKnowts by deploying the software in the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. They worked with an emergency physician and four hospital scribes who enter notes into the electronic health record.

Deploying the software in an emergency department, where doctors operate in a high-stress environment, involved a delicate balancing act, Agrawal says.

“One of the biggest challenges we faced was trying to get people to shift what they currently do. Doctors who have used the same system, and done the same dance of clicks so many times, form a sort of muscle memory. Whenever you are going to make a change, there is a question of is this worth it? And we definitely found that some features had greater usage than others,” she says.

The Covid-19 pandemic complicated the deployment, too. The researchers had been visiting the emergency department to get a sense of the workflow, but were forced to end those visits due to Covid-19 and were unable to be in the hospital while the system was being deployed.

Despite those initial challenges, MedKnowts became popular with the scribes over the course of the one-month deployment. They gave the system an average rating of 83.75 (out of 100) for usability.

Scribes found the autocomplete function especially useful for speeding up their work, according to survey results. Also, the color-coded chips helped them quickly scan notes for relevant information.

Those initial results are promising, but as the researchers consider the feedback and work on future iterations of MedKnowts, they plan to proceed with caution.

“What we are trying to do here is smooth the pathway for doctors and let them accelerate. There is some risk there. Part of the purpose of bureaucracy is to slow things down and make sure all the i’s are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. And if we have a computer dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s for doctors, that may actually be countering the goals of the bureaucracy, which is to force doctors to think twice before they make a decision. We have to be thinking about how to protect doctors and patients from the consequences of making the doctors more efficient,” Karger says.

A longer-term vision

The researchers plan to improve the machine learning algorithms that drive MedKnowts so the system can more effectively highlight parts of the medical record that are most relevant, Agrawal says.

They also want to consider the needs of different medical users. The researchers designed MedKnowts with an emergency department in mind — a setting where doctors are typically seeing patients for the first time. A primary care physician who knows their patients much better would likely have some different needs.

In the longer-term, the researchers envision creating an adaptive system that clinicians can contribute to. For example, perhaps a doctor realizes a certain cardiology term is missing from MedKnowts and adds that information to a card, which would update the system for all users.

The team is exploring commercialization as an avenue for further deployment.

“We want to build tools that let doctors create their own tools. We don’t expect doctors to learn to be programmers, but with the right support they might be able to radically customize whatever medical applications they are using to really suit their own needs and preferences,” Karger says.

This research was funded by the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health.

NSF Grant Supports Future Designers of ‘Trustworthy’ Artificial Intelligence

SEAS received $3 million through the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program to transform the future of work, develop a new model for graduate education and to fund cross-cutting student scholarship.

By Kristen Mitchell
The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) received a $3 million award from the National Science Foundation to develop a transformative model for graduate education training that combines research in computer science and systems engineering to support the next generation of leaders and researchers in artificial intelligence (AI).
This new initiative marks the first time the university has been the primary institution on an award from the prestigious NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program. It brings together faculty from the SEAS Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering (EMSE) and the Department of Computer Science (CS), who will support 25 Ph.D. students over the next five years, develop a new graduate certificate program for mid-career professionals working with AI and host boot camps and seminars open to the GW community.
Over the past decade, AI tools have been developed at an unusually rapid pace. They’ve been deployed into environments where value maximization precedes regulation, the grant abstract states, and these tools impact every realm of life. Through this funding, GW will conduct research and educate interdisciplinary scholars capable of co-designing AI algorithms and work systems to unlock new opportunities in both the capabilities of new systems and their “trustworthiness.”
The designers of tomorrow must be able to take advantage of the power of AI while mitigating potential risks of embedding bias or cybersecurity threats, said Zoe Szajnfarber, principal investigator, professor and chair of EMSE. To do this, algorithm designers need to learn more about the complex systems in which AI will be deployed. AI adopters, including policymakers, also need to better understand the capabilities and limitations of these new technologies. 
“We made the case that a new approach is needed to train a next generation of researchers who are able to think about both algorithm design and the system in which it will be deployed, well enough to bridge across those disciplines so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities to transform work for social good, while mitigating unintended consequences,” she said.
This funded project, titled “Co-Design of Trustworthy AI and Future Work Systems,” is led by Dr. Szajnfarber and co-principal investigators Robert Pless, computer science department chair and the Patrick and Donna Martin Professor of Computer Science, Rachelle Heller, director of the SEAS Center for Women in Engineering and professor emerita of computer science, and Ekundayo Shittu, EMSE associate professor. The project will engage many other faculty members through interdisciplinary research projects focused on application areas of existing strength, including humanitarian operations, the information landscape and smart mobility. 
The NRT will build on existing Ph.D. programs, involving students who have a deep research area in either computer science or systems engineering. The goal is to bring these two fields together for meaningful, interdisciplinary interaction, Dr. Pless said.
“This project is a really good combination of a couple really deep technical disciplines of system engineering and computer science and AI,” Dr. Pless said. “It builds on some of the things that our strategic planning and our strategic research initiatives have been building towards for years.”
John Lach, dean of SEAS, said the NRT award to SEAS is a result of faculty leaders working across disciplines to create a compelling and distinctive vision for the future of graduate education.
“It’s in line with our school’s ‘engineering and...’ approach, which emphasizes the societal context in which engineering and computing are practiced,” Dr. Lach said. “This context—in addition to the program's technical depth and professional development—will prepare students to become leaders and cultivators of trust in our increasingly AI-driven world.""
Compared to traditional engineering or computer science Ph.D. programs, students will engage in coursework with an emphasis on building holistic skills including communication, leadership, teamwork and ethics. The faculty is also focused on providing opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. Bringing more diverse perspectives into AI decision-making can help mitigate bias within well-intended systems to ensure they are trustworthy, equitable and fair.
“The reality is a lot of the seeds of unintended consequences get baked in through early design decisions,” Dr. Szajnfarber said. “They're really hard to correct later, but if you can think through the implications upfront—a big if—design changes are much easier in the initial stages. To that end, including more diverse perspectives early in design is known to help with this identification process.”
The new graduate certificate program—yet to be named—is expected to launch ahead of the fall 2022 semester. That program will be aimed toward working professionals who are asked to evaluate or integrate new technologies into organizations and critical decision functions to help them gain a stronger fundamental understanding of algorithm design to be more informed consumers and purchasers.
Certificate students and Ph.D. students will interact closely through seminars that aim to explore new cross-cutting ideas through discussions and case studies with external industry experts and faculty. This provides an important path for doctoral students to learn of the most pressing problems in practice, and mid-career professionals to gain access to the latest tools and insights, a type of cross pollination particularly enabled by GW’s Washington, D.C location. The seminar series, focused on trustworthiness in AI, is set to launch by next September.
This NRT award joins a list of prestigious research training awards the university has received recently. Over the past year, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences has been awarded three T32 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award institutional research training grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The first to study cancer, the second to study HIV and the third in primary care research team development.

""I think in five years' time ... we'll see 45 to 60 second videos with every job application,"" says Erin Devlin.(Supplied)Based on employer feedback, though, Ms Devlin is expecting something of a revolution in the application process — towards the use of video — within years.""Video resumes are definitely going to be on the rise,"" she says. ""But I think what will be more relevant and useful for employers would be what would be a type of video cover letter... because it's a quick snapshot of who you are and what your key selling points are.""It's getting that elevator pitch right."" And while video job applications won't replace written resumes completely, they will become much more common, Ms Devlin says.""I think in five years' time ... we'll see 45 to 60 second videos with every job application coming through ...

 GMC Hummer To Debut New Ultium Technology 
 Via GM   





 Considered the first of GM’s next-gen EVs, the new Hummer EV is first vehicle in production that is underpinned by GM’s all-new Ultium battery architecture. Because of this, the new electric truck will debut a number of EV technologies, such as Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive units. 

 The Ultium Drive is GM’s collective term for a family of five interchangeable drive units and three motors. The new Hummer EV will be the first to employ the three-motor Ultium Drive system. The Drive System in the Hummer EV will employ the highest-rated motor that GM developed specially for its Ultium-based EVs. 



 Three Motors Designed For GM’s Ultium Drive System 
 Via GM   

 GM has created three Ultium Drive motors: a 180-kW front-drive motor, a 255-kW rear- and front-drive motor, and a 62-kW all-wheel drive assist motor. Since these motors were built as a scalable family, they share design principles and employ similar tooling and production strategies. 





 RELATED: GMC Flexes Its EV Hummer Hitting Pickup 60 MPH In Just 3 Seconds 

 The motor in the Hummer EV is the 255-kW unit, which, along with the 180- kW unit, is a permanent magnet motor. On the other hand, the 62-kW unit is an induction motor. Up to three electric motors can be fitted in one Ultium EV, with the Hummer EV served by three separate 255-kW motors for 1,000 hp of total system output. 



 Artificial Intelligence Enables Motors To Work Together 
 Via GM   

 To ensure that these electric motors are working as intended, GM engineers developed the needed software for their controllers. After all, three separate motors have to work together effectively as one system. To enable this, artificial intelligence and machine learning are employed, thereby ensuring that torque is distributed to the system in the most efficient manner. 





 The software of key power electronics components – including the power inverter module and inverter – is designed in-house. This software is responsible for the ability of the Hummer EV to sprint from zero to 60 mph in around 3 seconds. 

 On existing GM EVs, the inverter and other power electronics are located outside the drive units. But for the Hummer EV and other Ultium EVs, these components will be integrated directly into the drive units, which would help cut cost while reducing manufacturing complexity.

Top Cloud Computing Companies for 2022

By Shelby Hiter

September 23, 2021 

Updated on: February 15, 2023 



FacebookTwitterLinkedinEmailPrint



Companies around the globe have been talking about digital transformation for years, but with the entrance of the COVID-19 pandemic and new workplace challenges, most enterprises have necessarily sped up their tech modernization efforts. Hybrid cloud, multicloud, and cloud computing companies and services have recognized this digital transformation push and are providing a wider range of cloud services accordingly.
Advancing a strategy in cloud computing — or making computing capabilities available over the internet and distributed virtual data centers rather than on-premises data centers — is one of the top priorities for most organizations today. The data reflects this: according to a study from Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market hit $250 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $791.5 billion by 2028. 
Some of this growth comes from new challenges found in a distributed global workforce, but exciting changes in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and big data growth have also precipitated the cloud’s expansion. Learn more about how the top cloud computing companies are providing the solutions that meet ever-changing business operation needs at scale.

Tips for Choosing a Cloud Vendor
Who Needs Cloud Solutions?

What Do Cloud Computing Companies Do?
Cloud computing companies offer a variety of enterprise cloud solutions, focused on infrastructure, platform, and/or software-based solutions. Although most smaller cloud companies specialize in one core area of cloud support, the biggest solutions providers tend to specialize in all three key areas of cloud computing services:
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SaaS is a type of solution in which a third-party vendor delivers cloud applications over the internet. They are typically hosted on a remote server and do not require enterprise customers to manage the hardware or software updates involved.
Examples: Google Workspace, Zoom, Dropbox, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, ZenDesk
PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
In PaaS, the cloud vendor provides enterprises with a cloud platform for application creation and development. With the platform approach, developers can focus on applications while other users or a third party separately manage servers, storage, and other networking features. 
Examples: SAP Cloud, AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Foundry, Red Hat OpenShift, Zoho Creator, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
IaaS is cloud-based infrastructural support delivered via virtualization technologies. With IaaS, enterprise customers receive self-service compute resources, such as servers, operating systems, and storage — all of which they can scale up or down as needed. Many IaaS solutions offer PaaS and SaaS solutions within their portfolios.
Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Open Cloud by RackSpace
Top Cloud Companies on the Market (Best by Category)

With so many core enterprise applications hosted on the cloud, it’s important that the platform offers robust analytics and data visualizations to assess application performance. Look for platforms that offer easy-to-read dashboards and key analytics and monitoring metrics.
AI/ML
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly being added to cloud platforms, helping enterprise developers to test and deploy AI/ML tools on the cloud framework. As a bonus, many cloud platforms also offer AI/ML-powered security monitoring and automation features to users.
User Access Controls
Most enterprises need their cloud platform to be accessible to all employees, but different employees require different applications and different levels of access to sensitive data. Invest in a tool that provides advanced user access controls that sysadmins can update for different users and devices over time.
Security and Automation
Cloud providers, especially in the IaaS realm, typically double as cybersecurity providers, offering embedded or integrated applications that automate security monitoring across cloud infrastructure.
Scalable Storage
One of the core benefits of migrating enterprise assets to the cloud is the ability to scale tools and storage up and down as your company changes over time. Look at the baseline storage features your chosen platform offers, as well as the pay-as-you-go model offered for added storage.
Interoperability and Integrations
Especially for the cloud platforms that offer hybrid cloud or multicloud capabilities, it’s crucial that they offer interoperability and integrations with the key applications and tools your organization already uses.
Collaborative Workspaces
Because the cloud offers real-time updates and easy access for enterprise users, many cloud platforms offer collaborative workspaces and office suites where users can collaboratively update company assets.

Tips for Choosing a Cloud Vendor
Cost to Implement
The great thing about cloud solutions is that enterprise users can easily scale up or down with the tools they need. Really consider what tools make the most sense for your business and whether your preferred vendor offers those solutions, and at what cost. The top cloud providers tend to offer the highest costs for initial infrastructure and add-ons. But they also offer the widest portfolio of solutions.
Hybrid Cloud and Multicloud Flexibility
Not all cloud solutions are created equally when it comes to hybrid cloud and multicloud flexibility. When choosing a cloud vendor, ask yourself the following questions: Are they willing to assist with the transition from your legacy systems and data centers to their cloud? Do they offer solutions that allow you to keep and connect legacy systems to their products?
Cloud Application Library
Whether embedded or added via integrations, it’s important to consider which cloud vendors offer the most useful suite of cloud applications for your particular business line and use cases. The largest providers tend to offer very similar core products and solutions. But each of them offers different specialties, partnerships with outside vendors, and industry-specific solutions that could benefit your organization.
Cloud Security Features
The cloud makes it possible for your team and solutions to work in a more distributed environment. But as a result, security also needs to become more distributed to protect your global network. Does your chosen cloud vendor offer native cloud security, or do they partner with top cloud security providers? Do they offer a dashboard, analytics, and other helpful visuals so your internal team can stay on top of potential threats?
Who Needs Cloud Solutions?
The modern enterprise technology landscape is reaching a point where virtually every company uses cloud solutions of some fashion for their business, But if you’re still not certain whether cloud technology can benefit your business, consider investing in the cloud if you’re looking for:

Simplified, remote access to company assets for employees
Automated and distributed security solutions that can be easily monitored
The ability to easily scale your storage and business applications
Stronger disaster recovery and quality control features
Easier access to emerging technologies, such as edge computing, AI, ML, and IoT

It’s likely that most workforces and enterprise projects will continue to operate in globally distributed locations. Although cloud computing companies and their solutions aren’t the only paths to successful management of a global enterprise, the cloud is quickly becoming the preferred method for uniting enterprise teams in an accessible, flexible, and secure environment.

Do we have a backup plan in place if AI causes unemployment?

By Palak Jain -   September 21, 2021 0 1379

Artificial intelligence and other major disruptive technologies have infiltrated the global tech business to improve production and yield. 
Multiple AI models are being used in organizations and factories to automate processes and generate significant in-depth insights. What if artificial intelligence leads to job losses shortly of technology? How will human employees make enough money to live a normal life? People are asking these kinds of concerns as robots and AI models automate operations and deal with large amounts of data rapidly and effectively.
Do we have a backup plan in place if artificial intelligence causes significant job losses in the coming years? 
Organizations and manufacturers are just following the crowd and implementing disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics, augmented reality, and others. They’re concentrating on task automation and increasing income while improving client happiness. Is this, however, sufficient to ensure that there will be no unemployment? Although there will be harmony in human-machine contact, millions of employees may probably lose their jobs in the next years as a result of these smart functions.
Scientists and developers are continually arguing that there will only be a hybrid workforce in which humans and machines collaborate for the benefit of both the company and society. Human personnel cannot be replaced by cutting-edge technologies since they are required for new levels of innovation. Humans are known for their creative brains, clear communication, and empathy, all of which can result in a wide range of inventiveness that can improve consumer engagement. Meanwhile, AI models are known for their ability to manage large amounts of data and generate in-depth insights. Humans are designed for creative labor, whereas machines are designed for mechanical activity. To thrive in this cutthroat competitive environment, businesses need a mix of both. This will help to prevent future job losses due to AI.
There are a variety of educational courses dedicated to training students and working professionals to be experts in various career categories linked to artificial intelligence and the creation of AI models, including AI architects, AI engineers, and many others. There are numerous options for them to retrain and reskill to improve their current abilities. 
As a fall-back strategy, displaced human workers can focus on making a living in industries that technology cannot reach, which will provide some job stability for a while. However, no one can claim that there is a backup plan in this situation because the future is unpredictable. Nobody knows what skills will be required for job jobs related to technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.The future is impossible to foretell.

With fossil fuels still supplying more than 80% of global energy, the energy sector needs to be at the heart of this action. Fortunately, the energy system is already in transition: renewable energy generation is growing rapidly, driven by falling costs and growing investor interest. But the scale and cost of decarbonizing the global energy system remain gigantic, and time is running out. To-date, most of the energy sector’s transition efforts have focused on hardware: new low-carbon infrastructure that will replace legacy carbon-intensive systems. Relatively little effort and investment has focused on another critical tool for the transition: next-generation digital technologies, in particular artificial intelligence (AI). These powerful technologies can be adopted more quickly at larger scales than new hardware solutions, and can become an essential enabler for the energy transition. Have you read?4 charts that show how technology is enabling the energy transitionWhy artificial intelligence is key to renewable energy grid resilienceHow 'active efficiency' can help electricity grids weather the storms to comeThree key trends are driving AI’s potential to accelerate energy transition: 1. Energy-intensive sectors including power, transport, heavy industry and buildings are at the beginning of historic decarbonization processes, driven by growing government and consumer demand for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions. The scale of these transitions is huge: BloombergNEF estimates that in the energy sector alone, achieving net-zero emissions will require between $92 trillion and $173 trillion of infrastructure investments by 2050. Even small gains in flexibility, efficiency or capacity in clean energy and low-carbon industry can therefore lead to trillions in value and savings.2. As electricity supplies more sectors and applications, the power sector is becoming the core pillar of the global energy supply. Ramping up renewable energy deployment to decarbonize the globally expanding power sector will mean more power is supplied by intermittent sources (such as solar and wind), creating new demand for forecasting, coordination, and flexible consumption to ensure that power grids can be operated safely and reliably.3. The transition to low-carbon energy systems is driving the rapid growth of distributed power generation, distributed storage and advanced demand-response capabilities, which need to be orchestrated and integrated through more networked, transactional power grids. Navigating these trends presents huge strategic and operational challenges to the energy system and to energy-intensive industries. This is where AI comes in: by creating an intelligent coordination layer across the generation, transmission and use of energy, AI can help energy-system stakeholders identify patterns and insights in data, learn from experience and improve system performance over time, and predict and model possible outcomes of complex, multivariate situations. AI is already proving its value to the energy transition in multiple domains, driving measurable improvements in renewable energy forecasting, grid operations and optimization, coordination of distributed energy assets and demand-side management, and materials innovation and discovery. But while AI’s application in the energy sector has proven promising so far, innovation and adoption remain limited. That presents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate transition towards the zero-emission, highly efficient and interconnected energy system we need tomorrow. AI holds far greater potential to accelerate the global energy transition, but it will only be realized if there is greater AI innovation, adoption and collaboration across the industry. That is why the World Economic Forum has today released Harnessing AI to Accelerate the Energy Transition, a new report aimed at defining and catalysing the actions that are needed. The report, written in collaboration with BloombergNEF and Dena, establishes nine 'AI for the energy transition principles' aimed at the energy industry, technology developers and policy-makers. If adopted, these principles would accelerate the uptake of AI solutions that serve the energy transition by creating a common understanding of what is needed to unlock AI’s potential and how to safely and responsibly adopt AI in the energy sector. Image: World Economic ForumThe principles define the actions that are needed to unlock AI’s potential in the energy sector across three critical domains:1. Governing the use of AI:Standards – implement compatible software standards and interoperable interfaces.Risk management – agree upon a common technology and education approach to managing the risks presented by AI.Responsibility – ensure that AI ethics and responsible use are at the core of AI development and deployment.2. Designing AI that’s fit for purpose:Automation – design generation equipment and grid operations for automation and increased autonomy of AI.Sustainability – adopt the most energy-efficient infrastructure as well as best practices around sustainable computing to limit the carbon footprint of AI.Design – focus AI development on usability and interpretability.3. Enabling the deployment of AI at scale:Data – establish data standards, data-sharing mechanisms and platforms to increase the availability and quality of data.Education – empower consumers and the energy workforce with a human-centred AI approach and invest in education to match technology and skill development.Incentives – create market designs and regulatory frameworks that allow AI use cases to capture the value that they create.AI is not a silver bullet, and no technology can replace aggressive political and corporate commitments to reducing emissions. But given the urgency, scale, and complexity of the global energy transition, we can’t afford to leave any tools in the toolbox. Used well, AI will accelerate the energy transition while expanding access to energy services, encouraging innovation, and ensuring a safe, resilient, and affordable clean energy system. It is time for industry players and policy makers to lay the foundations for this AI-enabled energy future, and to build a trusted and collaborative ecosystem around AI for the energy transition.Don't miss any update on Decarbonizing EnergySign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesEnergy TransitionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

As it prepares to launch the first cross-disciplinary institute for artificial intelligence (AI) at a liberal arts college, Colby today announced that Amanda Stent has been named the inaugural director of its Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Stent, who most recently served as the natural language processing (NLP) architect at Bloomberg L.P. and led the company’s People and Language AI Team, will assume her role in October.
Stent is considered one of the leading authorities on NLP, the branch of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to understand human text and spoken words. With an exceptional range of NLP experience at some of the country’s top companies, she has authored or co-authored more than 100 papers on natural language processing, regularly speaks or presents on the topic, and is co-inventor on more than 30 NLP-related patents. Her strong background in academia includes acting as co-principal investigator on a large National Science Foundation information technology research grant that graduated interdisciplinary students across psychology, linguistics, and computer science. Additionally, she was involved in the famous CALO (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) project that directly led to a wide range of AI and NLP applications, most notably the virtual assistant Siri.
“Amanda is the ideal person to build and lead the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence,” said President David A. Greene. “She is in the midst of a distinguished career overseeing large, complex teams of scientists, developing new technologies, and addressing algorithmic bias in machine learning. But she is a teacher and researcher at heart. Our students, faculty, and visitors to the Davis Institute will benefit from the clarity of her thinking, the depth of her knowledge, and the generosity of her spirit. She will establish the Davis Institute as a global model for how liberal arts colleges can shape the future of AI for the common good.” 
Colby announced earlier in the year that it had received a $30-million gift from the Davis family and trustee of its charitable foundation Andrew Davis ’85, LL.D. ’15, to establish the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The institute will provide new pathways for talented students and faculty to research, create, and apply AI and machine learning (ML) in a manner that is informed and driven by a broad liberal arts perspective.
“The mission of Colby’s Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence is to use AI creatively, while also preparing future leaders to predict and understand its impact, so negative impacts are mitigated and positive impacts are reinforced, and that’s exactly aligned with where I want to be in my career right now,” commented Stent. “Being at Colby will give me the opportunity to work with students and faculty across disciplines to not only use AI to inform those disciplines but ensure that all of those disciplines inform AI.”
Stent added that she also feels very strongly about undergraduate education and that it must include some component of studying AI. “AI will continue to have broad and profound societal impact, which means that the whole of society should have a say in what we do with it. For that to happen, each of us needs to have a foundational understanding of the nature of this technology.”
Inimitable Combination of Corporate and Academic Experience 
While at Bloomberg L.P., Stent was responsible for developing and overseeing the company’s strategy for using AI to understand and produce human language. This included product managing the engineering teams responsible for the NLP infrastructure that permitted the conversion of unstructured data (i.e. written and verbal content) into structured, actionable data quickly and at a consistently high level. For example, using AI to extract data from earnings calls or reports. She also developed new NLP-driven enterprise products and created and taught natural language processing courses for the company’s engineers and data scientists.
As principal research scientist and research director at Yahoo Labs, Stent managed a group of researchers who worked on various aspects of NLP as well as image and video processing. At AT&T Labs–Research she conducted pure and applied research on dialog systems, interactive data exploration, and assistive technology.
Before joining the private sector, Stent was a tenured associate professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, where she created an interdisciplinary computational linguistics graduate program and designed and taught new graduate courses in speech processing, natural language processing, and information retrieval. She also developed new undergraduate courses for the university, including a software engineering ethics class, and taught across the curriculum—from theory of computation to software engineering.
Stent is a member of the National Academy of Sciences’ working group on responsible computing research and co-author of The Princess at the Keyboard: Why Girls Should Become Computer Scientists. One of the research projects she plans to work on at Colby involves using computers and NLP to understand the scientific literature in different disciplines to help inform future scientific initiatives that can lead to new discoveries. She holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Rochester and a B.A. in mathematics from Houghton College.
AI Across Disciplines
The Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence will launch this fall with more than 20 courses and classes that have been retooled to include significant AI components. Extending across a wide range of departments, they will focus on everything from economic forecasting and linguistics to art and mathematics.
“Amanda brings a remarkable range of experiences in both academia and industry that make her exceptionally well-qualified to lead the Davis Institute,” said Margaret McFadden, provost and dean of faculty at Colby. “Our faculty colleagues are delighted to work with her on the project of integrating AI into the curriculum and their research programs, and their enthusiasm is clear from the number of AI-themed courses and projects that they have created for students this fall. Colby has a long and fruitful tradition of interdisciplinary collaboration, and I am confident that under Amanda’s leadership, the Davis Institute will enable faculty to work together in transformative and generative new ways.”
A key priority for Stent will involve working with departments in the hiring of new faculty experts in AI who will join a larger community of scholars at Colby currently using artificial intelligence in their research and teaching. She and the Institute will also support Colby faculty interested in exploring new ways to incorporate AI tools and methodologies into their teaching and research as well as design new courses to include meaningful learning opportunities with AI.
“While there’s certainly lots to do, I’m currently working on setting up a series of lectures and discussions with various leaders in the AI space, and I’m also thinking about incorporating AI into Colby’s Jan Plan term that will involve different areas, including art and the College’s wonderful museum,” said Stent. “On a parallel track, I hope to quickly create some fantastic undergraduate collaborative projects with faculty that we can showcase and use to begin to build a thriving and dynamic community that wants to learn about and speak critically, as well as creatively, to the development of AI.”
The Davis Institute will build upon existing partnerships and develop new relationships with leading organizations and institutions to facilitate significant faculty and student research using rich datasets with real-world consequences and to provide students with broad-ranging opportunities for internships. It will also create a summer program for visiting faculty and students to work on AI projects and to develop courses and research projects that can be shared at their home institutions. In these ways, the Davis Institute will become a national center for training faculty and students in the use of AI and the creation of new systems and capabilities.

Machine learning is the process of using computers to detect patterns in massive datasets and then make predictions based on what the computer learns from those patterns. This makes machine learning a specific and narrow type of artificial intelligence. Full artificial intelligence involves machines that can perform abilities we associate with the minds of human beings and intelligent animals, such as perceiving, learning, and problem solving.All machine learning is based on algorithms. In general, algorithms are sets of specific instructions that a computer uses to solve problems. In machine learning, algorithms are rules for how to analyze data using statistics. Machine learning systems use these rules to identify relationships between data inputs and desired outputs–usually  predictions. To get started, scientists give machine learning systems a set of training data. The systems apply their algorithms to this data to train themselves how to analyze similar inputs they receive in the future.One area where machine learning shows huge promise is detecting cancer in computer tomography (CT) imaging. First, researchers assemble as many CT images as possible to use as training data. Some of these images show tissue with cancerous cells, and some show healthy tissues. Researchers also assemble information on what to look for in an image to identify cancer. For example, this might include what the boundaries of cancerous tumors look like. Next, they create rules on the relationship between data in the images and what doctors know about identifying cancer. Then they give these rules and the training data to the machine learning system. The system uses the rules and the training data to teach itself how to recognize cancerous tissue. Finally, the system gets a new patient’s CT images. Using what it has learned, the system decides which images show signs of cancer, faster than any human could. Doctors could use the system’s predictions to aid in the decision about whether a patient has cancer and how to treat it.The way training data is set up divides machine learning systems into two broad types: supervised and unsupervised. If the training data is labeled, the system is supervised. Labeled data tells the system what the data is. For example, CT images could be labeled to indicate cancerous lesions or tumors next to tissues that are healthy. Basically, this means the machine learning system learns by example. Labeling data can be very time consuming for the large amounts of data required for training datasets.If the training data is not labeled, the machine learning system is unsupervised. In the cancer scan example, an unsupervised machine learning system would be given a huge number of CT scans and information on tumor types, then left to teach itself what to look for to recognize cancer. This frees human beings from needing to label the data used in the training process. The disadvantage of unsupervised learning is that the results may not be as accurate because of the lack of explicit labels.Some machine learning systems can improve their abilities based on feedback received on the predictions. These are called reinforcement machine learning systems. For example, the system could be told the results of doctors’ other tests of whether patients have cancer or not. The system could then tweak its algorithms to produce more accurate predictions in the future.DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Machine LearningThe Department of Energy Office of Science supports research on machine learning through its Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. ASCR has a portfolio of data management, data analysis, computer technology, and related research that all contribute to machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of this portfolio, DOE owns some of the world’s most capable supercomputers.The DOE Office of Science as a whole is committed to the use of machine learning to support scientific research. Science depends on big data, and Office of Science user facilities such as particle accelerators and X-ray light sources generate mountains of it. Using machine learning, researchers are identifying patterns or designs in data from these facilities that are difficult or impossible for humans to detect, at speeds that are hundreds to thousands of times faster than traditional data analysis techniques.Fast FactsThe newest of DOE’s supercomputers—Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory—has an architecture especially well-suited for artificial intelligence applications.Machine learning allows scientists to analyze quantities of data that were previously inaccessible.DOE-funded researchers have used machine learning to develop new cancer screening, better understand the properties of water, and autonomously steer experiments.Physics-informed machine learning uses deep neural networks that can be trained to incorporate specific laws of physics to solve supervised learning tasks and scientific problems.Machine learning algorithms are not a silver bullet. The development of machine learning systems is susceptible to human error and biases and requires the same careful design as software engineering.ResourcesDOE Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing Research programDOE Office of Science Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning InitiativeDOE’s Executive Guide to Artificial Intelligence(link is external)Report to Congress(link is external) on DOE support for artificial intelligence and machine learningScience highlight: Machine Learning Accelerates Metamaterial DesignScience highlight: Machine Learning Speeds Molecular Motion ModelingScience highlight: Machine Learning System Improves Accelerator DiagnosticsScience highlight: Breakthrough Reported in Machine Learning-Enhanced Quantum ChemistryFeature: Stargazing with Computers: What Machine Learning Can Teach Us About the CosmosFeature: What Can Science Gain from Computers that Learn?Learn how machine learning helps advance fusion power research(link is external). Scientific terms can be confusing. DOE Explains offers straightforward explanations of key words and concepts in fundamental science.

Almost 80% of the ranch workers and related labor force are locked in and withdrawn dependent on the seasonal perspectives. This is the biggest reason why the rural Indian job market is still suffering..Ways AI Can Help in the Fight Against Unemployment in Rural India:.Drone Operators.Drones are the eventual fate of horticulture. IoT and AI-empowered drones could assist with recognizing the different regions that need quick human consideration. Drone makers can utilize the rural population, train them and assist with dealing with the agribusiness drones. These drone administrators can assist with distinguishing irritations, flooding, dry season, and yield wastage..Precision Animal Husbandry and Agriculture.Precision Agriculture or PA, it is seen that animal husbandry and agriculture are boosting the job market in rural India. PA can assist in finding the best mating seasons for numerous cattle and avian populations. The creation of milk, grain, eggs, meat, and leather can be developed dramatically with the consideration of Predictive science in cultivating and animal husbandry. Organizations like Intel, Google AI, IBM Watson, and Microsoft could assume a larger part in carrying PA to the focal point of the agricultural AI biological system..Executives in Micro-Seeding Projects.Like microfinancing, we would discover no less than one-fifth of the country India populace occupied with miniature cultivating projects. The leaders in micro-cultivating undertakings could come generally from the informed portion of the provincial populace who are essential science graduates. These science graduates could be prepared in government-subsidized AI IoT programs. Artificial intelligence, machine learning use case in farming would open the work market for instructed youth with remunerating profession openings lined up with the country and Agri-based framework..Farm Planning with Data Visualizers.Indian cultivating remains exceptionally unstructured, to a great extent because of the piece-land reservations. Deforestation, metropolitan disarray, and streamlined advances are add-ons to the list of difficulties. Data visualization organizations could utilize a huge piece of the country populace who comprehend the homestead arranging guide better compared to other people. By utilizing robotics in agriculture and machine learning use cases in agriculture, we could see information perception turning into the middle stone of each homestead arranging project in India. Projects like Microsoft AI for Earth are a model. The rustic economy could be prepared to work with AI for Earth undertakings to evaluate the danger of dry season, flooding, and wildfire..In conclusion, technologies like AI and machine learning have great potential to change the current scenario of rural India..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Welcome to AI book reviews, a series of posts that explore the latest literature on artificial intelligence.
Recent advances in deep learning have rekindled interest in the imminence of machines that can think and act like humans, or artificial general intelligence. By following the path of building bigger and better neural networks, the thinking goes, we will be able to get closer and closer to creating a digital version of the human brain.
But this is a myth, argues computer scientist Erik Larson, and all evidence suggests that human and machine intelligence are radically different. Larson’s new book, The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do, discusses how widely publicized misconceptions about intelligence and inference have led AI research down narrow paths that are limiting innovation and scientific discoveries.
And unless scientists, researchers, and the organizations that support their work don’t change course, Larson warns, they will be doomed to “resignation to the creep of a machine-land, where genuine invention is sidelined in favor of futuristic talk advocating current approaches, often from entrenched interests.”

The myth of artificial intelligence
The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, by Erik J. Larson
From a scientific standpoint, the myth of AI assumes that we will achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) by making progress on narrow applications, such as classifying images, understanding voice commands, or playing games. But the technologies underlying these narrow AI systems do not address the broader challenges that must be solved for general intelligence capabilities, such as holding basic conversations, accomplishing simple chores in a house, or other tasks that require common sense.
“As we successfully apply simpler, narrow versions of intelligence that benefit from faster computers and lots of data, we are not making incremental progress, but rather picking the low-hanging fruit,” Larson writes.
The cultural consequence of the myth of AI is ignoring the scientific mystery of intelligence and endlessly talking about ongoing progress on deep learning and other contemporary technologies. This myth discourages scientists from thinking about new ways to tackle the challenge of intelligence.
“We are unlikely to get innovation if we choose to ignore a core mystery rather than face it up,” Larson writes. “A healthy culture for innovation emphasizes exploring unknowns, not hyping extensions of existing methods… Mythology about inevitable success in AI tends to extinguish the very culture of invention necessary for real progress.”
Deductive, inductive, and abductive inference

You step out of your home and notice that the street is wet. Your first thought is that it must have been raining. But it’s sunny and the sidewalk is dry, so you immediately cross out the possibility of rain. As you look to the side, you see a road wash tanker parked down the street. You conclude that the road is wet because the tanker washed it.
This is an example “inference,” the act of going from observations to conclusions, and is the basic function of intelligent beings. We’re constantly inferring things based on what we know and what we perceive. Most of it happens subconsciously, in the background of our mind, without focus and direct attention.
“Any system that infers must have some basic intelligence, because the very act of using what is known and what is observed to update beliefs is inescapably tied up with what we mean by intelligence,” Larson writes.  
AI researchers base their systems on two types of inference machines: deductive and inductive. Deductive inference uses prior knowledge to reason about the world. This is the basis of symbolic artificial intelligence, the main focus of researchers in the early decades of AI. Engineers create symbolic systems by endowing them with a predefined set of rules and facts, and the AI uses this knowledge to reason about the data it receives.
Inductive inference, which has gained more traction among AI researchers and tech companies in the past decade, is the acquisition of knowledge through experience. Machine learning algorithms are inductive inference engines. An ML model trained on relevant examples will find patterns that map inputs to outputs. In recent years, AI researchers have used machine learning, big data, and advanced processors to train models on tasks that were beyond the capacity of symbolic systems.
A third type of reasoning, abductive inference, was first introduced by American scientist Charles Sanders Peirce in the 19th century. Abductive inference is the cognitive ability to come up with intuitions and hypotheses, to make guesses that are better than random stabs at the truth.

For example, there can be numerous reasons for the street to be wet (including some that we haven’t directly experienced before), but abductive inference enables us to select the most promising hypotheses, quickly eliminate the wrong ones, look for new ones and reach a reliable conclusion. As Larson puts it in The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, “We guess, out of a background of effectively infinite possibilities, which hypotheses seem likely or plausible.”
Abductive inference is what many refer to as “common sense.” It is the conceptual framework within which we view facts or data and the glue that brings the other types of inference together. It enables us to focus at any moment on what’s relevant among the ton of information that exists in our mind and the ton of data we’re receiving through our senses.
The problem is that the AI community hasn’t paid enough attention to abductive inference.
AI and abductive inference
Abduction entered the AI discussion with attempts at Abductive Logic Programming in the 1980s and 1990s, but those efforts were flawed and later abandoned. “They were reformulations of logic programming, which is a variant of deduction,” Larson told TechTalks.
Erik J. Larson, author of “The Myth of Artificial Intelligence”
Abduction got another chance in the 2010s as Bayesian networks, inference engines that try to compute causality. But like the earlier approaches, the newer approaches shared the flaw of not capturing true abduction, Larson said, adding that Bayesian and other graphical models “are variants of induction.” In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, he refers to them as “abduction in name only.”
For the most part, the history of AI has been dominated by deduction and induction.
“When the early AI pioneers like [Alan] Newell, [Herbert] Simon, [John] McCarthy, and [Marvin] Minsky took up the question of artificial inference (the core of AI), they assumed that writing deductive-style rules would suffice to generate intelligent thought and action,” Larson said. “That was never the case, really, as should have been earlier acknowledged in discussions about how we do science.”
For decades, researchers tried to expand the powers of symbolic AI systems by providing them with manually written rules and facts. The premise was that if you endow an AI system with all the knowledge that humans know, it will be able to act as smartly as humans. But pure symbolic AI has failed for various reasons. Symbolic systems can’t acquire and add new knowledge, which makes them rigid. Creating symbolic AI becomes an endless chase of adding new facts and rules only to find the system making new mistakes that it can’t fix. And much of our knowledge is implicit and cannot be expressed in rules and facts and fed to symbolic systems. 
“It’s curious here that no one really explicitly stopped and said ‘Wait. This is not going to work!’” Larson said. “That would have shifted research directly towards abduction or hypothesis generation or, say, ‘context-sensitive inference.’”
In the past two decades, with the growing availability of data and compute resources, machine learning algorithms—especially deep neural networks—have become the focus of attention in the AI community. Deep learning technology has unlocked many applications that were previously beyond the limits of computers. And it has attracted interest and money from some of the wealthiest companies in the world.
“I think with the advent of the World Wide Web, the empirical or inductive (data-centric) approaches took over, and abduction, as with deduction, was largely forgotten,” Larson said.
But machine learning systems also suffer from severe limits, including the lack of causality, poor handling of edge cases, and the need for too much data. And these limits are becoming more evident and problematic as researchers try to apply ML to sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance.
Abductive inference and future paths of AI

Some scientists, including reinforcement learning pioneer Richard Sutton, believe that we should stick to methods that can scale with the availability of data and computation, namely learning and search. For example, as neural networks grow bigger and are trained on more data, they will eventually overcome their limits and lead to new breakthroughs.
Larson dismisses the scaling up of data-driven AI as “fundamentally flawed as a model for intelligence.” While both search and learning can provide useful applications, they are based on non-abductive inference, he reiterates.
“Search won’t scale into commonsense or abductive inference without a revolution in thinking about inference, which hasn’t happened yet. Similarly with machine learning, the data-driven nature of learning approaches means essentially that the inferences have to be in the data, so to speak, and that’s demonstrably not true of many intelligent inferences that people routinely perform,” Larson said. “We don’t just look to the past, captured, say, in a large dataset, to figure out what to conclude or think or infer about the future.”
Other scientists believe that hybrid AI that brings together symbolic systems and neural networks will have a bigger promise of dealing with the shortcomings of deep learning. One example is IBM Watson, which became famous when it beat world champions at Jeopardy! More recent proof-of-concept hybrid models have shown promising results in applications where symbolic AI and deep learning alone perform poorly.
Larson believes that hybrid systems can fill in the gaps in machine learning–only or rules-based–only approaches. As a researcher in the field of natural language processing, he is currently working on combining large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 with older work on the semantic web in the form of knowledge graphs to create better applications in search, question answering, and other tasks.
“But deduction-induction combos don’t get us to abduction, because the three types of inference are formally distinct, so they don’t reduce to each other and can’t be combined to get a third,” he said.
In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, Larson describes attempts to circumvent abduction as the “inference trap.”
“Purely inductively inspired techniques like machine learning remain inadequate, no matter how fast computers get, and hybrid systems like Watson fall short of general understanding as well,” he writes. “In open-ended scenarios requiring knowledge about the world like language understanding, abduction is central and irreplaceable. Because of this, attempts at combining deductive and inductive strategies are always doomed to fail… The field needs a fundamental theory of abduction. In the meantime, we are stuck in traps.”
The commercialization of AI

The AI community’s narrow focus on data-driven approaches has centralized research and innovation in a few organizations that have vast stores of data and deep pockets. With deep learning becoming a useful way to turn data into profitable products, big tech companies are now locked in a tight race to hire AI talent, driving researchers away from academia by offering them lucrative salaries.
This shift has made it very difficult for non-profit labs and small companies to become involved in AI research.
“When you tie research and development in AI to the ownership and control of very large datasets, you get a barrier to entry for start-ups, who don’t own the data,” Larson said, adding that data-driven AI intrinsically creates “winner-take-all” scenarios in the commercial sector.
The monopolization of AI is in turn hampering scientific research. With big tech companies focusing on creating applications in which they can leverage their vast data resources to maintain the edge over their competitors, there’s little incentive to explore alternative approaches to AI. Work in the field starts to skew toward narrow and profitable applications at the expense of efforts that can lead to new inventions.
“No one at present knows how AI would look in the absence of such gargantuan centralized datasets, so there’s nothing really on offer for entrepreneurs looking to compete by designing different and more powerful AI,” Larson said.
In his book, Larson warns about the current culture of AI, which “is squeezing profits out of low-hanging fruit, while continuing to spin AI mythology.” The illusion of progress on artificial general intelligence can lead to another AI winter, he writes.
But while an AI winter might dampen interest in deep learning and data-driven AI, it can open the way for a new generation of thinkers to explore new pathways. Larson hopes scientists start looking beyond existing methods.
In The Myth of Artificial Intelligence, Larson provides an inference framework that sheds light on the challenges that the field faces today and helps readers to see through the overblown claims about progress toward AGI or singularity.
“My hope is that non-specialists have some tools to combat this kind of inevitability thinking, which isn’t scientific, and that my colleagues and other AI scientists can view it as a wake-up call to get to work on the very real problems the field faces,” Larson said.

The use of artificial intelligence in the hiring process has increased in recent years with companies turning to automated assessments, digital interviews, and data analytics to parse through resumes and screen candidates. But as IT strives for better diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), it turns out AI can do more harm than help if companies aren’t strategic and thoughtful about how they implement the technology.
“The bias usually comes from the data. If you don’t have a representative data set, or any number of characteristics that you decide on, then of course you’re not going to be properly, finding and evaluating applicants,” says Jelena Kovačević, IEEE Fellow, William R. Berkley Professor, and Dean of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
The chief issue with AI’s use in hiring is that, in an industry that has been predominantly male and white for decades, the historical data on which AI hiring systems are built will ultimately have an inherent bias. Without diverse historical data sets to train AI algorithms, AI hiring tools are very likely to carry the same biases that have existed in tech hiring since the 1980s. Still, used effectively, AI can help create a more efficient and fair hiring process, experts say.
 
 
 













 
 

The dangers of bias in AI
Because AI algorithms are typically trained on past data, bias with AI is always a concern. In data science, bias is defined as an error that arises from faulty assumptions in the learning algorithm. Train your algorithms with data that doesn’t reflect the current landscape, and you will derive erroneous results. As such, with hiring, especially in an industry like IT, that has had historical issues with diversity, training an algorithm on historical hiring data can be a big mistake.

“It’s really hard to ensure a piece of AI software isn’t inherently biased or has biased effects,” says Ben Winters, an AI and human rights fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. While steps can be taken to avoid this, he adds, “many systems have been shown to have biased effects based on race and disability.”
If you don’t have appreciable diversity in your data set, then it’s impossible for an algorithm to know how individuals from underrepresented groups would have performed in the past. Instead, your algorithm will be biased toward what your data set represents and will compare all future candidates to that archetype, says Kovačević.
 
 
 













 
 

“For example, if Black people were systematically excluded from the past, and if you had no women in the pipeline in the past, and you create an algorithm based on that, there is no way the future will be properly predicted. If you hire only from ‘Ivy League schools,’ then you really don’t know how an applicant from a lesser-known school will perform, so there are several layers of bias,” she says.
Wendy Rentschler, head of corporate social responsibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion at BMC Software, is keenly aware of the potential negatives that AI can bring to the hiring process. She points to an infamous case of Amazon’s attempt at developing an AI recruiting tool as a prime example: The company had to shut the project down because the algorithm discriminated against women.
“If the largest and greatest software company can’t do it, I give great pause to all the HR tech and their claims of being able to do it,” says Rentschler.
 
 
 













 
 

Some AI hiring software companies make big claims, but whether their software can help determine the right candidate remains to be seen. The technology can help companies streamline the hiring process and find new ways of identifying qualified candidates using AI, but it’s important not to let lofty claims cloud judgment.

If you’re trying to improve DEI in your organization, AI can seem like a quick fix or magic bullet, but if you’re not strategic about your use of AI in the hiring process, it can backfire. The key is to ensure your hiring process and the tools you’re using aren’t excluding traditionally underrepresented groups.
Discrimination with AI
It’s up to companies to ensure they’re using AI in the hiring process as ethically as possible and not falling victim to overblown claims of what the tools can do. Matthew Scherer, senior policy counsel for worker privacy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, points out that, since the HR department doesn’t generate revenue and is usually labeled as an expense, leaders are sometimes eager to bring in automation technology that can help cut costs. That eagerness, however, can cause companies to overlook potential negatives of the software they’re using. Scherer also notes that a lot of the claims made by AI hiring software companies are often overblown, if not completely false.
 
 
 













 
 

“Particularly tools that claim to do things like analyze people’s facial expressions, their tone of voice, anything that measures aspects of personality — that’s snake oil,” he says.
At best, tools that claim to measure tone of voice, expressions, and other aspects of a candidate’s personality in, for example, a video interview are “measuring how culturally ‘normal’ a person is,” which can ultimately exclude candidates with disabilities or any candidate that doesn’t fit what the algorithm determines is a typical candidate. These tools can also put disabled candidates in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether they should disclose any disabilities before the interview process. Disabled candidates may have concerns that if they don’t disclose, they won’t get the right accommodations needed for the automated assessment, but they might not be comfortable disclosing a disability that early in the hiring process, or at all.
And as Rentschler points out, BIPOC, women, and candidates with disabilities are often accustomed to the practice of “code switching” in interviews — which is when underrepresented groups make certain adjustments to the way they speak, appear or behave, in order to make others more comfortable. In this case, AI systems might pick up on that and incorrectly identify their behavior as inauthentic or dishonest, turning away potentially strong candidates.
 
 
 













 
 

Scherer says discrimination laws fall into two categories: disparate impact, which is unintentional discrimination; and disparate treatment, which is intentional discrimination. It’s difficult to design a tool that can avoid disparate impact “without explicitly favoring candidates from particular groups, which would constitute disparate treatment under federal law.”
Regulations in AI hiring
AI is a relatively new technology, leaving oversight scant when it comes to legislation, policies, and laws around privacy and trade practices. Winters points to a 2019 FTC complaint filed by EPIC alleging HireVue was using deceptive business practices related to the use of facial recognition in its hiring software.
HireVue claimed to offer software that “tracks and analyzes the speech and facial movements of candidates to be able to analyze fit, emotional intelligence, communication skills, cognitive ability, problem solving ability, and more.” HireVue ultimately pulled back on its facial recognition claims and the use of the technology in its software.
 
 
 













 
 

But there’s similar technology out there that uses games to “purportedly measure subjective behavioral attributes and match with organizational fit” or that will use AI to “crawl the internet for publicly available information about statements by a candidate then analyze it for potential red flags or fit,” according to Winters.
There’s also concerns around the amount of data that AI can collect on a candidate while analyzing their video interviews, assessments, resumes, LinkedIn profiles, or other public social media profiles. Oftentimes, candidates might not even know they’re being analyzed by AI tools in the interview process and there are few regulations on how that data is managed.
“Overall, there is currently very little oversight for AI hiring tools. Several state or local bills have been introduced. However, many of these bills have significant loopholes — namely not applying to government agencies and offering significant workarounds. The future of regulation in AI-supported hiring should require significant transparency, controls on the application of these tools, strict data collection, use, and retention limits, and independent third-party testing that is published freely,” says Winters.
 
 
 













 
 

Responsible use of AI in hiring
Rentschler and her team at BMC have focused on finding ways to use AI to help the company’s “human capital be more strategic.” They’ve implemented tools that screen candidates quickly using skills-based assessments for the role they’re applying to. BMC has also used AI to identify problematic language in its job descriptions, ensuring they’re gender-neutral and inclusive. BMC has also employed the software to connect new hires with their benefits and internal organizational information during the onboarding process. Rentschler’s objective is to find ways to implement AI and automation that can help the humans on her team do their jobs more effectively, rather than replace them.

While AI algorithms can carry inherent bias based on historical hiring data, one way to avoid this is to focus more on skills-based hiring. Rentschler’s team only uses AI tools to identify candidates who have specific skill sets they’re looking to add to their workforce, and ignores any other identifiers such as education, gender, names, and other potentially identifying information that might have historically excluded a candidate from the process. By doing this, she has hired candidates from unexpected backgrounds, Rentschler says, including a Syrian refugee who was originally a dentist, but also had some coding experience. Because the system was focused only on looking for candidates with coding skills, the former dentist made it past the filter and was hired by the company.
Other ethical strategies include having checks and balances in place. Scherer consulted with a company that designed a tool to send potential candidates to a recruiter, who would then review their resumes and decide whether they were a good fit for the job. Even if that recruiter rejected a resume, the candidate’s resume would still be put through the algorithm again, and if it was flagged as a good potential candidate, it would be sent to another recruiter who wouldn’t know it was already reviewed by someone else on the team. This ensures that resumes were being double-checked by humans and that they aren’t relying solely on AI to determined qualified candidates. It also ensures that recruiters aren’t overlooking qualified candidates.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s important that the human retains the judgment and doesn’t just rely on what the machine says. And that’s the thing that is hard to train for, because the easiest thing for a human recruiter to do will always be to just say, ‘I’m going to just go with whatever the machine tells me if the company is expecting me to use that tool,’” says Scherer.

Making the case for artificial intelligence What risks to society go hand in hand with speed and convenience?  


                      University of Utah Communications                                                                






Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened myriad possibilities to make life better—faster, more efficient, cheaper. At the same time, using data and machines to speed things up has also increased the chances of lost human connections, missed steps in deliberation, and over-simplification of life’s messiness.
The Utah Informatics Initiative (UI2) and Tanner Humanities Center are hosting a virtual symposium Sept. 21 and 22 to explore the facets of AI’s role in society.
The University of Utah is uniquely situated as the host for these discussions, said Mike Kirby, UI2 director. The U has a notable cohort of researchers studying informatics, data science and machine learning, while working alongside interdisciplinary partners in the humanities and arts. “That crossover allows us to really dig into the thorny ethical questions raised by technological advances,” Kirby said.
Moshe Vardi
On the first day, keynote speaker Moshe Vardi will talk about “Ethics Washing in AI.” Vardi, director of Rice University’s Initiative on Technology, Culture and Society, says many companies have developed internal ethical standards after several incidents of AI and Machine Learning going wrong: self-driving cars on autopilot crashing, face-recognition software disproportionately targeting dark-skinned people. But those much-touted standards could be superficial, Vardi said.
“Talk is cheap. ‘Ethics washing’ — also called ‘ethics theater’— is the practice of fabricating or exaggerating a company’s interest in equitable AI systems that work for everyone. An example is when a company promotes ‘AI for good’ initiatives with one hand, while selling surveillance tech to governments and corporate customers with the other,” Vardi added.
“I will argue that the ethical lens is too narrow. The real issue is how to deal with technology’s impact on society. Technology is driving the future, but who is doing the steering?”
Vardi will discuss with symposium attendees in a question-and-answer session moderated by Kirby.
On the event’s second day, six U researchers will present their work using, or examining, artificial intelligence:

Lisa Swanstrom
Trafton Drew
Eliane Wiese
Aniello De Santo
Alan Kuntz
Bei Wang

Following the presentations, Vardi, Tanner Humanities Center Director Erika George and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Dan Reed will participate in a panel discussion moderated by Professor Valerio Pascucci.

In its third year, the Informatics Initiative was established by Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Dan Reed to build on the university’s existing education, research and workforce development strengths in data science. The initiative is funded using annual performance-based funding from the Utah Legislature.

The use of AI language models to generate text for business applications is gaining steam. Large companies are deploying their own systems, while others are leveraging models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 via APIs. According to OpenAI, GPT-3 is now being used in over 300 apps by thousands of developers, producing an average of more than 4.5 billion novel words per day.
But while recent language models are impressively fluent, they have a tendency to write falsehoods ranging from factual inaccuracies to potentially harmful disinformation. To quantify the risks associated with “deceptive” models, researchers at the University of Oxford and OpenAI created a dataset called TruthfulQA that contains questions some humans might answer incorrectly due to false beliefs or misconceptions. The researchers found that while the best-performing model was truthful on 58% of questions, it fell short of human performance at 94%.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



TruthfulQA
In the subfield of AI known as natural language processing (NLP), robustness testing can be the exception rather than the norm.  One report found that 60% to 70% of answers given by NLP models were embedded somewhere in the benchmark training sets, indicating that the models were usually simply memorizing answers. Another study found that metrics used to benchmark AI and machine learning models tended to be inconsistent, irregularly tracked, and not particularly informative.
TruthfulQA aims to avoid these benchmarking pitfalls with a bank of questions about health, law, finance, and politics that requires models to avoid generating false answers learned from text. The dataset spans 817 questions in 38 different categories. Researchers worded the questions such that some humans and models might answer falsely.
The team tested several different models on TruthfulQA, including GPT-3; GPT-3 predecessor GPT-2; open source versions of GPT-3 called GPT-Neo and GPT-J; and UnifiedQA, a model fine-tuned on question-answer tasks. To classify answers from the models as either true or false, the team developed “GPT-judge,” an algorithm trained on answers to TruthfulQA questions from all of the evaluated models.
Above: Examples of falsehoods generated by models tested on the dataset.
Interestingly, the results show that larger models generally perform worse than smaller models in the same family. The size of a model is measured by the number of parameters it contains — variables internal to the model that the model learns from historical training data. For example, the largest GPT-Neo and GPT-J models were 17% less truthful (as measured by TruthfulQA) than a model 60 times as small. Meanwhile, UnifiedQA did better on truthfulness than the three GPT families, with the largest model performing only slightly worse than the smallest.
When forced to choose from multiple responses rather than generate answers themselves, larger models also performed worse on TruthfulQA than smaller ones. No models significantly outperformed random guessing. And even the “best” model gave false answers 42% of the time, versus 6% for human participants. (Eighty-seven percent of the humans’ answers were true on TruthfulQA.)advertisement
The researchers speculate that the models haven’t learned the training distribution well enough or that the models’ training objectives actually incentivize false answers. “We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web,” the researchers wrote in a preprint paper, “TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehood.” They added: “[Our preliminary work finds] that today’s large models are much less truthful than humans.”
Large language models
The work adds to growing skepticism that the size of language models — and their training datasets — correspond to performance.  Earlier this month, a team of Google researchers published a study claiming that a model much smaller than GPT-3, fine-tuned language net (FLAN), bests GPT-3 by a large margin on a number of challenging benchmarks. And scientists at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria found that GPT-3 underperforms in domains like biomedicine compared with smaller, less architecturally complex but carefully fine-tuned models.advertisement
Maria Antoniak, a natural language processing researcher and data scientist at Cornell University, says that when it comes to natural language, the question of whether larger models are the right approach is still open. While some of the best benchmark performance scores today come from large datasets and models, the payoff from dumping enormous amounts of data into models is uncertain.
“The current structure of the field is task-focused, where the community gathers together to try to solve specific problems on specific datasets,” Antoniak told VentureBeat in a previous interview. “These tasks are usually very structured and can have their own weaknesses, so while they help our field move forward in some ways, they can also constrain us. Large models perform well on these tasks, but whether these tasks can ultimately lead us to any true language understanding is up for debate.”

Artificial Intelligence-based technologies have the potential of becoming tools used to promote equity and provide personalized learning.The use of AI and other technologies in colleges and universities open the doors of higher education to all disregarding where in the world they live. Location and time become a thing of the past while curiosity, creativity, and collaboration are encouraged and supported; students become global students, and universities become borderless.In fact, a Stanford University study on Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 shows how interactive machine tutors can be matched to students for a more focused and personalized learning experience.Today’s students will become the leaders of tomorrow. Higher education leaders who know the benefits that AI can provide have the responsibility of equipping their institution with the AI that will be able to assess students, provide feedback, and test scientific hypotheses just as well as a human can. Perhaps even better. AI in higher education: Current status, looking into the future  AI will become a norm in every aspect of higher education / Source: Microsoft ResearchIn a survey conducted by Microsoft Research (MSR) in collaboration with Times Higher Education (THE), global university leaders provided feedback on the benefits of AI and its current status in higher education: Only a minority of universities currently have an AI strategy, but most plan to develop oneUniversities find it difficult to recruit and retain staff able to teach and research in AIAI will increase employers’ demand for university graduates and will not lead to university closuresAI will be able to assess students, provide feedback, and generate a test scientific hypotheses at least as well as humans canBut universities will not cut teaching, research, or administration staff and may even recruit moreMost of the survey respondents agreed that AI will complement rather than replace human scientific input, a true human+machine collaboration resulting in a powerful combination of skills. The survey evaluated the possibility of AI replacing humans in the lab doing the routine tasks. In this matter, the vast majority of respondents disagree that AI will decrease demand for humans in the lab, including research assistants, at least over the next 20 years. Twenty percent of respondents, however, expect such demand for humans in the lab to drop. In contrast, 72 percent do not believe this will happen and 46 percent strongly disagree with the suggestion. Students today. Leaders tomorrowAll students must be taught specific technical skills which will allow them to program and interact with Artificial Intelligence in the future. Subjects and courses in ethics and philosophy as well as a focus on skills where AI is less likely to have an advantage such as complex decision making, critical thinking, entrepreneurship, and emotional intelligence will become part of a basic education to provide tools that will help them live and work with Artificial Intelligence. Academic leadership should also consider that what students study today may well change. “Students across the world will have to face the possibility that perhaps what they are dedicating their lives to studying right now may soon become redundant,” said one of the students participating in a survey. Every industry is adapting and changing toward digital transformation and Industry 4.0. University leadership must embrace Education 4.0 in order to remain relevant. In time, those institutions which resist change and are unable to adapt, those that do not embrace AI will not remain competitive. They will have to make redundancies to try to survive, but in the end, they will become redundant themselves, indeed. Only change remains forever constant. Embracing change is paramount for every institution in higher education.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — Artificial intelligence has reached a critical turning point in its evolution, according to a new report by an international panel of experts assessing the state of the field. 
Substantial advances in language processing, computer vision and pattern recognition mean that AI is touching people’s lives on a daily basis — from helping people to choose a movie to aiding in medical diagnoses. With that success, however, comes a renewed urgency to understand and mitigate the risks and downsides of AI-driven systems, such as algorithmic discrimination or use of AI for deliberate deception. Computer scientists must work with experts in the social sciences and law to assure that the pitfalls of AI are minimized.
Those conclusions are from a report titled “Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms: The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) 2021 Study Panel Report,” which was compiled by a panel of experts from computer science, public policy, psychology, sociology and other disciplines. AI100 is an ongoing project hosted by the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence that aims to monitor the progress of AI and guide its future development. This new report, the second to be released by the AI100 project, assesses developments in AI between 2016 and 2021.
“In the past five years, AI has made the leap from something that mostly happens in research labs or other highly controlled settings to something that’s out in society affecting people’s lives,” said Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University who chaired the report panel. “That’s really exciting, because this technology is doing some amazing things that we could only dream about five or 10 years ago. But at the same time, the field is coming to grips with the societal impact of this technology, and I think the next frontier is thinking about ways we can get the benefits from AI while minimizing the risks.”
The report, released on Thursday, Sept. 16, is structured to answer a set of 14  questions probing critical areas of AI development. The questions were developed by the AI100 standing committee consisting of a renowned group of AI leaders. The committee then assembled a panel of 17 researchers and experts to answer them. The questions include “What are the most important advances in AI?” and “What are the most inspiring open grand challenges?” Other questions address the major risks and dangers of AI, its effects on society, its public perception and the future of the field.

""Cirrascale is thrilled to bring Cerebras’ world-class artificial intelligence (AI) compute power to the cloud – we are truly democratizing AI by broadening deep learning access and enabling large-scale commercial deployments across leading Fortune 500 customers, research organizations and innovative startups,” said PJ Go, CEO, Cirrascale Cloud Services. “The Cerebras Cloud @ Cirrascale will advance the future of deep learning and greatly accelerate the performance of AI workloads, all through a single device that is easy to use and simple to deploy.”

Cerebras Cloud delivers the wall-clock training performance of many 10s to 100s of GPUs for training and inference workloads on a single CS-2 system, enabling cluster-scale performance with single-node programming simplicity with standard ML frameworks. In a recent comparison, a Cerebras system showed 9.5x faster training time to accuracy on a BERT-type model for NLP compared to an 8-GPU server. Since training time does not scale linearly with GPUs, users would need more than 120 GPUs to train the model to the same accuracy as a single CS-2. The WSE-2 powering the Cerebras Cloud uniquely handles fine-grained and dynamic sparsity that are common in neural network workloads, but are challenging for traditional processors.

""We are excited to partner with Cirrascale and introduce the Cerebras Cloud @ Cirrascale, bringing the power and performance of our CS-2 system to more customers looking to glean world-changing insights from massive datasets sooner,” said Andrew Feldman, CEO and Co-Founder of Cerebras. “We designed the WSE-2 with 850,000 AI-optimized cores so that the CS-2 system at the foundation of the Cerebras Cloud @ Cirrascale offering can deliver cluster-scale acceleration of AI workloads easily with a single system, thereby enabling customers to deploy solutions faster, using large, state-of-the-art models for training or inference.”

The Cerebras Cloud @ Cirrascale is currently available in weekly or monthly flat-rate allotments with discounts offered for longer-term use with predictable pricing and no extra charges. Additionally, Cirrascale can easily integrate its Cerebras Cloud with a customer’s current online cloud-based workflow at various hyperscalers, creating a secure, multi-cloud solution.

With every component optimized for AI work, the Cerebras Cloud @ Cirrascale delivers more compute performance at less space and less power than any other solution. Depending on workload, from AI to HPC, it delivers hundreds or thousands of times more performance than legacy alternatives, but uses only a fraction of the space and power.

Creating a More Resilient Energy Grid Through Artificial Intelligence
September 20, 20214 min read

Stony Brook University professor Peng Zhang, a SUNY Empire Innovation professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is leading a statewide team of collaborators in developing “AI-Grid,” an artificial intelligence-enabled, autonomous grid designed to keep power infrastructure resilient from cyberattacks, faults and disastrous accidents.
The work is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator Program, which supports and builds upon basic research and discovery that involves multidisciplinary work to accelerate solutions toward societal impact.
In September 2020, the program launched the 2020 cohort, which included AI-Grid as a phase 1 awardee and grant funding of a $1 million to further AI-Grid research from an idea to a low-fidelity prototype. The Convergence Accelerator recently selected teams for phase 2, to focus on expanding the solution prototype and to build a sustainability plan beyond the NSF funding. Under phase 2, a new $5 million NSF cooperative agreement will fund the AI-Grid project.
“This project led by Professor Zhang is a great example demonstrating the impact of this novel research on essential infrastructure that we rely on daily, and defines a pathway for enhancing the resiliency and security of our electrical grid systems,” said Stony Brook University Vice President for Research Richard J. Reeder.
“We expect to show that our AI-Grid solution is affordable, lightweight, secure and replicable, thus offering what could be unprecedented flexibility for an approach to transform today’s infrastructures into tomorrow’s autonomous AI-Grid,” said Zhang, the project’s principal investigator. “This project will demonstrate AI-Grid’s capability to empower our nation’s digital economic engines, relieve the pains of those communities suffering from high electricity costs, and knock out low energy reliability and poor resilience.”
Peng Zhang
According to Zhang, the program includes a broad multidisciplinary team of researchers and many academic and industry partnerships key to its success. The AI-Grid team has established more than 30 partnerships that include power utilities, independent system operators, local and state government, industry and university researchers. Zhang said these partnerships have significantly advanced the technology involved in the work that now includes various deep learning methods, online distribution control, encrypted control, active fault management, and a fully programmable microgrid platform.
“The technologies that Peng and his team are developing come at a critical time as the nation pivots toward renewable energy and the inevitable impact it will have on the grid in the coming decade,” said College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) Interim Dean Jon Longtin. “This kind of multidisciplinary collaboration strengthens our research enterprise, while demonstrating to our students how complicated problems are solved in the modern world.”
Collaborative work at Stony Brook includes faculty and students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science, in conjunction with scientists, engineers and stakeholders affiliated with the Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center (AERTC), and with those from Brookhaven National Laboratory, EIP, RTDS, Hitachi America, Eversource, CCAT, ISO New England, New York Power Authority, PSEG Long Island and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
Stony Brook co-investigators include Scott Smolka, Scott Stoller, Xin Wang and Yifan Zhou. They will work with Zhang to deploy AI-Grid in the field and verify its replicability and universality at three of the most representative networked microgrid sites in the U.S.
“A convergence approach is essential to solving large-scale societal challenges, which is why the NSF Convergence Accelerator requires our funded teams to include a wide-range of expertise from academia, non-profits, industry, government and other communities,” said Douglas Maughan, head of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program. “The merging of ideas, techniques and approaches combined with human-center design concepts assists our teams in accelerating their ideas toward solutions within three years.”
Most recently, the AI-Grid team established end-user partnerships with Energy and Innovation Park, a fuel cell grid-connected energy project in Connecticut; Epic Institute, a global climate solutions organization that also manages The Plant — an old coal power plant being redeveloped into a global climate exhibition and convention center in New York City; and the Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) owned Bronzeville Community Microgrid (BCM) in Chicago.
These end-users will test, demonstrate and ideally implement the technology. The team will develop an open-access AI-grid technology platform with industry partners.

Harshit Agrawal, who explores the symbiotic relationship between AI and art at his solo show at Emami Art, Kolkata—EXO-Stential: AI Musings on the Post-human—believes so. The exhibition gives us a peek into the future where hyper-realistic and interactive art might be the norm. With its sheer innovation and application of technology, the exhibition challenges the traditional ways of approaching and appreciating art. The artworks created with the assistance of AI are compelling yet thought-provoking..Agrawal, 29, speaks with confidence that belies his age and the fact that this is his first solo show, “Technology and design are two of my greatest passions. AI is probably the most important technology we have today. It is shaping our lives and growing at a fast pace. It is influencing our decisions, gives us recommendations based on how we browse the internet and even decides what pops up on our social feed. This is happening very subtly, so people don’t realise they are moving into the post-human era. AI will be an extension of one’s body soon, just like one’s mobile phone is today.” The Bengaluru artist became the first Indian artist to join the non-fungible token (NFT) art bandwagon. As many as eight of his AI-generated artworks were recently minted..With nine artworks that explore sculpture and installations, the exhibition in Kolkata is unusual from a regular gallery art experience. One of the installations, Masked Reality, is an interactive video, where the viewer’s facial expressions are transformed into those of a (female) Kathakali performer and a (male) Theyyam performer. In Strange Genders, the artist investigates our cultural representations of gender bypassing human drawings through the mind of a machine. Agrawal says that he views AI as a vehicle to engage with deep-rooted social issues. Explaining the tone and tenor of AI art, this IIT-Guwahati alumnus shares an analogy, “Just like an artist uses paints and brush to create a canvas, for AI, paint is the data. Data is the raw material that I use to manipulate an algorithm to create an artwork.”.This show portrays how technology can be used as a means of engagement. The curator of the show, Myna Mukherjee, notes that this is one of the first such in-depth shows in India and adds, “AI is rapidly reshaping the world. Agrawal’s work consciously engages with this inevitable techno-centric reality we live in, rather than being simply sucked into it.” The unique show presented many challenges to the artist, from transporting technology across media to collecting data on a large scale. Dabbling in social, cultural, and ethical issues, this exhibition though married to AI, asks pertinent questions about the world around us, in a manner similar to any traditional art form..It may sound strange. But the art world is constantly evolving, and at a pace, we cannot begin to fathom. Back in November 2017, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi went under the hammer at Christie’s, many questioned its provenance. Was it really by the Renaissance artist, hushed voices asked. To avoid such scepticism, and in some cases, consequent scandal, many auction houses today use what is known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are designed to analyse images to help recognise the master’s brushstrokes. Indeed, the art world is just not the same!  .Agrawal became the first Indian artist to join the NFT bandwagon.

Automation is changing everyone’s jobs, even secretaries and receptionists, office assistants and mailroom clerks.
But while numerous studies and think pieces have thought about how automation is affecting factory workers, engineers, or truck drivers, few have looked at how artificial intelligence will change clerical jobs.
A $150,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to researchers in the University of Iowa’s Tippie College of Business and College of Engineering will start the process of answering those questions according to a release. The one-year grant from NSF’s Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program will look at how artificial intelligence will change clerical jobs, including how many might be eliminated.
“We don’t often think about artificial intelligence and clerical work, the kind of filing and collating and administrative jobs that have been traditionally lower-paying jobs held by women,” says Beth Livingston, assistant professor of management & entrepreneurship in Tippie and a co-investigator on the grant. She says that many of those jobs are the entry point to careers for many people who don’t have college degrees or other credentials that have become in many cases key to career success, so learning more about how that work will be affected by technology is vital to keep those doors open.
She says automation could affect clerical jobs in any number of ways, from robots taking over filing jobs, answering phones or working reception desks, or machine learning advising managers on what decisions they should make.
“We want to understand the challenges that workers who have these jobs will have and learn about what they will need to do to adapt,” she says.
Researchers will focus on laying out a research agenda, looking at what existing research says and meeting with experts from across numerous fields to find out what questions they should ask and what directions to pursue. They will also conduct focus groups with clerical workers and ask how they think automation will impact their jobs and how concerned they are about that.
Ms. Livingston says researchers expect to create a body of research that will get ahead of the automation trend, so employers, policymakers, labor economists, and others will have a better sense of the impacts before they happen. She says that few people bothered to think about the impact that automation would have on manufacturing in advance, and the result was a significant level of economic and labor disruption that could have been mitigated if people had thought about how to minimize the damage.
She said that after one year, the researchers will seek a follow-up grant from NSF to answer the questions they’ve raised.

AI is becoming strategic for many companies across the world. The technology can be transformative for just about any part of a business. 

But AI is not easy to implement. Even top-notch companies have challenges and failures.


So what can be done? Well, one strategy is to provide AI education to the workforce. 

“If more people are AI literate and can start to participate and contribute to the process, more problems–both big and small–across the organization can be tackled,” said David Sweenor, who is the Senior Director of Product Marketing at Alteryx. “We call this the ‘Democratization of AI and Analytics.’ A team of 100, 1,000, or 5,000 working on different problems in their areas of expertise certainly will have a bigger impact than if left in the hands of a few.”

Just look at Levi Strauss & Co. Last year the company implemented a full portfolio of enterprise training programs—for all employees at all levels—focused on data and AI for business applications. For example, there is the Machine Learning Bootcamp, which is an eight-week program for learning Python coding, neural networks and machine learning—with an emphasis on real-world scenarios. 
PROMOTED
“Our goal is to democratize this skill set and embed data scientists and machine learning practitioners throughout the organization,” said Louis DeCesari, who is the Global Head of Data, Analytics, and AI at Levi Strauss & Co. “In order to achieve our vision of becoming the world’s best digital apparel company, we need to integrate digital into all areas of the enterprise.”
Granted, corporate training programs can easily become a waste. This is especially the case when there is not enough buy-in at the senior levels of management.
It is also important to have a training program that is more than just a bunch of lectures. “You need to have outcomes-based training,” said Kathleen Featheringham, who is the Director of Artificial Intelligence Strategy at Booz Allen. “Focus on how AI can be used to push forward the mission of the organization, not just training for the sake of learning about AI.  Also, there should be roles-based training. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to training, and different personas within an organization will have different training needs.”

AI training can definitely be daunting because of the many topics and the complex concepts. In fact, it might be better to start with basic topics. 
“A statistics course can be very helpful,” said Wilson Pang, who is the Chief Technology Officer at Appen. “This will help employees understand how to interpret data and how to make sense of data. It will equip the company to make data driven decisions.”

There also should be coverage of how AI can go off the rails. “There needs to be training on ethics,” said Aswini Thota, who is a Principal Data Scientist at Bose Corporation. “Bad and biased data only exacerbate the issues with AI systems.”

For the most part, effective AI is a team sport. So it should really involve everyone in an organization. 
“The acceleration of AI adoption is inescapable—most of us experience AI on a daily basis whether we realize it or not,” said Alex Spinelli, who is the Chief Technology Officer at LivePerson. “The more companies educate employees about AI, the more opportunities they’ll provide to help them stay up-to-date as the economy increasingly depends on AI-inflected roles. At the same time, nurturing a workforce that’s ahead of the curve when it comes to understanding and managing AI will be invaluable to driving the company’s overall efficiency and productivity.”

It turns out that/news/2019/04/move-from-banking-to-private-equityprofessionals do too. A new study by a professor at one of France's top finance universities explains how.

Professor Thomas Åstebro at Paris-based HEC says private equity firms are using artificial intelligence (AI) to push the limits of human cognition and to support decision-making. Åstebro says the sorts of people employed by private equity funds is changing as a result. 

Åstebro looked at the use of AI systems across various private equity and venture capital firms. He found that funds that have embraced AI are using decision support systems (DSS) across the investment decision-making process, including to source potential targets for investments before rivals. 

Data companies specializing in the investment process are already emerging. - For example, one firm, InReach Ventures, claims to have developed software that can analyze around 2,500 start-ups each month. In other cases, funds have developed proprietary technology in-house.

One of the funds Åstebro studied was Paris-based private equity firm, Jolt Capital, which has developed its own DSS called ""Ninja."" Jolt introduced Ninja in 2019 and by the spring of 2020 it had already automatically stored and identified data on over 600,000 companies. A further 15,000 companies had been reviewed and by the algorithm, 3,000 were liked by a partner and 300 were passed to the investment committee for review. Jolt invested in 17 companies over the period. 

Jean Schmitt, partner and CEO at Jolt Capital, told Åstebro that the traditional approach to identifying target companies worthy of investment involved hiring juniors, typically MBA graduates, and training them in how to spot good deals.  This often didn't work well, said Schmitt: ""I don’t want a junior to filter my deals, because they have their own biases, and often won’t see the real opportunity.”

By comparison, Schmitt said Ninja made the investment process more efficient by codifying his own decision-making. ""The point is to train the system to understand what I like and don’t like, and then the system can show me what I would normally like...every week we are looking at 70 opportunities brought up by the system. This thing is a productivity tool, so there’s no idle time.” 

It turns out that even partners at private equity firms aren't great at identifying investment opportunities. Philippe Laval, the CTO at Jolt who helped develop Ninja, pointed out that partners don't learn much in the process of investing because their investments don't happen very often. Senior partners have the greatest insights, but this is a problem because it means that decision-making ability is focused in the hands of a few top people. 

At Jolt, the artificial intelligence system has changed the jobs of senior staff and reduced the need for juniors. In the past, partners spent a lot of their time travelling to meetings and on phone calls, and didn't record data systematically. Now, they spend around three hours a day on Ninja reviewing investment decisions suggested by the system, and the system is trained on their decision-making process. 

Pierre Garnier, a partner at Jolt, said Ninja's reports help him appear more informed when he gets in front of clients: ""This guy really knows the sector … I’m engaging with smart investors.” Private equity partners enjoy working with the AI-driven systems, says Åstebro: ""What is not to like about an algorithm that is your digital self and relieves you from spending hours in planes and meetings and sifting through websites?""

While partners are empowered by the artificial intelligence, juniors have seen their jobs disappear. If AI is doing the analysis and due-diligence previously undertaken by juniors, those juniors will be far less in demand than before. Technology and data staff will replace junior bankers as private equity funds' preferred hires.  

In future Åstebro says funds will,  ""spend more on information technology, and decisions will be made much more quickly. Those that don't risk missing out on the best opportunities and disappearing altogether.

Could it write a program that replaces all the spaces in a sentence with dashes? Even better, could it write one that identifies invalid ZIP codes?It did both instantly, before completing several other tasks. “These are problems that would be tough for a lot of humans to solve, myself included, and it would type out the response in two seconds,” said Mr. Smith, a seasoned programmer who oversees an A.I. start-up called Gado Images. “It was spooky to watch.”Codex seemed like a technology that would soon replace human workers. As Mr. Smith continued testing the system, he realized that its skills extended well beyond a knack for answering canned interview questions. It could even translate from one programming language to another.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYet after several weeks working with this new technology, Mr. Smith believes it poses no threat to professional coders. In fact, like many other experts, he sees it as a tool that will end up boosting human productivity. It may even help a whole new generation of people learn the art of computers, by showing them how to write simple pieces of code, almost like a personal tutor.“This is a tool that can make a coder’s life a lot easier,” Mr. Smith said.ImageTesting Codex convinced Mr. Smith, who runs an artificial intelligence start-up, that it will only enhance how people work with computers.Credit...Jason Henry for The New York TimesCodex, built by OpenAI, one of the world’s most ambitious research labs, provides insight into the state of artificial intelligence. Though a wide range of A.I. technologies have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade, even the most impressive systems have ended up complementing human workers rather than replacing them.Thanks to the rapid rise of a mathematical system called a neural network, machines can now learn certain skills by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for example, they can learn to recognize a cat.This is the technology that recognizes the commands you speak into your iPhone, translates between languages on services like Skype and identifies pedestrians and street signs as self-driving cars speed down the road.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAbout four years ago, researchers at labs like OpenAI started designing neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of prose, including thousands of digital books, Wikipedia articles and all sorts of other text posted to the internet.By pinpointing patterns in all that text, the networks learned to predict the next word in a sequence. When someone typed a few words into these “universal language models,” they could complete the thought with entire paragraphs. In this way, one system — an OpenAI creation called GPT-3 — could write its own Twitter posts, speeches, poetry and news articles.Much to the surprise of even the researchers who built the system, it could even write its own computer programs, though they were short and simple. Apparently, it had learned from an untold number of programs posted to the internet. So OpenAI went a step further, training a new system — Codex — on an enormous array of both prose and code.VideoIf you ask Codex to “make a snowstorm on a black background,” it will do just that, generating and running the code.CreditCredit...By OpenaiThe result is a system that understands both prose and code — to a point. You can ask, in plain English, for snow falling on a black background, and it will give you code that creates a virtual snowstorm. If you ask for a blue bouncing ball, it will give you that, too.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“You can tell it to do something, and it will do it,” said Ania Kubow, another programmer who has used the technology.Codex can generate programs in 12 computer languages and even translate between them. But it often makes mistakes, and though its skills are impressive, it can’t reason like a human. It can recognize or mimic what it has seen in the past, but it is not nimble enough to think on its own.Sometimes, the programs generated by Codex do not run. Or they contain security flaws. Or they come nowhere close to what you want them to do. OpenAI estimates that Codex produces the right code 37 percent of the time.When Mr. Smith used the system as part of a “beta” test program this summer, the code it produced was impressive. But sometimes, it worked only if he made a tiny change, like tweaking a command to suit his particular software setup or adding a digital code needed for access to the internet service it was trying to query.In other words, Codex was truly useful only to an experienced programmer.But it could help programmers do their everyday work a lot faster. It could help them find the basic building blocks they needed or point them toward new ideas. Using the technology, GitHub, a popular online service for programmers, now offers Copilot, a tool that suggests your next line of code, much the way “autocomplete” tools suggest the next word when you type texts or emails.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It is a way of getting code written without having to write as much code,” said Jeremy Howard, who founded the artificial intelligence lab Fast.ai and helped create the language technology that OpenAI’s work is based on. “It is not always correct, but it is just close enough.”VideoIn a nod to a popular internet meme, Codex generates a website for “a cat that’s an attorney,” providing a biography, a phone number and a small avatar.CreditCredit...By OpenaiMr. Howard and others believe Codex could also help novices learn to code. It is particularly good at generating simple programs from brief English descriptions. And it works in the other direction, too, by explaining complex code in plain English. Some, including Joel Hellermark, an entrepreneur in Sweden, are already trying to transform the system into a teaching tool.The rest of the A.I. landscape looks similar. Robots are increasingly powerful. So are chatbots designed for online conversation. DeepMind, an A.I. lab in London, recently built a system that instantly identifies the shape of proteins in the human body, which is a key part of designing new medicines and vaccines. That task once took scientists days or even years. But those systems replace only a small part of what human experts can do.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn the few areas where new machines can instantly replace workers, they are typically in jobs the market is slow to fill. Robots, for instance, are increasingly useful inside shipping centers, which are expanding and struggling to find the workers needed to keep pace.ImageGreg Brockman of OpenAI said artificial intelligence was taking the drudge work out of jobs, not replacing them.Credit...Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesWith his start-up, Gado Images, Mr. Smith set out to build a system that could automatically sort through the photo archives of newspapers and libraries, resurfacing forgotten images, automatically writing captions and tags and sharing the photos with other publications and businesses. But the technology could handle only part of the job.It could sift through a vast photo archive faster than humans, identifying the kinds of images that might be useful and taking a stab at captions. But finding the best and most important photos and properly tagging them still required a seasoned archivist.“We thought these tools were going to completely remove the need for humans, but what we learned after many years was that this wasn’t really possible — you still needed a skilled human to review the output,” Mr. Smith said. “The technology gets things wrong. And it can be biased. You still need a person to review what it has done and decide what is good and what is not.”Codex extends what a machine can do, but it is another indication that the technology works best with humans at the controls.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. is not playing out like anyone expected,” said Greg Brockman, the chief technology officer of OpenAI. “It felt like it was going to do this job and that job, and everyone was trying to figure out which one would go first. Instead, it is replacing no jobs. But it is taking away the drudge work from all of them at once.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

And started there a week later.""Two and a half years later, I really think it's the best decision I ever made,"" she reflects.When she started at the company, she was the first woman developer working on her team. She now spends her spare time encouraging other women, people of colour, and LGBT people to try coding.For programmers like her, she says the most interesting shift recently has been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) tools which can bite off increasingly big chunks of programming all by themselves.In June, GitHub, a San Francisco-based code-hosting platform with 56 million users, revealed a new AI tool called Copilot.You start typing a few characters of code, and the AI suggests how to finish it.Getty ImagesInstagram co-founder Mike Krieger applauded the application of AI to coding""The single most mind-blowing application of machine learning I've ever seen,"" Instagram's co-founder Mike Krieger enthused about Copilot.It is based on an artificial intelligence called GPT-3, released last summer by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI lab, co-founded by Elon Musk.This GPT (which stands for generative pre-training) engine does a ""very simple but very large thing - predicting the next letter in a text,"" explains Grzegorz Jakacki, Warsaw-based founder of Codility, which makes a popular hiring test.OpenAI trained the AI on texts already available online such as books, Wikipedia and hundreds of thousands of web pages, a diet that was ""somewhat curated but in all possible human languages,"" he says.And ""spookily, it wasn't taught the rules of any particular language,"" adds Mr Jakacki.The result was plausible passages of text. People have subsequently asked it to write in a variety of styles, for example, new Harry Potter stories, but in the style of Ernest Hemingway or Raymond Chandler.Getty ImagesAI can make ""silly mistakes"" points out OpenAI chief executive Sam AltmanEventually the hype over GPT-3 got ""way too much"", and people needed reminding the AI ""sometimes makes very silly mistakes"", tweeted Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive.Still, GitHub - whose owner, Microsoft, bought an exclusive licence to use GPT-3 in September - decided to train-up another, similar model. But this time, training the AI on software source code instead.GitHub is the world's largest host of source code, it has at least 28 million public repositories (places software packages are stored). So, the company has fed Copilot on a healthy diet of public code.As a result, Copilot can provide ""relatively good solutions, even though sometimes it requires some tweaking,"" according to Miss Luk who has tried giving the AI coding challenges.As a programmer, far from seeing the tool as risking her job she likes the idea of having AI to support her with ""the more boring parts"" of coding, like checking over complicated strings, called regular expressions, that she always has to ""quadruple check"".Red HatSenior Red Hat programmer Dina Muscanell says inexperienced coders should be wary of relying on AI helpAnd, since the AI has been fed code written by professional programmers, it's really helping coders draw on their colleagues' collective wisdom, says Dina Muscanell, Vermont-based senior programmer at open-source software company, Red Hat.There are already coding-community websites like Stack Exchange, where programmers can pose questions and get suggestions. Maybe this isn't so different?""If you think about getting that feedback instantaneously as you're typing, that's pretty awesome. You have a team of people feeding you this code"" even if there is an AI assembling it, she observes. But professional programmers also have a few qualms about the new AI kid on the block.One is spotting mistakes. In software engineering, ""you're lucky where the garbage [rubbish] is very obvious, but this thing can generate very subtle garbage,"" says Mr Jakacki.Subtle mistakes in code can be especially costly and very hard to find.A possible future answer could involve using AI to detect bugs: for instance, noticing that pressing some buttons on a microwave ""are valid inputs, but do not make sense"". But we're not quite there.In the meantime, ""if you're not experienced, and you're just trying to learn, you could be doing something bad without being aware of that,"" warns Ms Muscanell.More Technology of BusinessJust how hard is it to recycle a jumbo jet?How to back up your data and keep it safeHow to keep your cool when the office heats upWhy artificial intelligence is being used to write advertsHow can new technology protect outdoor workers?Another big question involves ownership of this auto-generated code. What if Copilot, which has been trained on other people's programs, dishes-up something near-identical to code another programmer has written, and then you use it? Using the AI tool ""can potentially violate open source licences because it can cite something from the training set,"" Miss Luk argues. And that could land you in hot water for plagiarism.It's all an area ""where law is not catching up with technology,"" Mr Jakacki says.In theory, you could measure how much code owed to one bit of training code: by training up a different AI using all the other source code but leaving that particular bit out.But doing this would be ""extremely costly,"" observes Mr Jakacki.In reality, at the moment the AI only provides short passages of code, not fully turned out software programs.By comparison 10,000 lines is the minimum length of website code 'when you're getting some meaningful functionality', Mr Jakacki says.So, it's not quite ready to replace human programmers yet.Or bring about the fabled AI singularity - an idea first hypothesised by mathematician John von Neumann, where computer intelligence enters a runaway explosion of self-improvement cycles, and quickly far surpasses human intelligence.And more to the point, for coders like Miss Luk, ""even though it does help, it doesn't necessarily mean the workload is alleviated"".Code still needs to be thoroughly reviewed, and subjected to tests both involving how it works (called unit tests) and how it fits with other pieces of code (integration tests). Which is all just as well, she adds.The chief reason she enjoys coding ""is the problem-solving element of it, and if everything is already done for you, it takes the fun out of it,"" Miss Luk reflects.If computers do too much of the thinking, ""you don't get the satisfaction after solving an issue.""And while she thinks there is potential for AI programming tools, as they learn more and adapt, ""but hopefully not so soon that we won't be needed any more,"" she laughs.

Compliance has always played a pivotal role across financial firms and banking institutions in an effort to pinpoint and mitigate various risks across communication channels, including market abuse, insider trading, spoofing, front-running, and even sexual harassment and racism. For decades, legacy vendors have been at the forefront of providing services to these institutions to flag and report any compliance and security breaches. This process was typically done manually where the compliance team would sift through emails and phone records and flag anything that appeared nefarious. While somewhat tedious, these compliance measures have helped institutions maintain industry wide standards and regulations as well as their own internal standards for employee conduct. 
However, over time technology has evolved and has now become a mainstay across all industries, including banking and finance, offering support and assistance to organizations and institutions, making them more effective and efficient in their daily operations. More specifically, artificial intelligence has provided the banking and finance industries with comprehensive compliance tools that automate the process. While these measures can be implemented to make compliance and security oversight easier, it does come with its share of challenges including regulator hesitancy which stems from historical concerns regarding bias, discrimination, and privacy, which has now ultimately led to some calling for policymakers to introduce overly burdensome regulations on the technology. Nonetheless, the adoption of artificial intelligence will continue to grow, as it’s already demonstrated immense value playing a significant role in the future of banking and finance.
Concerns over AI and the Potential to Regulate
Artificial intelligence has proved and continues to prove itself to be one of the most valued assets, across all industries, that enables companies to rapidly evolve and conduct their business more effectively and efficiently. However, it does bring with it criticism and concern in which regulators and skeptics are asking the question, “can artificial intelligence be transparent? Can we trust it?” There have been reports of bias, discrimination, invasiveness to private data and violations of human rights, which has led the European Union to propose the Artificial Intelligence Act which will aim to impose restrictions on artificial intelligence in an effort to regulate the technology and eliminate these instances. While the law would impact all industries, there would be a particular focus on high-impact sectors which includes both the banking and finance industries. 
While these regulations seem to have the public’s best interest and values in mind, it also proposes an impractical solution, especially if other countries seek to implement them. According to the Center for Data Innovation, these new regulations would cost the European economy more than $30 million to introduce and manage. Should policymakers enact these regulations, they would ultimately spend more on regulating the technology than the cost of compliance itself, making it illogical. The banking and finance industries have already seen artificial intelligence at work and have reaped the benefits and any service less than what they’re accustomed to would be a setback. 
One of the major concerns from a technology standpoint is that artificial intelligence relies on what is referred to as the “black box”, which means regulators are able to see what goes into the AI and what comes out but are unable to see how the algorithms and technology actually works. Tech companies are hesitant to share their algorithms – what’s inside the black box – because it can lead to potential intellectual property infringement and theft. While the European Union continues to push for some type of reform, it is important they realize that they need to work directly with tech companies to implement risk management solutions that provide thorough training and regular testing to offer protections against biases. 
Communication in Today’s Digital and Remote Work Environment
Over the last few decades, there has been a steady stream of new communication methods that have surfaced including SMS, Slack, WhatsApp, etc. As these new channels have become dominant in the way we communicate daily in both our personal and professional lives, it has become harder and nearly impossible for compliance teams to provide security oversight and carry out thorough reviews and investigations. In 2020, financial organizations saw an increase of 54% in tickets coming in through WhatsApp. While new communication channels are making it easier and are being more heavily relied on to communicate, it’s also indirectly creating opportunities for security and compliance breaches. 
These new channels alone call for the use of artificial intelligence to make compliance more effective and efficient. However, with the new workplace environment where many are working outside of the office and from home, it is even more critical for banking and financial institutions to find a better way to maintain compliance regulations. With a dire need to address compliance across all communication channels, many are turning to artificial intelligence as a solution as it provides automated compliance and security oversight that is more advanced and tech-driven especially when communicating over encrypted messaging services. This ultimately will provide banks with a valuable resource that allows employees to continue using messaging apps and services that are in line with privacy laws like GDPR, ensuring separation between personal and business data. 
AI’s Value to Compliance in the Banking and Finance Industries
Financial institutions have struggled with communication storage and while still new to the industry, artificial intelligence provides the support and solution to overcome. Artificial intelligence enables compliance officers and institutions the ability to automate all elements of their communications data management. This includes capturing data, enriching it with third party data such as CRM, normalizing it and allowing the compliance officer the ability to seamlessly investigate, archive and retain data. Under regulatory rules, there is an immense amount of both structured and unstructured data which is required for recordkeeping. Additionally, artificial intelligence can combine all data sources which in turn makes advanced searches and the ability to perform full investigations more efficiently. 
In addition to the previously mentioned capabilities, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial compliance and redefining the way in which communications compliance risk is managed. Financial institutions are able to mitigate risk, improve operational efficiency, and reduce compliance costs by being afforded the ability to proactively detect and alert on abnormalities in communication including threats or violations such as insider trading, providing an in-depth analysis and breakdown of various communication triggers, and offering the ability to manage and customize alerts based on their specific needs, regulations, and procedures. 
Implementing Artificial Intelligence Responsibly
For any organizations or institutions that decide to implement artificial intelligence for compliance purposes, it is incredibly important that it is done so responsibly. It is critical that banking and finance organizations work with companies who can fulfill their internal needs as well as meet industry standards and regulations. With much discussion around transparency, it is key to ensure the ability to separate personal data from professional data, conduct business without the consequences of bias and discrimination, and offer data that is easily interpreted and explained by compliance team members. These capabilities are readily available and continue to be top of mind when creating and developing new artificial intelligence models and algorithms.    
Compliance and security measures are in place to keep our businesses and employees safe and protected from various risks and market abuse. The fact of the matter is that the old way of doing things just can’t keep up and is no longer an effective process. 
While trust from regulators, or lack thereof, continues to play a role in the acceptance of artificial intelligence, it will not prevent companies from adoption and implementation as long as new opportunities continue to arise to mitigate risk, cut compliance costs, and increase operational efficiency. Artificial intelligence is only going to continue to develop and evolve, leaving banking and financial institutions to get on board to keep up with the fast pace of communication and do their due diligence in following regulations. The alternative? Continue to rely on outdated legacy vendors and risk failing to maintain industry wide regulations. Artificial intelligence can and will drastically improve compliance and security oversight.

 - stock.adobe.com)HONOLULU, Hi. — Artificial intelligence does a better job of identifying the hidden signs of breast cancer, scientists in Hawaii say. Their study finds a sophisticated tool, a type of AI called deep learning, analyzes breast scans to identify women with early signs of cancer whose tumors are hard to find by conventional methods.
Doctors recommend that all women over the age of 40 book themselves for a mammogram at least once a year to screen for breast cancer. These images help physicians detect the cancer early, significantly increasing a patient’s chances of survival.
They also help to determine how likely a woman is to develop cancer further down the line, based on her breast density. While dense breasts on a mammogram signifies a higher risk of cancer, there are many other, unknown factors, which doctors can’t account for. Now, researchers at the University of Hawaii have taught a computer to look for these hidden signals.
“Conventional methods of breast cancer risk assessment using clinical risk factors haven’t been that effective,” says lead author Professor John Shepherd in a statement to SWNS. “We thought that there was more in the image than just breast density that would be useful for assessing risk.”
Making the yearly screening process easier?
The team analyzed more than 25,000 breast scans from 6,369 women. They found over 1,600 women had developed breast cancer that was successfully picked up during their screening. However, another 351 developed interval invasive breast cancer, meaning it was not detected during the regular screening process.
Scientists trained a “deep learning model” to find hidden details or signals in the scans which could indicate a higher risk of breast cancer. The tool was more effective than traditional methods at predicting the cancers which were picked up during regular screenings. On the other hand, the technology was less effective when trying to calculate the risk of cancers developing between screenings.
“The results showed that the extra signal we’re getting with AI provides a better risk estimate for screening-detected cancer,” Professor Shepherd tells SWNS. “It helped us accomplish our goal of classifying women into low risk or high risk of screening-detected breast cancer.”
Armed with the algorithm, women could be sorted into groups depending on their level of risk instead of having to come back a year later for another screening.
“This would allow us to use a woman’s individual risk to determine how frequently she should be monitored,” Shepherd says. “Lower-risk women might not need to be monitored with mammography as often as those with a high risk of breast cancer.”
Smarter technology dealing to smarter cancer decisions
The AI tool could also help medical professionals make more informed decisions when referring people for MRIs and other imaging procedures.
“Women in the high-risk deep learning group who also have dense breasts and are at a higher risk for interval cancers may benefit most from a monitoring strategy that includes supplemental imaging that retains sensitivity in dense breasts such as MRI, ultrasound and molecular imaging,” the study authors explains. “Interval cancers usually have more aggressive tumor biology and are typically discovered at an advanced stage.”
Next, the researchers are hoping to replicate the study in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women, groups which have been underrepresented in breast cancer studies until now. They are also hoping to study different grades of breast cancer, from the least to most aggressive forms.
“By ranking mammograms in terms of the probability of seeing cancer in the image, AI is going to be a powerful second reading tool to help categorize mammograms,” Prof. Shepherd concludes.
The findings appear in the journal Radiology.

Ethical Artificial Intelligence is Focus of New Robotics Program


















AUSTIN, Texas — Ethics will be at the forefront of robotics education thanks to a new University of Texas at Austin program that will train tomorrow’s technologists to understand the positive — and potentially negative — implications of their creations.
Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum.
“In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.”
Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation.
CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems, which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program, which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities.
Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik.
Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies.

 
 
More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin.
“This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.”

AI algorithms can complete any kind of work within a short period of time while providing opportunities for employees to focus on creativity. But it has been discovered that artificial intelligence can predict human death by identifying any early death risk. Even scientists and AI developers have been startled at this discovery where AI algorithms are predicting death. AI detecting human deaths is one of the unbelievable innovations in this 21st century. Scientists and developers do not have a clear understanding of how AI algorithms are predicting death. Let's dig deep into how if anyone needs to know early death risk, artificial intelligence is here to predict human deaths efficiently. .The healthcare sector leverages artificial intelligence to boost productivity, help patients with medicines and assist doctors in analysing medical reports. Now, AI algorithms predicting death within a year is startling doctors. Doctors are observing normal reports but artificial intelligence can look at heart tests and predict early death risk. What seems like a normal ECG report to cardiologists, AI can accurately predict the early death risk of multiple patients. .This is showing that artificial intelligence can detect certain risky elements in a human body that are invisible in the human naked eye or what professional doctors consider normal. This major disruptive technology holds the potential to teach human doctors different lessons that may be have been misinterpreted and miscommunicated for a long time. Doctors incorporated around 1.77 million ECG logs with over 400,000 patients for AI detecting human deaths from cardiac problems like heart attacks and atrial fibrillation. Later on, the AI algorithms generated the appropriate result in predicting death risk in the nearby future. .Artificial intelligence detected heart problems in patients who were cleared from any cardiac issue by professional doctors. These algorithms can predict lung cancer and other chronic diseases more accurately than the medical staff. Professionals and scientists are worried about how artificial intelligence can detect such diseases and how patients can be on medication, depending on the determinations from machine learning algorithms. .This breakthrough of AI predicting death risk and human deaths within a year is getting popular in these recent years. It only automates rigorous work but can predict early death risk. The University of Nottingham has created an AI-based model to predict premature human deaths. Surprisingly, artificial intelligence predicted more accurate results than any other machine. Being a Silicon Valley giant, Google AI can harness predictive algorithm to detect and predict early death risks, deaths, discharges, and many more. Similarly, the European Cardiology Society also had experimented with the same kind of test with AI. The members utilized a machine learning algorithm known as LogitBoost for analyzing cardiac imaging data from approximately 950 patients from the Turku PET Centre in Finland. .That being said, it is proved that artificial intelligence can predict early death risk but there are some major concerns among several healthcare professionals. The issue of unconscious and bias in the machine learning algorithms can create a drastic effect on patients who have cardiac problems as well as those who do not. There may be discrepancies among data of white patients, patients of colours, and different genders. AI cannot still mitigate the issues of gender inequality and racism efficiently.  Doctors are concerned because this outcome is a matter of life and death that cannot be compromised for AI algorithms predicting deaths. There are series of medications that needed to be put in patients and if those patients do not need the cure, it will create a drastic effect in bodies. From there, innocent patients can deteriorate more. .Thus, it is useful to have such cutting-edge technologies in the healthcare sector to help and assist doctors in other work. But for predicting early death risk and human deaths, solely depending on algorithms can possess a huge risk for the healthcare sector. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The guests on this episode of What Happens Next? don't think so.

Dr Susan Carland is again joined by communications and media studies expert Professor Mark Andrejevic, human-computer interaction scholar Yolande Strengers, Monash University Interim Dean of Information Technology Ann Nicholson, and Microsoft Australia's former chief digital advisor, Rita Arrigo.AI is undoubtedly playing a beneficial role in society, helping us respond more effectively to medical emergencies, improving surgical procedures, and even making our buildings smarter.There are already methods in place ensuring society can hold AI and its designers accountable. Established ethics committees have been joined by new legislation and increasing awareness among policymakers.Accessible courses and casual data science meetups enable any of us to join the conversation, and help shape emerging technologies, the data they use, and how they use it. As we work towards a more ethical society, we can ensure our AI is ethical, too.I think we could imagine cases where it's demonstrated over time that the machine actually makes a better decision with a better social outcome.Professor Mark Andrejevic


 TranscriptDr. Susan Carland:Welcome to another episode of 'What Happens Next?' I'm Dr Susan Carland. In our first episode, we spoke about the potential problems with biases in artificial intelligence or AI. What are the consequences in the future if there are no regulations in place to prevent it?Today, we take a more positive approach and look at some of the potential AI has in addressing biases and how it could ultimately play a role in helping us achieve all positive outcomes.Rita Arrigo was most recently Chief Digital Advisor at Microsoft Australia. Her role as an AI ambassador drives many AI for good initiatives, including smart, inclusive cities; diversity, sustainability; and humanitarian aspects. I asked Rita where she thinks AI is headed in the future. It turns out, she's quite excited. Rita, lovely to have you here today.Rita Arrigo:Thanks, Dr Susan Carland. It's wonderful to be here.Dr Susan Carland:Tell me what you see as the role of AI, or artificial intelligence, for societies going into the future.Rita Arrigo:Well, I think there's really exciting stuff happening in society at the moment. I think we're really moving from being consumers of stuff to entering this idea of societal innovation, where we want to solve complex problems, address some of these huge challenges like the environment, sustainability, accessibility, inclusion. I think this is a real vital role for AI and data science, because it will allow us to augment the world and see the world in a different way as we start to find these new ways that we want to innovate society.Dr Susan Carland:So you see AI as helping us solve some of those big problems.Rita Arrigo:Yeah, absolutely.Dr Susan Carland:Do you have a fear that AI might try to kill us in our sleep like Terminator?Rita Arrigo:No, but I love that Hollywood loves that, you know? Hollywood's there to make horror movies and stuff, and I think I love that whole dystopia kind of model that they create, but we haven't seen it. I've been in technology for like 40 years, pretty much, and read about the Luddites that try to, you know, break all the machinery when the industrial age was coming, but really, did it really affect what was happening? And has the progress been going on regardless of those kinds of fears that we have? Maybe they are just part of the drama of Hollywood potentially, I don't know.Dr Susan Carland:Are any of the fears justified? Do you think we have enough checks and balances or policies or proper ring fencing around any of, perhaps, the ethical concerns people might have about AI?Rita Arrigo:I think we do. I think we're a really risk averse culture. I think in the way that we implement technology ... you know, it takes 50 change managers, cultural program, and building the culture and the diversity in the organisation, and the training. I don't think we just switch on technology and go, ""Wow, what happened then?"" There's a lot of planning and journey creation around it, so yeah, I don't think that that's an issue.Dr Susan Carland:I want you to look into the crystal ball. If we continue down the same path that we're on with our approach to AI - imagine we don't change anything in our approach to AI - what does our future look like? What does our society look like? What's good and what's bad?Rita Arrigo:Well, I think there'll be some really great things. I think a lot of the frustrations that we have with customer service, for example, like how many times do you want to tell someone your name, address, date of birth? ""Excuse me, I'm over this,"" right? We want more intelligent customer service and experiences, and I think that there's going to be some real advantages in that.I think healthcare is one of the areas that really needs AI, and we're already seeing things like quantum-inspired algorithms to improve the way we do scans. We're seeing much better real-time prediction in hospitals with algorithms to assist clinicians to know what's going on. You know, all those crazy beeping machines actually being turned into messages that people can understand. We're seeing it with things like holographic surgery, where we're moving into that spatial world and adding an AI layer to that. So I think in healthcare, there's some really exciting things.And I think in transportation and smart cities, that's going to be a massive disruption. Roads are going to change. We're maybe not going to have as many accidents on roads because we're going to have a bit more AI computer vision and a bit more -Dr Susan Carland:Like AI in our cars, you mean?Rita Arrigo:Yeah, AI in our cars and on our roads, and lots of cameras. I don't know if you've driven a Tesla lately, but ...Dr Susan Carland:Sadly, no. I'm on an academic wage.Rita Arrigo:I only test drove one. But they're quite cost-effective because all of a sudden you don't have to pay for petrol and et cetera, et cetera. But you know, it can actually see the road, and it can identify pedestrians, and it will stop instead of colliding into one. I think that that side of it's going to be really amazing.Then what's happening in smart cities. Even this building, it's like, it's almost like a smart building I've walked into. People knew I was arriving, had an experience to it, but imagine all the other critical infrastructure we have. Our bridges, our water, our energy, and that being turned into these cyber-physical digital twins for us to be able to predict the future and understand the past.Dr Susan Carland:Although Rita is excited about the future benefits of AI, she also concedes that at this stage, we still bring our own biases when developing new systems. Because after all, it's humans who are doing the programming.Is there a way that you can see the future of AI better tackling the human biases that may have inadvertently been placed within them?Rita Arrigo:Yeah, I really do. I think that's so real in terms of, if you even look at the way that we run our finance systems and how you apply for a loan. A lot of those biases exist before you even put the AI around it. Or how do we go about getting a new job and what kind of... how do people judge us when we enter the room - that combination of body language, et cetera, et cetera.I also think it's about building a lot of fairness. There's a lot of work going on in creating responsible AI guidelines so that we can have fairness, reliability, safety, privacy, security, inclusion, transparency, and accountability. It's these principles that we're starting to see in organisations as they start to bring them on. How to create these kind of committees to discuss and think about some of the implications of what we take when we start to mine our data and start to find examples from them and start to predict things, and also start to use AI to learn.I think it's those learning parts of things, that deep learning, that will have to become much more focused around ensuring that we're using these responsible AI principles. So I actually think it's some kind of new science that's emerging. We're seeing a lot of the philosophers and ethicists and people coming in to have these discussions, because it is a real multi-disciplinary discussion, and probably an area that I'm really passionate about, because I think traditionally data science and data engineering and people dealing with data can be quite a male-dominated area. But I also think that women are amazing at data analysis and understanding that side of things. So being able to make it more multi-disciplinary and also include other stream of thoughts that might not necessarily be a lot of the engineers that you traditionally work with, bringing them into the equation will make a massive difference as well.Dr Susan Carland:In our previous episode, we spoke with Yolande Strengers about how female voices on our smartphones and networked home devices such as Google Home are perpetuating old-fashioned feminine stereotypes. I asked her what she thinks are some of the things needed to improve these issues.Would it be having things like Siri or Alexa come where you can choose from five different voices, and gradually trying to get people used to hearing different voices in these devices? How else could we do it?Yolande Strengers:I think we also need to be experimenting with personality. Actually that's - there is also already a lot of experimentation with voice. There's already a lot of options away from the default, but not so much around what it is, or how we expect these devices to behave.Dr Susan Carland:So we might suddenly start having an AI who's a bit sassy?Yolande Strengers:Yeah.Dr Susan Carland:Or I say, ""What's the weather,"" and they say, ""Work it out yourself, idiot."" Like, talks back?Yolande Strengers:Yeah, possibly. I mean, there are some great design precedents out there already, and they're quite quick. They didn't have to be threatening. They don't have to be rude or not likeable. They can actually be kind of just a really interesting kind of character in our lives.Dr Susan Carland:Tell us about some of those precedents that are available at the moment.Yolande Strengers:There's one that Jenny and I refer to in the book called Kai, which is actually a banking assistant that was developed by a feminist designer, Jacqueline Feldman. Her kind of design ethos was that she wanted this device to be assertive, and also, I guess, to have a kind of - a bot sense of humour. It's gender neutral, but it's not personality-less. It still tries to behave in the world like a bot. So if someone kind of puts a human question to it, like, ""Do you want to go out with me?"" Or, you know ...Dr Susan Carland:Why can we not help doing that? You said Kai was a banking bot?Yolande Strengers:Yeah, that's right.Dr Susan Carland:So I thought you were going to say the question would be, ""How much money do I have in my account?"" Or, ""How do I move it?"" Why can we not help asking AI these questions?Yolande Strengers:Exactly. Look, I think because they're designed to behave like people, right?Dr Susan Carland:So we want to see, what will you say?Yolande Strengers:That's right. Yeah, we want to engage with them like we would engage with another person.Dr Susan Carland:Right.Yolande Strengers:I think that's partly human nature.Dr Susan Carland:Okay. So I ask Kai, I type in Kai, ""Kai, how about a date?"" What would Kai say?Yolande Strengers:Well, I can't remember exactly what Kai would say, but it'd be something like, ""Oh, I'm a bot, so such trivial consent things don't concern me. I'm much more interested in…"" I don't know, whatever it's interested in, numbers and maths or something. That was a very poorly scripted answer on my part, but she makes him sound so - just gendered it - she makes it sound much more quirky and kind of funny.Another one that I really like is the Tamagochi robot, which died if you didn't look after it. You know, it's not like devices that don't put up with things haven't existed around us in different forms for a while. I think that there are other sources of inspiration out there, little pockets of resistance. Like the Tamagochi robot, it's often not where you expect it to be. But it dies. If you don't look after it, that's it. I mean, I think it does eventually possibly come back to life, but there's - I can imagine similar situations with a voice assistant kind of shutting down for a period of time if you treat it badly.Some of the companies have started to do that on a very modest scale now in response to widespread criticism of how they respond to sexual harassment, and sort of abusive language and loud, aggressive tones. But I think there's, again, a lot more I could do around what they are prepared to tolerate, I guess, in terms of how people are going to treat them.Dr Susan Carland:Professor Ann Nicholson is the Interim Dean of IT at Monash University. What do you see as some of the greatest successes that artificial intelligence is giving us at the moment?Ann Nicholson:Well, I think that we've had a huge improvement, if you like, in what AI systems that have kind of been around with the fundamental technology for about 30 years, that's the deep learning is based on neural networks, that they - it sounds really technical, but basically the idea is if you get data, you can feed it into a model and it kind of learns based on those inputs, something about the outputs.Now, that might be recognising features in a picture. So we know now that computer vision is really accurate and speech-to-text and speech recognition are doing really well. So they've really massively improved for two reasons: One is that we have got much greater computing power, and we've got much greater sources of data to train them up well. They can take lots of data and just do an amazing job on finding patterns, and learning things, and classifications, and so on. It's truly amazing, what's happening in that space.Dr Susan Carland:What advice would you give to people who want to ethically and mindfully engage with AI?Ann Nicholson:I think that if you've got the time, that there's some quite good online courses, like micro-credentials that actually try and explain a little bit about AI and actually can show you with some software online, that you can kind of run some little tests and create some sort of little AI model.That might be something that would be too much for some of your listeners, but for other ones, I would encourage you to sort of expand your technological base. People are really amazing. My mum is on Facebook and downloading things and messaging, so she's upskilled. I do think that getting a bit more familiar with some of the guts of it, even if you're not going to go off and do it seriously, can help you get a better understanding of how it's built.And then you can then assess better when you think there might be an AI on and that you're putting data in, how they might use it. I think that if you're working with an organisation who wants to collect your data, you should definitely be asking how they're using it. If you're typing it in to get an answer back from something, you should be aware that there's some AI and that it might be really dodgy or it might be really good. You can try and have a [inaudible] and ask the organisation. If they can't tell you, you should probably give it a miss.Dr Susan Carland:Do you have any examples of projects you've worked on where artificial intelligence is clearly doing a social good?Ann Nicholson:Well, I'm working on one right now where we're trying to prove that it will. That is, that we're collaborating with Ambulance Victoria to have an AI system that will listen in on emergency calls and provide a kind of a decision support flag to earlier detect cardiac arrest calls. Cardiac arrest is where the heart's stopped, so time is critical. The call-takers do a great job. They have a script though that they have to go through. If we can detect agonal breathing, a particular kind of breathing in the background, before the call-taker does, or some other indication while they're still going through their script and we can flag it earlier, we could save precious seconds and get the ambulance out there earlier. Or we could hook into these new systems they've got where they ping someone who knows how to do CPR and could be in the vicinity, and say, ""Get to that person who's a hundred metres away from you and help with the CPR."" So we're not necessarily there yet, but we've got some very promising results that show in particular cases, that we can just help get that right decision detection earlier.Dr Susan Carland:I asked Professor of Communications and Media Studies in the Faculty of Arts at Monash University, Mark Andrejevic, for some advice.Dr Susan Carland:I once typed into my Google search bar - I think it was something like, ""Why are academics so..."" or, ""Why are professors so..."" and do you know what it suggested?Mark Andrejevic:Oh no.Dr Susan Carland:""So badly dressed."" Deeply hurtful bias. What can the average person do to either be more aware of the biases we may be encountering in AI, or even do something about it?Mark Andrejevic:Well, clearly I need to dress better.Dr Susan Carland:I think, well, clearly we both do, because that's what humanity thinks.Mark Andrejevic:I think that in many cases, these responses are going to have to be collective political ones. I think the type of organising that we've been seeing in response to concerns about bias. For example, political mobilising around bias in the use of facial recognition technologies. I think those ... where the politics is going to come to bear on the decisions to actually use those systems. Once the systems are in place, it's very difficult to find ways to reverse-engineer them. Although I think it will be important to advocate for accountability as well.On an individual level, I think it's very hard ... when it comes to political change, I think in most cases we're talking about collective action. So we have to, as a society, start to hold accountable those places where these decisions are being made and say, ""This is what we want and this is what we, you know, we don't want certain types of decisions to be made by automated systems in ways that are non-explicable to us.""And when it comes to very significant decisions about medical care, employment, we're going to have to be able to come to a shared political consensus about when systems are appropriate to use, and why they're appropriate to use.I think we could imagine cases where it's demonstrated over time that the machine actually makes a better decision with a better social outcome. That seems conceivable to me, but it's got to be demonstrable and explainable how we came to that decision and how we have the belief that that's going to continue to operate if we're going to continue to use that system.It's been interesting to see, for example, bias and facial recognition has gotten a lot of political attention. I think it's because the face itself is - we're very concerned about biometric monitoring of our faces because we think of our faces as communication ... I don't know how, I mean, one way we think of our faces is that they're ours to control our interface with the world. The idea that it can be captured and used to make inferences about us and to identify us without our ability to know that that's happening or to see how it's happening is alarming.And so it's been a site of people expressing concern, and there've been bans of the use of facial recognition technology in some municipalities. That has received political traction, and there's political response to that. So I think it's possible, but I think it does require interrogating the systems, and looking at how they're being developed and pushing back against them. That takes political will, and it takes a lot of knowledge about what's going on, and it's going to be harder and harder to do because more and more of these systems are going to be operating. You're going to have to keep directing your attention. Wait, is it the prison parole system? Is it facial recognition technology? Is it medical triage? Where are we going to devote our effort?Dr Susan Carland:Mark, thank you so much for coming back. I think you're really well dressed. I think Google got it wrong.Mark Andrejevic:Thank you. Likewise.Dr Susan Carland:I asked recent Chief Digital Advisor on Microsoft Australia, Rita Arrigo, for her advice.What advice would you give to the average person who is interested in maybe accessing AI, but wants to make sure they're part of an ethical or fair society of AI use?Rita Arrigo:I feel really into that. I think there should be ways that you can start to be part of these ethics committees, and be part of these kinds of decisions. I think there's already a bit of a startup around the ethics in AI committee and people that are going to make, have opinions around that. You're seeing it in our public sector. You're also seeing in our vendors where a lot of ... I was playing with this system called Fair Learn, which actually assesses systems and mitigates any impacts from race, gender, or disability, or age, and kind of assesses your AI platform in the way that you're using it. So a lot of software-driven stuff as well to start to assess a lot of those kinds of things.But I think the way I've ... I'm a real hands-on learner, so the way I've always kind of learned about the way things work or learned about IOT or learned about mixed realities, I like to go to hackathons or meetups. I think if I'm a young person, you want to turn up to some of these things and have a listen to what people are saying about data science. My first data science meetup, it was all about trying to figure out who's going to win the soccer. So people were studying soccer games and trying to figure out, and had servers under their desk. Now it's really evolved into being able to tap into services to do a lot of that kind of deep learning and machine learning and not have to kind of create your own hardware and that kind of stuff. I think for young people, it's really exciting to kind of see the applications and see the way we're using some of the newest technology to trial some of these things.Dr Susan Carland:Rita, thank you so much for joining us.Rita Arrigo:It's a pleasure. Had a lot of fun.Dr Susan Carland:That's it for our look into the issues surrounding bias in artificial intelligence. We will be back next week with a brand new topic to unpack on 'What Happens Next?'.Listen to more What Happens Next? podcast episodes

On 14 September 2021, eight international organisations joined forces to launch a new portal promoting global co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). The portal is a one-stop shop for data, research findings and good practices in AI policy.
The objective of the portal is to help policymakers and the wider public navigate the international AI governance landscape. It provides access to the necessary tools and information, such as projects, research and reports to promote trustworthy and responsible AI that is aligned with human rights at global, national and local level.
Key partners in this joint effort include the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the World Bank Group.

Photograph: ReutersArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldScientists identify key conditions to set up a creative ‘hot streak’This article is more than 2 years oldResearchers use AI to reveal runs of artistic success are commonly preceded by an experimental phaseNicola DavisMon 13 Sep 2021 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 19 Oct 2022 10.08 EDTShareWhether it is the director Márta Mészáros or the artist Jackson Pollock, those in creative careers often experience a particular burst of success.Now researchers have used artificial intelligence to reveal such “hot streaks” are commonly preceded by an experimental phase followed by a focus on one particular approach once the winning period has begun.The director Peter Jackson’s career is, perhaps, a prime example: his hugely successful Lord of the Rings trilogy came after an eclectic range of movies such as the sci-fi comedy horror Bad Taste, the puppet film Meet the Feebles and the drama Heavenly Creatures.The new work builds on a previous study by the researchers that suggested many creatives find themselves on a roll at some point in their career, although when exactly this happens appears to be random.“About 90% of people have at least one hot streak” said Prof Dashun Wang of Northwestern University, who led the latest study. But, Wang said, it was important to understand why they happened.“Then we can think about, how do we facilitate an individual to help them break through?” he said. “How do we first create an environment that will help the individual to achieve their full potential?”Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Wang and colleagues report how they sought to investigate whether there was a common pattern behind hot streaks. To do so they looked at metrics of success such as the auction price of art works, IMDb ratings of films and citations of research papers to identify hot streaks for 2,128 artists, including Pollock and Frida Kahlo, 4,337 directors – including Mészáros and Jackson – and 20,040 scientists, including the Nobel laureates John B Fenn and Frances Arnold.They then analysed how diverse the individuals’ work was at different points in their careers. This was assessed using an artificial intelligence system that was trained, in the case of art, to “recognise” different styles by features such as the brush strokes, shapes and objects in a piece, while in the case of film, it was trained to classify a director’s work based on plot and cast information. For science, the system identified different research topics based on the papers cited within a researcher’s publications.The diversity before and during the hot streaks was then compared with the diversity at random points in the careers. The team found that for all three career types, work tended to be more diverse just before a true hot streak than expected from the randomly selected points.However, once success had begun, individuals switched, sticking to a narrower than expected approach. That, the team says, suggests “that individuals become substantially more focused on what they work on, reflecting an exploitation strategy during hot streak”.But the researchers found that neither exploring new approaches nor exploiting one were alone linked to hot streaks. Instead it is the combination that is important.“There’s experimentation, and then there’s implementation based on what you have learned through experimentation,” said Wang.Among other twists, the team found that scientists are more likely to try new things with small teams before a hot streak, but then work with large teams once a hot streak begins.Wang said a key direction for future work is to look at how long an experimentation period tends to be.Pamela Burnard, a professor of arts at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research.“‘Trying something new’, ‘going for it’ and optimising ‘hot streaks’, are not new in our understanding of creative careers. What is new is the use of AI to study careers,” she said, adding that old models, for education, economies and creative careers were failing.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ArtPeter JacksonHilary MantelJackson PollockComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because everything got outdated quickly, my little project soon occupied a shelf and threatened to consume many more.You had to have been there in that long-ago age to know how magical it felt to see averages tick over live, and to watch record pages update themselves on ESPNcricinfo. A few years after, along came Statsguru to spoil numbers geeks. It still remains the cricket world's default tool to search, dice and zoom in and out of stats across players, teams, eras and formats. Early in my job as editor of the site, I remember the utter panic in a media box once when Statsguru went down for a while towards the end of a game. I could feel eyes on me, but instead of feeling awkward, I was quietly chuffed.AskCricinfo is a natural, and if I may say, slightly giddy, step forward in that journey: another breakthrough, a little more magic. For all its wonders, Statsguru, with all those filters that allow you to drill and drill, can be a bit overwhelming for the newbie. But what if you could get Virat Kohli's record against legspinners in the last two seasons in the IPL by just typing out a query about it in regular English?Or the answers to other queries, like these:Who hit the most sixes in the powerplays in IPL 2020?What is Dale Steyn's record against AB de Villiers in all T20s? What is Babar Azam's strike rate against Shahid Afridi in the PSL?Which bowler has the most wickets in death overs in the men's T20 World Cups?Which batter has the most 50-plus scores in women's T20Is?Who has the most sixes in an innings in the T20 Blast/T20 Cup in England?Who has scored the most runs in the death overs in an innings in the IPL?What is the highest total by a team in a women's T20I?Who has scored the most runs against Rashid Khan in the BBL?What is the highest partnership in a successful run-chase in the BPL?Just  AskCricinfo. Get to the page. Key in the question. Or ask it aloud if you have voice input enabled for your phone browser. The answer will flash in a few seconds.Of course it's not all that simple at our end. First, the  AskCricinfo engine needs to think like a cricket fan and interpret ""Which opening batter has faced the most dot balls in the powerplays in an innings in IPL?"" or ""What is the highest partnership for the sixth wicket after five wickets down for less than 50 in the CPL?"" correctly. Next, it has to translate that into language that computers understand, and also correctly identify which database to send the question to - our Statsguru engine, the ball-by-ball database, or the records pages. After these tasks, it needs to return the exact answers to those questions.These are not static web pages called up by keyword-matching, as with normal search engines. Here, each question is unique, there are millions of questions that our databases can answer, and a million ways the engine can go wrong. The enormous complexity of this task is why you haven't seen anything like this - not for cricket, not for any sport, not for anything else - where a natural language question returns a precise answer from a database.Since a lot of these answers are derived from ball-by-ball data, this version of  AskCricinfo only fully supports top-flight international cricket, both men's and women's, and all the major leagues. We have started with the newest format simply because there is relatively more ball-by-ball data available for T20 as a whole. Our aim is to build  AskCricinfo tournament by tournament, and then format by format.Artificial intelligence, as most of us know by now, gets better with use. Like with the discovery algorithms on streaming apps,  AskCricinfo will get smarter the more questions it is asked.In the period leading up to this launch, we have endured as much frustration as we have experienced exhilaration. When the first answer came through, it felt like magic. But as expectations and ambition grew, there were days when the task felt hopeless. Accepting the pursuit of accuracy as a more realistic goal freed us from the burden of trying to achieve perfection - unattainable in this case.So let's set our expectations. AskCricinfo is designed to answer queries based on scoring data. It doesn't have opinions: you can ask  who has taken the most wickets in the death overs, but not ""Who is the best bowler in the death overs?"" It doesn't deal in trivia (How many batters have scored hundreds on their birthday? How many sets of brothers currently play in the IPL?) And there is some data it doesn't process yet. (Who was the fastest bowler? Who has scored the most runs from cover drives?)Since the tool is in learning mode, the more specific the questions, the better the answers. Try to spell things right, particularly names; use specific terms like ""batting"", ""bowling"", ""in an innings"", ""in a match"", ""in a season"";  ""Ben Stokes' bowling record"" instead of ""Ben Stokes' record"". Use ""versus"" or ""vs"" or ""v"" for batter-versus-bowler queries, and ""and"" to compare two players ( ""Kohli vs Rashid"",  ""Compare Warner and Rohit Sharma strike rates in powerplays"").Those inclined to help, please make sure to click the thumb icons at the bottom of the  AskCricinfo page. Particularly the ""thumbs down"" one if you think the result is incorrect. And if you can, tell us what went wrong in the text field below. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn.The  AskCricinfo project reunited us with one of ESPNcricinfo's original co-founders, and it began, true to tradition, with a chance conversation online. Vishal Misra, whose most famous contribution to the site is re-engineering the live scorecard overnight during the 1996 World Cup, but who stopped working for Cricinfo long before I came on board, tagged me in a tweet that suggested someone should create an interface for Statsguru using an AI tool that he had come across. ""I am waiting for you to do it,"" I replied.That little chat lit a spark. In a few days Vishal, who has been a professor, entrepreneur and consultant, and a cricket nut at his core, sent me a prototype, and in a matter of a couple of months he had put together a small team that has worked with a small team of ours to bring  AskCricinfo to life.Come and share the adventure with us.

Our aim is to build  AskCricinfo tournament by tournament, and then format by format.Artificial intelligence, as most of us know by now, gets better with use. Like with the discovery algorithms on streaming apps,  AskCricinfo will get smarter the more questions it is asked.In the period leading up to this launch, we have endured as much frustration as we have experienced exhilaration. When the first answer came through, it felt like magic. But as expectations and ambition grew, there were days when the task felt hopeless. Accepting the pursuit of accuracy as a more realistic goal freed us from the burden of trying to achieve perfection - unattainable in this case.A handy tool for those cricket debates with friends•Satish Bate/Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesSo let's set our expectations. AskCricinfo is designed to answer queries based on scoring data. It doesn't have opinions: you can ask  who has taken the most wickets in the death overs, but not ""Who is the best bowler in the death overs?"" It doesn't deal in trivia (How many batters have scored hundreds on their birthday? How many sets of brothers currently play in the IPL?) And there is some data it doesn't process yet. (Who was the fastest bowler? Who has scored the most runs from cover drives?)Since the tool is in learning mode, the more specific the questions, the better the answers. Try to spell things right, particularly names; use specific terms like ""batting"", ""bowling"", ""in an innings"", ""in a match"", ""in a season"";  ""Ben Stokes' bowling record"" instead of ""Ben Stokes' record"". Use ""versus"" or ""vs"" or ""v"" for batter-versus-bowler queries, and ""and"" to compare two players ( ""Kohli vs Rashid"",  ""Compare Warner and Rohit Sharma strike rates in powerplays"").Those inclined to help, please make sure to click the thumb icons at the bottom of the  AskCricinfo page. Particularly the ""thumbs down"" one if you think the result is incorrect. And if you can, tell us what went wrong in the text field below. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn.The  AskCricinfo project reunited us with one of ESPNcricinfo's original co-founders, and it began, true to tradition, with a chance conversation online. Vishal Misra, whose most famous contribution to the site is re-engineering the live scorecard overnight during the 1996 World Cup, but who stopped working for Cricinfo long before I came on board, tagged me in a tweet that suggested someone should create an interface for Statsguru using an AI tool that he had come across. ""I am waiting for you to do it,"" I replied.That little chat lit a spark. In a few days Vishal, who has been a professor, entrepreneur and consultant, and a cricket nut at his core, sent me a prototype, and in a matter of a couple of months he had put together a small team that has worked with a small team of ours to bring  AskCricinfo to life.Come and share the adventure with us. And let's take to it to the places it can go.Sambit Bal is editor-in-chief of ESPNcricinfo @sambitbalby Taboolaby TaboolaSponsoredSponsoredPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeCoupon Code

Researchers mimic the animal kingdom’s most basic signs of intelligence in quantum material
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — For artificial intelligence to get any smarter, it needs first to be as intelligent as one of the simplest creatures in the animal kingdom: the sea slug.
A new study has found that a material can mimic the sea slug’s most essential intelligence features. The discovery is a step toward building hardware that could help make AI more efficient and reliable for technology ranging from self-driving cars and surgical robots to social media algorithms.
The study, publishing this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted by a team of researchers from Purdue University, Rutgers University, the University of Georgia and Argonne National Laboratory.
“Through studying sea slugs, neuroscientists discovered the hallmarks of intelligence that are fundamental to any organism’s survival,” said Shriram Ramanathan, a Purdue professor of materials engineering. “We want to take advantage of that mature intelligence in animals to accelerate the development of AI.”

Two main signs of intelligence that neuroscientists have learned from sea slugs are habituation and sensitization. Habituation is getting used to a stimulus over time, such as tuning out noises when driving the same route to work every day. Sensitization is the opposite – it’s reacting strongly to a new stimulus, like avoiding bad food from a restaurant.
AI has a really hard time learning and storing new information without overwriting information it has already learned and stored, a problem that researchers studying brain-inspired computing call the “stability-plasticity dilemma.” Habituation would allow AI to “forget” unneeded information (achieving more stability) while sensitization could help with retaining new and important information (enabling plasticity).
In this study, the researchers found a way to demonstrate both habituation and sensitization in nickel oxide, a quantum material. The material is called “quantum” because its properties can’t be explained by classical physics.
If a quantum material could reliably mimic these forms of learning, then it may be possible to build AI directly into hardware. And if AI could operate both through hardware and software, it might be able to perform more complex tasks using less energy.
“We basically emulated experiments done on sea slugs in quantum materials toward understanding how these materials can be of interest for AI,” Ramanathan said.
Neuroscience studies have shown that the sea slug demonstrates habituation when it stops withdrawing its gill as much in response to being tapped on the siphon. But an electric shock to its tail causes its gill to withdraw much more dramatically, showing sensitization.
For nickel oxide, the equivalent of a “gill withdrawal” is an increased change in electrical resistance. The researchers found that repeatedly exposing the material to hydrogen gas causes nickel oxide’s change in electrical resistance to decrease over time, but introducing a new stimulus like ozone greatly increases the change in electrical resistance.
Inspired by these findings, a research group under Kaushik Roy, Purdue’s Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, modeled nickel oxide’s behavior and built an algorithm that successfully used these habituation and sensitization strategies to categorize data points into clusters.
“The stability-plasticity dilemma is not solved at all. But we’ve shown a way to address it based on behavior we’ve observed in a quantum material,” Roy said. “If we could turn a material that learns like this into hardware in the future, then AI could perform tasks much more efficiently.”
For practical use of quantum materials as AI hardware, researchers will need to figure out how to apply habituation and sensitization in large-scale systems. They also would have to determine how a material could respond to stimuli while integrated into a computer chip.
This study is a starting place for guiding those next steps, the researchers said. In addition to the experiments performed at Purdue, a team at Rutgers University performed detailed theory calculations to understand what was happening within nickel oxide at a microscopic level to mimic the sea slug’s intelligence features. Argonne National Laboratory characterized the nickel oxide sample’s properties and the University of Georgia measured conductivity to further analyze the material’s behavior.
The work received funding from multiple entities, including the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, the Office of Naval Research, and the Center for Brain Inspired Computing, a Joint University Microelectronics Program center sponsored by the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The research used the resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory.

Habituation and sensitization (non-associative learning) are among the most fundamental forms of learning and memory behavior present in organisms that enables adaptation and learning in dynamic environments. Emulating such features of intelligence found in nature in the solid state can serve as inspiration for algorithmic simulations in artificial neural networks and potential use in neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate non-associative learning with a prototypical Mott insulator, nickel oxide (NiO), under a variety of external stimuli at and above room temperature. Similar to biological species such as Aplysia, habituation and sensitization of NiO possesses time-dependent plasticity relying on both strength and time-interval between stimuli. Combination of experimental approaches and first-principles calculations reveal that such learning behavior of NiO results from dynamic modulation of its defect and electronic structure. An artificial neural network model inspired by such non-associative learning is simulated to show advantages for unsupervised clustering task in accuracy and reducing catastrophic interference, which could help mitigate the stability-plasticity dilemma. Mott insulators can therefore serve as building blocks to examine learning behavior noted in biology and inspire new learning algorithms for artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the way of the future in tech, gaming and smart-device industries. When applied effectively, AI can save on human employment costs and, in some cases, can accomplish tasks even better than humans can. It would make sense for other industries to try to capitalize on AI's efficiency, versatility and overall power, but for entrepreneurs, applying AI to human resources (HR) poses some challenges.

Understanding AI and the challenges it creates in HR departmentsHR professionals may want to put AI to use, at least partly because it can offer predictive analysis for recruiting. When a company is swamped with resumes, AI can scan resumes for those that best fit the skills and responsibilities required for that specific job. In this sense, AI can save HR teams days of sifting through resumes and cover letters. But applying AI to HR departments isn't always that simple, and in many cases AI can create more challenges than the problems that it solves. Here are some of those issues, and how you can deal with them.


1. AI won't understand your company like you or a recruiter canAlthough AI might help recruiters quickly scan through a pile of resumes, it lacks the global understanding of a company that recruiters possess. When hiring ideal employees, a recruiter researches a company and develops an understanding of that company's positioning, direction within the market and even company culture. AI lacks that same understanding, so when it comes to identifying employees who might be a good fit given the wider global view of the company, AI technology falls short. AI also lacks the knowledge and intuition that recruiters develop from decades in their jobs. AI won't necessarily spot important connections in an applicant's past work that might hint that applicant could be an important candidate. For instance, a recruiter might see that an applicant has worked for a company that underwent rapid growth in the past. That could mean the applicant might be comfortable and flexible enough to grow with a quickly expanding startup. AI won't make that same connection.

The key here is to consider mixing these solutions, so you receive the benefits of both. For example, you can use AI to help candidates more easily send you their credentials (automatic web forms and the like), but use recruiters and your own experience to narrow down the applicants who may actually be the best fit.2. You might miss out on hiring outliersJob applicants who don't fit all of the strict hiring criteria a company has established might also be overlooked by HR. Some of these outliers could make a strong contribution to a company but might not get an interview because of AI technology used to screen resumes. Similarly, because AI lacks a human touch, it might approve resumes of applicants who meet all of the required criteria, but who still aren't ideal applicants for a position. Although it's smart to use AI to cast a wide net, watch the process closely to keep an eye out for certain characteristics that you want in a new hire. If necessary, schedule time for you and your team to personally assess any candidate if needed. Related: Nervous About Meeting Employees in Person for the First Time? Try These 5 Tips


3.  AI can't account for human emotion When hiring, companies don't base their decision-making process on only hard skills. Emotional and psychological traits are important, too, including ambition and passion. AI cannot currently monitor or evaluate human emotion, and it can't account for how emotion affects human behavior. AI also cannot account for personalities and how emotion can affect teams. If tasked with finding a new team member to add to an existing team, AI can't recognize the nuances of team dynamics and how personalities work together. That's where you and the team come in. Because AI operates without the background understanding of complex human emotions, it makes for a flawed hiring and employee evaluation process. Use it sparingly for actual employee evaluation, and let team members do that themselves. 4. AI can't ""read' peopleHR is a human-based, personal operation. AI can't replace an individual manager's unique viewpoint or ability to ""read"" people in person, whether they're job applicants or current employees. Although companies might incorporate AI solutions into their business models, the technology isn't ready to take over significant face-to-face responsibilities in an HR department just yet. As mentioned, the technology might be useful in resume screenings, but it needs to be monitored closely and can't replace talent evaluators (no matter what Elon Musk's plans are).Related: 3 Ways to Set Up Personal and Business Success During Immense Change


5. AI lacks ethical responsibilityEthical responsibility is key for HR teams today, especially when it comes to hiring minorities, taking action after sexual assault and other hot-button issues. AI lacks the ethical responsibility that HR needs to uphold, and AI can unknowingly become biased, too. AI technology ""learns"" from the algorithms that it processes. If AI's machine learning process is programmed by a human, it can take on the biases of its programmer, even though he or she might be unaware of their biases. With biased technology, a company's talent acquisition process might unintentionally also be biased. If the hiring process is ever challenged or questioned, the technology cannot be held accountable for the bias, so HR leaders and the HR team need to take on ethical responsibility. In order to prevent or remedy these occurrences, HR pros have to communicate about such problems to company leadership and programmers. Then, different departments should work together to identify bias, and prevent it from influencing hiring processes.  On another ethical note, if AI can replace a certain number of workers at a company, HR might face the challenging question of deciding which employees to let go. AI might save a company money, but replacing employees with technology can be a touchy ethical dilemma. 


Also, certain AI tech can help by actually picking which people to lay off. Discuss whether these types of solutions feel ethically right to you and your team or not. Just who will select the technology, who needs to be retrained or who might be fired in the end? Go carefully and thoughtfully as you deal with AI and how it affects all of these matters.Related: 4 Lessons from Steve Jobs That Are Still Relevant 10 Years After His Death

Even now, though, things with artificial intelligence may go wrong. Unfortunately, AI systems may run amok on their own, with no outside intervention..AI failed to recognize images:.This example is one of the popular AI failures. Deep learning, a collection of methods commonly used to construct AI, began its triumphant march around 20 years ago with the breakthrough in image recognition, also known as computer vision. It completed previously unsolvable tasks, such as identifying cats from dogs and vice versa, before moving on to more difficult and demanding challenges. It is now a widely held belief that computer vision is a stable and trustworthy technology that is unlikely to fail. Researchers from Berkeley, the University of Chicago, and the University of Washington gathered 7,500 unedited nature pictures a year ago, which perplexed even the most powerful computer vision algorithms. Even the most tried and true algorithms might fail at times..AI despised humans:.After 24 hours of 'learning' from human interactions, Tay, Microsoft's most advanced chatbot, declared, &quot;Hitler was correct to hate the Jews&quot; on Twitter. The goal was to build a slang-filled chatbot that would raise machine-human conversation quality to a new level. However, it was revealed to be a &quot;robot parrot with an internet connection.&quot; The chatbot was constructed on top of the company's AI technology stack, but the harsh reality appears to have ruined the innocent artificial intelligence worldview: an excellent illustration of how data may damage an AI model built in a &quot;clean&quot; lab environment without immunity to detrimental outside impact. This example belongs to another popular AI failure..AI to fight cancer could kill patients:.Another failure cost US$62 million, which was spent by IBM to develop an AI system to aid in the battle against cancer. However, the outcome was once again unsatisfactory. The product, according to a doctor at Jupiter Hospital in Florida, was a complete failure. He went on to say that they acquired it for marketing purposes. Watson advised physicians to give a cancer patient with serious bleeding a medication that might aggravate the bleeding, according to medical experts and customers. Multiple cases of dangerous and erroneous therapy suggestions were reported by medical experts and customers..AI despised women:.Amazon wanted to automate its hiring process to expedite the selection of candidates for the thousands of job openings they have. Everything ended up being a public relations disaster since the system turned out to be sexist, favoring white guys. The training data used to create the model was most likely imbalanced, resulting in candidate selection bias. This is also another example of AI Failures..AI for secure system access by a face can be tricked with a mask: .Make sure no one is wearing a mask with your face if you have an iPhone X with a Face ID. Face ID, according to Apple, creates a 3-dimensional model of your face using the iPhone X's powerful front-facing camera and machine learning. The machine learning/AI component allowed the system to adjust to aesthetic changes (such as putting on make-up, donning a pair of glasses, or wrapping a scarf around your neck) while maintaining security. Bkav, a security business located in Vietnam, discovered that by attaching 2D &quot;eyes&quot; to a 3D mask, they could successfully unlock a Face ID-equipped iPhone. The stone powder mask, which cost approximately US$200, was created. The eyeballs were simply infrared pictures printed on paper. Wired, on the other hand, attempted to defeat Face ID using masks but was unable to replicate the results..AI believes that members of Congress resemble criminals:.Amazon is responsible for another face recognition blunder. Its AI system was meant to detect offenders based on their facial image, but when it was put to the test using a batch of photos of members of Congress, it proved to be not only incorrect but also racially prejudiced. According to the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), almost 40% of Rekognition's (the system's) erroneous matches in our test were of persons of color, even though people of race make up just 20% of Congress. It's unclear if it was a fault with non-white face recognition or if the training data was skewed. Both, most likely. However, relying only on AI to determine whether or not a person is a criminal would be crazy..A lawsuit was filed as a result of an AI-related loss:.A Hong Kong real estate tycoon purchased an AI system to handle a portion of his money to increase funds. In reality, the robot continued to lose up to US$20 million every day. To reclaim a portion of his money, the tycoon sued the firm that provided the fintech service for US$23 million. The lawsuit claims that the business overstated K1's capabilities, and it is the first recorded example of court action over automated investing losses. This AI Failure is also another example..AI has lost its employment to humans:.The first revolutionary Henn-na Hotel opened its doors to visitors in Japan in 2015. All of the hotel's employees were robots, including the front desk, cleaners, porters, and in-room helpers. However, the bots quickly accumulated consumer complaints: they regularly broke down, we're unable to offer adequate responses to visitor questions, and in-room helpers frightened guests at night by misinterpreting snoring as a wake command. The hotel group that owned the hotel finally got rid of the last of its unreliable, costly, and irritating bots, replacing them with human staff after years of effort. The management said that it will return to the lab to see if it can build a new generation of more adept hospitality bots..A triumph for AI that ended in a defeat:.Artificial intelligence was victorious in this case, but it was on the wrong side of the law. A call from his German employer instructed the CEO of a UK-based energy business to transfer €220,000 (US$243,000) to a Hungarian supplier. The 'boss' stated that the request was urgent and instructed the UK CEO to send the funds as soon as possible. Regrettably, the boss was a 'deep fake' speech-generating program that precisely resembled the genuine human's voice. According to The Wall Street Journal, it employed machine learning to become indistinguishable from the original, including the &quot;slight German accent and the melody of his voice.&quot; Is AI a success or a failure? It is entirely up to you to make your decision. This is one of the examples of AI failures..AI-driven cart Malfunctioned on the tarmac:.On the tarmac, an AI-driven food cart malfunctioned, circling out of control and ever-closer to a vulnerable Aeroplan parked at a gate. Finally, a yellow-vest worker was able to stop the cart by hitting it with another vehicle and knocking it down. This case is a little off the rails. The cart was neither mechanized nor controlled by artificial intelligence in any manner. This is also considered one of the popular AI failures..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AskCricinfo is the easiest way to get your stats questions answered. It's like the stats nerd in your circle of friends who revels in cricket numbers and has an answer to every query. And unlike that stats nerd, it never sleeps.At the moment AskCricinfo is still a work in progress. Which means it will make mistakes, and it won't know the answer to every question you ask. But we're banking on you - the cricket fan - to help us improve it and make it perfect.What sort of queries will it answer?
To start with, T20s will be the focus of AskCricinfo. More specifically, it will answer questions on:
 Tests (Men and Women)
 ODIs (Men and Women)
 ODI World Cup (Men and Women)
 Champions Trophy
 IPL
 BBL
 PSL
 CPL
 BPL
 T20 Blast
 T20 internationals (Men and Women)
 T20 World Cup (Men and Women)
 All T20s (Men) (as an overall grouping)
However, since we don't have ball-by-ball data for many women's T20I matches, for that category, AskCricinfo will only answer those queries for which data is available from scorecards. Thus, you won't get answers to player vs player, powerplay, and death-overs questions, but questions related to match totals, run rates, partnerships etc will be answered.For the men's matches, the results for ball-by-ball queries will include all matches for which these details were recorded.A few examples of the query types AskCricinfo will answer are:RecordsMost sixes conceded by a bowler in the PSL
Fastest to 10,000 runs in men's Tests
Who has scored the most runs in World T20?
Most powerplay wickets taken by a spinner in the IPL
Which captain has won the most matches after losing the toss in men's ODIs?
What is the highest partnership in women's ODIs?
Most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in a match in the BPL
Highest individual score in a women's T20IPlayer stats
Pollard's batting record in the death overs
Yuzvendra Chahal's economy rate at each venue in the IPL
What is David Warner's highest score in run chases in T20Is?
What is Jhulan Goswami's economy rate in ODIs in England?
Sunil Gavaskar's batting average in Tests against West IndiesPlayer/team match-ups / comparisons
Who has dismissed Aaron Finch most often in the BBL?
Virat Kohli's batting average against James Anderson in Tests
New Zealand's T20I record against Bangladesh
Compare the strike rates of Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell in the death overs in IPLPartnerships
What is the highest partnership in a follow-on in Tests?
What is the highest partnership in Women's T20Is?
Highest partnership in a defeat in the T20 Blast
Highest stands between Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in the IPL
Best strike-rate for a 50+ stand in the BBL
Best run rate for a century partnership in ODIsWhy is there a tournament/ format dropdown listed beside the query bar?
The dropdown ensures you don't need to type in the tournament name for each query - selecting the relevant tournament/format from the dropdown will do the job, and ensure that the output is restricted to that tournament alone, for that query and all subsequent queries, unless another tournament is selected from the dropdown.If a written query specifies a tournament different from the one in the dropdown selection, the dropdown entry will change to accommodate the tournament specified in the text. A couple of examples.Query: What is the most sixes hit in an innings by a team (select ""BBL"" from the dropdown)
The output leads with 15 sixes, by Sydney Thunder versus Sydney Sixers in Adelaide.Change the dropdown selection to ""IPL"". 
The output now leads with RCB's 21 sixes against Pune Warriors in 2013.Now change the query to ""Highest partnership in a defeat in a T20I"", but keep the dropdown selection as ""IPL"" .
As mentioned earlier, the query engine gives precedence to the written query over the dropdown selection, and throws up the 156-run partnership between Adnan Idrees  and Ravija Sandaruwan as the top entry, with the dropdown selection automatically changing to ""T20Is"". You can also view the scorecard of that game by clicking on the drilldown options on the right in that row.Do we need to ask the questions in a particular format?
No, but the clearer the question, the higher are the chances of AskCricinfo fetching the right answers. Here are a few tips:
Defining the innings number in Tests: Since the term 'first innings' could mean the first innings of a match, or the first innings for a team (which could be the first or second innings of a match), the following rules apply for the algorithm to understand which innings to query for:-	'Innings number 1' (or 'innings no. 1' or 'innings no.=1') will returns results only for the first innings of a game. The other three innings will be ignored.
-	Any other terminology will return results for the first two innings.
-	So, 'highest total by a team in innings no. 2 in a Test match' will return results only for that particular innings, ignoring innings 1, 3 and 4, while 'highest total by a team in the second innings in a Test match' will return results for innings 3 and 4.Keep the questions specific and detailed, using key terms that will help the engine identify the question and answer it correctly.

So, ""Gayle versus Ashwin in the powerplay in IPL""; ""Compare the strike rates of Pollard and Russell in the death overs in IPL"".Mind your spellings : The engine may not identify players whose names have been spelt incorrectly, so be careful about spelling names right. In general, avoid spelling errors to get the best results from AskCricinfo.Rephrase your question and try again if you don't get the answer you expect at the first attempt. The learning engine may not have come across that specific semantic construction for the question. Rephrasing the question might help the engine understand, and answer, your question.Pick the tournament from the dropdown: As mentioned earlier, the tournament/format dropdown ensures you don't need to write them out for every query.Will the voice command work for questions?
The voice command will work on the desktop and on mobile web (but not on the ESPNcricinfo app). You can use voice input for your query by clicking on the mic icon and asking the question clearly. Voice commands will work on most browsers on desktop and on mobile.What are some of the questions that Ask Cricinfo will not answer?
While Ask Cricinfo will answer a wide gamut of questions, there are some query types that it is not trained for. So the following question types are beyond it at this time:
Line, length, ball type, ball speed
Eg: Who bowled the most yorkers in IPL 2020
How many times was AB de Villiers dismissed by the googly in last two seasons
Bumrah's economy rate when he bowls back of a length
Who bowled the fastest ball of last seasonWagon wheel
Eg: How many runs has Babar Azam scored in the V this PSL seasonShot type
Eg: What is Prithvi Shaw's favourite shot this seasonControl factor
Eg: Which batsman had the highest control percent this seasonDRS 
Eg: Which team had the best success percent with reviews Consecutives
Eg: Which team has the most consecutive wins
Which batsman has hit 50s in the most consecutive innings Indian versus foreign players in the IPL
Eg: What was the split of runs scored by Indian and foreign players for MI in IPL 2021Dot-ball %, boundary %, control %
The raw values for these data points will work, but not the percentage values. So:
Who bowled the most dot balls in IPL 2020 will work, but Which bowler had the highest percentage of dots in IPL 2020 will not
This is not a comprehensive list of queries which can't be answered.Also, since this is a purely stats-based engine, it will not answer queries which are not related to stats. (So don't expect it to know the name of Virat Kohli's daughter.)",,,"NewsHow to get the best out of AskCricinfoA list of FAQs about AskCricinfo, ESPNcricinfo's unique stats offeringESPNcricinfo stats team14-Sep-2021Geek speak: the simplest way to get cricket stats  •  ESPNcricinfo LtdWhat is AskCricinfo?
AskCricinfo is the easiest way to get your stats questions answered. It's like the stats nerd in your circle of friends who revels in cricket numbers and has an answer to every query. And unlike that stats nerd, it never sleeps.At the moment AskCricinfo is still a work in progress. Which means it will make mistakes, and it won't know the answer to every question you ask. But we're banking on you - the cricket fan - to help us improve it and make it perfect.What sort of queries will it answer?
To start with, T20s will be the focus of AskCricinfo. More specifically, it will answer questions on:
 Tests (Men and Women)
 ODIs (Men and Women)
 ODI World Cup (Men and Women)
 Champions Trophy
 IPL
 BBL
 PSL
 CPL
 BPL
 T20 Blast
 T20 internationals (Men and Women)
 T20 World Cup (Men and Women)
 All T20s (Men) (as an overall grouping)
However, since we don't have ball-by-ball data for many women's T20I matches, for that category, AskCricinfo will only answer those queries for which data is available from scorecards. Thus, you won't get answers to player vs player, powerplay, and death-overs questions, but questions related to match totals, run rates, partnerships etc will be answered.RelatedIntroducing AskCricinfoFor the men's matches, the results for ball-by-ball queries will include all matches for which these details were recorded.A few examples of the query types AskCricinfo will answer are:RecordsMost sixes conceded by a bowler in the PSL
Fastest to 10,000 runs in men's Tests
Who has scored the most runs in World T20?
Most powerplay wickets taken by a spinner in the IPL
Which captain has won the most matches after losing the toss in men's ODIs?
What is the highest partnership in women's ODIs?
Most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in a match in the BPL
Highest individual score in a women's T20IPlayer stats
Pollard's batting record in the death overs
Yuzvendra Chahal's economy rate at each venue in the IPL
What is David Warner's highest score in run chases in T20Is?
What is Jhulan Goswami's economy rate in ODIs in England?
Sunil Gavaskar's batting average in Tests against West IndiesPlayer/team match-ups / comparisons
Who has dismissed Aaron Finch most often in the BBL?
Virat Kohli's batting average against James Anderson in Tests
New Zealand's T20I record against Bangladesh
Compare the strike rates of Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell in the death overs in IPLPartnerships
What is the highest partnership in a follow-on in Tests?
What is the highest partnership in Women's T20Is?
Highest partnership in a defeat in the T20 Blast
Highest stands between Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in the IPL
Best strike-rate for a 50+ stand in the BBL
Best run rate for a century partnership in ODIsESPNcricinfo LtdWhy is there a tournament/ format dropdown listed beside the query bar?
The dropdown ensures you don't need to type in the tournament name for each query - selecting the relevant tournament/format from the dropdown will do the job, and ensure that the output is restricted to that tournament alone, for that query and all subsequent queries, unless another tournament is selected from the dropdown.If a written query specifies a tournament different from the one in the dropdown selection, the dropdown entry will change to accommodate the tournament specified in the text. A couple of examples.Query: What is the most sixes hit in an innings by a team (select ""BBL"" from the dropdown)
The output leads with 15 sixes, by Sydney Thunder versus Sydney Sixers in Adelaide.Change the dropdown selection to ""IPL"". 
The output now leads with RCB's 21 sixes against Pune Warriors in 2013.Now change the query to ""Highest partnership in a defeat in a T20I"", but keep the dropdown selection as ""IPL"" .
As mentioned earlier, the query engine gives precedence to the written query over the dropdown selection, and throws up the 156-run partnership between Adnan Idrees  and Ravija Sandaruwan as the top entry, with the dropdown selection automatically changing to ""T20Is"". You can also view the scorecard of that game by clicking on the drilldown options on the right in that row.Do we need to ask the questions in a particular format?
No, but the clearer the question, the higher are the chances of AskCricinfo fetching the right answers. Here are a few tips:
Defining the innings number in Tests: Since the term 'first innings' could mean the first innings of a match, or the first innings for a team (which could be the first or second innings of a match), the following rules apply for the algorithm to understand which innings to query for:-	'Innings number 1' (or 'innings no. 1' or 'innings no.=1') will returns results only for the first innings of a game. The other three innings will be ignored.
-	Any other terminology will return results for the first two innings.
-	So, 'highest total by a team in innings no. 2 in a Test match' will return results only for that particular innings, ignoring innings 1, 3 and 4, while 'highest total by a team in the second innings in a Test match' will return results for innings 3 and 4.Keep the questions specific and detailed, using key terms that will help the engine identify the question and answer it correctly. These keywords include the following:batter/batting, bowler/ bowling, team, in an innings, in a match, in a season, overall.For example:- ""Batter with the most sixes in PSL 2020"" or ""Team with most sixes in PSL 2020"", instead of ""Most sixes in PSL 2020""- ""Bowler with most powerplay wickets"" or ""Team with most powerplay wickets"", instead of ""Most powerplay wickets"".- ""Most sixes by a team/batter in an innings"" instead of ""Most sixes in an innings"".- ""Worst powerplay score for a team in a match"", instead of ""Worst powerplay score""- ""Bumrah's bowling record against Ben Stokes"", instead of ""Bumrah's record against Stokes""- ""Compare the batting records of Andre Russell and Kieron Pollard"", instead of ""Compare the records of Andre Russell and Kieron Pollard"".- Use ""versus"" or ""vs"" or 'v"" for batter-versus-bowler match-up questions, and ""and"" to compare two players. So, ""Gayle versus Ashwin in the powerplay in IPL""; ""Compare the strike rates of Pollard and Russell in the death overs in IPL"".Mind your spellings : The engine may not identify players whose names have been spelt incorrectly, so be careful about spelling names right.
