With the endless promotion of artificial intelligence by analysts, media, and vendors, one can be forgiven for assuming AI is proliferating across and running enterprises far and wide. However, the reality is beyond simply automating narrow applications — such as credit scoring, upselling recommendations, chatbots, or managing machine performance — AI still has a limited range, and barely begun to achieve its full potential as a true augment to human intelligence and talent.


That's the takeaway from recent panel discussion hosted by New York University Center for the Future of Management and LMU institute for Strategy, Technology and Organization, joined by Daron Acemoglu, professor at MIT; Jacques Bughin, professor at the Solvay School of Economics and Management; and Raffaella Sadun, professor at Harvard Business School.

“I am not that excited about the narrow applications of AI,” says Sadun. “I’m not excited about the dumb approach of automating one process and them claiming that you are on a different tier of technology.”

PROMOTED
At the moment, “AI is being pushed too much into automating narrow tasks, where there are not a lot of productivity gains and a lot of displacement,” Acemoglu agrees. For the most part, “AI is being used at a narrow process level as a cost-cutting measure. That does not really work very well at scale, and is really not the best way of using AI. But a lot of managers are doing that. Many firms investing in AI, bit doing it the wrong way.”

AI will start reaching its potential when it aligns broader human and machine intelligence, says Acemoglu. “Machines need to become a tool for the selection and presentation of the right type of information, for leveraging the skill, judgement, creativity, and social learning and situational learning of humans,” he says. “Very few organizations are doing that. There is a failure of these organizations, but more importantly, it’s a failure in the field of AI,"" says Acemoglu. ""Managers are following what AI leaders are telling them. And AI leaders are not discussing this type of use of AI. They are hyping up cost-cutting process-level AI use. In that sense, we are in an AI trap.""

The embrace of a broader and more meaningful AI needs to start at the top, where there is still much resistance, Sadun says. “There are too many leaders and executives who think about AI as a technology, not as about a lever for organizational change,” she explains. “And they have no idea how the technology is actually used by their employees. People who are really using AI effectively in their firm spent time on the shop floor, seeing how the technology is used by people. They get a sense of the software and the hardware change that needs to be there for people to actually leverage AI.”

Embracing AI needs to be an organizational transformation. “It requires different skills — not just coding skills,” Sadun says. “It’s much more about the soft skills. The ability to coordinate knowledge that comes from different pockets of the organization. I’m surprised that even some organizations are getting it right. It’s actually a really tough issue.”
The companies that are using AI to its full potential “are thinking about incorporating new input,” says Sadun. They are thinking about training, making sure that the technology is actually usable, and can leverage continuous self-improvement. Fundamentally, it’s about the technologies that think about a human and a machine as a team.”

My personal favorite was a holiday-themed romantic comedy script, in which a ""business man,"" whose ""hands are briefcases,"" courts a ""single mother,"" who ""cannot date because of a snow curse.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis human-created work imitating artificial intelligence is almost certainly entitled to copyright registration. But what if someone actually created a bot to review 1,000 hours of romantic comedies and create a script amalgamating its learnings? Would that script be entitled to copyright registration? According to the U.S. Copyright Office's Copyright Compendium, ""the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work,"" so the answer is currently no.Advertisement · Scroll to continueStephen Thaler, a Ph.D. in Physics and the founder, president, and CEO of Missouri-based technology company Imagination Engines Incorporated, is trying to change the U.S. Copyright Office's policy against copyright registration of AI-created works.Thaler is a pioneer in creating artificial intelligence machines, including three versions of the ""Creativity Machine"" and the Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience, nicknamed DABUS. DABUS is one of the world's most-advanced AI systems because it not only compiles and analyzes existing information to produce optimal combinations, but also forms and tests consequence chains of each of the potential outcomes. Put simply, DABUS is to traditional AI what 3D is to 2D.Ad Break Coming Up

Continue watchingExiled Chinese businessman Guo convicted of fraudafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEThaler specifically piqued the interest of intellectual property lawyers because of his high-profile efforts to protect the fruits of the Creativity Machines' and DABUS's labors, both in patent offices around the world and in the U.S. Copyright Office.Circa 2014, DABUS had seen thousands of photographs and was able to generate original artwork based on its machine learning. On a particular project, Thaler used the ""random snipping of connections within DABUS to simulate a dying brain."" DABUS generated two-dimensional artwork that it named ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise."" Despite looking like a floral-covered railway tunnel to the human eye, DABUS captioned (and apparently envisioned) the artwork as: ""This facility was decommissioned in 1975. Administrative offices to right were abandoned then. Note the trans-dimensional rippling effect.""In November 2018, Thaler filed a U.S. copyright application to register the two-dimensional artwork, listing ""Creativity Machine"" as the author and himself as the claimant, based on his ownership of the Creativity Machine.In August 2019 and March 2020, the U.S. Copyright Office refused to register ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" because the work ""lacks the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim."" In May 2020, Thaler's counsel submitted a second request for reconsideration, which was evaluated by the Copyright Review Board, the tribunal responsible for hearing appeals of copyright registration refusal decisions and the final level of appellate review within the U.S. Copyright Office.On Feb. 14, 2022, the Copyright Review Board (CRB) rejected Thaler's argument that the human authorship requirement was unconstitutional and unsupported by case law and issued a decision upholding the Copyright Office's refusal to register ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise.""Although the precise question of whether AI-generated artwork could be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office appeared to be a question of first impression, the CRB leaned heavily on supposedly analogous CRB and federal court decisions involving works produced by nature and natural processes, such as a living garden, a jellyfish's depictions, and a monkey's photography.The CRB also relied on U.S. Supreme Court decisions from 1884, 1954, and 1973 (long before AI existed) defining an ""author"" as ""he to whom anything owes its origins"" and 1976 Copyright Act language referring to an author's children, widow, grandchildren, and widower — ""terms that 'all imply humanity'"" — as judicial and legislative precedent.And thus, even in the absence of an express human authorship requirement within the Copyright Act, the CRB held that ""[b]ecause copyright law as codified in the 1976 Act requires human authorship, the [w]ork cannot be registered."" The CRB also rejected work-for-hire arguments.Considering that Thaler's primary challenge to the Copyright Office's human authorship requirement was constitutionality, it was highly unlikely that the Copyright Office would have simply reversed its longstanding construction of the Copyright Act. Such a stark pivot in copyright policy will likely take the intervention of multiple federal courts or Congress.When Thaler's patent applications for AI-generated inventions were refused registration by the U.S. Patent Office, Thaler filed a lawsuit against the USPTO and its then-Acting Director under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing ""the USPTO is belatedly adopting luddism."" Reading the tea leaves, it appears likely that Thaler will soon file a complaint against the U.S. Copyright Office and the Register of Copyrights under the Administrative Procedure Act in the Eastern District of Virginia challenging the CRB's decision or appeal the CRB's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.And although the Copyright Office has occasionally reversed course in settlement of federal court lawsuits filed against it under the Administrative Procedure Act, such a reversal seems unlikely here because of the landmark nature of such a potential decision.Notably, Thaler could have touted his human contribution to the overall creation of the machine-generated artwork (for example, classifying the Creativity Machine as ""merely being an assisting instrument""), but instead represented that ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" was ""autonomously created by artificial intelligence without any creative contribution from a human actor.""This unequivocal statement appears to have been intentionally made to directly pressure test the U.S. Copyright Office's human authorship requirement, rather than creating a potential middle ground for joint authorship between AI and humans and leaving the question of 100% AI authorship unresolved.In a footnote, the Copyright Review Board noted that ""the Board does not need to determine under what circumstances human involvement in the creation of machine-generated works would meet the statutory criteria for copyright protection."" But it is reasonable to expect that issue to be squarely in front of the Copyright Review Board sooner than later.Unless and until the federal courts or Congress change the law with respect to copyright registrability of AI-generated works, the Copyright Review Board's decision presents more questions than it answers. For example, what can third parties do with AI-created works such as ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise""? Are such works to be treated like public domain works, free for anyone to commercialize?Likewise, although federal courts require a copyright registration as a prerequisite to the filing of a copyright infringement lawsuit, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which permits reporting of infringing user-generated content to a social media website (or other website with third-party content) does not. Accordingly, it is unclear whether sending a DMCA infringement notice to a website alleging infringement of an AI-generated work runs afoul of the DMCA's prohibition against bad-faith notices, following the CRB's ruling.Finally, if AI-created works are not registrable as copyrights because they lack human authorship, are they likewise exempt from copyright infringement, at least until they are exploited?The law typically lags technological advances, and artificial intelligence technology is no exception. As humans create artificial intelligence, and their artificial intelligence creates inventions and works of value, we can expect ample legal activity around the world seeking to protect the fruits of the artificial intelligence's lucrative labor. Thaler's ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" fight is likely only an entrance to artificial intellectual property jurisprudence.Disclaimer: This article is presented for informational purposes only and it is not intended to be construed or used as general legal advice nor as a solicitation of any type.Joel Feldman is a regular contributing columnist on trademark and copyright law for Reuters Legal News and Westlaw Today.Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter.

The most important development in human history will take place not too far in the future. Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, will become better (and cheaper) than humans at most tasks. This will generate enormous wealth that can be used to fill human needs.
However, since most humans will not be able to compete with AI, there will be little demand for ordinary people’s labour-power. The immediate effect of a world without work is that people will lose their primary source of income and whatever meaning, mastery, sense of belonging and status they get from their work. Our collective challenge is to find meaning and other ways to reliably get what we need in this new world.

What you just read is the prevailing story among both optimists and pessimists around the development of AI. The story can and should be challenged. (For an excellent challenge, see Divya Siddarth, Daron Acemoglu, Danielle Allen, Kate Crawford, James Evans, Michael Jordan, E. Glen Weyl’s How AI Fails Us.) However, here I will focus on what the story takes to be our challenge: How do we ensure that ordinary people continue to experience a growing standard of living and sense of meaning in a world without work?
Although it is not always recognised, a satisfactory answer to this challenge requires answering two related but distinct questions.

The easy question is to find possible, realistic replacements for work as a source of income and meaning.
The hard question is how to go from here to there, to make the possible actual. I call this AI’s transition problem.

Not only is the transition problem harder to solve. Replacing workers with AI may prevent any realistic solution to the challenge AI presents. This is AI’s transition paradox. The paradox, in short, is that the more workers who are replaced by AI, the more difficult it becomes to build the institutions that are necessary to make the lives of ordinary people better in a world without work. Without a solution to the transition paradox, the AI future will be dystopian.
I will flesh out the transition paradox in more detail. But first, how do we solve the easy question?
The easy question
OpenAI Co-Founder & CEO Sam Altman speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019. CC BY 2.0
There are several possible answers to the easy question, which recall is the task of finding possible, realistic replacements for work as a source of income and meaning.
One attractive model is proposed by Sam Altman, OpenAI co-founder and CEO. In the essay “Moore’s Law for Everything,” he argues for giving everyone a stake in the AI economy. By increasing taxes on profitable companies and property, one could fund a basic income, a universal, unconditional income paid monthly to all citizens or residents independent of whether they work or not.
One possible hurdle with the basic income solution is that people may like their jobs and prefer to receive income through work than through welfare. Not only do many people find meaning and belonging in their work. Many find it demeaning to receive welfare. Unemployment is among the major sources of lasting unhappiness.
Finding meaning, belonging, and happiness without work might nevertheless be a solvable problem, as suggested by e.g. John Danaher in Automation and Utopia Human: Flourishing in a World without Work.
Many retired people already live on a form of basic income. They are no less happy than working people. Indeed, they report being happier. Of course, a reason for this may be that they have earned their time of leisure. A more plausible explanation is that when we are no longer expected to work, and our peers no longer work, not working is no longer a marker of failure or a cause of anxiety about the future.
Other groups that are happy without work include adolescents and young adults. Indeed, a notable finding in happiness research points to a happiness U-curve over our lifetimes. Younger and older people are happier than people in their prime working age. The happiness U-curve is evidence that we can live good lives without work.
The hard question
David G. Blanchflower, Is happiness U-shaped everywhere? Age and subjective well-being in 145 countries. Journal of Population Economics 34, 575–624 (2021)
Altman’s answer to the easy question is to tax property and capital and provide people with a generous basic income. If we can solve the problem of finding happiness outside work, we have a satisfactory solution to the easy question. However, the harder question, how to get from here to there, remains unresolved. This is what I call AI’s transition problem.
To answer the hard question, we need to understand how institutions are built. An obvious source of insight is the historical record. How did we build institutions that have proven to distribute the gains from trade for the benefit of ordinary people, such as welfare states, regulation of working time, coordinated wage setting, and free or subsidised health care and education?
The optimistic take
Steven Pinker, Enlightenment Now, Penguin Books 2018, 108
The transition problem is rarely discussed explicitly by tech optimists. However, their implicit view finds a voice in Steven Pinker’s recent book Enlightenment Now. According to Pinker, social expenditure on institutions like education, health care and social insurance is the inevitable result of economic growth.
These are the things we want more of when we become richer. And since rich countries are predominantly democratic and thus responsive to citizens’ needs, rich countries provide people with what they want. This is evident from the statistics: The richer countries become, the more they spend on opportunity enhancing and equalising institutions.
Let us connect Pinker’s view with the prevailing story of AI replacing workers that we began with. With growing unemployment, the existing social insurance and taxation programs will be unsatisfactory in providing people with what they need.
In response, political elites will want to find new ways to tax wealth and provide people with other sources of consumption power. These elites may either be motivated by the same sense of noblesse oblige that the AI developers in Silicon Valley profess to be motivated by, or they will be forced to do it by people demanding change.
The realist take
Another, and in my mind, more plausible, the view is less optimistic. Institutions that increased the well-being of ordinary people were not given on a silver platter; they had to be fought for. They result from a long struggle, in many cases spearheaded by organised labour.
Indeed, democracy itself results from the struggle for improved conditions for ordinary people. The fight for political rights went hand in hand with improved working conditions and other social rights.
This struggle depended on several factors: One factor was working people’s ability to coordinate and organise, and crucially their power to stop production through coordinated strikes. Another closely related factor was the political elites’ fear of revolution, strengthened by the 1917 revolution in Russia. A third was policies that supported full employment, increasing workers’ bargaining power.
The transition paradox
Labor-Strikes-Minneapolis, circa 1934. In public domain
If we accept the view that new institutions must be fought for through organised struggle, we face a transition paradox. When workers are increasingly replaced by AI, their power to push for necessary changes in the existing institutions for the benefit of ordinary people weakens.
When more people are unemployed, there will be more demand for the jobs that need to be met by humans, driving down wages and weakening organised labour. The immediate effect of fewer workers and lower pay is a reduction in government revenue.
Governments are run on tax on labour income and consumption. As suggested by Altman, this can be mitigated by taxing property and capital. But without political pressure, a reduction in the tax base is more likely to lead to cuts in government expenditure, the very thing that is necessary to fund expensive basic income schemes.
It is notable that even in the heyday of social democracy and organised labour, governments did little to tax capital and land. To believe that this will change in an age of weakened labour seems naïve at best.
Furthermore, it is not like governments have much success in taxing the very companies spearheading the AI revolution. If governments cannot tax them in their current state, we have no reason to believe they will be able to tax them when they become bigger and more powerful, and the wealth of nations is entirely dependent on their success.
Democracy’s demise
But will not democracy solve the problem, as the Pinker story suggests? If a sufficiently large share of people is unemployed, they could, through voting, force politicians to implement a basic income.
This assumes, however, that unemployed people will coordinate their interests and demand the necessary changes. An alternative view is that people will lose faith in the system or try to find convenient scapegoats in immigrants or foreign powers.
Even more bleakly, the day ordinary people have no other power than their votes, we have no guarantees that democracy survives. As long as wealth is built by ordinary people and they are necessary to protect the country against foreign invasion, ordinary people have real power. Historically, ordinary people’s ability to work and fight to provide the material basis upon which they demanded and gained, through struggle, a right to a say in the collective decisions that shape their future. However, if workers no longer are needed to sustain economic growth or protect the country against invasion, how will they keep their claim to power? If someone moves to take their rights away, how will they resist?
Empowering AI
An upshot of the transition paradox is that its solution cannot be an after-thought to the development of AI. AI needs to be developed and implemented with the transition paradox in mind. Developing AI must be geared to strengthen the forces that can push for reforms to make ordinary people better off.
This means that AI needs to be developed by and for workers to increase their productivity and control over the means of production. (See, e.g., Anton Korinek and Joseph Stiglitz and Siddarth et al.’s How AI Fails Us). We ignore the distribution of power at our peril.

To engage customers in a personal way, at a very large scale, AI or machine learning is essential. Chatbots and intelligent assistants are already leading client interactions, and AI-generated content is around the corner. AI also enables the analysis and interpretation of data at a speed and volume beyond human capabilities. Algorithms are continuing to improve as well, accelerating optimization in near real-time. As AI improves, use-cases are only going to increase.
Artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing leverages machine learning to make automated decisions. With AI, brands can boost the ROI of marketing campaigns through predictive modeling, advanced segmentation, and personalization.
In this piece, we will dive deep into the value of AI technologies in marketing. We’ll cover:

Why AI marketing matters
AI has transformed digital marketing and reduced the risk of human error while streamlining marketing campaigns. To truly connect with customers, you’ll still need the human touch — especially concerning compassion, empathy, and storytelling. However, when it comes to certain aspects of marketing, like predictive analytics and digital advertising, AI is capable of incredible things. For example, when your goal is to understand your customers’ needs and match them to appropriate products or services, this is where AI shines.
A 2020 McKinsey survey found that those working in marketing and sales had the third-highest rate of AI adoption. What’s more, the survey reported that “A small contingent of respondents coming from a variety of industries attribute 20 percent or more of their organizations’ earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to AI.”
Since then, AI use in marketing has continued to grow. As rates of use increase, if you don’t consider implementing these technologies, your brand risks being left behind. Your competitors will adopt AI strategies to improve their business outcomes, allowing them to increase sales, boost customer retention, and more effectively launch new products.

Benefits of artificial intelligence in B2B marketing
There are plenty of artificial intelligence marketing tools designed specifically for business sales, allowing B2B vendors to leverage the power of personalization, machine learning, and more. From AI-powered workflows to automated next best action features, AI is helping companies solve challenges specific to B2B.
Here are some of the benefits of artificial intelligence in B2B marketing.
Campaign ROI. With the help of AI technology, B2B marketers can better predict the performance of data and campaigns. They can then make suggestions for optimizing those campaigns to reach the maximum ROI. When leveraged effectively, marketers can use AI to transform their marketing campaigns, extracting the most valuable insights to act on them in real-time — for example, analyzing the most effective ad placements to increase engagement.
Better informed decisions. Data integration automation replaces manual processing to enable faster, real-time decision-making. The goal is to gain promptly actionable customer insights. For example, with the help of predictive analytics, you can access buying patterns that help forecast purchasing decisions. Since these buying patterns are often more complex to spot in a B2B model than in a B2C model, the help of AI can be a game-changer.
Marketing metrics. The ability to track the effectiveness of campaigns can significantly affect your marketing ROI. Artificial intelligence can help monitor the outcomes of countless customer touchpoints, thus supporting campaign optimization.
Better data management. AI marketing tools also help to significantly reduce the risk of improper data interpretation, support optimal data integration, and eliminate data silos. An AI marketing tool is software that leverages AI technology to automate decisions based on collected data.
Components of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence encompasses various features and capabilities that can scale your marketing programs. Here are some of the main components.
Machine learning. Unlike task automation, which is fairly limited, machine learning relies on algorithms trained to use large quantities of data to make complex predictions and decisions. Machine learning models can decipher text, recognize images, perform audience segmentation, and even anticipate how customers are likely to respond to various initiatives. More importantly, as the name implies, it can correct and improve itself without supervision (although some human supervision is often involved).
AI-powered platforms. Many marketing platforms today have AI “baked in,” using it to analyze and drive insights across large pools of data. Most of the large marketing suites have AI components providing cross-platform support for the solutions the suites offer. Examples are Salesforce’s Einstein and Adobe’s Sensei.
Platforms to perform specific kinds of work are also available, for example, AI-powered content creation platforms. Some solutions offer draft content for emails or specific social media platforms, such as Twitter. Other solutions optimize content for SEO.
Big data and analytics. Collecting data is one thing — effectively analyzing it is another. AI presents one solution to the challenge of analyzing and interpreting data at a scale beyond the reach of human beings. Using AI in B2B marketing can efficiently analyze immense amounts of data, link that data, recognize patterns, and drive predictions. The more data AI is given, the better it can learn and improve., but there is still a lack of emotional intelligence. For this reason, as well as the need for human supervision (e.g., data stewardship, the maintenance of data catalogs, etc.), people continue to play a vital role in data management and analytics.
Examples of artificial intelligence in marketing
Many companies across all industries are implementing unique AI marketing strategies. Here are some common examples.
AI chatbots. STCHealth uses intelligent chatbots to answer vaccine-related questions and help people access their immunization records. Botco.ai, an automated, AI-powered conversational marketing platform, made the seemingly impossible possible. Thanks to this automated platform, the company saved approximately 52,000 human hours across two million chatbot interactions.
Visual intelligence. The eBike manufacturer Serial 1 used Vizit, a visual intelligence platform that uses machine learning and AI to help the company determine what images resonate most with consumers. As a result, Serial 1 was about to optimize digital assets and boost website conversions by 98%. This use case is a prime example of how AI marketing leads to better decision-making.
AI platforms for SMBs. Mailchimp uses a tool called Smart Platform, bringing AI to the SMB market. Some of the latest tools allow SMBs to automate content creation, gain access to dynamic recommendations and leverage a new customer journey builder.
Frequently asked questions about AI marketing
While AI technologies have been around for decades, many brands still wonder how to apply them to their marketing processes. Here are some of the most common questions people ask.
How does AI differ from automation? AI is software that is designed to mimic human thought processes and solve problems. Automation, on the other hand, refers to technologies that follow programmed rules to accomplish tasks at scale with little to no human intervention.Brands use both of these tools to improve their marketing processes. AI, with its machine learning capabilities, can help marketers optimize demand generation and increase personalization by analyzing customer behaviors. Automation is designed to help these teams accomplish more repetitive tasks at scale.  Do marketers need AI? In our digital world, marketers need better ways to understand audiences across different devices and channels. And while brands can still engage with their customers without AI, it’s going to become increasingly harder to scale these efforts as technologies evolve. AI is essential if brands are to engage with prospects and customers as individuals, but do so at scale.  What are some AI marketing challenges? As mentioned, not every member of the marketing team needs to have an extensive understanding of AI to enjoy its benefits. However, if brands don’t have at least one person working with them who has this experience, it can prove difficult to incorporate it into your systems. Brands also may not have the tools to handle the data and resource requirements of AI technologies. That’s why so many marketers are turning to marketing work management platforms and other helpful technologies to more effectively manage these demands.

How artificial intelligence is changing the marketing landscape
Companies can accomplish much by implementing artificial intelligence in marketing campaigns, strategies, and tools.
Whether your goal is to study consumer behavior on your website or develop tailored advertising campaigns, AI can play a pivotal role. Many digital marketing strategies can benefit significantly from these technologies, ranging from social media to SEO.
Some of the ways that AI continues to change the marketing landscape include:

Customer acquisition and the need for personalized marketing: The digital world is fueled by data now more than ever, especially as the number of people online continues to abound with growth.
Customer service through chatbots: Customers want their needs to be taken care of immediately, and the use of AI to power chatbots has enabled some businesses to handle customer inquiries more effectively while reducing the role of human agents.
Advertising campaigns: Campaigns can now be more precisely optimized and targeted.

As AI continues to evolve, there are disruptions in day-to-day marketing operations. However, it’s likely that AI technology will continue to enable sophisticated marketing strategies for years to come.

The FIA’s plans to incorporate artificial intelligence into spectator safety have been put on hold due to the challenge involved with developing suitable technology.
Plans unveiled under Jean Todt’s leadership of international motorsport’s governing body to have the system in place for the start of this season have proved unrealistic. FIA rally director Andrew Wheatley admitted the project was ongoing, but confessed no new launch date had been agreed.
“The artificial intelligence camera project is still in development,” he said. “There was a 12-month development process where the intention was for it to be fitted in the car and we would be monitoring the information.













“That is not happening and we are behind schedule with that. The technology involved in getting the camera small enough that it doesn’t fill the screen is a challenge. So we’re still using the same system which is Nico [Klinger, FIA deputy safety delegate] following the in-car cameras.”
Asked when the system could be in place, Wheatley added: “We are working towards that. I think it’s a significant challenge, let’s put it that way. The prototype was good but the problem is identifying what is a human and identifying what is, for example, a post.”
While the FIA waits to implement the AI initiative – an initiative which will have cameras in every car specifically designed to use artificial intelligence to monitor the movement of fans between cars in the stages – Wheatley was quick to praise the work of Klinger.













Klinger uses onboard camera technology to do the same job, checking on spectators moving towards the road between the stages.
Wheatley shared a powerful but very real example of how important the new safety system will be.
“In Catalunya, on the powerstage last year, Gus Greensmith went through the stage and Nico noticed something underneath the Armco [barrier],” he said. “It was, basically, the back of a mobile phone.
“Using the system they’ve got, they can reverse back frame-by-frame-by-frame and he identified it was someone holding a mobile phone underneath the Armco at road level, they were lying at road level.













“Between Gus and the next car going through, which was Thierry Neuville in nine minutes, they were able to contact the marshal on the location, he was able to go to the corner, find the guy, move him, get him back up to the safe location.
“Then [Marco] Bulacia came through, locked up on the corner and went into the barrier and damaged the barrier at exactly, exactly the location the guy was lying on the floor.
“The concept is really good, the problem is there’s so much pressure on Nico sitting in front of a screen watching. We can’t have 10 Nicos sitting in line watching the image, we need to try to work with technology to understand how we can make that easier.”

Children born today should expect to live through their 100s, and that has all sorts of implications for education, work, financial, lifestyle, family, and the workforce has not quite adapted to all these new changes.” – Susan Wilner Golden (Video: Washington Post Live)“I look to Denmark as one of the great models. They have an initiative that is multi-year, all facets of longevity including helping people work longer, national digital liberty campaigns. They’re really a model, and some other countries have implemented their model.” – Susan Wilner Golden (Video: Washington Post Live)“I see a role for everyone to help in this. Certainly educational institutions, not for profit organizations, government as well, and private companies. We all have a role in determining our future. We are all responsible for what we can do as organizations.” – Katia Walsh (Video: Washington Post Live)“It is absolutely imperative that we have diversity in the field of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the result of humans, its humans that create the code, it’s humans that use the data, and humans are limited, humans have bias. And therefore, we do everything we can to minimize the bias… We do so in three ways: one is diversity of people… we also use a diversity of data sets… and then the third way is… the diversity of tools… which is one reason we always want to include open source tools.” – Katia Walsh (Video: Washington Post Live)Susan Wilner GoldenLecturer, Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Director of dciX at the Stanford Distinguished Careers InstituteKatia WalshSenior Vice President & Chief Strategy and Artificial Intelligence Officer, Levi Strauss & CoContent from AARPThe following content is produced and paid for by a Washington Post Live event sponsor.

In the auto industry, for example, they’ve long been the most precise and reliable welders and painters. Sitting in place and doing the same job, over and over, has historically been automation’s sweet spot.But, with the explosion in artificial intelligence, robots are coming to understand more complex, nuanced tasks. And they are increasingly able to navigate, both inside and outside. In agriculture, robots are not only plowing fields, but can now recognize weeds and zap them with lasers. In hospitals, robots are doing everything from fetching supplies for nurses to helping surgeons direct their instruments more precisely.A 2020 World Economic Forum report predicted that robotics and automation would displace 85 million jobs globally in the coming five years. Yet, it also predicted that the technologies would create 97 million new jobs—generally ones requiring more skills and education.Sure enough, that’s creating a lot of very-human anxiety. A 2021 Morning Consult poll found that 48% of Americans fear that automation will reduce the number of jobs. That fear was higher among adults earning less than $50,000 annually and those without a college degree.“The people who have skills, who have training, they can get a job,” says Lionel P. Robert Jr., a professor at the University of Michigan Robotics Institute. “The people at the low end—when those jobs go away, they just have less options to find another job.”As everyone knows, the supply chain is under tremendous pressure with a boom in consumer spending. E-commerce exploded as the pandemic lockdowns set in, and it continues to grow rapidly (up 14.2% from 2020 to 2021). Demand is accelerating the deployment of already advanced robots, and nowhere are the prospects for automation stronger than in two particular sectors: warehousing and trucking.The automatic warehouse“Moving pallets around, moving forklifts around, moving boxes around in fulfillment centers—that’s an area where we’ve seen just massive robotic explosion,” says Matthew Johnson-Roberson, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Amazon operates its own in-house robotics company to push the tech forward. And a growing cadre of startups, such as Berkshire Grey, Covariant, Dexterity, and Plus One Robotics, are offering automation services to the rest of the industry.Take, for instance, the “put wall”—an array of cubbies that workers sprint to fill up with customer orders. Berkshire Grey now offers a robotic put wall that automatically fills the cubbies and transfers the completed orders for shipping. It can handle the same amount of orders with just one-third as many employees, the company claims.And as robot AI gets better at recognizing and handling a greater variety of packages, the role for humans will continue to shrink. “We have a robotic field where we have hundreds of bots that actually work together. There’s no humans at all,” says Sri Solur, chief product officer at Berkshire Grey, which counts Walmart, Target, and FedEx among its clients. People only enter the picture when the system gets stuck, such as a jammed conveyor belt.But for now, as the warehouse business keeps growing, the amount of work far outstrips what the machines can handle. Despite automation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects warehouse employment to grow by 7% from 2020 to 2030. And warehouses are raising pay and adding perks to attract and retain workers for these exhausting jobs.advertisementRobo truckersGoods have a long way to travel to and from warehouses, and the work of truckers is grueling. One of the job’s downsides is the monotony of highway driving—but such dull duties are, again, the sweet spot for automation. Several well-funded companies, including Aurora, Plus, TuSimple, and Google sister company Waymo, are testing automated driving systems.Some companies have proposed first automating the highway part—which comprises over 90% of long-haul trucking—and using human drivers to handle the trickier navigation around cities. But Aurora, which collaborates with FedEx, Uber Freight, and Werner, says that it will be able to automate the entire trip by the end of 2023. “We think you have to actually do driving that is useful,” says Aurora CEO Chris Urmson (who previously led Google’s self-driving car project). “And that means it has to start somewhere and end somewhere.”Rachel Binder, a senior intelligence analyst at CB Insights, says that the highway part of trucking could soon be automated, but she expects full autonomy to take another 5 to 10 years. And it takes a long time for technology to go from possible to ubiquitous. “The investment necessary to create a fleet of robots that would meaningfully change the dynamics in the labor market is significant,” says Johnson-Roberson about automated trucking.If automation fully takes over the trucking industry, it could ultimately replace up to 400,000 jobs, according to a 2020 Cornell University study. But will people miss those jobs? Even today, it’s hard to find people to take them. In 2021, the U.S. had about 80,000 unfilled driving positions, estimates the American Trucking Associations.Jobs are going away—somedayToday, economic, demographic, and cultural forces are uniting to push demand for labor-saving robotics at the same time that burgeoning AI technology is making radically smarter machines possible. Robots always start with the most mundane tasks. But as technology evolves, even roles that require a fair amount of human dexterity and judgement are falling under that definition.None of this is happening in the next year or two, though. The 5, 10, or more years it takes for robots to catch up in both capability and numbers offer time for the current and next generation of workers to learn more advanced skills beyond what machines can do. And those skills could earn them more money, in more interesting jobs. Rather than people losing their employment to machines, the machines may simply fill in for occupations that people no longer want to do anyway.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

A new panel of experts has been assigned to advise President Joe Biden on artificial intelligence. Among them is Carnegie Mellon University Dean Ramayya Krishnan.The National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee is composed of 27 experts in academia, labor, industry and civil society. They will counsel the president on topics including the current state of the country's AI competitiveness, the state of science around AI, and AI workforce issues.Ramayya Krishnan is the dean of CMU's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. He also serves as faculty director of the Block Center for Technology and Society, which earlier this month launched a responsible AI initiative. CMU has been a leader in AI research and development since the technology was first invented.

“I’m excited, and I’m proud to represent the region and CMU in this effort,” Krishnan said. “And contribute my expertise to what I think is a really important public policy issue.”The committee members were nominated by the public as expert leaders across a wide range of AI-relevant disciplines. Other advisors include leaders from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce, the AFL-CIO, IBM Corporation and the Markle Foundation. Committee members will serve three-year terms but could serve an additional term at the discretion of the secretary of commerce.The committee is a requirement of the National AI Initiative Act of 2020. Members will help the U.S. stay competitive in new AI development, research and uses according to Don Graves, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce.“Artificial intelligence presents a new frontier for enhancing our economic and national security, as well as our way of life. Moreover, responsible AI development is instrumental to our strategic competition with China,” said Graves. “At the same time, we must remain steadfast in mitigating the risks associated with this emerging technology, and others, while ensuring that all Americans can benefit.”Among the key priorities of the committee will be thinking about new innovations that keep the U.S. at the forefront of developing AI technology and implementing it in new ways.Krishnan argues transparency and responsible use of the technology will be important to get more sectors of the economy up to speed on the advantages of using AI in the workforce. “That’s going to be a key driver of how AI is actually going to be a huge competitive advantage for us as a nation,” he said.The group will think of ways to provide new employment opportunities in artificial intelligence as well as how to better educate the public about the benefits of the technology.

“There’s this huge opportunity for us,” Krishnan said. “To allow for people to acquire the skills that would allow for pathways to economic prosperity.”A smaller subcommittee will soon be appointed to consider matters related to AI in law enforcement, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The smaller group will advise the president on topics such as bias, data security, legal standards and how to adopt AI for security or law enforcement. The group will focus on ensuring “that AI use is consistent with privacy rights, civil rights and civil liberties, and disability rights.”""AI is already transforming the world as we know it,"" said Alondra Nelson, the head of the Office of Science and Technology and deputy assistant to the president at CMU. ""The expertise of the NAIAC will be critical in helping to ensure the United States leads the world in the ethical development and adoption of AI, provides inclusive employment and education opportunities for the American public, and protects civil rights and civil liberties in our digital age.""

Too many technologist, in every generation of technology, state that management need to think more like programmers. That’s not the case. Rather, the technology professionals need to learn to speak to management. “The Business Case for AI,” by Kavita Ganesan, PhD, is a good overview for managers wishing to understand and control the complexities of implementing artificial intelligence (AI) systems in businesses.


I’m always skeptical of self-published books. Usually that means the books just aren’t that good. However, sometimes, especially in non-fiction, it means that publishers are clueless about the subject and hesitant to work with people who aren’t “names.” This book is an example of the second option, and it will give management an introduction to the concepts surrounding AI and how to address implementation in a way that will increase the odds of success for AI initiatives.

The indication that the author mostly lives in the real world comes quickly. The first chapter is a good, introduction to what matters for business about AI. Forget the technical focus, it’s about solving problems in an efficient and cost-effective way.

PROMOTED
Chapter 2, “What is AI?” isn’t bad either, though I disagree with the idea that machine learning (ML) is part of AI. Business Intelligence (BI) has advanced, along with computing performance, that standard analytics provide insight that can be termed ML, so ML and AI overlap. That, however, is a religious argument and what Ganeson has to say about AI is at a good level for management understanding.

The weakest chapter in the introduction is the fourth, where the science fiction addict in me had to sigh at “Movies such as ‘I Robot’”. Ummm, check your library.
That chapter’s list of myths is also a bit problematic. The first, about job loss, is the one area where it shows the part of the real world in which the author exists isn’t one most people are in. The AI revolution is very different than the industrial revolution and earlier technology revolutions. She talks about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and says that since it’s still far away that means a lot of jobs won’t be lost. We don’t need AGI to replace jobs.

The next couple of chapters are good for setting up examples of business processes that could be impacted by AI. I do have an issue with which companies she decides to name and which remain anonymous, as that seems to imply protecting customers. The best part was a good discussion of IT & manufacturing operations, but that could have been improved by discussing infrastructure operations such as pipelines and the electrical grid.

Part 3 (chapters 7-9) is very good but, again, has a few things to keep in mind. On page 117, six phases of the development lifecycle are defined. I agree with them, but want to point out that data acquisition and model development, phases 2 & 3, can be done somewhat in parallel. The things you learn from each can impact the other. The other nit is that the author seems to use warehouse improperly. Data warehouses have a specific, more narrow purpose. When she uses the term, think data lake. The importance of logging, transactions and more, is often ignored, and the end of this section of the book has a good explanation of its importance.

The fourth part of the book is a set of chapters that drills down into the “finding AI projects” portion of the analysis process, and is well laid out.
The final section has two chapters. The first is about “build v buy.” It is no surprise that a consultant leans towards build, that’s her livelihood. What managers need to understand is that businesses aren’t as unique as they wish to think. There are unique things, but the vast majority of business is like other businesses. AI is a new technology and there aren’t enough easy to use tools for a buy decision in many areas, but that will change over time. Managers need have a flexible understanding of the equation and balance that in the real-world.
The final chapter is, as expected, a good summation and a return to focusing on business results. It continues the author’s use of good, simple, graphics to show the points of her arguments. Regardless of the issues I’ve mentioned above, the book does a great job of laying out the challenges of artificial intelligence from a business perspective. The book doesn’t delve deeply into algorithms or other details that don’t matter to management, while it does provide a framework to look at AI projects through a business lens that integrates the technology into organizations in a way that doesn’t leave everything to technologist. “The Business Case for AI” is a good introduction for IT and line managers to think about how to integrate artificial intelligence into their organizations.

Global survey shows researchers in increasing numbers are looking to AI to support and speed up their work

COVID-19 changed the way we all work, live and socialise – with technology and communication tools more important than ever. The world of scientific research was no exception, with the use of technology and specifically artificial intelligence (AI) increasing. AI is now increasingly relied upon to speed up research and generate new insights across all of science. 
The positive endorsement of AI was noted in the second iteration of Elsevier’s global research project – Research Futures – which aims to gather the views and opinions of researchers across the world to help us as science publishers better understand the challenges and opportunities they face.
Forty seven percent of researchers believe that a long-lasting impact of the pandemic will be a greater dependency on technology and AI in their work, underlining the importance of AI for the future of research.
The study shows the number of researchers using AI “extensively” has increased from 12% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. In materials science, which covers the structure and properties of materials, the discovery of new materials and how they are made, 18% of researchers are now likely to be extensive AI users, up from zero a year ago.

Daikin latest to adopt AI service tool
29th April 2022






USA: Daikin Comfort Technologies North America is the latest air conditioning manufacturer to adopt the cloud-based mobile communications tool developed by US company XOi Technologies. 

The technology has also been adopted by Carrier for both its Carrier and Bryant service technicians in the USA and by the UK subsidiary of Aermec, the Italian chiller and fan coli manufacturer.
Using the technology with the Daikin, Goodman and Amana air conditioning brands will enable contractors to automate the entire workflow, boosting quality repairs and replacements. It seamlessly connects field service techs, home offices and their customers, while enabling on-the-job photo and video documentation, real-time remote video support and training, plus access to a vast knowledge base of product documentation and training content.
This is accomplished through a cloud-based app that’s customisable for specific dealer needs. For their customers, it allows the repair process to be immediately shareable, transparent and validating.

According to XOi Technologies, contractors using this service solution found they could grow revenues by up to 18%, cut callbacks by up to 40% and reduce re-servicing by up to 80%.
“XOi simplifies technicians’ work while validating consistent quality and, ultimately, transforming the customer experience,” said Stuart Werner, Daikin’s vice president – technical services.
“With XOi’s software solution, HVAC technicians can better document, communicate and verify the services they provide. It equips field professionals with capabilities to perform full-service diagnostics at any job site by applying data science across live video, workflow automation and artificial intelligence.”
At its core, XOi software standardises workflows and documents job sites by collecting, indexing and analysing data to improve both current and future service calls. But, Werner says, it also allows Daikin technicians to build a deep and easily accessible institutional knowledge base that supports real-time decision-making and data-based continuity.
“What elevates XOi’s technology from the rest of the field service management sector,” explains Werner, “is its historical job data functionality that seamlessly ties together customers, contractors, distributor and OEMS, laying the foundation for future value. If we can reduce the challenges HVAC techs face – documenting the entire process for both customers and our industry’s knowledge base – we can tackle one of HVAC’s biggest challenges head on.”

XOi’s cloud-based suite uses augmented reality and artificial intelligence to apply, aggregate and analyse critical job data from the moment a field tech steps onto a job site. The entire workflow is streamlined and automated, with a simple capture and share function that allows photo/video documentation, while pinpointing manuals, parts and training specific to the equipment. The workflow is readily shareable to the home office, distributors and OEMs. Customers can also get a record of service call highlights, making it easier to understand repair or replacement costs.
With XOi’s coaching screen, field techs and others can collaborate with live, interactive video that’s recorded and indexed, a feature built to help less experienced technicians or those facing repair challenges. Technicians can access more than 120,000 pieces of content – a centralised training repository with easy access to historical job content.
“Most field service management software solutions are effective for high-level operations, but we designed XOi to fully capture the granular detail that is crucial not only for real-time decisions but for long-term accuracy and efficiency,” said XOi founder and CEO Aaron Salow.

Despite continued increases in R&D spending, the five-year average number of new medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sits stubbornly at around 50 drugs per year1. As the cost of bringing a new drug to market increases, with estimates suggesting it has nearly doubled in the past decade2, it has become vital to improve R&D productivity to ensure the future viability of the pharmaceutical industry and advances in healthcare.Many drug candidates fail before they enter clinical trials. Preclinical studies are designed to identify and validate a lead candidate. It is at this crucial stage of the process that 50% of spending is wasted, amounting to $28.2 billion in the United States alone each year3.There are three main reasons for this:• Redundancy. Scientists often have no or poor visibility of experiments other scientists have performed in the past, even within their own organizations.• Experimental failure. Many experiments fail to produce usable data because of faulty reagents and protocols.• Irreproducibility. Even when an experiment seemingly succeeds, it often cannot be reproduced, perhaps because of problems with reagents, documentation and data gathering.As a PhD researcher, Tom Leung, BenchSci’s CSO experienced first-hand the waste of resources in preclinical studies. When working as a cancer researcher, he lost rare patient samples because of an inappropriate antibody. Problems with antibody selectivity and specificity are widely acknowledged as one of the main causes of incorrect, inconsistent and irreproducible results in life sciences.Keen to tackle the problem, Leung teamed up with David Q. Chen, Elvis Wianda and Liran Belenzon at the University of Toronto, Canada, to apply AI to antibody selection. In 2015, they founded BenchSci and started building AI-powered applications that analyse the full text of scholarly articles to extract relevant information for choosing the most suitable reagent for a particular experiment.In 2017, BenchSci launched its first application: AI-Assisted Antibody Selection. “Scientists used to have to spend hours or even days reviewing publications to find the antibody that would be most likely to work in their experiments. With BenchSci they can get antibody validation information within minutes,” said Leung.Since then, BenchSci’s platform has expanded to encompass more types of reagents as well as model systems, including recombinant proteins, RNAi, cell lines, CRISPR, animal models and PCR. Today, more than 49,000 scientists in 16 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies and 4,500 academic institutions use BenchSci’s AI-Assisted Antibody Selection or Reagent Selection applications to plan more successful experiments, with proven savings of millions of dollars per year.




How the BenchSci system works. Accelerating R&D, the system above enables faster reagent selection, more reproducible experiments and increased research capacity.


Running fewer but better experimentsBy helping researchers select the most-appropriate reagents in seconds, BenchSci aims to halve the time it takes for new drugs to reach the market by 2025.“Roughly 80% of experiments in the preclinical phase of the drug development process are unnecessary to progress a novel medicine to clinical trials,” said Leung “Performing only the 20% that are necessary would mean carrying out an average of 1,400 versus 7,000 experiments—so new drugs would get to patients much faster and be much cheaper.”BenchSci’s approach involves:• The collection of terabytes of data from sources including scientific publications, reagent catalogs, and customer databases. These include closed-access publications, thanks to partnerships with publishers.• The use of more than 100 proprietary machine-learning models that decode millions of unstructured scientific documents and extract insights from images, as well as text.• A user-friendly interface that organizes the resulting information using a proprietary ontology. This allows researchers to understand the biomedical significance of the extracted data and establish relationships between biological entities. Users can easily search by target and reagent- or model system-type to obtain experiment-specific reagents and compare their specifications in minutes.Meeting customer needsBuilding on the success of current applications, BenchSci is evolving its technology to provide even more comprehensive solutions to help leading pharmaceutical companies solve their biggest R&D challenges.

As stated in our ""Thought Leadership"" document
published in 2021, AI-created works of art and the notion of
ownership and enforcement within copyright law are controversial
issues worldwide.
Although there has been no new court decision or legislative
regulation that could answer these questions in our country or
around the world during the past year, the decision of The Review
Board of the United States Copyright Office (""Board"")
dated February 14, 20221, which includes evaluations on
whether artificial intelligence can be the owner of the work,
contains substantial determinations in this regard.
In the related dispute, Stephen Thaler, who works in artificial
intelligence technologies, has applied for the copyright
registration for the work named ""a recent entrance to
paradise"", whose image is presented below and created by the
algorithm called ""creativity machine"".

In his application, Stephen Thaler stated that the related work
was created autonomously by the ""creativity machine""
algorithm, and it is a work created by the ""work made for
hire"" doctrine, and that he filed the application by being the
proprietor of the machine following the assignment declaration he
submitted. However, in its initial examination, the United States
Copyright Office (""Office"") rejected the application,
stating that the relevant application did not meet the ""human
authorship"" requirement sought for a copyright claim. On the
other hand, Thaler requested reconsideration of this decision
stating that it is unconstitutional to require a ""human
authorship"" requirement for registration and that such a
requirement is neither included in the law nor the case law.
In the subsequent examination, the Office again rejected these
requests, reiterating its initial assessments and stating that
Thaler did not provide evidence to prove that human-provided
sufficient creative contribution to the relevant work or that the
human intervention had taken place. Thus, the Office has also made
it clear that it will not abandon its long-standing interpretation
as ""a work will only meet the legal and formal requirements to
benefit from copyright protection when it is created by a
human."" which has been adopted based on the US Copyright Law,
Supreme Court and other court decisions.
Thaler filed a second request for the reconsideration, stating
that the regulations regarding copyright already allowed
non-natural persons to own works within the scope of the ""work
made for hire"" doctrine and that there is also no obstacle to
the application of the works created by computers. Therefore, he
argued that the Office's refusal grounds were based on old
views that did not address current needs.
Evaluating this second request for reconsideration, the Board
stated that the law protects the fruits of intellectual labour. The
Board did not find these reconsideration requests acceptable,
stating that the works created only by a machine or a mechanical
process without a human author's creative input or intervention
cannot benefit from protection. Referring to the previous
decisions, the Board underlined that no protection had been
provided before for works created by non-humans such as animals or
spiritual beings. Moreover, the Board stated that the ""work
made for hire"" doctrine is not relevant to this file and that
creating the work by a human is a must for this doctrine.
As a result, the relevant decision of the Board set out that, in
accordance with the current regulations and case law in the USA,
the nexus between the human mind and creative expression is seen as
the most fundamental element for copyright, and it is not possible
for works created without human creative contribution and
intervention to benefit from copyright protection under the current
legislation.
Although we see that the requirement for the owner of the work
to be a natural person continues to be sought within the scope of
the current regulations, the necessity of protecting the works
created using artificial intelligence systems and the issue of what
kind of protection this will be, continue to be discussed around
the world.
As a matter of fact, the UK Intellectual Property Office has
published a consultation and requested the opinion of the public
until the date of January 07 2022, on the issues of copyright
protection and authorship on the products created as a result of
the technological developments in terms of the relationship between
artificial intelligence and copyright law. Besides other questions,
participants were asked whether the current regulation, which
grants copyright ownership to the natural person who makes the
necessary arrangements during the creation of the relevant work,
responds to developments in artificial intelligence and carries a
sufficient incentive mechanism.
Although the results of this consultation and regulations to
come into force regarding this issue have not been shared with the
public yet, even the fact that such consultation is being conducted
indicates that the authorities are paying more attention to this
issue and actions are being taken slowly to meet the
ever-increasing need for regulation in this area.
In addition, the European Union Intellectual Property Office,
which examines the usage areas and effects of artificial
intelligence technology more closely in terms of rights arising
from copyright, and evaluates the situation with 20 different
scenarios, published the Study on the Impact of Artificial
Intelligence on the Infringement and Enforcement of Copyright and
Designs report2 in March 2022. In summary, the
report stated that artificial intelligence could be used
effectively during the exercise of these rights and to detect
violations; however, this technology has technical limitations in
itself, and even there is an increasing trend in terms of their use
in acts constituting infringement, it brings concerns in terms of
ethics, privacy and fundamental rights.
We will continue to follow the developments in this field, which
no doubt will keep being on the agenda in the following years.

Normally, epigraphers – scholars who study ancient texts written on durable materials such as stone, metal, or pottery – use their knowledge of repositories of information and digital databases to perform &quot;string matching&quot; searches to find textual and contextual parallels. However, differences in the digital-search query that can exclude or conceal relevant results and that the texts often are discovered not in their original context can complicate the work. Starting from Adam and Eve to the Greek gods there is so much to discover and researchers are using advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to get more accurate results. Most scientific research to date has focused on whether Adam and Eve could have passed on genetic material to everyone living; however, this doesn't seem to be the type of ancestry the Bible is concerned with. While all genetic ancestors are genealogical ancestors, the inverse is not necessarily true..So, what does this mean for Adam and Eve? Well, in 2004, a computer simulation of life on Earth was created to test and see when the most recent common ancestor for all humans was. The researchers put higher barriers than historically existed to stack the odds against there being a common ancestor in the recent past. Despite this, the results, published in Nature, found common ancestors only two or three thousand years ago. Apart from Adam and Eve, the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is speeding up such research and drawing attention to overlooked information. But this approach, known as &quot;digital humanities&quot;, is in a battle for funding against more future-focused applications of AI..Restoring or recreating archaeological artifacts is a complicated problem for computer vision models. Previous work — algorithms learning to reassemble photos or documents, for example — has not accounted for the degradation of fragments, unclear images, or imprecise piece-fitting..Researchers use AI to restore ancient Greek texts.Ancient texts written on stone tablets, such as those found in Greece, provide invaluable insight into the history of past civilizations. However, being as much as 2,600 years old, these priceless inscriptions haven't been immune to the ravages of time. They're often damaged and littered with chips and cracks, sometimes even missing entire fragments of text. To fill these gaps and reconstruct the missing sections, historians typically rely on a discipline called epigraphy, which uses &quot;grammatical and linguistic considerations, layout and shape, textual parallels, and historical context&quot; to estimate what the text originally contained. As this is a very complex and time-consuming process, the team behind Google's DeepMind AI joined forces with the University of Oxford to develop Pythia, the first ancient text restoration model that uses deep neural networks to recover missing characters from damaged text..How AI is helping us bring history back to life.Artificial intelligence technology has had a profound impact on a wide variety of industries in recent years, transforming almost every aspect of our lives in the process. While most of the talk surrounding AI has focused on how it will affect the human workforce, it can't be denied that it's found some very promising applications in certain areas. One of these areas is archaeology, where AI's ability to analyze large amounts of data in a short amount of time and uncover hidden patterns is very useful. Whether it's used to restore ancient Greek texts, translate long-lost languages, reassemble damaged archaeological artifacts, or uncover hidden designs in the Nazca Lines, AI is becoming an increasingly important tool in archaeologists' arsenal, helping them bring history back to life..In conclusion, looking at the continued developments there is no lie that in no time artificial intelligence will be able to tell how Adam and Eve used to live in the past.

AI is turning out to be one of the trendiest topics in the business and digital world. Top leading tech companies and industries show interest in AI app development Canada. The speed with which the craze and development of artificial intelligence are rising is admirable as AI is everywhere nowadays. But how does AI help in mobile app development Toronto?
Beginning from the live chat box to prediction analytics, AI approaches state-of-the-art ideas to provide better client services and re-evaluate business procedures with current modern technology. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the new-age technologies that cause unexpected changes in the manner a business works.
The thought of AI portrays that a computer will carry out a task that generally needs a human to finish. Amazingly, AI is about speech recognition as well as interpretation, portraying that a program could work as a human in activities and thoughts. The implementation of artificial intelligence in mobile app development Toronto can be classified into weak and strong levels.
Though AI accounts for fewer errors in the complete procedure, carries out deadly tasks easily, and distinguishes real-time location smoothly; AI decreases the amount of creativity and innovative ideas of a process, that a human could think of. So, AI has its advantages and disadvantage. But we cannot deny the fact that it is the future of mobile app development Canada and the tech industry.
Types of AI
AI is a very provocative topic, on which we have seen a lot of intense discussions. But generally speaking, Artificial intelligence can be categorized into 4 types. They are –
1. Reactive machines:
This is the first type of AI that reacts to the present scenario by analysing all the feasible moves and then selects the finest one. A well-known sample of a reactive machine is the IBM chess program, Deep Blue which defeated chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This program analyses its own as well as opponent moves and selects the most tactical one. But, it can’t store previous experiences. One more example of such reactive AI is Google’s AlphaGO.
2. Theory of mind
In this type of AI, psychology term is considered that means understanding others’ desires, beliefs, and intentions that influence one’s decision. An example of this kind of AI doesn’t present as of yet. Such kind of artificial intelligence would understand you and afterwards make a decision.
3. Limited memory 
These systems of artificial intelligence do all the discussed things that reactive machine performs, but it additionally stores memory. Such Ai’s are utilized in self-driving cars which utilize past observation to form a prediction such as changing car lanes etc. But the memories are not permanently stored. They are stored for a limited time.
4. Self-awareness 
This is the kind of artificial intelligence which you perceive in movies which have self-awareness, self-consciousness, have a sensitive feeling toward others. Right now, we are very far from making such kind of AI.
Importance of Artificial Intelligence in Real Life
Artificial intelligence plays a very significant role in mankind. It is the expertise that can bring more output in less input. Primarily, AI will carry out tedious tasks, but it will also improve efficiency. Farmers can utilize robots to plant as well as cultivate seeds and afterwards use drones to look after their field. It will exponentially raise the output. In the same way, advancements are also in development in other fields like healthcare and education. But it will moreover create so many high-skilled jobs and get things much more inexpensive for the people.
Artificial intelligence will affect and transform every industry on Earth, such as manufacturing, health care, agriculture, and many more.
What are the examples of AI?
Machine learning
In this technology, machines act with no need for programming. They perform by the study of earlier experiences and then forecasting moves.
A realistic example of this kind of AI can be a robot which analyses the stock market by looking at earlier recorded trades and afterwards forecast new ones that get success in the upcoming days.
Automation
Mobile Application development is a lengthy process; programmers have to employ hundreds of hours coding a similar thing. Artificial intelligence will ease this burden by creating infrastructure for programmers to work on. A company launched the latest AI test bot which will test different mobile applications. In simple terms, it will assist developers to test smartphone applications more efficiently and make the most of quality assurance by doing less.
Machine vision
Artificial intelligence is utilized to provide a machine with the competence to capture as well as analyse visual information. Thus, an AI can witness and listen to things simply like a human. Afterwards, analyse and react as per the information. The humanoid Sophia is powered by artificial intelligence that can see as well as listen to things and facial recognition feature is included with the machine vision to better recognize the world.
Voice recognition
At present, we have a lot of mobile applications that use artificial intelligence to understand your voice. You can also unlock or give commands through this feature. Apple has become the pioneer in this field because it has combined Siri with Apple mobile gadgets for a long time. She can identify your voice and customize the phone for the best user experience.
Chatbots
Chatbots are AI-powered robots that can have an interaction with users just like humans. They learn through previous practices. The basic thought behind this product is that if individuals don’t desire to interact with somebody other than humans, they can employ these chatbots. Several popular AI-powered chatbots are Bold360 and LivePerson.
These were only a few popular applications of artificial intelligence that are being utilized in the present market.
How Can You Improve User Experience and Mobile application Development? 
AI assist to make a better decision
Artificial intelligence can analyse large bits of data which humans cannot. Imagine there is a big sum of data on the response of consumers to the application. You can create a program to get all those responses and feedback. But artificial intelligence can change the game by reading them in a humane way & grant developers a superior-conclusion. Later, this can be utilized to make an up-to-date decision.
User engagement
Most smartphone applications fail because of their lack of user engagement. Artificial intelligence is presently being utilized to analyse user behaviour to grant insight into the consumer. AI can tell smartphone applications what users are in search of and how they are utilizing their applications. Professional developers can employ this information to do changes for improved user engagement.
Personalization with artificial intelligence 
The smartphone is already marketized as custom-made for every user. But most applications are just the same for everybody. There is not much customization on an individual level. Recently, Flutter mobile applications have improved user experience with their personalized apps as per the user. AI primarily records user behaviour and afterwards changes their application or suggests changes as per the user practice for a better experience.
The smartphone can better connect with users 
As artificial intelligence can analyse large amounts of data, smartphone applications can connect to consumers on a deeper level. Apps can store the behaviour of users and give them more control over themselves. Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are good examples that are doing the same. 
Context-driven UX
A smartphone can find your location; however, it doesn’t affect the user experience to a big level. But artificial intelligence-based algorithms can employ the user location along with various crucial aspects and then turn up user-centric recommendations and messages. For instance, in case you are on a road trip, your smartphone AI can suggest applications that can be beneficial to you or give a notification informing you that there is not any fuel station 100 odd km ahead.
Conclusion:
So, by now, you must be aware of how amazingly AI affect the user experience and mobile app development Canada. You also got a bit of knowledge about how it works on mobile applications. However, the incorporation of artificial intelligence with mobile applications is yet in the early stage. In future, you can witness a lot of transformation that can happen here. Your complete user experience can be improved through AI and then utilized in various mobile applications. We all need to see where artificial intelligence can take user experience and mobile app development.
Now, is a great time to involve your customers in AI-based mobile applications. iQlance is the Top mobile app development Companies Toronto. They have a team of experts that has forward-thinking abilities and provides next-level mobile applications by integrating AI capabilities with machine learning as well as deep learning techniques.

Stronger legislation than the European Commission envisages is needed to regulate AI and protect workers.
In joint, human-machine problem-solving, the worker must make the decision (PaO_STUDIO/shutterstock.com)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is of strategic importance for the European Union: the European Commission frequently affirms that ‘artificial intelligence with a purpose can make Europe a world leader’. Recently, the commissioner for the digital age, Margrethe Vestager, again insisted on AI’s ‘huge potential’ but admitted there was ‘a certain reluctance’, a hesitation on the part of the public: ‘Can we trust the authorities that put it in place?’ One had to be able to trust in technology, she said, ‘because this is the only way to open markets for AI to be used’. 
Trust is indeed central to the acceptance of AI by European citizens. The recent toeslagenaffaire (allowances affair) in the Netherlands is a reminder of the dangers. Tens of thousands of families were flagged up as potentially fraudulent claimants of childcare allowances, without any proof, and forced to pay back—driving many into poverty, some to depression and suicide. All of this was the consequence of a self-learning algorithm and AI system, designed without checks and balances and not subject to human scrutiny.
In its current form, the AI regulation proposed by the commission last April will not protect citizens from similar dangers. It will also not protect workers. In its eagerness to push AI forward and position itself in the global AI race, the commission has overlooked workers’ rights. The envisaged AI legislation is framed in terms of product safety and, as such, employment is not within its legal ambit.

The only reference to employment is found in annex III, which lists ‘high-risk’ AI systems. These take in recruitment and selection, the screening and evaluation of candidates, and the elevation or termination of work-related contractual relationships and task allocation, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of the performance and behaviour of persons in such relationships.
The regulation would not however provide any additional specific protection to workers nor ensure their existing rights were safeguarded—despite the uncertainty AI will generate in these regards. The protective capacity for workers of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), although in force for almost four years and despite its potential, is not yet used to the full.
Shortcomings to address
Along with other emerging technologies, such as quantum computing, robotics or blockchain, AI will disrupt life as we know it. The EU can become an AI global leader only if it remains faithful to its democratic and social values, which implies protecting the rights of its workers.

To do that, the shortcomings of the AI regulation and the GDPR need to be addressed. Seven aspects deserve more attention:
Implementing GDPR in the context of employment: fully implementing GDPR rights for workers is one of the most effective ways to ensure they have control over their data. AI relies on data, including workers’ personal data. Workers need to use GDPR actively, to ask how such data is used (potentially for profiling or to discriminate against them), stored or shared, in and out of the employment relationship; employers need to respect their right to do so. The commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor should issue clear recommendations insisting on the applicability of the GDPR at work. There may also be a need to determine what role labour inspectors could or should play.
Further developing the ‘right to explanation’: when decisions supported by algorithms—the processing of sensitive data, performance assessment, task allocation based on reputational data, profiling and so on—negatively affect workers or are associated with a bias (in the design or the data), the right to explanation becomes an essential defence mechanism. A specific framework based on articles 12-15, 22 and recital 71 of the GDPR must be developed and apply to all forms of employment. In practice, when a decision supported by an algorithm has been made and negatively affects a worker, such framework should enable the individual to obtain information that is simultaneously understandable, meaningful and actionable; receive an explanation as to the logic behind the decision; understand the significance and the consequences of the decision, and challenge the decision, vis-à-vis the employer or in court if necessary.
Purpose of AI algorithms: in an occupational setting, having access to the code behind an algorithm is not useful per se. What matters to workers is understanding the purpose of the AI system or the algorithm embedded in an application. This is partly covered by GDPR article 35, on the obligation to produce data-protection impact assessments. Further action is however needed to make sure workers’ representatives are involved.
Involving workers’ representatives when conducting AI risk assessments at work, pre-deployment: Given the potential risk of misuse, as well as of unintended or unanticipated harmful outcomes stemming from AI systems, employers should have the obligation under the proposed regulation to conduct technology risk assessments before their deployment. Workers’ representatives should be systematically involved and have a role in characterising the level of risk arising from the use of AI systems and in identifying proportionate mitigation measures, all along the life cycle. Risk assessments should address general issues about cybersecurity, privacy and safety, as well as specific associated threats.
Addressing intrusive surveillance: workplace monitoring is increasingly being replaced by intrusive surveillance, using data related to workers’ behaviour, biometrics and emotions. Given the risk of abuse, legal provisions are needed to ban such practices.
Boosting workers’ autonomy in human-machine interactions: this entails ensuring that workers are ‘in the loop’ of fully or semi-automated decision-making and that they make the final decision, using the input from the machine. This is particularly important when joint (human-machine) problem-solving takes place. Boosting workers’ autonomy means sustaining the accumulated tacit knowledge of the workforce and supporting the transfer of that knowledge to the machine—whether it be a co-operative robot or a piece of software. This is particularly pertinent to processes that require testing, quality control or diagnosis.
Enabling workers to become ‘AI literate’: acquiring technical skills and using them ‘at work’, although necessary, is not enough and mostly serves the interests of one’s employer. Becoming ‘AI literate’ means being able to understand critically the role of AI and its impact on one’s work and occupation, and being able to anticipate how it will transform one’s career and role. Passively using AI systems does not benefit workers themselves—a certain distance needs to be established for them to see AI’s overall influence. There is scope here for a new role for workers’ representatives to flag up digitally-related risks and interactions, to assess the uncertain impact of largely invisible technologies and to find new ways of effectively integrating tacit knowledge into workflows and processes.
Two scenarios
In the negotiations over the AI regulation, two possible scenarios have emerged. The first revolves around adding ‘protective’ amendments to the text. This may not be enough, as significant fixes are required to extend its legal purview and make substantial changes to its scope.
The second scenario involves adopting complementary rules on AI for the workplace. These would add to the GDPR and the commission’s draft directive on improving working conditions in platform work, in particular when it comes to algorithmic management.
As the Dutch toeslagenaffaire has shown, algorithms can have a direct and damaging impact on people and on workers’ lives. For trust ever to exist, the AI act must be reorientated: its current focus is on enabling business and promoting the EU as a global AI leader, when the priority should be to protect citizens and workers.

The Great Resignation may be a myth or reality, depending upon your viewpoint. But one thing is clear: The labor shortage is real.
But it is likely not due to a decline in the participation rate. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the post-pandemic labor force participation rate has not declined dramatically. In fact, the core ages of the workforce, 25-54, saw a dip at the onset of the pandemic that was mild compared to other age groups – especially workers 55+.
Rather than a Great Resignation, this would suggest a Great Reallocation of the workforce. As a global search consultant, we are seeing this precipitous shift in positions, with great demand for skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML).

With that in mind, here are seven artificial intelligence (AI)-related roles to consider prioritizing right now as the workforce reallocates talent to new jobs that drive economic value for leading companies:
1. Head of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) – Director, VP, SVP
Description: This role is responsible for improving business process automation technology based on metaphorical software robots (bots) or on artificial intelligence. They lead teams in areas of process improvement, product design, and business transformation, which may involve tasks such as implementing new data sets, R&D or Revenue dashboards, and automation of NLP processes.
Why it is important: Effective management of RPA improves speed, quality, and productivity by minimizing the need for human assistance in the automation process.

2. Head of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI/ML) – VP, SVP, EVP
Description: This leader is responsible for building innovative, world-class products and capabilities by leading a team of data and machine learning engineers in building high-quality products for both internal and external use. They lead and mentor teams implementing cutting-edge Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and analytics systems, tools, and services that operate at an unprecedented scale.
Why it is important: Every organization is challenged to remain competitive in the market, increasing revenue and reducing operating costs. AI is the single most powerful tool that organizations are using to make informed decisions, drive new lines of revenue, attract new customers, and optimize the costs of business operations. A technical leader to run this program is imperative to the success of the program.
3. Head of Customer Insights
Description: The customer insights leader strives to improve marketing by gaining a better customer understanding through both data and research. These analytics and insights apply to all marketing channels and are delivered at preferred customer touchpoints.
Why it is important: Consumer insights play a huge role in reducing inefficiency and repetitive tasks. Brand leaders can also use consumer insights to measure key performance metrics for optimizing operational excellence and product innovation. This helps reduce churn, waste, and redundancy.
4. Product Management – Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
Description: This role is responsible for defining and owning the data science product roadmap within an organization. He or she prioritizes the research and development of optimization, statistical, and machine learning models, and takes to market new product capabilities to automate customers’ business processes.
Why it is important: A deep focus on the customer experience is critical to assure that organizations find solutions to customer challenges and keep up with market trends.

5. Chief Data Officer (CDO)
Description: The chief data officer is responsible for providing world-class information management and data operations. The CDO builds enterprise intelligence and automation capabilities to ensure that pertinent data is available, reliable, consistent, accessible, secure, and timely to support the mission and activities. This includes:

Defining an ongoing data strategy in partnership with leaders from across the organization
Implementing an appropriate and well-defined data governance approach
Creating constructs to support optimal access/retrieval, security, storage/caching, movement/transformation, and classification/encryption
Management of data across multiple teams

Why it is important: Many organizations are drowning in data, and the ability to “make data speak” with the right information at the right time is critical to organizational success. The CDO is key to building foundational data and analytics competencies and ensuring that data generates these key business benefits:

Business leaders receive advanced analytics that help decision-making that drives desired business outcomes
Business leaders are empowered to explain to the board and C-level how data is applied in their organization’s use cases
Data becomes a powerful tool to guide strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat discussions

6. Data Scientist
Description: Data scientists are responsible for providing data, analysis, statistical modeling, and machine-learning capabilities to inform key business initiatives.
Why it is important: Data science can add value to any business that can use its data well. From statistics and insights across workflows and hiring new candidates to helping senior staff make better-informed decisions, data science is invaluable in today’s business environment.
7. Chief Digital Officer
Description: The chief digital officer is responsible for leading and building key technologies to drive digital transformation across the enterprise. This role serves as a strategic leader for key IT business processes, including the architecture committee, capital planning, and security processes.

Why it is important: Organizations need to drive growth and strategic renewal by transforming traditional analog business into digital. This role focuses on creating new value through the smart use of digital tools, platforms, technologies, services, and processes. In addition, as companies digitize, many have rushed to the cloud, with mixed results. Managing a cloud strategy is critical as improper management can cost enterprises millions.
While these seven AI roles are critical, finding talent to fill them is difficult.  AI, machine learning, and data analytics are new fields, and few people have relevant experience.
This leads us back to the fact: We are dealing with a Great Reallocation of the labor force to an AI/Machine learning, data-driven world.

My grandmother, Claire Hastings, was born in the 1920s on a farm in Armidale, northern New South Wales. That was a relatively common thing, with just 43% of the population living in cities, compared with more than 70% now. 
She lived in a small wooden hut, with a chicken coop out the front and fields out the back. When she and her siblings came home from school, they helped plough the fields with a horse-drawn plough until sundown. 
Little did she know this life would soon disappear. The “second industrial revolution” (of mass production and standardisation) was creating machines to replace human and horse power. A plough pulled by a tractor could do in hours what took Grandma and her siblings a week.

By the time she left school, age 17, she wasn’t needed on the farm. So she instead went to college, became a teacher, got married and raised a family. Now 93, she lives in a comfy suburban four-bedroom home, enjoys dining at restaurants, and loves going to the theatre and on ocean cruises. 
Her story is far from unique. Around the world industrialisation has reduced farm employment enormously. In the United States, for example, 40% of the
 labour force worked on farms in 1920; now it is about 2%
The loss of those jobs, and their replacement, is worth remembering as we now confront the “fourth industrial revolution”, with robots and artificial intelligence tipped to take up to 40% of the jobs now done by humans within two decades.

      Behind those headlines. Why not to rely on claims robots threaten half our jobs




The hit list is long, from drivers and call-centre workers to computer programmers and university lecturers like myself (we face being replaced by AI avatars, delivering animated content online).
But just as disappearing farm jobs didn’t lead to permanent mass unemployment, nor should we fear this next stage of technological development.
Improving quality of life
While industrial farming was not universally embraced as progress, the huge reductions in farming labour over the 20th century were key to a better life for most people (though poverty and glaring economic inequality still exist). 
To cite just one measure, when my grandmother was born the average life expectancy in Australia was 60 years. Now it’s more than 80.
The underlying forces driving such advances are twofold. 
First, the mechanisation of farming made food cheaper. US data shows the price of a common basket of groceries is now about 80% cheaper than a century ago. Similar trends exist for virtually every other consumable product. 
Second, spending less on food meant people could spend more on other things. New industries sprang up – automobiles, holidays, health care, finance, fitness and education and so on. Sectors virtually unknown in the 1920s now employ more than half of the population.





McKinsey



These new industries have both underpinned improvements in our quality of life and, crucially, created new jobs. 
As artificial intelligence and robotics develop, services such as banking, insurance and transport will become cheaper. As a consequence, we will have more money to spend on other items – on health and fitness, travel and leisure and possibilities yet to be conceived. 
Whatever these new or expanded industries are, jobs will evolve at the same time as quality of life improves for all.

Two lessons from my grandmother
None of this, of course, will necessarily make you feel better if you have (and love) a job under threat from automation. 
Some lessons from my grandma’s life may help. 
First, she didn’t take the changes personally. She understood that times were changing, and that she would have to change with them. She embraced the challenge rather than being defeated by it.

Second, she understood she had to develop new skills. At the same time as farm jobs were diminishing, she saw growing demand for more teachers, underpinned by government regulations requiring children to stay in school longer. So too today education is the key for future jobs.  
None of us know what the future holds. But for our collective future to replicate the advancements my grandmother has seen over her life, it’s inevitable that artificial intelligence and robots will take over jobs.
I asked grandma if we should be worried. “Life moves on,” she told me. 
And so must we.

Refereeing decisions at the World Cup have been debated decades later.

From whether the ball crossed the line in the final in 1966, through Diego Maradona’s “Hand of God” two decades later, to some of the decisions made by the video assistant referee at Russia 2018, any perceived mistake by the referee will be scrutinized by fans years later.


Referees need all the help they can get, and they could be about to be given a hand from artificial intelligence.

Over the past few years, FIFA has been trialing the use of limb-tracking offside technology, which uses AI along with a series of cameras around the stadium to follow players’ limbs and instantaneously creates virtual offside lines for referees. The technology has so far been used at the Club World Cup and FIFA Arab Cup, and FIFA expects it to be used at Qatar 2022.

Given all the issues with VAR, there could be some concerns about the use of AI in soccer.
But Dr. Patrick Lucey, chief scientist at sports data firm Stats Perform says that FIFA’s approach when it comes to limb-tracking is the right approach.
PROMOTED
He says that rather than a fully-automated decision, the AI is used to give precise measurements and create the offside lines that before would have to be drawn manually. This removes human error, but humans are still very much in the loop.
The referee or assistant referee can look at the image created by the AI and know straight away if a player is offside, but the human official can also use their own judgement to decide whether that player is interfering with play or if there is any other reason why the goal should be given or not.
MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor
Dr. Lucey says this approach combines “getting humans to do what they do really well and getting computers to do what they do really well”. That’s why FIFA’s referee committee chair Pierluigi Collina says this is not “robot offside”.

As the manual work is being done by a computer, and not a human, the decision won’t be as instantaneous as goal line technology but it should be a lot quicker than the current VAR, hopefully removing some of frustration caused by lengthy VAR decisions, as well as improving the referees’ overall decision making.

Dr. Lucey points out that player-tracking technology is nothing new, it’s been used in basketball for more than twenty years. But camera technology has improved with 4K and 8K cameras that have higher pixel density, and AI can now do things not possible before.
With more powerful AI and improvements in player-tracking technology, Dr. Lucey says that within the year, soccer data and metrics that used to be collected manually will be able to be captured directly from a live TV soccer broadcast without the need for other cameras in the venue.
While TV broadcasts don’t provide the quality for the live limb-tracking technology that is needed for accurate refereeing decisions, AI will soon be able to use TV broadcasts for real-time creation of statistics including expected goals and the estimated position of players not on screen. This is done using a footprint of player tracking data from the last twenty years combined with machine learning algorithms to estimate where the missing players are.
This technology can then be used on TV broadcasts of historical matches, collecting data from previous world cups, enabling statisticians to analyze England’s Golden Generation or Diego Maradona’s expected goals data.
One of those advanced stats that AI is able to create is called “ghosting”. This uses AI to work out whether players are in the position that they are expected to be in for particular situations. Clubs can use this to fix errors, like showing if a wingback is in the wrong position during a counter attack, or to find weaknesses in their opponents, by seeing what their players are likely to do in a certain situation.
As AI has made it possible to get create such statistics from a TV broadcast, this will make advanced statistics available to a much wider level of the game, so this could have even more of an impact than FIFA’s limb-tracking technology.

                  Artificial Intelligence
                













The last year was a busy one for Russia’s military and civilian artificial intelligence efforts. Moscow poured money into research and development, and Russia’s civil society debated the country’s place in the larger AI ecosystem. But Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February and the resulting sanctions have brought several of those efforts  to a halt—and thrown into question just how many of its AI advancements Russia will be able to salvage and continue. Ever since Putin extolled the development of robotic combat systems in the new State Armaments Program in 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense has been hyper-focused on AI. We have learned more about the Russian military’s focus on AI in the past year thanks to several public revelations. But talk of AI has been muted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Apart from the widespread use of UAVs for reconnaissance and target acquisition and a single display of a mine-clearing robot—all of which are remote-controlled—there is no overt evidence of Russian AI in C4ISR or decision-making among the Russian military forces, other than a single public deepfake attempt to discredit the Ukrainian government. That does not mean AI isn’t used, considering how Ukrainians are now utilizing artificial intelligence in data analysis—but there is a notable absence of larger discussion about this technology in open-source Russian media. The gap between Russian military aspirations for high-tech warfare of the future and the actual conduct of war today is becoming clear. In January 2021, Colonel-General Vladimir Zarudnitsky, the head of the Military Academy of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, wrote that the development and use of unmanned and autonomous military systems, the “robotization” of all spheres of armed conflict, and the development of AI for robotics will have the greatest medium-term effect on the Russian armed forces’ ability to meet their future challenges. Other MOD military experts also debated the impact of these emerging technologies on the Russian military and future balance of forces. Russia continued to upgrade and replace Soviet-made systems, part of the MOD’s drive from “digitization” (weapons with modern information technologies for C4ISR) to “intellectualization” (widespread implementation of AI capable of performing human-like creative thinking functions). These and other developments were covered in detail during Russia’s “Army-2021” conference, with AI as a key element in C4ISR at the tactical and strategic levels.

Meanwhile, Russian military developers and researchers worked on multiple AI-enabled robotics projects, including the “Marker” concept unmanned ground vehicle and its autonomous operation in groups and with UAVs.

Toward the end of 2021, the state agency responsible for exporting Russian military technology even announced plans to offer unmanned aviation, robotics, and high-tech products with artificial intelligence elements to potential customers this year. The agency emphasized the equipment is geared toward defensive, border protection, and counter-terrorism capabilities.Since the invasion, things have changed. Russia’s defense-industrial complex—especially military high-tech and AI research and development—may be affected by the international sanctions and cascading effects of Russia being cut off from semi-conductor and microprocessor imports.Throughout 2021, the Russian government was pushing for the adoption of its AI civilian initiatives across the country, such as nationwide hackathons aimed at different age groups with the aim of making artificial intelligence familiar at home, work, and school. The government also pushed for the digital transformation of science and higher education, emphasizing the development of AI, big data, and the internet of things. Russian academic AI R&D efforts drove predictive analytics; development of chat bots that process text and voice messages and resolve user issues without human intervention; and technologies for working with biometric data. Russia’s development of facial recognition technology continued apace, with key efforts implemented across Moscow and other large cities. AI as a key image recognition and data analytical tool was used in many medical projects and efforts dealing with large data sets.Russian government officials noted their country’s efforts in promoting the ethics of artificial intelligence, and expressed confidence in Russia’s continued participation in this UN-sponsored work. The Russian Council for the Development of the Digital Economy has officially called for a ban on artificial intelligence algorithms that discriminate against people.Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development was asked to ""create a mechanism for assessing the humanitarian impact of the consequences of the introduction of such [AI] technologies, including in the provision of state and municipal services to citizens,"" and to prepare a ""road map"" for effective regulation, use, and implementation. According to the council, citizens should be able to appeal AI decisions digitally, and such a complaint should only be considered by a human. The council also proposed developing legal mechanisms to compensate for damage caused as a result of AI use.In October, Russia’s leading information and communications companies adopted the National Code of Ethics in the Field of AI; the code was recommended for all participants in the AI market, including government, business, Russian and foreign developers. Among the basic principles in the code are a human-centered approach to the development of this technology and the safety of working with data. AI workforce development was spelled out as a key requirement when the government officially unveiled the national AI roadmap in 2019. A 2021 government poll that tried to gauge the level of confidence in the government’s AI efforts showed that only about 64 percent of domestic AI specialists were satisfied with the working conditions in Russia.The survey reflected the microcosm of AI research, development, testing, and evaluation in Russia—lots of government activity and different efforts that did not automatically translate into a productive ecosystem conducive for developing AI, some major efforts notwithstanding.Among some of the reasons in 2021 that Russia was lagging behind in the development of artificial intelligence technologies were the personnel shortage and the weakness of the venture capital market. The civilian developer community also noted the low penetration of Russian products into foreign markets, dependence on imports, slow introduction of products into business and government bodies, and a weak connection between AI theory and practice. Russia’s likely plans to concentrate on these areas in 2022 were revised or put on hold once Russia invaded Ukraine. The sudden pull-out of major IT and high-tech companies from Russia, coupled with a rapid brain drain of Russia’s IT workers, and the ever-expanding high-tech sanctions against the Russian state may hobble domestic AI research and development for years to come. While the Russian government is trying to prop up its AI and high-tech industry with subsidies, funding, and legislative support, the impact of the above-mentioned consequences may be too much for the still-growing and evolving Russian AI ecosystem. That does not mean AI research and development will stop—on the contrary, many 2021 trends, efforts, and inventions are being implemented into the Russian economy and society in 2022, and there are domestic high-tech companies and public-private partnerships which are trying to fill the void left by the departed global IT majors. But the effects of the invasion will be felt in the AI ecosystem for a long time, especially with so many IT workers leaving the country, either because of the massive impact on the high-tech economy, or because they disagree with the war, or both.One of the most-felt sanctions aftereffects has been the severing of international cooperation on AI among Russian universities and research instructions, which earlier was enshrined as one of the most important drivers for domestic AI R&D, and reinforced by support from the Kremlin. For most high-tech institutions around the world, the impact of civilian destruction across Ukraine by the Russian military greatly outweighs the need to engage Russia on AI. At the same time, much of the Russian military AI R&D took place in a siloed environment—in many cases behind a classified firewall and without significant public-private cooperation—so it’s hard to estimate just how sanctions will affect Russian military AI efforts. While many in Russia now look to China as a substitute for departed global commercial relationships and products, it’s not clear if Beijing could fully replace the software and hardware products and services that left Russian markets at this point. Recent events may not stop Russian civilians and military experts from discussing how AI influences the conduct of war and peace—but the practical implementation of these deliberations may become increasingly more difficult for a country under global high-tech isolation.Samuel Bendett is an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an Adviser at the CNA Corporation.

On 4 April 2022, the Italian Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers and the Council of Europe co-organised the “High-Level Segment – Inaugural Meeting of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)”. This important event took place at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome and featured presentations on artificial intelligence and human rights by eminent academics, and representatives of States and international organisations.
Bjørn BERGE, Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe, in his opening speech noted the many novel challenges societies are facing through the use of AI systems in everyday life.
The high-level event was followed by the first meeting of the CAI (4-6 April 2022), which elected Mr Thomas SCHNEIDER (Switzerland) as its Chair. The Committee also held an exchange with Mr Gregor STROJIN (Slovenia), Vice-Chair elect, on the outcomes of the work of its predecessor the Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI), which Mr STROJIN chaired, and examined the ways forward in elaborating an appropriate legal instrument on the development, design, and application of artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe’s standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and conducive to innovation.

They need to set up a foundation of empathy and connectedness.Artificial intelligence combined with a human-centric approach to marketing might seem like a contrarian model. But the truth is that machine learning, AI and automation are vital for brands today to transform data into empathetic, customer-centric experiences. For marketers, AI-based solutions serve as a scalable and customizable tool capable of understanding the motive behind consumer interactions. This is the power of artificial empathy: When brands target individual consumer needs and connect with them at a deeper level than mere transactional exchanges. When it comes to empathetic machines, Hollywood may have made us think of the likes of Wall-E: robots with emotions. But artificial empathy is fundamentally about giving technology the ability to discover and respond to human emotions. Artificial empathy and data applicationTechnology provides us with insights about what the customer has done, but also nuggets and nuances that help anticipate future needs. But to mine them means analyzing reams of data to detect wider patterns or evolving preferences. Businesses cannot just rely on research and data teams to glean what customers are throwing back at them. The need right now is to be active listeners with ears on the ground and an ability to respond in real time.Have you read?Does this artificial intelligence think like a human?Artificial intelligence is learning to interact with the world the way humans doWhy artificial intelligence is learning emotional intelligenceArtificial empathy in marketing begins with a consumer-centric perspective and is embodied in insights that reflect what data is being collected from a brand’s customers and what meaningful next steps should be taken. It combines data intelligence with artificial intelligence and predictive modelling tools for all critical moments, including websites, store visits, social media or customer service. Some examples: • AI can detect patterns of behaviour and alert consumers of price drops or new stock-keeping units for favourite items through notifications. • Delayed or wrongly addressed packages get an exclusive offer for the next order. Artificial empathy and the human touchThe digital consumer today is always on. Herein lies the opportunity to create exceptional experiences while retaining the hearts of consumers all the while. Many labs are designing software to understand and respond to how what humans say and how they feel. The applications of artificial empathy are wide-ranging, from market research to transportation to advertising to customer service. Humana Pharmacy, for example, used an empathetic AI service to help its call centre teams handle customers more efficiently through emotion analytics. The solution deciphers the emotions of clients through the mapping of behavioural patterns such as a delayed pause, a rise in speech speed, or tempo. The analysis is relayed to the teams in messages such as “speaking a little fast” or “relate to the customer a bit more”. Such examples of empathetic AI will increase in the future. Artificial empathy is beneficial to advertisers in understanding how customers emotionally connect to the brand. Insights can be utilized to evolve content and messaging to help optimize campaign performance. Machine learning algorithms combined with consumer behaviour can offer suggestions for improving campaign performance. Such algorithms can be deployed to fine-tune demand forecasting and price sensitivity across target segments along with providing information on purchase behaviour. But while artificial empathy can help businesses create more effective interactions, it cannot replace human interaction. The primary requisite that makes AI effective is human insight, contextual awareness, nuances and creativity. Businesses must identify appropriate use cases of artificial empathy, and can then strategically implement its use into the services that they provide to customers. The human touch combined with machine intelligence can drive greater return on investment for targeted campaigns.The impact on marketingMarketers need to use artificial empathy to create campaigns that are humanized and not just mass-targeted. Here is where it can be utilized to comprehend business needs and harness data that can be distilled in simple terms. Campaigns can then be focused on providing beneficial content to customers after understanding the pain points and challenges of the customer. With evolving market conditions and constant disruption, brands must demonstrate empathy. Those who fail to appreciate the consumer predicament can fail to communicate in an appropriate tone and risk entrenching negative perceptions of their brand in the consumer’s mind. An insightful survey by Dassault Systems with independent research firm CITE revealed that younger consumers prefer personalization that enhances the product experience or their quality of life. They are also ready to pay extra and share their data to get it. Large volumes of unstructured data can be difficult to manage. But this technique allows marketing teams to react accordingly with relative ease. It can also be used to compare product features. Features and attributes that resonate with the target audience can be introduced or enhanced. It can also automatically differentiate between emotions and attitudes and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using ML (machine learning) and natural language processing (NLP).DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Can artificial intelligence own copyright?
This question has come to the fore as technological advances lead to scenarios far beyond the imagination of those who crafted most of our current jurisprudence on copyright. Ownership of copyright by nonhumans is not allowed in China, but increasing AI capabilities could spur changes in legal thinking.
According to the Copyright Law, “the author of a work is a natural person who creates the work.” Under certain circumstances, a legal person or unincorporated organization may be considered a work’s author. There is nothing in the law, however, that would support the proposition that computer systems can be treated as authors for copyright purposes.
In the landmark Shenzhen Tencent v. Shanghai Yingxun case, the Nanshan District People’s Court considered whether an article written by Tencent’s AI software Dreamwriter was entitled to copyright protection. The court found that it was, with copyright vesting in Dreamwriter’s developers, not Dreamwriter itself. In its decision, the court noted that “the arrangement and selection of the creative team in terms of data input, trigger condition setting, template and corpus style choices are intellectual activities that have a direct connection with the specific expression of the article.” These intellectual activities were carried out by the software developers.
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has distinguished between works that are generated without human intervention (“AI-generated”) and works generated with material human intervention and/or direction (“AI-assisted”). In the case of AI-assisted works, artificial intelligence is arguably just a tool used by humans. Vesting of copyright in the humans involved in these cases is consistent with existing copyright law, just as an artist owns the copyright to a portrait made using a paintbrush or a song recorded using a guitar. The scenario in the Tencent case falls in the AI-assisted bucket, with Dreamwriter being the tool.
China’s current copyright law does not provide for nonhuman ownership of copyright
As mentioned above, China’s current copyright law does not provide for nonhuman ownership of copyright, regardless of whether the work is AI-generated or AI-assisted. This said, it does not follow that copyright in an AI-generated work must by default be owned by a human. While future AI-generated output may constitute works from a copyright law standpoint, these works may be ineligible for copyright protection due to their lack of human authorship.
This approach would be consistent with longstanding principles of copyright law. Yet it could lead to results that are undesirable, at least from the perspective of the companies developing AI, and possibly government authorities looking for the industry to be a driver of growth. Further advances in the field could inevitably lead to a growing amount of works that cannot be copyrighted, making it difficult, if not impossible, to monetize them. Given this scenario, it would be understandable if copyright law was revisited.
Zhou Bo, senior judge of the Supreme People’s Court IPR Division, has suggested that the adoption of such changes could just be a matter of time. According to Zhou, “AI has not yet developed to a level where it is truly free from human involvement in the generation of relevant products.” However,
as for the copyright protection for those autonomously generated products of AI without any human intervention, we have to be patiently monitoring the progress of technology. It is still a bit early to draw conclusions.
This is not to say that in the future China will recognize computer systems as copyright owners. A more likely outcome is for the concept of authorship to be extended, allowing copyright in AI-generated works to vest in the developers of the underlying AI, just as with AI-assisted works. This would not mark a radical departure from the traditional copyright framework. Regardless of the level of autonomy AI achieves, its outputs will still be traced back to human intelligence, however remote in time.
In sum, we may eventually see the recognition of some form of AI copyright ownership, but in a way that provides rights to certain humans. Of course, if AI develops sufficiently, Dreamwriter’s descendants may start lawyering up to enforce their own rights in court!

It’s not new that the emerging artificial intelligence technology aims to take over the writing space.
High-end and intermediate writers have expressed cynical views and even fears over the AI writing software introduction.
For proponents of the AI writing application, it’s not so! According to them, the concept behind the creation is to help lessen the workload of writers.
In the meantime, the number of AIs has surpassed expectations. From small companies to big names in tech, AIs are attempting to become the next big thing for content marketing. 
In fact, due to the improvement in its machine language and data analytics, some companies prefer AI content marketing. 
This begs the question, is AI the future of writing? Or will it replace the human writing form?
Read on!
For a start, how does an Artificial intelligence Writing tool work?
If you’ve been wondering what goes on behind every AI, it’s simple, a machine language. 
AI writing tools use natural language generation to produce written words from mere data. You just input data in, and the rest is history. 
An AI is effective when a large amount of data needs conversion into written language that anyone can understand. 
Are more AIs being produced?
Scientists didn’t stop at a mere natural language generation; more work began after the discovery in 2016. 
They rebranded and created a more advanced AI that didn’t need data labeling while saving time and money. 
In May 2020, another model was created. It’s called OpenAIs GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3). 
This new and advanced machine language is the largest neural network globally. The machine has a model with over 175 million parameters.
The GPT-3 is different from other AIs because it processes information like the human thinking faculty. 
It executes tasks like answering questions, filling in blanks, publishing articles, writing songs, jokes, and even questions about the philosophical aspect of life! 
There are even better and more advanced ALs being created. In particular, some companies have copied the language system of the OpenAIs GTP-3 and made better improvements. 
In May 2020, Google launched a new chatbot called LAMDA. It’s designed to hold meaningful, emotional, and intellectual conversations. 
What’s more, Beijing has attempted to create the first living AI. In June 2020, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) launched a new AI called Wu Dao 2.0. 
The AI gave “life” to its first virtual student, Hua Zhubing to write songs and codes and possess a large memory. 
Is Artificial intelligence writing tools the future of writing?
This has become a lingering question in every writer’s mind and probably a writer’s worst fear, especially writers in the business of content writing or copywriting.
While AI technology keeps advancing, it’s arguably not going to be the future of writing. 
Writers are more skilled in capturing the essence and reader perception. It’ll take years of research for any AI to exhibit such traits. An AI can’t write emphatically as a human would. 
Although AI has shown great dexterity and expertise in writing, there are still major gaps that can’t be filled. 
Below are a few reasons why writers need not worry about AIs for now:
Uniqueness
An AI lacks the uniqueness human writers bring to their articles. It’s an intricate factor that distinguishes the pro from the amateur. 
AIs may be perfect for data gathering and analyzing complex words but possess poor creative analytics. 
They poorly express themselves due to a lack of cognition and emotion. Only humans can process such complexities. 
Editing
AIs produce whatever you run into them. The process is like garbage in garbage out. 
The workload still falls on a human to carefully reread and edit AI-generated articles. 
Engagement
Yes, it might be difficult to detect an AI-written article. However, AIs struggle to compose coherent and engaging content to captivate readers. Engagement is the footstone of every good content. 
Writers are more skilled in capturing the essence of every article. It may take years of research for AIs to exhibit such traits. 
Ambiguousness
If there’s one thing an AI greatly lacks in information presentation, it’s a lack of direct and multiple evaluations. 
For instance, an AI can’t interpret a proverb or an idiom. They aren’t recognizable in data analysis. 
Also, they can’t differentiate between the linguistic complexities, like when not to use offensive words.
New hope for writers?
For now, human writers have nothing to worry about. AIs and humans can coexist symbiotically without one dominating the other. 
Though many believe it’s economical and more reliable than human writers. However, the barrier to the above statement is the cost of an AI to start up. Only big tech companies can afford excellent and effective AI writing tools. 
The risk-on human writers are quite low. However, it shouldn’t stop you from honing your skill!  
Final Say
Sam Altman, CEO of Open AIs, in a tweet published in early June 2021, stated that AIs might likely affect physical jobs more than remote jobs such as coding, writing, administrative jobs, and co.
Whether we like it or not, AIs are here to stay. We can’t fight them. However, we can create a means to incorporate them into the physical fold without any job losses. 
They immensely contribute to accelerating a writer’s process and simplifying the workload.
We already use low-resource AIs like Grammarly and plagiarism checkers. Still, human editors and proofreaders are thriving.

As she was looking for a camp last summer, Yabesra Ewnetu, who’d just finished eighth grade, found a reference to MIT’s FutureMakers Create-a-thon. Ewnetu had heard that it’s hard to detect bias in artificial intelligence because AI algorithms are so complex, but this didn’t make sense to her. “I was like, well, we’re the ones coding it, shouldn’t we be able to see what it’s doing and explain why?” She signed up for the six-week virtual FutureMakers program so she could delve into AI herself.
FutureMakers is part of the MIT-wide Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE) initiative launched earlier this year. RAISE is headquartered in the MIT Media Lab and run in collaboration with MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MIT Open Learning.
MIT piloted FutureMakers to students from all over the United States last year in two formats.
During one-week, themed FutureMakers Workshops organized around key topics related to AI, students learn how AI technologies work, including social implications, then build something that uses AI.
And during six-week summer Create-a-Thons, middle school and high school students do a deep dive into AI and coding for four weeks, then take two weeks to design an app for social good. The Create-a-Thon culminates in a competition where teams present their ideas and prototypes to an expert panel of judges.
“We want to remove as many barriers as we possibly can to support diverse students and teachers,” says Cynthia Breazeal, a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT who founded the Media Lab’s Personal Robots Group and also heads up the RAISE initiative. All RAISE programs are free for educators and students. The courses are designed to meet students and teachers where they are in terms of resources, comfort with technology, and interests.
But it’s not all about learning to code.
“AI is shaping our behaviors, it’s shaping the way we think, it’s shaping the way we learn, and a lot of people aren’t even aware of that,” says Breazeal. “People now need to be AI literate given how AI is rapidly changing digital literacy and digital citizenship.”
The one-week FutureMaker Workshops are offered year-round. MIT trains teachers or people who work at STEM educational organizations so they can bring the tools and project-based hands-on curriculum and activities to their students. One year in, MIT has trained 60 teachers who have given workshops to more than 300 students, many from underserved and under-represented communities across the United States. Teachers and mentors choose from among four workshop themes for their training: Conversational AI, Dancing With AI, Creativity and AI, and How to Train Your Robot.
MIT worked with Lili’uokalani Trust in Hawaii to teach the How to Train Your Robot workshop during a spring break program on the remote islands of Moloka’i and Lana’i.
When the trust visited the MIT Media Lab on an East Coast study tour, “we were immediately inspired by the vast array of AI and STEM programs and decided to pilot How to Train Your Robot,” says Lili’uokalani Trust program manager Kau’ilani Arce.
The workshop introduced students to AI, image classification, and algorithmic bias, and taught them to program robots using a custom block-based coding environment built using the Scratch programming language, which was developed at the Media Lab.
On the first day, “we learned about algorithmic bias and how it can lead to deeply rooted issues, such as social and racial injustices,” Arce says. “It was a wonderful opportunity to critically think about how Native Hawaiians are equally represented in algorithms we use daily.”
The best moment for sixth-grader Yesmine Kiroloss: “When I got to program my robot!”
For students without previous AI experience, it took grit to understand the correlation between a coding environment and a functioning robot, says Arce. “There was an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.”
MIT collaborated with SureStart, a startup aimed at mentoring high school and college students in AI, for the first six-week FutureMakers Create-a-thon last summer.
The Create-a-Thon had two tracks: an MIT App Inventor track with 30 students including Ewnetu, and a Deep Learning track with 45. The 78 students hailed from more than 20 states and just over two-thirds were female.
For the first four weeks students worked in groups of eight with two graduate student mentors who summarized each day’s lessons and held office hours so the students could ask questions.
In the final two weeks, the students applied what they’d learned to create something with societal or environmental impact.
A key step was plotting out a minimum viable product: a web or mobile app that contained the minimum elements needed to illustrate their idea.
At the end of the six weeks, 15 teams of four students and a mentor showed off their ideas in an entrepreneurial-style pitch competition judged by experts form academia and industry.
Ewnetu’s team, Team Dyadic, built a prediction model to warn people about wildfires. The idea was inspired by a team member from California. The team bootstrapped a website, collected a dataset, trained a machine language model, and added an interactive map. “Our code is a prediction of how close the current conditions are to a fire condition,” says Ewnetu, who’s now a first-year student at Justice High School in Falls Church, Virginia.
The team members had a mix of experience. “There were people in the class who had a lot of [coding] experience and there were people in the class like me who had very little to no experience,” says Ewnetu. She needed a lot of help from the mentors in the first couple of weeks, but then everything clicked, she says. “It went from like an error every other line to an error maybe every other section.”
Ewnetu “is the perfect embodiment of what happens when you just provide people with support,” says SureStart founder Taniya Mishra. “[Having] high expectations is a good thing, especially if you can provide a lot of scaffolding.”
Team Dyadic made the finals. “To see all of our work culminate and then pay off just made us feel like winners,” Ewnetu says.
Meanwhile, Team Youth of Tech created the Vividly app, which allows parents to input questions for their child. When the child logs in, the app asks if they’re happy, sad, frustrated or angry, a bot named Viviana asks the questions, and the child communicates with the bot, knowing the parents can see the conversation.
The idea is to give kids a way to be open with their parents in a very comfortable environment, says Bella Baidak, a first-year masters of information student at Cornell Tech in New York City, and the team’s mentor.
“It’s a form of facilitating better communication so they can talk more,” says team member Netra Rameshbabu, now a first-year at Matea Valley High School in Aurora, Illinois.
“Our idea was to make this a routine, like brushing your teeth.”
Team Youth of Tech made the finals, then won. When they announced Team Youth, “I was screaming I was so excited! I was in tears. I was in joy,” says Rameshbabu.
The mentees did “a brilliant job,” says Kunjal Panchal, head mentor and PhD student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “They know how to use AI and they know how to use it for the common good.”
This year’s six-week FutureMakers program starts July 6. Middle, high school, and undergraduate students can apply here.
Teachers can reach out to RAISE to learn about the one-week training workshops.
Students and teachers can also get started with AI this May 13 during the Day of AI. Students and their teachers from all over the country can learn about AI literacy through a modular, hands-on curriculum that supports up to four hours of learning per grade track. The Day of AI format can be taught by teachers with a wide range of technology backgrounds and are designed to be accessible to all students.
This year’s Day of AI, on May 13, includes teaching materials for upper elementary through high school. The program will eventually span all of K-12. Teachers can register here for a two-hour Day of AI teacher training program. Teaching materials are available under a Creative Commons license.
For this year's Day of AI, students in grades 3 to 5 will learn about datasets, algorithms, predictions and bias, and will create an AI application that can tell the difference, say, between an image of a dog and that of a cat. Middle school students will learn about generative adversarial networks, which can produce both deepfakes and art. High school students will learn about the recommendation systems used by social media and their implications for individuals and for society. Students and their teachers can register here to participate.

Robotics: which jobs will disappear with robotization?

A team of roboticists from the EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and economists from the University of Lausanne has developed a method that calculates the probability that a job will be automated by robotics. This tool also suggests less risky job changes. The study, titled ” How to compete with robots by assessing the risks of task automation and resilient alternatives,” was published in Sciences Robotics.
The fourth industrial revolution emerged in 2011. Artificial intelligence and robotics have enabled the design of increasingly autonomous robots that can replace humans in their tasks.
A profound transformation of the entire economic and production system is taking shape, raising questions about the nature of the jobs that will disappear. This is the subject of a study by a team from the EPFL and the University of Lausanne, which has designed a tool that proposes professional reorientation towards less exposed jobs that require little retraining.
Professor Dario Floreano, director of the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at EPFL and head of this study at EPFL, explains:
“There are already different studies that predict the number of jobs that will soon be robotized, but they all focus on software robots, such as voice and image recognition, robot financial advisors, dialoguers, etc. Moreover, these predictions vary widely depending on job requirements and software capabilities. Our study considers not only artificial intelligence software, but also actual intelligent robots that perform physical work. We developed a method that systematically compares human and robotic capabilities required in hundreds of jobs.”

Assessing the risk of automation

To assess the automation risk index (ARI) of each job, the researchers referred to the Occupation Information Network (O*NET), a U.S. market database of 967 job profiles. For each job, O*NET provides a profile composed of a list of required abilities, skills and knowledge. The researchers selected 87 human capabilities.
In addition to human capabilities, they also studied a set of robotic capabilities that robots and AI are already capable of performing or will be able to perform in the future. For this, they used a list of capabilities defined in the SPARC Multi-Annual Report (MAR), a document published by SPARC, a public-private partnership between the European Commission and EU-robotics, which represents the European robotics industry. After selectively matching human capabilities from the O*net list to robotic capabilities in the MAR document, the team was able to calculate the likelihood for each existing job to be performed by a robot.
The study classified the 967 jobs: physicists are the least likely to be replaced by a robot, while people working in slaughterhouses are at the highest risk. In general, jobs in the food industry, building and maintenance, construction and mining seem to be the most exposed to robotization.
The authors then created a method to find the conversion for any job that has a significantly lower risk of automation, while being close to the original job in terms of skills and knowledge required. To do this, they used data on the U.S. workforce and simulated thousands of job conversions based on the algorithm’s suggestions.
Professor Rafael Lalive, who co-led the study at the University of Lausanne, concludes:
“Today, the major challenge for society is to prepare to deal with automation. Our work provides detailed career advice to workers facing high risks of automation, allowing them to choose safer jobs while reusing many of the skills they acquired in their previous jobs. With this advice, governments can help society become more resilient to automation.”

Artificial Intelligence is seen by many as a great transformative tech.  Will AI systems one day drive us around? Do our laundry? Mow our lawn? Raise our kids?  Fight wars? Write these articles? Create political advertisements? These questions make people shift from thinking purely about the functional capabilities to the ethics behind creating such powerful and potentially life-consequential technologies.  As such, it makes sense to spend time considering what we want these systems to do and make sure we address ethical questions now so that we build these systems with the common good of humanity in mind.


Will AI replace human workers?

The most immediate concern for many is that AI-enabled systems will replace workers across a wide range of industries. AI brings mixed emotions and opinions when referenced in the context of jobs. However, it’s becoming increasingly clear that AI is not a job killer, but rather, a job category killer. As has happened with every wave of technology, from the automatic weaving looms of the early industrial revolution to the computers of today we see that jobs are not destroyed, but rather employment shifts from one place to another and entirely new categories of employment are created. We can and should expect the same in the AI-enabled economy. Research and experience is showing that it’s inevitable that AI will replace entire categories of work, especially in transportation, retail, government, professional services employment, and customer service. On the other hand, companies will be freed up to put their human resources to much better, higher value tasks instead of taking orders, fielding simple customer service requests or complaints, or data entry related tasks. 

Indeed, the move to this new age of digital transformation is creating concerns about labor displacement, with or without the power of AI. All AI is doing is hastening digital transformation across particular business processes. As companies are looking to adapt and implement AI strategies we think it’s important to have open and honest conversations with your employees. In particular, experience and research is showing that companies that adopt augmented intelligence approaches, where AI is augmenting and helping humans to do their jobs better, rather than fully replacing the human, not only shows faster and more consistent ROI for organizations, but also is welcomed much more warmly by employees. People feel more comfortable working with machines instead of being replaced by machines.

The rise of fake media and disinformation: Will AI make this worse?
AI systems are getting really good at creating fake images, videos, conversations, and all manner of content. We already have trouble believing everything we hear, see, and read.  What happens when you can no longer tell if an image is real or AI-generated or if you’re talking to a bot or a real person? It’s been widely reported that bots had a role to play in the 2016 US Presidential elections spreading political propaganda. These automated social media accounts helped create and spread misinformation on the internet attempting to manipulate voters and fueling the fire of partisan disagreement. Unlike humans, bots never tire working 24/7 and can generate a very large amount of content in a very short period of time. Once shared and re-tweeted with others this news starts to go viral, true or not, and is virtually unstoppable. These bots are effective at spreading false or heavily altered facts, amplifying messages, and putting thoughts and ideas into people’s heads. Criminals and state actors can use fake imagery or audio to cause personal or business harm or to interfere with government operations. Now all it takes is a few malicious actors spreading false claims to traumatically alter public opinion and quickly shift the public’s view.
Governments and corporations alike will have to think about how they will reign in the potential damage done by AI-enabled content creation. In fact, we encourage companies and governments to consider fake content to be as malicious as cybersecurity threats and respond appropriately. Propaganda, disinformation, malicious interference, blackmail, and other forms of “information crime” can be just as harmful as physical and electronic attacks on systems. The world is very much unprepared for AI being unleashed on unprotected citizens. Corporations who freely traffic in user-generated content are just as liable as governments to curb abuse.

Do we want evil people to have easy access to AI technology?
While AI can do a lot of good we must be mindful about AI in the hands of malicious users. As technology continues to become more powerful, AI can cause severe damage if used maliciously. What happens when individuals, criminal organizations, and rogue countries apply AI to malicious ends?  Many companies are already asking themselves these questions and starting to take action to safeguard against malicious AI attacks.  New technologies can exploit the vulnerability of systems that are dependent on AI and machine learning technologies. As these AI systems get smarter they can change the nature of threats, making them harder to detect, more random in appearance, more adaptive to systems and environments, and more efficient at identifying and targeting vulnerabilities in systems. This should be terrifying. We need to immediately start thinking about how we are constructing and managing our digital infrastructure as well as how we design and distribute AI systems. Detecting these malicious attacks will only get harder over time.

In addition, machine learning service providers, especially on-demand cloud-based services should be mindful of who their customers are. If malicious users are using their platforms to perform distributed AI-enabled attacks or other criminal acts, then like financial institutions, governments will start cracking down on these providers and impose new forms of “Know Your Customer (KYC)” regulations. If these platform providers don’t want to be on the wrong end of the regulatory cycle, they need to get ahead of the curve and start their own efforts to make sure they know who their customers are and what they are doing on their platforms.

Is pervasive surveillance already here? Is AI our new Big Brother?
AI enables companies and governments to keep constant tabs on what humans are doing in an automated and intelligent fashion. Will a future with AI mean an end to privacy? Will “Big Brother” really always be watching? As facial recognition technologies continue to advance it’s getting easier to detect individuals from a large crowd of people at stadiums, parks, and public spaces without their permission. In 2018 Microsoft urged Congress to study it and oversee the use of facial recognition technology. Bradford Smith, the company’s president said “We live in a nation of laws, and the government needs to play an important role in regulating facial recognition technology”.  What’s striking about this statement is that tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, so for Microsoft to be urging the US Congress to regulate facial recognition they must already see how this technology can be misused.
In an AI-enabled future we assume that everyone and everything will have knowledge about everyone else. This means that the assumption will be that everyone already knows who we are, what we want, where we are, and what we’re doing. This pervasive knowledge will become part of the assumption of where we are, just like we are now expecting to be able to get Internet, electricity, and information whenever and wherever we need it without excuse. No longer will we be able to just “un-plug” for a while. We may quickly move to a world where just a few companies and government have an uncomfortable amount of knowledge and level of control over the lives of everyone.
Will intelligent machines have rights?
As machines become more intelligent and we ask more and more of our machines, how should they be treated and viewed in society? Once machines can actually simulate emotion and act similar to human beings, how should they be governed?  Should we consider machines as humans, animals, or inanimate objects? To this point, to what level do we ascribe liability and responsibility to the devices themselves over the people that are supposedly in control of them? In March 2018 an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian. People were outraged that a machine killed a human being.
But why were people outraged by this accident? Thousands of people are killed every day in motor vehicle accidents caused by humans at the wheel. What difference should it make that it was a machine driving the vehicle? The reason for this outrage is because society hasn’t, and may never accept, when a machine kills a human. However, the likelihood of eliminating all traffic-related fatalities is almost certainly zero percent. As such, if we want autonomous vehicles on the road this scenario will happen again, and again. Despite perhaps dramatic evidence that machine-driven vehicles have overall far lower fatality rates than human-driven vehicles, the issue of liability and control is primarily one of ethics. So we need to be asking these questions, figuring out what we can accept and what’s ethical, and put laws and regulations in place now to safeguard against future tragedies.
Creating transparency in AI decision-making
There are many approaches used in machine learning, however, no machine algorithm has re-invigorated the AI market quite like deep learning. Deep learning, however, is a “black box”. We aren’t really sure how deep learning works and this can be a big problem when we rely on this technology to make critical decisions such as loan applications, who gets paroled, and who gets hired. AI systems that are unexplainable should not be acceptable, especially in high risk situations. Explainable AI needs to be part of the equation if we want to have AI systems we can trust.
Deep learning relies heavily on training data. So it should be no surprise then that when biased training data is used to teach these systems the results are biased AI systems. People wrongly assume that the training data is always “clean”, from a large pool, and represents society as a whole but results have proved this is not the case. Google’s image recognition system wrongly classified images of minorities, the Apple Card which is administered by Goldman Sachs has come under recent scrutiny for gender bias, and software used to sentence criminals was found to be biased against minorities. If we are going to use machine learning algorithms to make any sort of worthwhile decision we must demand that it be able to explain itself. Would you really allow a human driver to hit your car and when you question why they did that they have no answer? Of course you wouldn’t. We shouldn’t accept this from machines either!
Taking steps to resolve these issues
If we don’t ask ourselves these questions now and build ethical AI, implications down the road can be far more grim than people realize. Do we really trust companies to do the right thing? Do we trust governments to do the right thing? We’d like to think that with public input and ethical questions and concerns brought up now, that we can create a future that isn’t so grim. There will always be bad actors who try to influence, infiltrate, and manipulate. Enterprises, organizations, and citizens should keep asking questions, keep working towards building ethical AI, and keep trying to fight automated bots and malicious attacks because AI is coming whether or not we’re ready.

						UCF NanoScience Technology Center Assistant Professor Tania Roy and Electrical and Computer Engineering doctoral student Adithi Krishnaprasad are working to give technology brain-like computing power.  					








Researchers at the University of Central Florida are developing new devices that will allow artificial intelligence (AI) to work from anywhere, without connecting to the internet.
This means technology ranging from natural language processing programs, like Siri or Alexa to robots and other advanced applications, could work in remote regions of the globe or even on other planets.
The researchers’ latest findings, which demonstrated a new technique to create the advanced devices, were published in a new study in the journal ACS Nano.
Currently AI depends on connections to remote servers to perform the heavy computing and complex calculations needed to run AI processing or perform unsupervised learning, says study principal investigator Tania Roy, an assistant professor in UCF’s NanoScience Technology Center.
“Our goal is to make the artificial intelligence circuitry very small and compact,” Roy says. “That way technology like portable, handheld devices can have the circuitry on them and don’t need an internet connection. They can operate in remote areas, and have all of those functionalities, like image search or voice understanding, from any place on Earth.”
And while smart phone voice assistants are current technology that could benefit from having brain-like computing power as part of their hardware, robots are another.
“If somebody is stuck in a remote area, then the robots now will have the capacity of functioning and going to that remote area and rescuing the human being,” Roy says. “Or if we have elderly parents living alone in their homes, we can have devices that can monitor their health conditions all the time and give them some triage if something goes wrong. We would feel much more at peace if there is something to take care of them.”
For space exploration, this means robots, such as rovers, wouldn’t need a person telling them what to do.
“What happens now is that because the devices are not capable of doing unsupervised learning there is a supervisor,” Roy says. “We have to tell them what to do in the environment. But after years in space, rovers will need the power of unsupervised learning to adapt to changing environments.”
The complex, neuromorphic — or brain-like —devices the researchers have created are placed upon small, rectangular chips, about an inch wide.
The devices that UCF researchers are developing will allow artificial intelligence to work from anywhere, without connecting to the internet.
Although other researchers have worked to develop this type of technology, the UCF-developed devices are more reliable due to the unique engineering and nanoscale materials they used, says the study’s lead author, Adithi Krishnaprasad ’18MS, a doctoral student in UCF’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
“We grew the material in a different way compared to how other labs grow it,” Krishnaprasad says.
“We did not grow it on some other substrate and then transfer it, rather, we grew it on the main chip itself,” she says. “We fabricated within the same platform, so that reduced the anomalies brought in by the chemistry when transfer is used. So, we completely avoided that. By using this different technique, we have changed the way the current moves through the device. This provides better reliability by reducing variability within the device.”
The team’s advancements allow for parallelism and in-memory computing, similar to the brain, that’s required for AI and unsupervised learning, the researchers say.
The critical task of growing, or synthesizing, the nanoscale material on the chip was performed by UCF researcher Eric Jung’s group. Jung is a study co-author and an assistant professor with UCF Materials Science & Engineering, NanoScience Technology Center, and Electrical & Computer Engineering.
For their next steps, the researchers will work to further advance the technology, including building networks with the devices to enable new applications, such as image recognition.
The chips could appear in modern technology in the next 10 years, the researchers say.
Study co-authors also included Durjoy Dev ’21PhD, a graduate of UCF’s doctoral program in electrical engineering; Sang Sub Han and Changhyeon Yoo, both postdoctoral associates in the Jung Research Group at UCF; Yaqing Shen, with the Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Hee-Suk Chung and Tae-Sung Bae, both with the Analytical Research Division, Korea Basic Science Institute; and Mario Lanza, with the Department of Material Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.
Roy joined UCF in 2016 and is a part of the NanoScience Technology Center with a joint appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Physics. Her recent National Science Foundation CAREER award focuses on the development of devices for artificial intelligence applications. Roy was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley prior to joining UCF. She received her doctorate in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University.

How Governments are Changing the World with HPC and AI 

April 11, 2022
Sponsored Content by Dell Technologies 

A nation’s global competitiveness depends on its ability to harness high performance computing (HPC) for innovation. Here’s how HPC, bolstered by data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), is helping governments tackle our most complex issues, from medical mysteries and world hunger to interplanetary research.

How can we best protect citizens? How can we help Veterans walk again? How can we help create a more sustainable future?
These are just a few of the countless big questions spiraling through the universe. But each represents a complex computational problem that high performance computing (HPC) is hard at work to solve.
HPC empowers governments to improve the lives and safety of citizens along with their global competitiveness. Combining massive compute power and storage capacity, HPC can process billions of bits of data every second to drive scientific discoveries, improve military outcomes, and create commercial innovation. An HPC foundation is necessary for heavy-duty data analytics that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to generate real-time, often predictive insights and enable automated actions.
Increasingly, a nation’s use of HPC reflects its global economic posture. By modeling complex behavior, HPC fuels breakthroughs in everything from aerospace development to cryptography and weapons design. The ability to process and analyze massive datasets in real time presents limitless possibilities for bettering the world around us.
Nuclear stockpile management
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) uses HPC to protect nuclear weapons. HPC simulation and modeling have become critical since the discontinuation of underground U.S. nuclear testing in the 1990s. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory plans to begin expanding processing power for its computational scientists and those at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories this year with 40 petaflops of HPC in next-generation Dell PowerEdge servers.
The agency said its HPC expansion, expected to last through 2025, will increase compute capacity for NNSA’s Advanced Simulation and Computing program by three to four times and enable higher-fidelity 2D and 3D simulations.
Medical breakthroughs
The Cineca scientific consortium’s Human Brain Project of uses HPC to advance the field of neuroscience and develop robotics with more human-like intelligence. About 90 European and international research institutes, including a U.S. federal lab, participate.
Dell PowerEdge servers powered by Intel® Xeon® Platinum processors and Intel Optane™ memory run enhanced brain simulation software that scientists have used to enable paraplegics to regain the ability to walk with brain-stimulation treatments. The same software is helping regulate the unstable blood pressure that’s common in victims of spinal cord injuries.
Another medical science project at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix  uses Dell Technologies HPC systems and storage to create a full genome in just 24 hours. Sequencing the first human genome was completed in 2003 and took 13 years. HPC enables the institute to quickly identify a gene mutation, make a diagnosis, and begin developing a treatment.
Weather and climate insights
Mother Nature creates concerns ranging from dressing for inclement weather to protecting the future viability of planet Earth. The U.S.’s NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) provides HPC and data services to global weather and climate researchers. Its arsenal includes an HPC cluster built with hundreds of Dell PowerEdge servers for enabling large-scale analysis that helps researchers better understand issues such as how vulnerable or resilient various ecosystems are to environmental change.
In the shorter term, modeling gives forecasters a clearer view of the intensity, direction, and speed of a storm. Given that the U.S. now generally experiences extreme weather more frequently, these programs help governments adopt smarter disaster preparedness and recovery plans that help save lives, improve safety, and minimize damage.
Feeding the world
Between 720 and 811 million people faced hunger in 2020, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. On the forefront of agricultural transformation, New Jersey-based AeroFarms works to alleviate the systemic food crisis with indoor farming locations around the world.
It uses Dell Technologies HPC solutions, data analytics, and ML to model different types of plants and create a 100%-controlled environment that grows crops 365 days a year, unencumbered by traditional seasonal limitations. It reports having grown more than 850 different varieties of crops and estimates having achieved 390X greater productivity than commercial farming while using 95% less water.
Life on other planets?
In its quest to determine the habitability of Mars, for example, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shares data and analytics from its interstellar space missions with members of the scientific community and the public. The NASA Perseverance rover has been gathering telemetry sensor data, photos, and audio content from the Red Planet since February 2021. NASA aggregates hundreds of terabytes of interplanetary data in Dell PowerScale and Unity storage.
NASA correlates and analyzes Perseverance data in combination with data from its 30 years of space missions to advance our understanding of Mars and its potential for one day supporting human life. Scientists have discovered evidence of water, ice, and snow, for example, that the agency says are possible indicators that the planet once hosted microbial life.
These are a few ways governments and commercial enterprises are competing in the global economy using HPC and AI technologies. Visit delltechnologies.com/federal and delltechnologies.com/hpc to learn more.

Artificial intelligence is already ubiquitous in our lives and will be foundational to our future prosperity. In Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has identified AI and machine learning as critical technologies of national interest. AI applications are wide-ranging and encompass many sectors, including agriculture, education, energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transport and telecommunications.
As a general-purpose technology, AI applications in those domains may also have implications for defence and security. Indeed, the Australian Defence Force’s ability to understand the operational environment, manoeuvre and project force will be transformed through advances in AI and human–machine partnerships, employing dual-use and defence-specific AI applications.
Innovation in AI is accelerating, creating opportunities to grow the economy, solve challenging problems, accelerate discovery and enhance national security. It’s estimated that AI could exceed $20 trillion in worth to the global economy by 2030. This potential for transformative impact, and the competitive advantages offered by AI, are being actively pursued around the world. More than 30 countries and regions had published AI strategies or similar documents by December 2020; the world’s top universities are increasing their investment in AI education; and private investment in AI continues to grow. This ongoing expansion in AI activity will bring accelerating advances across the field.
With global AI investments growing, Australia will need to remain internationally competitive in a world of expanding AI capabilities and AI-enabled operations. For defence, AI will be critical in delivering strategic objectives and maintaining a capable, agile and potent defence force. Reflecting that importance, and the need for increased self-reliance, AI is included among the new ‘sovereign industry capability priorities’ critical to defence. A sovereign capability in AI ensures Australia’s stake in a key 21st-century industry and underpins the defence organisation’s future operational and training capabilities.
Australia has some world-leading AI capabilities in universities, research organisations and industry. To expand from that base, we need to focus on AI and broader STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) initiatives to build the specialist workforce required by Australian industry. Building human capacity in AI will be critical, as demand is already outstripping supply, and the need for AI specialist skills is expected to grow significantly. For sovereign activities, including sensitive work supporting the nation’s defence and security sector, the ability to draw upon an Australian AI-skilled workforce will be fundamental.
Capacity in the Australian workforce will ensure that we can maintain an effective defence force and develop the capabilities needed to meet and overcome the disruption that AI will introduce to current methods of warfare. That will require sustained investment in skills training at all levels to raise understanding of AI by managers and to further expand AI graduate and higher degree by research programs to attract and train Australian AI specialists.
Increased research and technology development, supported by long-term and sustained investments in data, tools and critical digital infrastructure, will underpin our national AI competitiveness. Through sovereign investment in AI research and development, the benefits of AI will be fully harnessed and the potential risks mitigated. Investment should include building access to sufficient computing capacity and the fast networking needed to source those capabilities.
In addition, data holdings need to be established and managed to support the development of AI applications and tools, buttressed by appropriate access and privacy protections. Issues of safety, security and bias need to be understood and actively researched to support and inform responsible AI practices and build trust in AI systems to underpin confidence in continued AI development. That will require the development of AI systems that accord with Australian values and are trusted partners across the breadth of AI applications. The ongoing development of AI standards, engaging a broad cross-section of stakeholders, will enable the widespread use of responsible AI and increase the competitiveness of Australian industry.
Through government leadership, a strong and vibrant AI ecosystem should be established to bring together partnerships with industry and academia to drive innovation, meet national priorities and expand AI exports. This will ensure strong stakeholder participation and dialogue to inform policy considerations and connect industry and academia with new business opportunities. Efforts are already being made in that direction. In the defence sector, this includes the establishment of the Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Network. The DAIRNet will work to build a research community in Australia supporting Defence, bringing together multidisciplinary teams to address AI challenges at scale. Beyond research and innovation, a sovereign capability entails the adoption and continuous upgrade of AI technologies to enhance productivity, requiring industry participation across the AI product life cycle.

When Alona Fyshe was growing up in Edmonton — the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta — and attending the University of Alberta, she never expected the city would turn into an epicenter of artificial intelligence work. However, that is exactly what it has become.
In 2018, after some time away, Fyshe was lured back to Edmonton for a job as a professor at her alma mater, and she’s thrilled to have settled in such a vibrant city that’s home to a thriving and collaborative network of artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers.



“It’s a remarkable place to be. We have young up-and-coming researchers, but we also have established researchers who are leaders in the field,” Fyshe said. “Everyone’s interested in each other’s ideas, and there are many opportunities for smart people to connect with each other.”
Fyshe is now an assistant professor in the Department of Computing Science and Department of Psychology, and uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand how the human brain processes language.
As Fyshe explained, “Computer models of language are exciting, and they’re becoming more and more accurate. I’m interested in using those computer models to understand how we comprehend language, but also how this can help further improve those models.”
Fyshe is not alone in her enthusiasm for the technology and Edmonton’s unique position as a leader in artificial intelligence research. Edmonton is gaining a worldwide reputation as a hub for businesses, and organizations from across the globe are flocking to the city to learn, collaborate, and advance their work in the field.
Future-Focused Ecosystem
An organization at the core of the region’s artificial intelligence innovation is the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), one of Canada’s preeminent centers of artificial intelligence. Amii plays a prominent role in building connections between researchers of different stripes in the tech community and, in doing so, developing a thriving artificial intelligence ecosystem in the province.
Amii also represents Edmonton as a member of the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, the world’s first national strategy committed to building local and regional AI ecosystems, supporting talent and training in the field, fostering collaboration, and understanding the societal implications of the technology.
The region is also home to the Alberta Artificial Intelligence Association (AlbertataAI), a non-profit organization aimed at cultivating the Alberta AI ecosystem and collaborating with like-minded communities. The group organized the first annual Alberta AI conference in March 2019, which attracted 350 participants, including AI experts, IT professionals, university professors, computer science graduate students, and enthusiasts from various industries across the artificial intelligence field.
The University of Alberta: A Best-in-Class Research Institution
When Fyshe isn’t engaging in the ground-breaking research that drew her back to Edmonton, she is deeply engaged in teaching at The University of Alberta — or, as she puts it, “training the next generation of scholars to do machine learning in the real world.”
Located at the edge of Edmonton’s North Saskatchewan River valley, The University of Alberta is one of the top five AI research institutions globally, with a world-renowned robotics lab and brain imaging center that are helping push the field in new directions.
The use of artificial intelligence in language processing has progressed rapidly over the last decade, and the University of Alberta’s expertise in this area has played a pivotal role in this. The university continues to provide exciting opportunities to advance this innovation, further contributing to Edmonton’s position as a leader in artificial intelligence.
In addition, The Kule Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) at the University of Alberta is the official host of the International Center for Information Ethics (ICIE), a leader in the field of digital ethics, and publisher of the International Review of Information Ethics. When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron committed to creating an international study group on artificial intelligence in 2018, the institute set out to organize its first annual AI, Ethics and Society Conference in 2019 — an interdisciplinary gathering which explored the history, ethics, policy, business, and science of AI.
Also at the university, the AI4Society Reverse EXPO 2022 brings together the University of Alberta AI research community and representatives from industry, government, and civil society to learn about what students are doing to advance AI-related research and applications, as well as explore collaboration options.
Describing the university’s community, Fyshe said, “There really is an excellent set of people who are working and learning here.” The work of introducing new learners, both students and members of the larger community, to artificial intelligence and machine learning is a collaborative and inspiring effort. “There’s an exciting network of researchers fueling the energy in Edmonton.”
Sharing Knowledge, Driving Progress
Edmonton’s energy and expertise is attracting events and organizations from around the world, tapping into the city’s ecosystem of innovation.
There is ample opportunity to learn from and collaborate with Edmonton’s AI experts like Fyshe. Conference attendees can engage in meaningful tours of state-of-the art facilities, hear from outstanding keynote speakers, and connect with leading institutions in artificial intelligence — and it’s these collaborations that are driving innovation to help shape the future of this increasingly important industry.

New AI technique could lead to innovations in biomaterials

Innovation often leads to new products, but new methods can be just as groundbreaking.





It was the chance to help develop those methods that drew chemical engineering doctoral student Soumil Joshi from his native Mumbai, India, to Virginia Tech in 2019.
""It's a great school, especially for the chemical engineering field, and it is really reputed for research on polymers, which I'm thankful to be doing here,"" Joshi said.
And in March, three years of work led to his name being listed as first author on a paper describing a new computational method for working with polymers that he and his advisor, Assistant Professor Sanket Deshmukh, hope will lead to significant biomedical advancements.
The paper, titled ""Coarse-grained molecular dynamics integrated with Convolutional Neural Network for comparing shapes of temperature sensitive bottlebrushes,"" details a method developed by the Deshmukh lab, including co-author and visiting scholar Samrendra Singh, that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the shape of important complex soft materials and predict their behaviors.
It was published in npj Computational Materials, an open-access journal from Nature, and not only holds promise for enabling new discoveries in biomaterials, but highlights the growing importance of big data, artificial intelligence, and computational science in chemical engineering.
These computer-assisted innovations are critical to making progress in a range of fields, Deshmukh said. ""There are long-standing scientific problems that can't be solved by existing methods, so solving problems and developing new methods go hand in hand.""






The researchers developed their ""deep-learning"" method to work with what are called ""soft materials.""
In deep learning, artificial intelligence systems are trained to recognize patterns, work on problems, and perform tasks—with or without human supervision. Soft materials can include liquids, polymers, glycomaterials, foams, gels, and most soft biological materials. They are used in a wide range of products and applications, from toothpaste, lubricants, and liquid crystal displays to drug delivery systems and tissue scaffolds. But traditional computational methods of analyzing and predicting their behaviors, especially polymers, have limited utility, hindering progress in their development.
To help break that logjam, the researchers worked with a type of branched, tree-like polymers called ""bottlebrushes."" Their inspiration came from biomolecules, whose different shapes determine their functions. Synthesizing them in the lab could lead to new medical treatments and other industry applications, Deshmukh said. But that can be difficult because the polymers change shape rapidly, depending on temperature and other factors. Without an efficient and accurate way to analyze and predict those changes, creating synthetic versions is difficult.
Their new process uses a well-known deep-learning system called Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, to identify and predict similarities in shape and function in the polymers—something that can't be done without computer assistance.
Applying artificial intelligence to this polymer problem is ""groundbreaking because it shows the potential of deep learning methods in the field of soft materials,"" Deshmukh said. ""So, in principle, if we understand how the shapes are changing, then hopefully we can control them.""
To prove their method would work, Joshi ran 100 unique CNN models, teaching the system to identify bottlebrushes with similar shapes. The project was challenging, not just because it required painstaking work to teach the model what data and features to look for in the polymers, but also because the researchers didn't immediately know what features were relevant. They had to figure that out first.
Developing the models took more than a year, Deshmukh said. ""Singh and Joshi did a fantastic job in identifying the processing of the relevant data and then further refining it to make sure the CNN model gets the right information.""
""Most of the initial brainstorming on what features to use was carried out by Dr. Singh and Dr. Deshmukh, which helped eliminate plenty of unfavorable options,"" Joshi said. ""This helped us zero in on our current methodology, which I used to code and incorporate into our analysis algorithm.""
The results have been very promising, Joshi said, and the team hopes to expand use of the technique into the growing field of glycomaterials—carbohydrate-based soft materials produced by every living organism.






These soft materials contain chains of sugars, called glycans, that play critical roles in health and disease. Of the four building blocks of life—glycans, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids—glycans are the most complex and the most challenging to understand. But CNN could spur progress in this area.
""So, just like we created these bottlebrush structures for synthetic polymers, there are a lot of architectures that can be created using glycomaterials and polymers like these glycans,"" Deshmukh said.
""We plan to help our collaborators design new types of glycomaterials that can be used for biomedical applications,"" Deshmukh said. ""It's really exciting.""
This research also points to the growing importance of data science and machine learning in chemical engineering, department head Steven Wrenn said.
""It's important that our graduates know how to work with data scientists and use computer modeling in their own work,"" Wrenn said. ""This training will make our students much more attractive to employers and graduate programs.""
In fact, the department is working on a new computational and data science track of study, which, if approved, will train undergraduates to apply computer science to chemical engineering. Deshmukh is involved in developing the study track.
""Training a chemical engineer who is going to work in a chemical plant in data science and artificial intelligence makes them a real asset,"" Deshmukh said. ""Because they are going to help solve problems in the chemical industry that can't really be solved using traditional methods.""

Using AI to fly an airplane will be an enormous achievement; the ultimate reflection of AI’s ability to manage complexity. It will be a critical piece to implementing the changes that will be required in the next decade as A&D organisations reassess manufacturing automation in their factories. The recent pandemic, furloughs, bankruptcies and retirements are all impacting productivity and widening the talent gap, forcing the industry to adopt new technology such as AI to reimagine their business.
What is AI and machine learning?
AI, like so many technology buzzwords, can mean different things to different people. For us, an AI system is one that leverages software functions created through a machine learning process rather than through traditional programming. Data, rather than source code, is the critical element. The performance of an AI application is shaped by the data used to train the application.

Without going into detail on machine learning algorithms or approaches, which is beyond the scope of this paper, we can generalise that the power in AI comes from machine learning’s ability to model complex systems and environments far beyond what we can reasonably build in traditional software.

Imagine building a speech recognition system through traditional programming — having a function for every word or a case statement for every pronunciation or accent. It would take a staggering amount of time to cover even 10 percent of the English language. Machine learning models, on the other hand, have made short work of this task, to the point that robust and accurate systems can understand a full vocabulary from hundreds of languages and accents.
Analytical AI vs. operational AI
Today, two distinct classes of AI applications are emerging across industries. The first is analytical AI, as in the type of system that can predict when a machine is going to fail, detect credit card fraud or recommend the next book to buy on Amazon. Operational AI, the second class of AI applications, actually does something in the physical world. It can manage a factory process, fly a plane, drive a vehicle or act on predicted events. It’s artificial intelligence at work.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimized automatically.







Analytical AI is maturing
The development tools and environment for building analytical AI applications are rapidly maturing. Previously, data scientists wrote Python code to enable most algorithms and approaches to machine learning. They did a lot of heavy lifting, extracting from various sources and then transforming the data to ingest into AI algorithms.
We can now address some of the more complex challenges the industry is trying to solve. Where does the industry need to pivot, from a technology point of view, so it can thrive during moments of disruption? We can also see coming technology advancements such as the introduction of more drones and air taxis.
What the industry really needs to do is to scale up the building of complex operational AI systems. We need the self-driving car level of AI across the A&D industry. To do this, we need a different approach to developing AI systems. The scale of data needed to train these complex systems is many orders of magnitude larger than what has been done before. This data must be well-managed through a significantly more complex machine learning system, where AI software is often trained in stages, leveraging data that is synthetically generated at key points. We must also consider the testing and validation environment, since we are talking about building systems that operate complex machinery in the real world.
Operational AI in aerospace and defense: Three use cases
Unlike AI development for analytical use cases, the development of toolchains and methodologies for complex operational AI is only just emerging. We believe that success in any complex operational AI endeavor will be determined most critically by having access to a robust development ecosystem.
Factory automation. Many of the woes in A&D over the past 10 to 15 years have been caused by the inefficient supply chain, which has created cost overruns, delays and even bankruptcies. Many companies are struggling with major supply chain problems, from a lack of control — in both delivery and timeliness — to a lack of quality control. Across the industry, supply chain problems have cost companies tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary costs. In short, the supply chain in the A&D industry has been a major problem.




















Learn about DXC's expertise in the Automotive industry. 





The automotive industry is highly digitised and highly automated from a manufacturing standpoint, because there is a relatively stable and manageable supply chain of 10 or 15 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), along with cooperation and partnerships so everyone can invest in automation. By contrast, the global aerospace industry lacks this level of partnership and, critically, the necessary manufacturing volume to make similar investments. A&D companies depend on a very deep and unwieldy supply chain with almost no automation and very little planning control or quality control.




In terms of delays and quality issues, the root causes are poor manual processes and poor manual planning. Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimised automatically. Automation not only brings conformity and control, but it also brings an automatic improvement in quality that is sorely needed. The answer to automating in A&D lies in using general-purpose robotics, more specifically, cobots (collaborative robots), which are general-purpose humanoid robots that can work among a human population on both factory floors and typical A&D production lines. Cobots introduce automation at a much lower cost because retooling of manufacturing programs is not needed.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimised automatically.







These cobots still need to be programmed, and that’s where AI comes in. Programming traditional automation solutions is an expensive proposition, as each task needs to be custom programmed to fit a particular factory and production line. With AI, programming countless different tasks one by one is not needed. AI plus cobots enable the automation of that operational program and factory at high, low and no scale, and at a dramatically lower cost, so that implementing automation is achievable, given the constraints of the aerospace industry.

Air traffic management. AI is critical for managing the anticipated disruptions in this industry over the next 10 years. One such disruption being watched closely is the pending introduction of drones and air taxis, often known as urban air mobility systems. Thus, the second use case is building an AI air traffic controller. 




















Today, air traffic management is generally managed by people. Based on many projections of this growing industry, in 15 to 20 years there will be 30 times the volume of air traffic flying over a large city such as Los Angeles than there is now. Human beings would be hard-pressed to manage that huge amount of air traffic, and it may be impossible.
But this is not the type of problem where more humans can be added and each person given a smaller slice of the air traffic pie when we consider the amount and type of new air traffic expected to operate, especially at the 0 to 3,000-foot level. Given all this, there is wide consensus that the industry needs AI to manage this exponentially higher level of complexity.

How AI can make fully autonomous driving a reality

 





Fully autonomous vehicles. This third use case is obvious because we are inundated with news about the self-driving car every day. First, being autonomous is different from being unmanned. Drones flying today don’t have pilots sitting in them, but they are still overseen by a pilot from the ground. Such drones have a ground station that has aspects of a cockpit repurposed on a desk, with a human flying the drone remotely.

The future progression from this state is full autonomy, where an AI system is constantly evaluating and reacting to the airspace and making decisions to act in accordance with its mission. The impetus for fully autonomous flight is the same as it is on the ground. A new, generally accepted roadmap has now been published and with autonomy, not only can we imagine a more efficient world, but we can imagine a safer one as well.
Creating complex operational AI systems
To create complex operational AI systems in the A&D industry, very different needs must be met for data management and for algorithm creation and implementation. Very robust simulation is also needed in the testing phase. Above all, there is a strong need for a solution that enables complex operational AI DevOps.
When training an AI system, there are two datasets. First is the historical dataset for the predictive use case containing the instances of what is being predicted. Next comes a testing or validation dataset. In the complex operational world, organisations often investigate neural networks to handle the pattern recognition. Algorithms can be used to automatically build better and better neural networks, based on the performance of the best-performing neural networks from past iterations.
But given the much higher complexity of the environment in which pattern recognition and training are run, higher-level approaches must be considered. For complex operational AI, the various machine learning approaches demand data at a higher scale and management at a greater complexity.




Building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification.







What is needed is a tiered approach to building different datasets. Start with a dataset that is focused on the physics of what you are trying to model; then build a dataset that accounts for the operating environment. After that, extrapolate the data to create a dataset that is orders of magnitude larger.
Algorithms then need to be constructed to create synthetic data to fill into that next-larger phase. Plus, building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification. For example, certifying an airborne system is all about proving it is safe, and complex operational AI DevOps can play a crucial role in providing a robust simulation environment in the testing phase.
Operational AI is not easy, but it is possible
Building complex operational AI systems is no simple task. There are many challenges in managing the development environment and specific workflows. Data management over the full development life cycle is key, as is using the right technology to manipulate, extrapolate and scale data. It is essential to build a system that effectively manages and curates the data that represents the foundational dataset; then integrates, manages and curates the data from that environmental representation dataset; and ultimately provides the platform and simulation for the synthetic extrapolation of that merged dataset into a much, much larger dataset.
It is no easy feat to provide the data hosting, management and curation environment through these data stages that are each so massive in scope. Providing the simulation environment is enormous, because that is the “secret sauce” needed to be able to take that large dataset, combine it and then extrapolate it to ultimately produce a robust algorithm. 
The good news — not only for the A&D industry but for all industries — is that a solution does exist that provides the DevOps environment to make all this come together and work at scale. DXC Robotic Drive Cloud Services on AWS is the first solution that provides a soup-to-nuts development toolchain and management environment for building complex operational AI.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are already transforming the work of lawyers and law firms in many ways and there are enormous opportunities for the future. Let’s discuss how artificial intelligence and machine learning have gradually transformed law firms (both in positive and negative ways) and how they can continue to improve. 
Positive effects of AI and machine learning in law
First, let’s discuss the positive effects of machine learning and AI on the legal industry. 
Automatic reminders
Breaking down legal procedures or duties traditionally handled by legal practitioners and embedding some of those parts in technology is how legal automation is accomplished. The most popular legal automation is complex, high-volume labor and common and repetitive duties, and they’re most common in high-volume data collection, review, repeatable processes, and document generation.
Consider using mail merge technology to address typical form letters or an automated tickler or reminder system to keep track of court dates. However, legal automation’s uses have advanced sophistication, ranging from filtering giant document review sets during litigation to extracting crucial words from agreements in due diligence operations. Lawyers have recently begun automating the creation of legal contracts and key elements in the negotiation process and this is another area of law that can benefit from AI.
Suppose you always set the alarm, a phone call reminder, at 4:00 pm every Tuesday for about two to three months to do a similar thing. A machine-learning smartphone will recognize the pattern and send you reminders automatically. It can help avoid forgetting a weekly task and is an excellent help for lawyers. 
Contract review and analysis in less time
Lawyers have to analyze contracts in bulks and give comments and redlines to advise clients. Imagine a firm with thousands of reviewed contracts, and you need to keep a copy of their financial obligation, renewal, expiration dates, and more. In a law firm, AI can perform such tasks efficiently. 
The procedure for using AI-powered document evaluation is straightforward: The system identifies the required papers, analyses them, and identifies the requested terms and clauses, after which they are ready for review.
Managing the project while evaluating the uploaded documents is crucial for the new technology. This is a hybrid of technological and manual labor. AI-powered document review comprehends papers in various languages, file kinds, and practice areas, assisting in the practical evaluation and categorization of documents, allowing employees to spend more time on quality assurance and legal analysis.
Ease of legal research
Lawyers and legal firms now have unparalleled access to information about lawyers, judges, courts, and damages, to name a few. Data-driven knowledge has replaced anecdotes and personal experience as the primary source of information.advertisement
As a result of all of this, you’ll be able to create an even more effective plan. These AI-powered tools help you comprehend previously ambiguous aspects of your case, such as how frequently your judge grants summary judgment motions or which court is ideal for your client’s case.
Your clients want to know about legal expenses and the tenure of the case, and they want to know what their chances are of a positive outcome. You used to take full advantage of what you had, but now you have more. That same data, those same insights—everything that aids in developing a superior case strategy also aids in providing confidence to your clients. Keeping them informed entails more than simply providing answers; it also entails instilling trust in you and your client’s future.
Thomson Reuters’ legal research product, Westlaw Edge, provides broader coverage of all federal and state courts. Lawyers can compare verdicts by judges, courts, and lawyers to uncover interesting trends, predict case outcomes, analyze IP filings, and research competitors.
Elimination of time-consuming tasksadvertisement
Artificial intelligence and automation can take over up to 23% of a lawyer’s everyday tasks. Many of these activities are routine, paperwork-based duties that divert legal professionals’ attention away from the strategic demands of a case.
E-discovery is the most basic and widely used form of AI in law: checking digital information to collect non-privileged data on a case or claim. Lawyers can use e-discovery software to scan documents based on search terms or parameters like dates or geographic location. This extra time enables lawyers to gather more pertinent information. Like Kira Systems’, AI platforms enable lawyers to detect, retrieve, and evaluate data contained in huge volumes of contracts. This helps to generate contract summary charts for merger and acquisition due diligence.
LawGeex reviews contracts one at a time every day. It includes a list of contract clauses that must be rejected or accepted. When a document is uploaded into the software, the user only needs to select the clauses from the list, and the result tells us which clauses are existing or missing. Since June 2017, JPMorgan has used an AI-powered COIN program to decipher commercial loan agreements. Work that used to take 360,000 lawyer hours is now completed in seconds. The bank intends to use AI technology for other types of legal paperwork in the future.
Case Analysis Research Assistant, or CARA, is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool developed by Casetext that analyzes citations and lists specific suggested cases that are not explicitly cited in the document. Lawyers can use CARA to find relevant agencies in seconds and review cases that opposing counsel is likely to cite. CARA searches legal papers, statutory provisions, viewpoints, and editorials using a proprietary algorithm, allowing the average lawyer to investigate more proficiently without worrying about missing ideal cases.
High-quality work
Innovative software that isn’t tired or confused can produce error-free work. Specialized document software can improve document organization and maintain that organization, including all internal cross-references, throughout the document’s life. Contract comparison tools detect missing clauses, wrong terminology, or ambiguous terms through document comparison and automatic learning, both within a single file and across similar documents.
Automation of lower-level tasks
Automation of specific tasks helps lawyers have free time for client interaction and complex analysis of cases. It helps to increase the efficiency of law firms. Client interaction is an integral part of a lawyer’s profession. Automatic review of documents allows lawyers to discuss important matters with their clients, which helps get a favorable judgment. 
Law firms can use AI-based chatbots to handle their customers’ questions and concerns. These AI-powered chatbots can provide people with preliminary legal advice and assistance in bringing them on board. Chatbots can also buffer law firms and potential clients, collecting information before human engagement. If a client’s case requires legal assistance, these bots will refer them to a lawyer.
Accurate result prediction
Usually, lawyers have to predict the results for their clients to let them decide whether they want to pursue the case or opt for settlement out of court. 
AI developers are developing machine learning models to anticipate the outcomes of pending cases. Although such technologies are still in their infancy, they yield encouraging results. Some companies are developing a tax-law-focused AI-based legal prediction engine. They claim that their AI tool can accurately forecast the outcomes of ongoing cases with a 90% accuracy rate. These kinds of legal AI tools will change how law firms handle cases. Law firms will use such applications to develop litigation tactics, speed up settlement negotiations, and limit the number of cases that go to trial.
Accurate risk assessment
Technology-assisted review tools, such as predictive coding, can help examine data in real-time. This enables lawyers to find potential risks beforehand and prevent legal problems later. When a lawsuit is filed or even threatened, these intelligent solutions enable law firms to identify pertinent information and define the data and custodians that must be safeguarded. With AI, law firms can quickly determine outcomes, reducing costs and risks while defending their clients with more information.
Efficient and accurate background checking
A prominent part of a lawyer’s work is to perform exhaustive and extensive background checks for their clients or about them. These facts need to be evaluated for better decision-making and to support their cases. In law firms, AI can replace this tedious job to a large extent, and it can perform due diligence efficiently and accurately. 
For example, you wrote a memo or brief and then went over it again and again. It’s not the most efficient or cost-effective technique, and you’re unlikely to be able to charge your client for your perfectionism. However, you may now save time and money by reducing unbillable hours while improving your assurance that you haven’t forgotten anything. You can also use tools for studying legal documents powered by artificial intelligence to examine your papers in minute detail. This means you may rest assured that the memo or brief you’re submitting is flawless and that you haven’t overlooked anything.
You have credibility, and your sources and quotations have been checked. That assurance is unrivaled, but being able to verify your opponent’s work product with the same level of care is a close second. Did they misquote a case by accident (or otherwise)? Did they cite any claims that were later overturned? They may not have noticed, but you did. And it’s all because of AI, which has become the gold standard in law and legal research.
Reduced stress of legal professionals
Lawyers have to deal with multiple clients, review documents, do legal research, proofread, etc. It’s a pretty tedious job. The software helps to do the essential work so that lawyers can focus on creative analysis. It improves attorney work satisfaction. 
Tools help to complete tasks fast and accurately, and it also helps to save time and reduce the stress of lawyers. For example, accurate scheduling of major tasks is a huge help in completing them on time. If you’re the type of person who forgets things even when you write them down, you might benefit from using tools like email calendars. These calendars can send you notifications when events or deadlines are approaching. Furthermore, applications such as OneNote and Todoist can assist you in tracking your task completion progress.
Few things are more stressful or bewildering than forgetting a task until the last minute or missing a deadline. Thank heavens, there are apps to assist in dealing with it. RescueTime and Remember the Milk, for example, were created to remind users of important deadlines and motivate them to be more productive.
If technology continues to grow at the current rate, automation will quickly become a part of a lawyer’s daily routine. Although some may be concerned about this change, it provides a welcome relief from stress and fatigue. Apps like Case Text, for example, can help accelerate the legal research process. Billing is a time-consuming task, but apps like AllocateLegal, BillerAssist, and SmokeBall significantly reduce the time required to complete the process manually.
Remote work facility
Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck our lives, especially during the lockdown, almost every organization started working remotely. Law firms are no exception. The pandemic has forced the legal industry to change court practices and run fully digital, and AI has helped lawyers perform their jobs remotely. Today, the professionals in a firm can access documents from their homes and arrange a video meeting to analyze and decide on a case. 
According to the Legal Industry Report 2021: Lessons Learned from the pandemic, law firms have become more productive and efficient using new technology.  According to the survey, 82% of law firms reported that their businesses had fully reopened, and 77% of firms had no plans to reopen.
In terms of continued remote work, 53 percent of the participants said their firms would give the remote working option to lawyers and law firm staff once the offices reopened, and 70 percent said they would opt for the hybrid option once the offices reopened. As a direct result of the pandemic, nearly half (46 percent) of respondents said their companies invested in remote working software. This makes sense given that remote working tools were frequently the only way to get work done due to social distancing requirements.
Due to the pandemic, the most popular remote-working tools firms invested in were video conferencing tools, e-signature, law practice management software, time and billing software, and communication software. Law firms have used the following tools and strategies to get their job done. 
Virtual receptionists can answer client calls, but they can also do many other things:

Online client payments – make it simple for the customers to pay with a credit card. 
Practice management software – helps law firms use cloud computing with a multifaceted solution to manage and grow their firm!
Outsource time-consuming tasks – use the time and talent of freelance lawyers to collaborate virtually to complete more work.

In the future, artificial intelligence could be utilized in the following areas:
Mergers and acquisitions
Get a single platform for the entire due diligence process, including reporting and documentation. Find clauses in multiple documents and get project management and reporting assistance.
Legal procedures
In a matter of seconds, combine your search terms with artificial intelligence to receive a quick overview. Optimize your search by determining which groups of papers you should examine to locate the needle in the haystack.
Reorganization of the group
Locate contracts that need to be renegotiated and moved without needing to be renegotiated.
Real estate investments
Data should be extracted and compared across leases. Get a quick summary of the contracts’ deadlines and differences.
The benefits of AI-assisted document review

From the beginning, this process generates a quick and thorough overview of the data volume.
It saves time reviewing vast amounts of data and uses resources wisely throughout the process.
Provides a high-level perspective of the process.

Adverse effects in law firms of AI and machine learning
Artificial intelligence and machine learning do not always have positive effects. Law firms may also see the negative consequences of implementing AI discussed below. 
Professionals may experience unemployment 
One of the significant disadvantages of AI is replacing manual work. As a result, professionals associated with law firms can experience unemployment. According to Deloitte, about 100,000 legal-related jobs can be automated by 2036.  According to recent Deloitte Insight research, “technology has already led to a loss of 31,000 positions in the legal sector, but there has been an overall rise of around 80,000 jobs, the majority of which are higher qualified and better compensated,” in the legal field specifically.
At first appearance, “job loss” appears to be negative. However, it is an obvious advantage when the removed jobs cause a significant turnover and poor job satisfaction. This allows for the development of higher-skilled professions and increases employee value in ways that would be impossible to achieve without AI taking on some of the responsibilities.
Only big law firms can afford AI
Relatively smaller firms may not have the financial strength to adopt the new technology. Therefore, those law firms that can afford AI can become richer while others cannot. 
A solo law practitioner can purchase a digital or AI assistant for around $200 to manage work. A small firm will spend approximately $30,000 on software to manage time-consuming legal tasks such as workflow management and contract review. And if lawyers need a system that can handle 500 users, they are looking at $250,000, to begin with. There is then the cost of tech support after the initial setup.
Machines cannot be trustworthy
Minor damage to the machine or software can create a huge mess. Though AI could hypothetically be without error, there’s still no guarantee of a device or software being error-free. In the case of law firms, the potential damage could create havoc. The company has to bear the cost of installation in such a scenario. There are no rules or regulations to monitor AI tools. Plus, AI can’t listen, empathize, advocate, or understand politics. 
Vulnerable to cyber threats
Another cause for anxiety is privacy and cybersecurity, which is understandable. According to recent research conducted by a malpractice insurer, cyberattacks affected 22% of legal firms. The victims were more well-known figures in the industry than you might anticipate, but smaller businesses are not immune. According to the American Bar Association, this proportion was 35 percent among legal companies with 10 to 49 practitioners, implying that more than a third of small law businesses had been hacked.
Rather than being a liability, AI, according to CSO, adds to the fight against the continual threat of cyberattacks. AI technology incorporates self-learning algorithms that allow it to better recognize and foresee possible risks in ways that humans cannot.
What should law firms consider before using AI? 
Although legal automation has the potential to accomplish great things, it will take quite a bit of work to implement these technologies successfully: You’ll still need a “lawyer brain” to build different automation systems to execute particular things with automation. You may make several mistakes if the instructions at the time of configuration are incorrect. Waste goes in, and garbage goes out. Furthermore, as the law changes, some algorithms need to be changed. You can’t rely on a five-year-old legal opinion, and you certainly can’t rely on a five-year-old automated procedure.
As a result, you’ll need buy-in from those whose input you want to record through technology. This will necessitate knowledge and time. Most of the time, “translators” will be required between the legal brain and the legal technologists who integrate the software processes. Organizations must also have a firm grasp on their current procedures. If you automate a duplicative or defective process, you will be making multiple errors.
Perhaps most crucially, start with a change management strategy. What will be the method of presenting the technology to lawyers and clients? How will you motivate and encourage adoption both internally and externally? How will AI technology work with the existing systems and processes of the lawyer or law firm? What AIs will you use to track how the technology is being used?
To end this article, I would like to mention that more and more legal roles are being automated and replaced by artificial intelligence systems. Law firms have no choice but to accept this new technology. However, some people believe that manual reviewing is more accurate and better for lawyers. But, artificial intelligence systems can do work in much less time, and thus it is favorable when the main concern is performing a job in as little time as possible. Sound machines and software can perform a task accurately and fast. 
Through AI deployment, lawyers can have adequate time and patience to counsel their clients and improve their work. It can be said that deploying AI in law firms can provide positive momentum for the law firm, thus helping lawyers to work efficiently.

Employees are quitting jobs at record rates and companies are having a hard time luring them back. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that employees are now frequently working from home, making it harder for managers to identify employees who are unhappy. Plus, getting new hires up to speed is more challenging when they can’t attend in-person training sessions or shadow experienced employees.
To solve all these issues, companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence. But there’s a limit to how much AI can do.
Using AI to gauge employee sentiment
The “Great Resignation” has been no exaggeration. The number of people quitting their jobs has been unprecedented throughout the pandemic, hitting a record high of 48 million people in 2020, up from 42 million in 2019, which was the previous record high.
 
 
 













 
 

Unsustainable work performance expectations, a lack of career development and advancement potential, and a lack of meaningful work are among the top reasons motivating employees to move on, according to a March McKinsey survey, with inadequate compensation further down on the list, in sixth place. The No. 1 reason why people quit their jobs? Uncaring leaders.

The problem is that it can be hard to notice that employees are struggling when they’re suddenly all working remotely.
“I’m an old-school person and I do believe that there’s no substitute for managing by walking around,” says Bill Nowacki, decision science lead at KPMG. “I don’t think there’s a substitute for good managers knowing that your daughter had a soccer match last week.”
 
 
 













 
 

But employers big and small have had to adapt, he says, and some are finding that remote and hybrid work offers significant advantages.
“This work from home thing is pretty cool and they’re going to embrace it,” he says. “But we will, then, by definition, take away the ability to manage by working around. When I have a team scattered all over the world, I really can’t intimately understand their comings and goings or whether they’re tired or not.”
To fill this gap, some companies are turning to employee surveys aimed at gauging how workers are feeling. More recently, they’ve been exploring the use of interactive chatbots to check the pulse of employee sentiment at work.
 
 
 













 
 

KPMG, for example, built its first interactive chatbot in 2016. It saw some limited adoption at first, but interest waned quickly. “Then literally this week, I had four calls on this,” Nowacki says. “People are starting to wake to it.”

Nowacki says the technology has grown since then. There’s a lot of information that can be gathered about what employees are doing, such as when they log in to their work systems, when they make their phone calls, and how much time they have between meetings. “All this data is there,” he says.
To make it feel less like creepy micromanaging and more like helpful attention, Nowacki suggests allowing workers to opt into the system. Employees can then understand what the company is looking at. “We can spot you burning out before you notice you’re burning out. When you present it that way, that we’re looking out for your health, they opt in,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

KPMG calculates a score for an employee’s risk of attrition, tries to identify a reason for that, and then suggests a remediation. “With back-testing and cross-validation, we found that we’ve consistently been able to predict two-thirds of people about to resign, and save 10% to 20% of the ones we identified,” he says.
Not every company will be able to use AI to predict attrition, however.
“Like any AI application, the ability to predict turnover is entirely dependent on historic data,” says Jonathan Reilly, COO and co-founder at Akkio, a no-code AI company.
 
 
 













 
 

Typically, this means that only large organizations can use the technology. But eventually, it’s likely that this kind of technology will be core functionality in enterprise HR platforms, Reilly says. “Most business platforms will be run on AI in the next five years.”
Employing AI to tackle attrition
One company that’s been investing in AI-powered chatbots and other tools to help reduce attrition is global professional services firm Genpact, which has more than 100,000 employees. Its chatbot, called Amber, asks employees relevant questions at crucial milestones with the company.
“The results enable HR leaders and C-suite executives to proactively help employees who are unhappy,” says Sanjay Srivastava, Genpact’ chief digital officer.
 
 
 













 
 

Previously, Genpact used surveys, he says. But the AI tool can help measure employee moods. The positive mood score is now a key indicator, he says. “We take action when there’s a decline in positive mood.”
And by ensuring employees get additional support when they need it, he says,  overall positive mood scores have increased as a result.
“Amber was especially crucial during the pandemic, when the company shifted to more remote work,” Srivastava says. According to Genpact, 66% of their employees used the Amber chatbot in 2021, and of those who did, 84% reported a positive mood.
 
 
 













 
 

“Employees who do not engage in Amber chats leave at a rate of two times more than those that do,” Srivastava notes. “The results have been well beyond what you would expect.”

The company also uses AI to monitor employee messages for indicators that an employee is about to quit. By analyzing messaging metadata, “not the messages themselves,” he says, “we can now statistically prove that certain types of communication behavior directly correlate to business performance.”
The analysis can help identify rock star employees so that the company can take extra steps to keep them motivated, he says. And it can identify attrition risks, enabling leadership to discuss retention strategies, or put succession plans in place before the employees actually leave.
 
 
 













 
 

Onboarding new hires faster with AI
Genpact is also speeding up the onboarding process for new hires using AI, says Srivastava. The company has transformed its new hire experience by digitizing the entire onboarding experience, which provides personalized experiential journeys, accompanied by experience and emotions mapping at each touchpoint.
Other companies are using AI to help train new employees more effectively, which has been increasingly important with the transition to a work-from-home workforce. And by offering additional training opportunities, companies also help bolster employee retention, says Jonathan Parnell, senior consultant for cloud and data center transformation at technology consultancy Insight.
“People feel that you actually care, that they’re investing in your future,” he says. “A lot of the problems in the labor shortage are caused by the companies not investing in the current workforce.”
 
 
 













 
 

AI-powered training solutions provide the most business value when targeting roles in which employees work within very specific parameters — and where there is a lot of turnover. Customer call centers are a perfect example.
Andy Thurai, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, has recently worked with a mid-to-large global retailer that found it hard to manage turnover in their call centers when the pandemic started.
Prior to the pandemic, new hires would read documentation, watch videos, and then sit in a classroom. “They were set up to hire and train people physically, locally in the call center area,” he says. “It required a physical presence, face-to-face, to come to one place to learn. When everything went virtual, they were hiring someone without seeing them, and trying to coach them virtually to come to speed.”
 
 
 













 
 

Typically, in a call center, managers are walking around the floor, watching how employees are doing, ready to step in and help if there are problems. “When you go virtual, that can’t happen,” Thurai says.
The company wound up building a solution based on pieces from several different vendors, including natural language processing, intelligent decision making, coaching systems, and conversational AIs. It took between six months to a year before it was working well enough to meet their needs, he says. “And they’re still building it. With AI systems, things are never perfect.”

The company started by using old customer cases for the training program, enabling employees to try to come up with their own solutions, and then evolved to simulating new support cases that hadn’t come up in the past.
 
 
 













 
 

There’s also the beginning of a system that would search a knowledge base of past cases to suggest possible solutions to new hires while they were on calls. “It’s not perfect yet,” says Thurai. “But it can point you to the location where you might want to look.”
Recently, the retailer added functionality to automatically listen to ongoing phone calls and flag them for supervisors if it sounds like things are going wrong.
Next, the company plans to improve the knowledge base so that it will automatically come up with solutions, and to offer one-button automations so that employees can click a button to have the system take over tasks they currently have to do manually, such as issuing refunds or sending letters.
 
 
 













 
 

Enter the era of augmented human resources
Using AI for training, as well as for retention, recruitment, and other HR tasks is what IDC calls “augmented human resources.”

Spending on augmented human resources grew at just over 30% last year to nearly $3 billion, and is expected to reach $6.3 billion in 2025.
And employees are increasingly warming to the idea. According to a 2021 survey by Workplace Intelligence and Oracle, 82% of more than 14,000 employees and managers from around the world said they believe robots can support their careers better than humans can.
Meanwhile, 85% said that they weren’t satisfied with the career support they were currently getting from their companies, and 87% said that companies should do more to listen to their needs.
 
 
 













 
 

In addition, 55% said they would be more likely to stay with a company that uses AI to support career growth. Some examples of this include identifying what skills they need to develop and recommending ways to learn new skills.
According to a report released by Eightfold AI last March, more than 50% of companies are already using some AI-related tools to improve HR, such as for evaluating potential job candidates and matching them to best roles, or using chatbots to answer common questions, map to employee career paths, or to upskill or reskill employees.
Moreover, 82% of HR managers queried for the survey said their companies will be increasing their use of AI tools for talent management over the next five years.
Some problems may be too big for AI to fix
According to research published in the Harvard Business Review, a toxic company culture is the single biggest predictor of attribution, followed by job security and reorganization.
An HR chatbot, no matter how intelligent, isn’t likely to do much to address these issues. In fact, AI is really a force multiplier. Using AI in a toxic workplace might make the toxicity even worse.
For example, if management’s solution to the turnover problem is to harangue employees into staying, then an AI system that monitors employee communications for signs of stress can put targets on these vulnerable populations, making them feel even more bullied and undervalued.
Similarly, some companies try to use AI as part of their onboarding process to make up for the lack of disciplined document structures, says Insight’s Parnell. “If your onboarding is that complicated then your business is not sound,” he says. “Why do you have to build all this crazy AI for onboarding? Don’t you know how your business runs? Why do you have to build an AI just to ask how someone is doing?”
There’s only so much that AI can do to fix fundamental business problems, he adds. “How much Febreeze can you buy so you never have to wash your clothes again? At some point, you just have to wash your clothes. You have to do the work. You have to organize an efficient business. AI doesn’t solve a problem all by itself. Yes, AI can help, but you still have to get things in place for the AI to be successful.”

At the time, OpenAI said it would continue to build on the system while examining potential dangers like bias in image generation or the production of misinformation. It’s attempting to address those issues using technical safeguards and a new content policy while also reducing its computing load and pushing forward the basic capabilities of the model.A DALL-E 2 result for “Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck.”One of the new DALL-E 2 features, inpainting, applies DALL-E’s text-to-image capabilities on a more granular level. Users can start with an existing picture, select an area, and tell the model to edit it. You can block out a painting on a living room wall and replace it with a different picture, for instance, or add a vase of flowers on a coffee table. The model can fill (or remove) objects while accounting for details like the directions of shadows in a room. Another feature, variations, is sort of like an image search tool for pictures that don’t exist. Users can upload a starting image and then create a range of variations similar to it. They can also blend two images, generating pictures that have elements of both. The generated images are 1,024 x 1,024 pixels, a leap over the 256 x 256 pixels the original model delivered.DALL-E 2 builds on CLIP, a computer vision system that OpenAI also announced last year. “DALL-E 1 just took our GPT-3 approach from language and applied it to produce an image: we compressed images into a series of words and we just learned to predict what comes next,” says OpenAI research scientist Prafulla Dhariwal, referring to the GPT model used by many text AI apps. But the word-matching didn’t necessarily capture the qualities humans found most important, and the predictive process limited the realism of the images. CLIP was designed to look at images and summarize their contents the way a human would, and OpenAI iterated on this process to create “unCLIP” — an inverted version that starts with the description and works its way toward an image. DALL-E 2 generates the image using a process called diffusion, which Dhariwal describes as starting with a “bag of dots” and then filling in a pattern with greater and greater detail.An existing image of a room with a flamingo added in one corner.Interestingly, a draft paper on unCLIP says it’s partly resistant to a very funny weakness of CLIP: the fact that people can fool the model’s identification capabilities by labeling one object (like a Granny Smith apple) with a word indicating something else (like an iPod). The variations tool, the authors say, “still generates pictures of apples with high probability” even when using a mislabeled picture that CLIP can’t identify as a Granny Smith. Conversely, “the model never produces pictures of iPods, despite the very high relative predicted probability of this caption.”DALL-E’s full model was never released publicly, but other developers have honed their own tools that imitate some of its functions over the past year. One of the most popular mainstream applications is Wombo’s Dream mobile app, which generates pictures of whatever users describe in a variety of art styles.

CHICAGO – The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) announces the publication of ""The Rise of AI: Implications and Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Academic Libraries,"" book number 78 in the Publications in Librarianship series, edited by Sandy Hervieux and Amanda Wheatley. This book collects projects, collaborations, and future uses from academic librarians who have begun to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) in their work.
Librarians are uniquely positioned to rise to the challenge that AI presents to the field. Libraries and their like have existed for millennia; they progress with society, altering and adapting their services to meet the information needs of their communities.
In three parts — User Services, Collections and Discovery, and Toward Future Applications — ""The Rise of AI"" explores: 

machine translation
creating incubation spaces
robotics
combining information literacy initiatives with AI literacy
fostering partnerships with other on-campus groups
integrating AI technology into collections to enhance discoverability
using AI to refine metadata for images, articles, and theses
machine learning 

Chapters introduce implications and applications of artificial intelligence in academic libraries and hopes to provoke conversations and inspire new ways of engaging with the technology. As the discussion surrounding ethics, bias, and privacy in AI continues to grow, librarians will be called to make informed decisions and position themselves as leaders in this discourse.
“The Rise of AI: Implications and Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Academic Libraries” is available for purchase in print and as an ebook through the ALA Online Store; in print through Amazon.com; and by telephone order at (866) 746-7252 in the U.S. or (770) 442-8633 for international customers.

Digital technologies, devices and the internet are producing huge amounts of data and greater capacity to store it, and those developments are likely to accelerate. For law enforcement, a critical capability lagging behind the pace of innovation is the ability and capacity to screen, analyse and render insights from the ever-increasing volume of data—and to do so in accordance with the constraints on access to and use of personal information within a democratic system.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are presenting valuable tools to the public and private sectors for screening big and live data. AI is also commonly considered and marketed as a solution that removes human bias, although AI algorithms and dataset creation can also perpetuate human bias and so aren’t value- or error-free.
In light of the many and varied solutions AI offers, the Australian government is building the necessary policy and regulatory frameworks to pursue the goal of positioning Australia as a ‘global leader in AI’. Recent initiatives include an AI action plan launched in 2021 as part of the digital economy strategy, the CSIRO’s 2019 AI roadmap, and the voluntary artificial intelligence ethics framework, which includes eight principles necessary for AI to be safe and democratically legitimate. In addition, more than $100 million in investment has been pledged to develop the expertise and capabilities of an Australian AI workforce and to establish private–public partnerships to develop AI solutions to national challenges.
AI is being broadly conceptualised by the federal government and many private companies as an exciting technological solution to ‘strengthen the economy and improve the quality of life of all Australians’ by inevitably ‘reshap[ing] virtually every industry, profession and life’. There’s some truth there, but how that reshaping occurs depends on choices, including, for policing, about how data and insights are used and how direct human judgements and relationships can be informed by those technologies, not discounted and disempowered.
In a new ASPI report, released today, I explore some of the limitations on the use of AI in policing and law enforcement scenarios, possible strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of AI data insights and decision-making in the justice system, and implications for regulation of AI use by police and law enforcement in Australia.
It is problematic, to say the least, that the ethics framework designed to ‘ensure AI is safe, secure and reliable’ is entirely voluntary for both the public and private sectors. And it is not supported by any actual laws specifically addressing the use of AI or other emerging technologies, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
For policing agencies, AI is considered a force-multiplier not only because it can process more data than human brains can conceivably do within required time frames, but also because it can yield insights to complement the efforts of human teams to solve complex analytical problems.
There are many different types and purposes for AI currently under consideration, in trial or in use in various areas of policing globally. Examples include risk assessment of recidivism used to inform parole decisions or to prompt pre-emptive, deterrent police visits to offenders’ homes; public safety video and image analysis, using facial recognition to identify people of interest or to decipher low-quality images; and forensic DNA testing.
AI algorithms, or models, promise to enable processing of high volumes of data at speed while identifying patterns; supercharge knowledge management while (supposedly) removing human bias from the process (we now know that AI can in fact learn and act on human bias); and operate with ethical principles coded into their decision-making.
This promise, however, is not a guarantee.
Holding AI to the ‘safe, secure and reliable’ standard in the Australian ethics framework requires the ability and functionality to comprehensively know and understand how algorithms make decisions and how ethical decision frameworks are coded into an algorithm and its development and training on historical and live datasets.
In fact, there are significant barriers from both a technical and implementation standpoint (for example, the market disincentive of sharing the finer details of how a proprietary AI product works) to achieving these aims.
It’s broadly understood that human bias can compromise both police outcomes (reducing and preventing crime, the successful prosecution of perpetrators of crime, and justice for victims of crime) and the trust from communities that enables effective policing. This can make AI seem a solution; however, if it’s adopted without knowledge of its limitations and potential errors, it has the potential to create more and compounding problems for police.
While researchers are fond of analysing ‘human bias’ in systems, the humanity of individuals also really matters for how they do their work and engage with their communities. It’s a strength of the community policing function, not something to be edited out by technology, no matter how powerful and large the datasets may be. This insight can help shape how policing works with AI and other new technologies, and how human analysts can prevent coded human bias from running unchecked in AI systems.
We can be certain that AI is here to stay. Appropriate regulation of its use in law enforcement scenarios is imperative to mitigate the significant potential impacts on justice outcomes and civil liberties. If Australia wants to ensure AI is safe, secure and reliable, we need at the very least an ethics framework that is compulsory and legally enforceable.

The difficulty in identifying an object using satellite video was highlighted in 2020 when Chinese space authorities released a video clip captured by Jilin-1, a small satellite, from an altitude of over 500km (310 miles) while chasing a cruising fighter jet.

The stealth aircraft, which appeared to be an F-22 according to some military experts, was nearly 20 metres (65 feet) long. With a smaller object, the commercial satellite’s camera, offering about 1-metre resolution, would generate just a few pixels of the target.
With fewer details in the image, it is more difficult to identify an object. And because each frame of the satellite video covered more than 10 square kilometres, a small target such as a car could blend into the surrounding environment or be confused with other vehicles, making it nearly impossible to track its movement from orbit.
A Chinese team said its new AI technology had achieved 95 per cent precision in locating an object when the Jilin-1 satellite streamed video of various moving small targets, including planes in the air and cars on the street.
Chinese satellite research grabs hi-res images of US city in seconds
Its success rate was nearly seven times higher than existing technology, according to Lin Cunbao of the People’s Liberation Army’s Space Engineering University in Beijing and his research colleagues in a paper published late last month in Fire Control and Command Control, a domestic peer-reviewed journal run by China’s state-owned defence industry.
Jilin-1, launched in 2015, was China’s first Earth observation satellite for commercial use. Unlike traditional spy satellites which carry a large telescope, the Jilin-1 weighed less than 100kg (220 pounds).
It circles the Earth at a relatively low altitude, achieving higher resolution but is only able to stay over a region for a short period.
Since the first Jilin satellite was launched, nearly 40 more in the family have joined it to form a global surveillance network that can detect a wide spectrum of signals, from visible light to heat signatures occurring at almost any time, anywhere.
Lin said most commercial satellites could not chase a small moving target because of technical limits.


The resolution of a satellite video stream – which usually records about 15 frames per second – is considerably lower than a still photograph captured by the same camera. The high speed of the satellite means almost everything in the video, including buildings and their shadows, are on the move as well, making traditional software designed to detect motion against a fixed background less effective.
Added to the complexity, is the ability of vehicles on the ground to stop suddenly, make a sharp turn or go under a bridge or through a tunnel. Even a thoroughly trained AI machine could lose the target when part or all of an object vanishes, according to the researchers.

Traditionally, the AI assumed it had made a mistake after losing the target and feeding the negative information into the learning process that would quickly reduce its overall performance.
Lin’s team said they had built a more confident AI based on a traditional machine learning algorithm that, before the team’s enhancements, had achieved only about 14 per cent success in analysing satellite video.
In the new iteration, when the target was temporarily obscured, the machine would not immediately question its own judgment. Instead, it would estimate the target’s possible location based on past experience and continue tracking along a course it assumed the target was most likely to take.


In most circumstances, the AI could recapture the target as soon as it reappeared, according to Lin’s study.
“It has done the job very well,” the paper said, adding that the AI would work even better from space.
At present, video data from the satellite must be transmitted to a ground station or communication relay satellite nearby and processed by a computer with a powerful processor, creating a potentially significant time delay if the target is on the other side of the planet.
Some new Earth observation satellites launched by China in recent years have been equipped with processors that could be uploaded with the latest AI algorithm to automatically identify and track moving targets in real time without any ground assistance, according to researchers involved in these projects.
Chinese project aims to give smartphone users access to cameras in space
China’s space-based high speed communication network could stream the tracking video to an end user’s smartphone in minutes, or even seconds.
The service, currently available only in the war rooms of some of the most powerful countries, will be available to everyone in the near future, according to the Chinese researchers.

Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], April 7 (ANI/NewsVoir): Jobaskit.com, a tech startup offering smart recruitment solutions, is winning accolades for its disruptive Software as a Service solution that uses Collaborative Intelligence (CI), involving a combination of both human and artificial intelligence, to help organisations find recruitable candidates. The patent-pending CI-based screening and filtering solution creates databases with a 10x higher composition of recruitable talent, compared to that of traditional online job portals which rely only on automation.

The startup has won an award at the Internet 2.0 Conference (www.internet2conf.com), an international tech forum held at Dubai in March this year, under the category of Innovative Product. During the same month, Jobaskit has been recognized with the Business Leadership Award under the Promising Startup category from the Indian Achievers Forum (iafindia.com), and Excellence in Recruitment award from Enantra, south India’s biggest entrepreneurship festival, an initiative of Anna University’s Centre for Entrepreneurship Development.

Talking about this first-of-its-kind solution, Ashokk Remi John, Founder and CEO, Jobaskit, said, “There has been a higher rate of adoption of Artificial Intelligence in recruitment processes across the world. However, AI has its own limitations. It works based primarily on keywords. People can easily game the system and come across as eligible candidates for jobs posted online. However, CI is all about using both AI and human intelligence to identify right candidates. At Jobaskit, we go not only by the information supplied by the candidates but also process the endorsements and opinions of their past employers and teachers. This two-layer mechanism helps us provide organisations with a high-quality recruitable pool. Our services also eliminate the scope for job scams as the jobs are published by the companies are visible on their corporate websites through Jobaskit smart career page.” Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 25:43Loaded: 2.31%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -25:43 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The company takes the responsibility of maintaining the career section of the official website of organisations with updated information, and of responding to applicants. The job applications, irrespective of their source, are processed using CI at the Jobaskit tech platform in the backend. 
Jobaskit’s is a recruiter-friendly platform, unlike that of traditional online portals that focus more on employees. The company also does not sell the database of job seekers to employees. It collects an annual subscription fee, after the completion of a limited trial period. Its core services of offering fool-proof filtering solutions targets organisations of all sizes. Jobaskit publishes jobs on its portal; powers career pages of corporate websites; connects hirers with academic campuses; conducts aptitude assessments online, and provides unlimited access to databases all at highly flexible and competitive rates. 
The company does not charge candidates for listing their resumes or processing their applications. It enables job seekers to get employer recommendations; know the strength of companies before applying; understand the profile match with the culture of organisations, and stand out in the job market by presenting the recommendations of past employers and teachers. They can also restrict the companies to invite for jobs. The company is planning to come up with exclusive solutions for students campus placements.

Performing arts union Equity is launching a campaign around performers’ rights over artificial intelligence (AI).
They hope to persuade the U.K. government to introduce laws that will prevent companies using AI performance synthetisation – based on real performers’ voices and likeness – without their permission.
As the U.K. law currently stands, performers’ rights extend to being able to give consent to the making of a recording of a performance and the right to control use of the recordings and any copies.
However, AI technology falls outside the scope of these protections because it “reproduces performances without generating a ‘recording’ or a ‘copy,'” according to the union. In addition, in a survey of 430 Equity members, 79% of those who have undertaken AI work said they didn’t feel they had a “full understanding” of their rights before signing their contracts.

Meanwhile 93% of audio artists responding to the survey said they were worried AI posed a threat to employment opportunities. According to Equity, AI is increasingly being used in the audio and audio-visual sector, from audiobooks to digital avatars.

Equity’s new campaign, which is titled Stop AI Stealing the Show, is backed by actor Talulah Riley (“St Trinian’s”), politician Lord Clement-Jones, who is co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence, and Canadian voiceover artist Bev Standing.
Standing won a settlement after she sued TikTok, saying the company had used her voice for their text-to-speech feature without her permission based on recordings she had provided for another company years earlier.
“In 2018, I was hired to do a text-to-speech job for a translation app,” said Standing. “But in 2020 these recordings were used for the first ever English text-to-speech voice on TikTok, who was not my client. The fear of coming up against a multibillion-dollar company was a little overwhelming but it came down to the fact that it was just wrong and I had to stand up for myself – my voice files were copyrighted and I owned them, so TikTok didn’t have permission to use them.” 
“After talking to a lawyer, a complaint was filed,” she continued. “We came to a very amicable agreement with TikTok last year and they settled. As a voice actor, I feel it’s a smart business decision to understand AI and get involved in it, and I now only work with companies where I have control over where my voice gets licensed. AI is here to stay – it’s not going away.”
 








Equity also warned that artists providing their voice and likeness for AI work were “not being compensated fairly” or sometimes at all and that performers are often asked to sign NDAs which obscures the nature of the job. 
“The explosion of artificial intelligence across the entertainment industry is a significant and growing concern for audio artists and other performers,” said Paul W Fleming, Equity’s general secretary. “We are working hard to protect our members as bosses try to increase profits by replacing skilled professionals with AI systems; but without Government action to modernise U.K. law we could see dystopian consequences for performers and permanent damage to our world leading industry. Workers everywhere need action on AI – from checkout tills to feature films, from call centres to videogames – to ensure this new technology enhances their working lives, and not just the bosses’ bottom line.”
Talulah Riley, a member of Equity, added: “Advances in AI technology are coming at us fast and it is important that those of us in the entertainment industry are aware of the possible changes to our livelihood. As a performer, it is vital that my voice and my image are my own, no matter how easily and cheaply those things can be digitally replicated. I believe that performers must be rewarded fairly for the content we create.”

Artificial Intelligence Approach Helps Identify Type 2 Diabetes Risk


A new artificial intelligence method used various factors, including pancreas health and fat levels, to determine patients at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) model that analyzed various factors relating to pancreas health and fat levels using non-contrast abdominal CT images to detect type 2 diabetes risk.







The study, which was published in Radiology, evaluated 8,992 patients, of which 572 had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 1,880 had dysglycemia. All patient screenings occurred between 2004 and 2016.
To build the model researchers used 471 images obtained from various datasets. They divided the photos into three categories: 424 for training, 8 for validation, and 39 for test sets.
The researchers used a variety of measurements when analyzing images. These measurements included CT attenuation, pancreatic volume, intrapancreatic fat percentage, and three-dimensional fractal dimension.
Other analyzed features included visceral fat levels and density and volumes of neighboring muscles and organs.
Results showed that low pancreas density and high visceral fat correlated with diabetes prevalence.
The consistent and accurate results displayed by the AI model indicated that fully automated analyses of abdominal CT biomarkers are a reliable approach to predicting and diagnosing diabetes.
Further, researchers hope to continue implementing multivariable analyses in diagnosing type 2 diabetes.
“This study is a step towards the wider use of automated methods to address clinical challenges,” said study authors Ronald M. Summers, MD, PhD, and Hima Tallam, an MD and PhD student, in a press release. “It may also inform future work investigating the reason for pancreatic changes that occur in patients with diabetes.” Summers and Tallam work and study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, respectively. 
The authors did note various limitations of the research, including difficulty segmenting images, and the exclusion of clinical factors such as race, family history, or blood lipid level from the final model.
Increasingly, predictive analytics methods are being used in clinical diagnoses.
For example, a predictive analytics method developed in August 2020 used a calculator to help clinicians foresee a stroke. Specifically, the tool used information regarding the metabolic system, including blood pressure and cholesterol.
Another study published in Nature Communications described how an early-warning system monitored infectious diseases. The study involved 3,000 providers who reported data on influenza-like illnesses to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weekly. With this data, the researchers created a forecasting model that intended to provide early warnings regarding patients at risk for stroke.
But as predictive analytics use in healthcare evolves, researchers are taking steps to enhance these methods.
Research published in the Journal of Social Computing in June 2021 described how predictive analytics could best succeed when assisted by both AI and humans, as AI works well when handling big data, and humans are better at handling thick data.

This article is part of our Artificial Intelligence Insights Series, written by McCarthy Tétrault’s multidisciplinary Cyber/Data team. This series brings you practical and integrative perspectives on the ways in which AI is transforming industries, and how you can stay ahead of the curve.

The tech world trend of artificial intelligence (“AI”) is becoming increasingly prevalent in employment matters. For example, employers are using AI to attract candidates, evaluate job performance and automate certain positions; however, there are controversies over the use of AI, including it resulting in the continuation of patterns of bias and discrimination in employment-related decision making and the potential of compromising privacy rights.
The area that has received much of the attention in recent years is the use of AI during the recruitment and hiring process. In a typical recruit cycle, one may encounter AI at multiple stages:

Creating Job Descriptions: Augmented writing platforms can analyze databanks of job postings and internal demographics to suggest alternative language, with the goal of appealing to a greater proportion of the target audience of the hiring employer.
Searching for Candidates: AI drives targeted advertising and can be effective in attracting suitable candidates to job postings they may otherwise have overlooked. For active job seekers, previous online activity will lead algorithms to push similar content. AI on platforms like LinkedIn can even target passive job seekers – individuals who are not consciously looking for a new position but would be open to opportunities – by analyzing their profile, recommending suitable job postings and encouraging certain connections. There are also new platforms using AI to make the job search more inclusive; for example, the Ontario Disability Employment Network’s new division, Jobs Ability Canada, assists individuals with disabilities to create profiles that are then intelligently matched to job postings harvested directly from the websites of companies subscribed to the platform.
Screening: AI may dramatically reduce the time needed to sort through resumes and applications. Many companies use keyword-matching programs to pare down the candidate pool, while others use more complex software to compare applicants based on a variety of factors, including factors that the program itself has determined make successful applicants.
Communicating with Applicants: Chatbots can be utilized throughout the process for tasks such as asking and answering basic applicant questions, scheduling interviews and sending reminders and feedback. This automation enables the recruiters to spend more time connecting with qualified candidates, while still providing a sufficiently engaging experience for all applicants.
Assessing and Evaluating: There are various tools at the interviewing stage that purport to assess candidate competency or “fit”. As virtual interviews are becoming more common, vendors of video interview software have included vocal and facial analysis components to provide additional data to the final decision makers. Some companies have also turned to game-based assessments whereby AI takes the raw results of a “game” to make conclusions about a candidate’s cognitive skills and personality traits.

Risks of AI in Employment Decisions
While AI has undoubtedly led to increased efficiency, there are attendant risks when the technology is used to make employment decisions. The greatest concern in this context is discrimination. Despite hopes that AI could eliminate human failings, evidence has shown that bias still creeps into AI systems resulting in harmful, discriminatory impacts. For example, a recruitment tool may end up ranking one gender or ethnicity consistently higher than the other due to the sample of resumes that were provided to the system for training at the outset being overwhelmingly from one gender or ethnicity. While the sample resumes would be intended to identify successful candidates based on prior successful candidates, the tool would ultimately lead to systemic bias for being reflective of one specific gender or ethnicity.
AI programs can also be based on fundamentally flawed premises, an issue distinct from biased source data. For example, the idea that a person’s facial expressions are a reliable indicator of their abilities or likelihood of success in a role is questionable. Expression and tone of voice are both products of culture, health and context. Tools that analyze these features are really measuring how “culturally normal” a person is, not necessarily how suitable they may be for a job, resulting in discrimination against candidates who may deviate from the “typical” successful candidate.
Lack of understanding and transparency may result due to the use of AI. Where a recruiter does not adequately explain to candidates how a decision was made, unsuccessful candidates may not understand the basis of the decision. Candidates may, for instance, believe their human rights were offended due to a misapprehended understanding of why they were not successful.
There is also a general hesitancy around AI due to questions about how it collects, processes and distributes personal information. The level of risk or liability exposure will depend on how and where the AI is being used. Employers must therefore be mindful of the privacy legislation in their jurisdiction and anywhere else the AI may be operating (i.e. if it were used for a potential candidate in a different country, or if the specific tool stores personal information across borders).
Regulation
The rise of AI in employment decisions and the corresponding risk of discrimination have been acknowledged across several jurisdictions. In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission examined how AI and other technology is transforming the hiring process and offers guidance on how to ensure these tools are compliant with federal civil rights laws. Individual states and cities have also taken action.[1]
The European Commission has proposed a comprehensive, risk-based framework to regulate the development, marketing and use of AI in the EU. Under the proposal, AI in the employment context is considered “high-risk”; that is, the draft regulation specifically notes that AI systems have the power to significantly impact individuals’ career prospects and livelihoods, and there is the risk that historical discrimination may be perpetuated by those systems. With the “high-risk” designation, employers using AI in recruitment would be subject to the requirements set out in Title III of the regulation, including data governance, technical documentation, record-keeping, transparency, human oversight and accuracy. We have taken a closer look at the proposed regulation in an earlier McCarthy Tétrault blog post.
Canada’s own response to AI has been primarily in the form of privacy law reform. Quebec’s Bill 64 will require companies that make decisions using personal information that are based exclusively on AI to inform the affected individuals. The federal Bill C-11 would apply more broadly, imposing transparency and explainability obligations on private organizations that use technology to replace or merely assist human decision-makers. Bill 64 received royal assent on September 22, 2021, while Bill C-11 died on the order paper. See McCarthy Tétrault’s Bill 64 Blog Series for further insight on the impact Bill 64 may have on your business and previous blog posts for additional details on Bill C-11.
Conclusion
Though innovation and artificial intelligence will likely continue to transform the way employment decisions are made, there are certain lessons to be learned from its use and attempted regulation thus far. First, transparency and explainability are key to using AI. To gain both internal and external confidence, employers must be able to communicate their use of AI to those who will be impacted by its decisions. Second, AI is not infallible. Even with a general understanding of the process behind AI-powered decisions, employers should undertake regular audits and impact assessments of their systems to ensure they continue to work as expected. Third and lastly, there is still a crucial role to be played by humans in the hiring process and overall decision making throughout the employment relationship up to and including termination. Beyond acting as a check of the AI and a final decision maker, a recruiter, manager or other supervisory employee can create personal connections that, as of now, are still out of reach for machines.
If you have any questions regarding use of AI in your workplace, please do not hesitate to contact a member of our Labour & Employment Law Group or a member of our Cyber/Data Group.
[1] Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act has been in force since January 1, 2020, pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic, and applies to AI that analyzes recorded interviews. Employers that utilize this technology must notify candidates, explain how the AI works and which characteristics it considers, and receive the candidate’s consent for the use of the technology;
New York City Council recently passed a bill, effective January 2, 2023, that will require employers to disclose to candidates their use of any “automated employment decision tools” in the hiring process. All automated employment decision tools will also be subject to a bias audit within a year of their use, the results of which must be made publically available. Violations under this bill will carry fines of up to $1,500 per instance;
The California Fair Employment & Housing Council recently proposed amendments to the state’s anti-discrimination employment laws that would impose obligations and liabilities on both employers that use, and vendors that sell or distribute, employment-screening tools or services that automate decision-making. The use of these automated-decision systems will be unlawful if it is intentionally discriminatory, but also if it is facially neutral in the event that it nevertheless has an adverse impact. Among other record-keeping requirements, the proposal would obligate employers and participating third-party entities to retain all data used to develop or apply algorithms in automated-decision systems.

The federal program that helps veterans with service-related disabilities explore employment and education options is using more digital tools to improve how it communicates with veterans and delivers customer service.
The head of the program, called the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) division under the Veterans Benefits Administration at the Department of Veterans Affairs, outlined several new modernization initiatives it implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic such as digitization and virtual video capabilities.
Before the pandemic, the division was “still a paper-intensive line of business,” Executive Director Nick Pamperin told GovCIO Media & Research. “A counselor would have a trifold folder where they would hand write notes and enter them into a computer system. Obviously, with not being able to go into the office, that just wasn’t going to work. Within 72 hours of COVID protocols being implemented, VR&E routed all incoming paper mail to our centralized vendor. Then it was scanned and uploaded into the Veterans Benefits Management System so [we] could still … maintain continuity of case management.”
Plus, VR&E already offered some virtual services before the pandemic. Pamperin said VA shifted its processes and procedures to continue to deliver interactive services to veterans like counseling and career services and also boost its existing virtual capacities.
One of the main services the division leveraged was its VA Video Connect. The platform allows veterans and their caregivers to meet with VA health care providers through live video on any computer, tablet or mobile device with an internet connection. The telecounseling platform has enabled the greater agency to interact and engage with veterans, and it allowed these career counselors to continue that engagement.
“We expanded telecounseling to our entire veteran population. We were set up for success for this,” Pamperin said. “During COVID-19, we scheduled over 200,000, almost 210,000, virtual telecounseling appointments with veterans, so it’s still allowed that face-to-face interaction that our counselors need.”
To streamline its customer service support, in 2020 the division implemented an electronic virtual assistant called e-VA to automate routine administrative tasks and create additional communications layers between veteran counselors.
“This is a big communications shift. It allows email communications back and forth that allows veterans to do several services that they previously couldn’t do unless they reached out to their counselor via the telephone,” Pamperin said.
The AI-powered virtual assistant allows veterans to schedule and reschedule appointments, text and email their counselor, and submit documentation privately and securely from their own devices. The new platform was designed to enhance customer service and provide timely responses.
“There’s some artificial intelligence that it leverages in there when it looks at tone of emails and content to help drive the veteran to the service they need,” Pamperin said. “Some of the ways it’s really benefited streamline functions is it allows for bidirectional email communication. … We can track responsiveness and timeliness in a much more robust fashion.”
The tool also sets up automatic alerts for veterans and counselors, sends follow up messages and appointment reminders, and automates documentation of routine communications. The platform will update VA’s internal case management system as veterans enter new information, which then improves continuity of care and communication capabilities.
Since implementation of e-VA and with a 96% adoption rate, the agency has already been able to automatically schedule 360,000 appointments, Pamperin said. This has both enabled veterans to take control of their communication with the agency and reduced workforce burden on VA.
“It’s really a win for veterans and for our counselors out in the field,” Pamperin said.
The division is looking to expand veteran adoption of the tool to better reach underserved populations, like veterans in rural areas, in a “much more user-friendly capability.”
“One of the ways that we’re continuing or striving to serve rural areas or just underserved veterans in general is through e-VA. Here at the service level, we have the ability to send mass targeted communications directly to veterans,” Pamperin said. “We were able to send to 10,000 veterans that were at job-ready status a specific, targeted message that said, ‘We have these three employers that are all looking for jobs in the following 10 skills.’”
As part of the division’s strategic roadmap, VR&E also is aligning with President Biden’s recent directives regarding cybersecurity, supply chain and customer experience.
“We need to continue to capitalize on the successes that modernization has brought to VR&E. We need to continue to look at modernizing not just our technology, but also our processes and procedures,” Pamperin said.

In fact, when it comes to values, then at a fundamental level, machines don't really get much more sophisticated than understanding that 1 is different from 0.
The Dangers Of Not Aligning Artificial Intelligence With Human ValuesAdobe Stock

As a society, we are now at a point where we are starting to allow machines to make decisions for us. So how can we expect them to understand that, for example, they should do this in a way that doesn’t involve prejudice towards people of a certain race, gender, or sexuality? Or that the pursuit of speed, or efficiency, or profit, has to be done in a way that respects the ultimate sanctity of human life?

Theoretically, if you tell a self-driving car to navigate from point A to point B, it could just smash its way to its destination, regardless of the cars, pedestrians, or buildings it destroys on its way.

PROMOTED
Similarly, as Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom outlined, if you tell an intelligent machine to make paperclips, it might eventually destroy the whole world in its quest for raw materials to turn into paperclips. The principle is that it simply has no concept of the value of human life or materials or that some things are too valuable to be turned into paperclips unless it is specifically taught it.

This forms the basis of the latest book by Brian Christian, The Alignment Problem – How AI Learns Human Values. It’s his third book on the subject of AI following his earlier works, The Most Human Human and Algorithms to Live By. I have always found Christian’s writing enjoyable to read but also highly illuminating, as he doesn’t worry about getting bogged down with computer code or mathematics. But that’s certainly not to say it is in any way lightweight or not intellectual.

Rather, his focus is on the societal, philosophical, and psychological implications of our ever-increasing ability to create thinking, learning machines. If anything, this is the aspect of AI where we need our best thinkers to be concentrating their efforts. The technology, after all, is already here – and it’s only going to get better. What’s far less certain is whether society itself is mature enough and has sufficient safeguards in place to make the most of the amazing opportunities it offers - while preventing the serious problems it could bring with it from becoming a reality.

I recently sat down with Christian to discuss some of the topics. Christian’s work is particularly concerned with the encroachment of computer-aided decision-making into fields such as healthcare, criminal justice, and lending, where there is clearly potential for them to cause problems that could end up affecting people’s lives in very real ways.

“There is this fundamental problem … that has a history that goes back to the 1960s, and MIT cyberneticist Norbert Wiener, who likened these systems to the story of the Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” Christian tells me.
Most people reading this will probably be familiar with the Disney cartoon in which Mickey Mouse attempts to save himself the effort of doing his master’s chores by using a magic spell to imbue a broom with intelligence and autonomy. The story serves as a good example of the dangers of these qualities when they aren't accompanied by human values like common sense and judgment.
“Wiener argued that this isn’t the stuff of fairytales. This is the sort of thing that’s waiting for us if we develop these systems that are sufficiently general and powerful … I think we are at a moment in the real world where we are filling the world with these brooms, and this is going to become a real issue.”
One incident that Christian uses to illustrate how this misalignment can play out in the real world is the first recorded killing of a pedestrian in a collision involving an autonomous car. This was the death of Elaine Herzberg in Arizona, US, in 2018.
When the National Transportation Safety Board investigated what had caused the collision between the Uber test vehicle and Herzberg, who was pushing a bicycle across a road, they found that the AI controlling the car had no awareness of the concept of jaywalking. It was totally unprepared to deal with a person being in the middle of the road, where they should not have been.
On top of this, the system was trained to rigidly segment objects in the road into a number of categories – such as other cars, trucks, cyclists, and pedestrians. A human being pushing a bicycle did not fit any of those categories and did not behave in a way that would be expected of any of them.
“That’s a useful way for thinking about how real-world systems can go wrong,” says Christian, “It’s a function of two things – the first is the quality of the training data. Does the data fundamentally represent reality? And it turns out, no – there’s this key concept called jaywalking that was not present.”
The second factor is our own ability to mathematically define what a system such as an autonomous car should do when it encounters a problem that requires a response.
“In the real world, it doesn't matter if something is a cyclist or a pedestrian because you want to avoid them either way. It's an example of how a fairly intuitive system design can go wrong.""
Christian’s book goes on to explore these issues as they relate to many of the different paradigms that are currently popular in the field of machine learning, such as unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning. It turns out that each of them presents its own challenges when it comes to aligning the values and behaviors of machines with the humans who are using them to solve problems.
Sometimes the fact that machine learning attempts to replicate human learning is the cause of problems. This might be the case when errors in data mean the AI is confronted with situations or behaviors that would never be encountered in real life, by a human brain. This means there is no reference point, and the machine is likely to continue making more and more mistakes in a series of ""cascading failures.""
In reinforcement learning – which involves training machines to maximize their chances of achieving rewards for making the right decision – machines can quickly learn to “game” the system, leading to outcomes that are unrelated to those that are desired. Here Christian uses the example of Google X head Astro Teller's attempt to incentivize soccer-playing robots to win matches. He devised a system that rewarded the robots every time they took possession of the ball – on the face of it, an action that seems conducive to match-winning. However, the machines quickly learned to simply approach the ball and repeatedly touch it. As this meant they were effectively taking possession of the ball over and over, they earned multiple rewards – although it did little good when it came to winning the match!
Christian’s book is packed with other examples of this alignment problem – as well as a thorough exploration of where we are when it comes to solving it. It also clearly demonstrates how many of the concerns of the earliest pioneers in the field of AI and ML are still yet to be resolved and touches on fascinating subjects such as attempts to imbue machines with other characteristics of human intelligence such as curiosity.

SmithPublished March 15, 2022Updated April 1, 2022This article is part of a new series on how artificial intelligence has the potential to solve everyday problems.Sean Cusack, a software engineer at Microsoft and beekeeper on the side, wanted to know if anything besides bees was going into his hives. So he built a tiny photo booth (a sort of bee vestibule) that took pictures whenever something appeared around it. But sorting through thousands of insect portraits proved tedious.Colleagues told him about a new product that the company was working on called Lobe.ai, which allows anybody to train a computer-vision system to recognize objects. Mr. Cusack used it to identify his honeybees — but also to keep an eye out for the dreaded Asian murder hornet.“It was just really simple,” Mr. Cusack said, adding that the underlying data science was “over my head,” despite his title. The Lobe platform allowed him to drag and drop sample photos and click a few buttons to make a system that could recognize his beloved bees and spot unwelcome visitors.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Cusack is part of a growing army of “citizen developers,” who use new products that allow anyone to apply artificial intelligence without having to write a line of computer code. Proponents of the “no-code” A.I. revolution believe it will change the world: It used to require a team of engineers to build a piece of software, and now users with a web browser and an idea have the power to bring that idea to life themselves.“We are trying to take A.I. and make it ridiculously easy,” said Craig Wisneski, a no-code evangelist and co-founder of Akkio, a start-up that allows anyone to make predictions using data.A.I. is following a familiar progression. “First, it’s used by a small core of scientists,” Jonathan Reilly, Akkio’s other co-founder, said. “Then the user base expands to engineers who can navigate technical nuance and jargon until, finally, it’s made user-friendly enough that almost anyone can use it.”Just as clickable icons have replaced obscure programming commands on home computers, new no-code platforms replace programming languages with simple and familiar web interfaces. And a wave of start-ups is bringing the power of A.I. to nontechnical people in visual, textual and audio domains.Juji, for example, is a tool designed to make building A.I. chatbots as easy as creating a PowerPoint presentation. It uses machine learning to automatically handle complex conversation flows and infer users’ particular characteristics to personalize each engagement rather than simply serving up preprogrammed interactions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIts co-founder, Michelle Zhou, said the goal was to give Juji chatbots advanced human soft skills such as emotional intelligence so that they could connect with users on a more human level than existing systems have. Using Juji, staff members at the University of Illinois were able to create and manage their custom A.I. chatbot and scale their student recruitment operations.But not all of the existing tools are robust enough to do more than simple tasks. Google’s Teachable Machines is a computer-vision tool similar to Lobe.ai. Steve Saling, a former landscape architect who is now living with A.L.S., worked with the Teachable Machines team for about a year and a half to train a system to turn switches on and off using his facial expressions.“It gets more accurate with more data,” Mr. Saling said in an email. But he said the process of collecting that data — pictures of his face at different angles and in varying light — was labor intensive and the system never reached the level of accuracy required. “Automation needs to be in excess of 99 percent reliable to be dependent on it,” he said. “Teachable Machines will get there but it is not there yet.”ImageCredit...Juan Carlos PaganStill, it’s early days. “No-code A.I. tools are still on the fringes of the larger no-code movement, because not many people understand machine learning enough to dream up what’s possible,” said Josh Tiernan, who runs No Code Founders, a community of nontechnical entrepreneurs who use no-code tools such as WordPress or Bubble. But he expects no-code A.I. to grow as more people understand its potential.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnother force in no-code’s favor: Advances in A.I. itself are making no-code platforms more powerful. OpenAI, the company co-founded by Elon Musk, has a vast A.I. system, GPT-3, that can write code when prompted with simple English. It can even create websites and do other basic programming tasks. In collaboration with OpenAI, partners like GitHub, a software development hosting company, have created tools like GitHub Copilot, which acts as an autocomplete function for coders, speeding up their work. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has gone a step further with an A.I. tool capable of writing complete code to solve complex problems posed to it with normal speech or text.Already, users of Microsoft’s Power Platform, which includes a family of no-code products, can generate simple applications by just describing them.“I could say something like, ‘Look up all the customer records from the last year,’ and it will go do that for you automatically,” said Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business apps and platforms. He estimates that half of all office work could be automated with A.I. if there were enough developers to do the work. “The only way to do this is to empower everybody to be a no-code developer.”Eventually the broader public will be able to create A.I.-enabled software in much the same way that teenagers today can create sophisticated video effects that would have required a professional studio a decade or two ago.For now, though, most no-code-A.I. users are business professionals who want to streamline the way things are done without having to involve a programmer.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle’s AppSheet, for example, is an open platform where people can connect data and, with a single click, create apps that can be opened on a smartphone, tablet or computer. It uses A.I. to understand the intent of users and enables them to build mobile and desktop applications with integrated computer vision and predictive analytics features. It costs nothing to make apps for personal use.“We’re focused on making this consumable by regular people,” said Praveen Seshadri, AppSheet’s co-founder and chief executive. There are many organizations around the world that have teams of people that need to coordinate schedules and tasks, he added. Each one is unique and more suited to building a custom app than trying to use something off the shelf.As an example, he cited New Incentives, an organization that gives small amounts of cash to mothers in some of the poorest parts of Nigeria to encourage them to immunize their children. To track that data, they built an app with AppSheet that their employees now use in the field.Alex Denning, who runs Ellipsis, a small marketing company for businesses that use WordPress, turned to Akkio to build an A.I. system that could predict which keyword and title would get his clients’ blog posts the most visibility on Google and other search engines. He dragged and dropped onto Akkio’s site a spreadsheet of past keywords and blog-post titles along with the number of clicks those posts got on Google. After a few keystrokes, Akkio created an A.I. to do the job.“Results for our clients improved by approximately a third as a result of leveraging Akkio and the A.I.,” Mr. Denning said. Once an A.I. system is created on Akkio, users can integrate with their existing software. Mr. Denning renamed the tool Falcon and uses it to market his company.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I am not a developer,” he said, “but it was easy and intuitive for me to make it happen.”And Mr. Cusack, the bee guy? His A.I. system never spotted a murder hornet, but it did catch plenty of wasps and earwigs sneaking into his hives — a modest but important step for no-code.Craig S. Smith is a former correspondent for The Times and hosts the podcast “Eye on A.I.”A correction was made on April 1, 2022: An earlier version of this article misstated the creators of Github Copilot, a tool that acts as an autocomplete function for coders. It was created by Github, a software development hosting company, in collaboration with OpenAI, an A.I. development company; OpenAI did not create the tool. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

By introducing the technology in the current CASE laboratory, Chalmers makes it easy for students and researchers to experiment with 5G solutions. ""It opens up for research and education in industrial applications where fast data transfer and response times are sometimes as short as 1 millisecond, for example for artificial intelligence (AI) such as autonomous robots, self-driving vehicles and the ""Internet of Things""”, says Erik Ström, Professor of Communication Systems at Chalmers. 


Connectivity is a prerequisite for being able to work with artificial intelligence, but today there are very few universities in Sweden and in the world that have access to their own 5G networks that they can experiment with.

""Commercially, 5G is already here and is available in many countries. However, it can be said that the application of 5G is in its infancy, and we will see a very large development in the coming years. Both with 5G technology as such but also with applications”, says Karl-Johan Killius, Head of Site Gothenburg Ericsson.  

5G consists of more technical advanced solutions than 4G, but at the same time also provides the conditions to use the technology for so much more. Researchers see 5G as a tool for solving major societal challenges.

""5G technology primarily enables applications that are resource-efficient and that promote sustainable use and development in society, such as digitization of unsustainable technology, efficiency and improvement of transport systems, health care, food production and systems for generating and distributing electricity. Our collaboration with Ericsson enables our research to be tested and hopefully be useful more quickly”, says Petter Falkman, Professor of Automation at Chalmers. 

""4G was created to be able to offer a wireless broadband connection e.g., for mobiles or laptops. 5G is created to offer wireless connection to a much wider range of applications which may have completely different requirements. For example, simple sensors in a mine have completely different requirements for availability, response time and capacity, while self-driving cars, trains and industrial robots place very high demands on reliability and response time”, says Magnus Castell, Manager Expericom at Ericsson Gothenburg.
 
To most people, 5G can be considered a new and exciting technology, but the aim of the researchers is now set on 6G.

""6G will give us significantly more of what 5G offers. In addition, 6G will be an important tool for achieving several of the UN's sustainability goals. What makes all this possible are high transmission speeds, low latency, knowledge of the radio environment, position and orientation, integration of sensor network functionality, network of networks and that the computing power is decentralized in the mobile networks. A key to this is that 6G can guarantee energy-efficient, reliable, robust, and secure communication, says Tommy Svensson, Professor of Communication Systems at Chalmers with a focus on wireless communication.

Facts about 5G​


Machine to machine communication – a large increase in the number of connected gadgets that are able to exchange information with each other, also called ‘Internet of Things’.
Considerable growth in data traffic – about 1000 times more than today. 5G can handle a larger amount of data from multiple devices simultaneously.
Higher transmission speed – top speeds up to 10 times higher than 4G, about 10 Gbit / second.
Less latency, shorter response times – about 1 millisecond compared to 25-35 milliseconds today.
Lower energy consumption – the connection via 5G becomes ten times more energy efficient than today's 4G. 
Higher frequencies – in its first stage, 5G uses the frequency band 3.4-3.8 GHz, and in the future also the millimeter wave band (over 24 GHz). To get good coverage, this requires more advanced solutions using many antennas per base station.

We'll continue to see AI jobs' influence permeate deeper into many other industries for the foreseeable future. There's no way around it; work is changing. Work is, in fact, ever-changing, ever-evolving, always progressively, never at once, as we create new problems just as fast as we solve old ones. Which has led to the creation of an entirely new industry of frankly terrible jobs. These are Augmented Reality Storyteller, Ad-Blocking Expert, Worldbuilder, Personal Data Representative, Data Detective, etc..Augmented Reality Storyteller: Virtual and augmented reality allows the reader to stop being passive and offers a window into the story. AR/VR is giving storytellers the ultimate tool to immerse their audiences in their stories. Content creators are pushing the boundaries of storytelling and are adopting AR/VR to tell new stories in a more engaging way and with an unmistakable sense of presence. This job will allow entities to create both immersive training scenarios and hard-to-spot marketing opportunities..World builder: World builder will design single-player or multiplayer game environments, with a specific emphasis on first-person shooter games. This role requires many of the same skills asked of video-game designers, except with a potentially entirely different endgame. Responsible for creating and developing 3-D game levels using popular 3-D modelling tools and packages, expected to be able to design environments with a realistic look and feel..Ad-Blocking Expert: Ad blockers are AI tools designed to remove or hide content identified as advertising during browsing. And they will have to be advanced enough to spot adverts embedded within reality itself. While a webpage is loading, the ad blocker looks at the site's scripts and compares them against a list of sites and scripts it was built to block..Personal Data Representative: A PDR would be a person or company which would legally represent the entirety of someone's data and invest it in the right databases to get its customers better returns. The primary purpose of this position is to enter data from different documents into the computer system for purposes such as storage, processing, and data management..Data Investigator: This becomes even more important as AI artificial intellligence becomes embedded in everyday life, data Investigator is responsible for the lawful acquisition of communications data, and for providing specialist advice to Life at Risk, proactive and reactive investigations, crimes in action, and intelligence operations..Data Detective: Data detective does jobs such as inspecting data, measuring the data defects, analyzing the cause and impact of those defects, and then reporting the results of the analysis to key stakeholders. It filters and organizes the data into information your customer can understand that is relevant to their needs..Man-Machine Collaboration Analyst: Man-machine collaboration just means having humans and automated technology working alongside each other to achieve a shared goal.  This role is to develop an interaction system through which humans and machines mutually communicate their capabilities, goals, and intentions, and to devise a task-planning system for human-machine collaboration..IT Facilitator: This job is centered on developing training modules and workshops that help employees learn essential skills in the workplace. This would be the role of the IT facilitator, which ought to put PMOs out of their misery. Expect the chosen few to lead a highly rewarding financial life..Smart City Analyst: City planners are becoming cool again! Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, etc for people living and working in the city. With the increasing use of smart cars, drones, post-Covid office space optimization their help will be sorely needed..Microgrid analyst: The Microgrid will be responsible for energy &amp; data analytics and energy simulations for solar PV and energy storage systems and microgrids using top technologies..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And although it seems like a term taken from a science fiction movie, the reality is that Artificial Intelligence is already part of our daily lives, you just are not aware of it..Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an extremely powerful digital tool, which has been adopted by many organizations in almost all sectors, markets, and industries because this type of technology allows them to optimize work and profitability..You can see how AI is applied for a wide variety of purposes today, from medicine to the legal online casinos US industry. It is really surprising how this technology operates around us in most areas..Let's see a little more in-depth what Artificial Intelligence is all about..What is Artificial Intelligence?.Roughly we could say that AI is the technology whose main objective is to try to imitate human reasoning and thought. These are systems created to store information, solve calculations and manage to process data to anticipate certain tasks..Artificial Intelligence allows machines to reason, plan, create and learn like human beings (or as close as possible). Through an algorithm, the AI ​​can perceive the environment and relate to it..The machine receives information (provided by man), then it processes it and can respond to it. In this way, the AI ​​manages to adapt its behavior, analyzing the effects of previous situations, and therefore manages itself autonomously..One of its greatest virtues is its speed of response, which makes it an extremely profitable tool for most businesses since it can learn from habits due to its intuitive nature, and it also allows for speeding up mechanical processes..What is the AI ​​for? In which fields can it be applied?.As we have mentioned before, today this type of technology is more used than you think. Surely you will be surprised to find out the scope it has today..Although this type of technology is applied to a wide variety of fields, we could classify it into two large subgroups or areas: information processing and robotics..When it comes to information processing (which actually involves the storage, processing, and analysis of information), there are many machines that have been developed to accomplish almost any task in the most cost-effective and efficient manner..Thus, most platforms are capable of performing the following functions: Manage and control information; Analyze, plan and query data; Diagnose, configure and distribute components and hardware in computer systems; Interpret data; Make conclusions; Anticipate tasks and situations; Monitor tasks..In relation to robotics, it refers to a more dynamic facet, since we are talking about robots that are used to perform various tasks. Nowadays, this type of technology is more than anything used for assembly lines or in tasks related to the manufacture of objects; mostly covering monotonous and repetitive tasks..Some examples of AI applied to everyday life.AI applied in customer service.Today, most of the live chats that offer customer service in different areas work through AI. Chatbots are those that assist people by answering basic help or technical support questions..For example, most legal online casinos and US operators are managed by a chatbot that offers fast and practical solutions 24 hours a day. This type of technology can help customers by handling simple requests such as opening an account, closing an account, and the like..AI applied to voice assistants/home automation.We are not only referring to cell phones and other electronic devices, but also to smart homes that use Google Home or Amazon Echo technology. Through these assistants, which use NLP (natural language processing) technology, which allows them to interpret voice commands and respond to them, families have the possibility of carrying out most household tasks through a simple command by voice..AI applied to maps and navigation directions.AI is fundamental to the existence of the navigation systems we use today, such as Google Maps..Artificial Intelligence applied to these programs is what makes it possible to provide information on the state of traffic in real-time and up to date. It also allows recommending to the user the best route to access the desired site, considering all the necessary factors..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance. Also note that the cryptocurrencies mentioned/listed on the website could potentially be scams, i.e. designed to induce you to invest financial resources that may be lost forever and not be recoverable once investments are made.
