Artificial Intelligence
Ethics and artificial intelligence are not difficult words


We need to talk about artificial intelligence (AI), and not because of the hype surrounding it, but because it is all around us. Without noticing, in one way or another, AI has become a part of our daily lives, and this may be just a hint of what’s to come in the future. Alan Turing pointed out that that at one point, machines will be able to simulate human thought and that's where we should start.






Nobody can doubt that the social impact of artificial intelligence (AI) will be enormous. Although there are clear questions without answers such as: is society prepared for what’s coming? What measures should public leaders take to ensure artificial intelligence improves the lives of human beings in the XXI century?
A recent report by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) – the consultant that emerged from the British weekly of the same name – tries to answer such questions, focusing on four of the sectors that will change as a result of the development of artificial intelligence: industry, health, energy and transport. These are areas in which one can already discern some of the challenges posted by the broad application of artificial intelligence. For example, job destruction in industry, doubts about the security of the private data of patients, cybersecurity of smart grids with predictive functions and regulations on traffic accidents in which self-driving cars are involved.
The report, which was carried out in collaboration with Google, doesn’t go into details in any of these sectors, opting instead to providing generic recommendations on them from a political and social point of view. These are five of the most important of these:
1. Recognize the social risks implied by artificial intelligence
The first step in resolving a problem is to recognize that it exists. According to EIU, the risk for the future of employment and privacy posed by artificial intelligence is undeniable. Faced with this reality, there is no room for complacency or resignation.
2. Explain, educate and boost transparency
To demand blind faith in algorithms is a sure road to misinformation and distortion about artificial intelligence. “The biggest challenge facing AI is the possible lack of confidence in the technology due to a lack of transparency on how machines arrive at their decisions”, says Manuela Veloso, the head of the department of machine learning of Carnegie Mellon University, one of 14 global experts interviewed for the report. Those at the vanguard of the AI revolution need to explain their work and the plans for society in the simplest way possible. They have a lot of power and that brings with it a lot of responsibility, the EIU says.
3. Adapt training and education to the new artificial intelligence society
This involves working with three tools: professional training, which has fallen by the wayside in many countries and needs to be given more importance, the report says; maintaining the focus on STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and not to forget the importance of the humanities whose value will grow as a result of an expected increase in the demand for soft skills such as teambuilding, cooperation and critical thought. All of this in a way that makes close collaboration between teachers, business and lawmakers more necessary than ever in the face of the ongoing evolution of training needs.






Science and technology
What is a recommendation in the era of artificial intelligence?


What happens when you choose a restaurant on the Internet? Or when you want to buy a book? Or find a song? Or get hooked on a new series?  BBVA Data & Analytics in a new item for dissemination explains how the different recommendation systems used by Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify work and how they will extend beyond the consumer and entertainment sectors.






4. Regulation and improving the treatment of data
As the report categorically states, the use of data is going to be one of the defining questions of the 21st century. It calls for the creation of specific regulations that allow the appropriate use of aggregate anonymous data in response to current doubts on cybersecurity and privacy. However, these regulations should not prevent the movement of data beyond state borders.
5. Build bridges and enhance communication
The report notes many gaps in understanding with respect to the development of artificial intelligence, but probably the biggest one is between company technical experts and political leaders.
Good public policies could lessen the negative effects of artificial intelligence without limiting the positive ones, the report concludes –for example, in the labor market,

Consumer goods
Using natural language processing, machine learning and advanced analytics, Hello Barbie listens and responds to a child. A microphone on Barbie’s necklace records what is said and transmits it to the servers at ToyTalk. There, the recording is analyzed to determine the appropriate response from 8,000 lines of dialogue. Servers transmit the correct response back to Barbie in under a second so she can respond to the child. Answers to questions such as what their favorite food is are stored so that it can be used in conversation later.
Coca-Cola’s global market and extensive product list—more than 500 drink brands sold in more than 200 countries—make it the largest beverage company in the world. Not only does the company create a lot of data, it has embraced new technology and puts that data into practice to support new product development, capitalize on artificial intelligence bots and even trialing augmented reality in bottling plants.
PROMOTED
Even though Dutch company Heineken has been a worldwide brewing leader for the last 150 years, they are looking to catapult their success specifically in the United States by leveraging the vast amount of data they collect. From data-driven marketing to the Internet of Things to improving operations through data analytics, Heineken looks to AI augmentation and data to improve its operations, marketing, advertising and customer service.

Creative Arts
Culinary arts require the human touch, right? Yes and no. AI-enabled Chef Watson from IBM offers a glimpse of how artificial intelligence can become a sous-chef in the kitchen to help develop recipes and advise their human counterparts on food combinations to create completely unique flavors. Working together, AI and humans can create more in the kitchen than working alone.
Another way AI and big data can augment creativity is in the world of art and design. In one example, IBM’s machine learning system, Watson, was fed hundreds of images of artist Gaudi’s work along with other complementary material to help the machine learn possible influences for his work including Barcelona, its culture, biographies, historical articles and song lyrics. Watson analyzed all the information and delivered inspiration to the human artists who were charged with the creating a sculpture “informed” by Watson and in the style of Gaudi.

Music-generating algorithms are now inspiring new songs. Given enough input—millions of conversations, newspaper headlines and speeches—insights are gleaned that can help create a theme for lyrics. There are machines such as Watson BEAT that can come up with different musical elements to inspire composers. AI helps musicians understand what their audiences want and to help determine more accurately what songs might ultimately be hits.
Energy
Global energy leader, BP is at the forefront of realizing the opportunities big data and artificial intelligence has for the energy industry. They use the technology to drive new levels of performance, improve the use of resources and safety and reliability of oil and gas production and refining. From sensors that relay the conditions at each site to using AI technology to improve operations, BP puts data at the fingertips of engineers, scientists and decision-makers to help drive high performance.
In an attempt to deliver energy into the 21st century, GE Power uses big data, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to build an “internet of energy.” Advanced analytics and machine learning enable predictive maintenance and power, operations and business optimization to help GE Power work toward its vision of a “digital power plant.”
Financial Services
With approximately 3.6 petabytes of data (and growing) about individuals around the world, credit reference agency Experian gets its extraordinary amount of data from marketing databases, transactional records and public information records. They are actively embedding machine learning into their products to allow for quicker and more effective decision-making. Over time, the machines can learn to distinguish what data points are important from those that aren’t. Insight extracted from the machines will allow Experian to optimize its processes.
American Express processes $1 trillion in transaction and has 110 million AmEx cards in operation. They rely heavily on data analytics and machine learning algorithms to help detect fraud in near real time, therefore saving millions in losses. Additionally, AmEx is leveraging its data flows to develop apps that can connect a cardholder with products or services and special offers. They are also giving merchants online business trend analysis and industry peer benchmarking.
Healthcare
AI and deep learning is being put to use to save lives by Infervision. In China, where there aren’t enough radiologists to keep up with the demand of reviewing 1.4 billion CT scans each year to look for early signs of lung cancer. Radiologists need to review hundreds of scans each day which is not only tedious, but human fatigue can lead to errors. Infervision trained and taught algorithms to augment the work of radiologists to allow them to diagnose cancer more accurately and efficiently.
Neuroscience is the inspiration and foundation for Google’s DeepMind, creating a machine that can mimic the thought processes of our own brains. While DeepMind has successfully beaten humans at games, what’s really intriguing are the possibilities for healthcare applications such as reducing the time it takes to plan treatments and using machines to help diagnose ailments.
Manufacturing
Cars are increasingly connected and generate data that can be used in a number of ways. Volvo uses data to help predict when parts would fail or when vehicles need servicing, uphold its impressive safety record by monitoring vehicle performance during hazardous situations and to improve driver and passenger convenience. Volvo is also conducting its own research and development on autonomous vehicles.
BMW has big data-related technology at the heart of its business model and data guides decisions throughout the business from design and engineering to sales and aftercare. The company is also a leader in driverless technology and plans for its cars to deliver Level 5 autonomy—the vehicle can drive itself without any human intervention—by 2021.
The AI tech revolution has hit farming as well, and John Deere is getting data-driven analytical tools and automation into the hands of farmers. They acquired Blue River Technology for its solution to use advanced machine learning algorithms to allow robots to make decisions based on visual data about whether or not a plan is a pest to treat it with a pesticide. The company already offers automated farm vehicles to plough and sow with pinpoint-accurate GPS systems and its Farmsight system is designed to help agricultural decision-making.
Media
The BBC project, Talking with Machines is an audio drama that allows listeners to join in and have a two-way conversation via their smart speaker. Listeners get to be a part of the story as it prompts them to answer questions and insert their own lines into the story. Created specifically for smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, the BBC expects to expand to other voice-activated devices in the future.
UK news agency Press Association (PA) is hoping robots and artificial intelligence might be able to save local news. They partnered with news automation specialist Urbs Media to have robots write 30,000 local news stories each month in a project called RADAR (Reporters and Data and Robots). Fed with a variety of data from government, public services and local authorities, the machine uses natural language generation technology to write local news stories. These robots are filling a gap in news coverage that wasn’t being filled by humans.
Big data analytics is helping Netflix predict what its customers will enjoy watching. They are also increasingly a content creator, not just a distributor, and use data to drive what content it will invest in creating. Due to the confidence they have in the data findings, they are willing to buck convention and commission multiple seasons of a new show rather than just a pilot episode.
Retail
When you first think of Burberry, you likely consider its luxury fashion and not first consider them a digital business. However, they have been busy reinventing themselves and use big data and AI to combat counterfeit products and improve sales and customer relationships. The company’s strategy for increasing sales is to nurture deep, personal connections with its customers. As part of that, they have reward and loyalty programs that create data to help them personalize the shopping experience for each customer. In fact, they are making the shopping experience at their brick-and-mortar stores just as innovative as an online experience.
As the world’s second-largest retailer, Walmart is on the cutting edge of finding ways to transform retail and provide better service to its customers. They use big data, machine learning, AI and the IoT to ensure a seamless experience between the online customer experience and the in-store experience (with 11,000 brick-and-mortar stores, something rival Amazon isn’t able to do. Enhancements include using the Scan and Go feature on the app, Pick-up Towers and they are experimenting with facial recognition technology to determine if customers are happy or sad.
Service 
Central to everything Microsoft does is leveraging smart machines. Microsoft has Cortana, a virtual assistant; chatbots that run Skype and answer customer service queries or deliver info such as weather or travel updates and the company has rolled out intelligent features within its Office enterprise. Other companies can use the Microsoft AI Platform to create their own intelligent tools. In the future, Microsoft wants to see intelligent machines with generalized AI capabilities that allow them to complete any task.
When you bring together cloud computing, geo-mapping and machine learning, some really interesting things can happen. Google is using AI and satellite data to prevent illegal fishing. On any given day, 22 million data points are created that show where ships are in the world’s waterways. Google engineers found that when they applied machine learning to the data, they could identify why a vessel was at sea. They ultimately created Global Fishing Watch that shows where fishing is happening and could then identify when fishing was happening illegally.
Always at the top of delivery extraordinary service, Disney is getting even better thanks to big data. Every visitor gets their own MagicBand wristband that serves as ID, hotel room key, tickets, FastPasses and payment system. While guest enough the convenience, Disney gets a lot of data that helps them anticipate guests’ needs and deliver an amazing, personalized experience. They can resolve traffic jams, give extra services to guests who may have been inconvenienced by a closed attraction and data even allows the company to schedule staff more efficiently.
Google is one of the pioneers of deep learning from its initial foray with the Google Brain project in 2011. Google first used deep learning for image recognition and now is able to use it for image enhancement. Google has also applied deep learning to language processing and to provide better video recommendations on YouTube, because it studies viewers’ habits and preferences when they stream content. Next up, Google’s self-driving car division also leverages deep learning. Google also used machine learning to help it figure out the right configuration of hardware and coolers in their data centers to reduce the amount of energy expended to keep them operational. AI and machine learning has helped Google unlock new ways of sustainability.
Social Media
From what tweets to recommend to fighting inappropriate or racist content and enhancing the user experience, Twitter has begun to use artificial intelligence behind the scenes to enhance their product. They process lots of data through deep neural networks to learn over time what users preferences are.
Deep learning is helping Facebook draw value from a larger portion of its unstructured datasets created by almost 2 billion people updating their statuses 293,000 times per minute. Most of its deep learning technology is built on the Torch platform that focuses on deep learning technologies and neural networks.
Instagram also uses big data and artificial intelligence to target advertising and fight cyberbullying and delete offensive comments. As the amount of content grows in the platform, artificial intelligence is critical to be able to show users of the platform information they might like, fight spam and enhance the user experience.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/04/30/27-incredible-examples-of-ai-and-machine-learning-in-practice/,Enterprise & Cloud,27 Incredible Examples Of AI And Machine Learning In Practice,False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-cleaning robots, cloud-based computing, kiosks at nearly every retail store: rapid technological advances such as these have already begun to upend entire industries, with millions of more jobs in their path.

While there is significant debate among economists over the severity and speed of these changes—some studies indicate that as many as 47% of today’s jobs could be replaced by technology, while others are much more conservative in their forecasts—there is little disagreement that automation is a real and growing threat.

One would assume, given the potential size and scope of these changes, that there’d be robust discussion around how best to prepare for this coming economic transformation. There hasn’t been. Even the few policy proposals that have emerged to respond to technology-driven job displacement, such as the idea of a universal basic income, largely just cushion the harms brought by job losses.

The primary goal of policymakers grappling with the future of work should be to ensure that individuals and communities don’t just “get by” after losing a job to automation, but are equipped to lead new lives, with new jobs in new industries. A monthly stipend from the government is a good and needed start, but it only goes so far if an unemployed worker isn’t able to find a new, reliable source of income.

Fortunately, we already have a federal model that, with some modifications, can prepare us to respond to the challenges of technological unemployment: the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA). Created in 1962 at a time when Congress was seeking to bolster public support for trade liberalization, the TAA helps groups of workers that are negatively impacted by trade stay afloat during hard times and find new paths to employment. If an individual loses his or her job primarily due to trade—say, if their company moves production overseas—they can become eligible for enhanced reemployment services.

As international trade has increased over the years—and with it, the impact on American workers—so too has the TAA evolved and expanded. Today the program has a two-pronged approach: first, it lessens the hardships faced by displaced workers (through benefits like extended income support, wage insurance, and maintaining of employer-based health insurance); and second, it redeploys human capital (through support for a wide variety of retraining programs, including post-secondary education, classroom training, and apprenticeships; relocation allowances; and reemployment services such as career counseling).

The TAA is not without its flaws. It has earned a bad rap from some on the left as an attempt to cover up grim economic realities, and by some on the right as an ineffective program. But a closer look at the program’s overall results speak for themselves. In 2015, 73% of TAA participants found employment in the quarter after completing the program, with 92% of those who did still remaining in their jobs six months later. Compared to a similar group of long-term unemployed workers who did not collect TAA, workers in the federal program were 11.3% more likely to be employed. Moreover, TAA recipients who completed training and found a job in that field received a $5,000 to $6,000 per year earnings boost.

In short, TAA represents a prescient solution to a looming crisis. It provides a ready-made, comprehensive model for the delivery of assistance to workers who experience a shock from the economy, one that is not only relevant to trade-related unemployment, but technology-related unemployment as well.

As I outline in a new report for The Century Foundation, updating TAA can be done relatively seamlessly, by porting the program’s structure to both trade and technological unemployment, creating a new “TTAA,” so to speak. A new certification scheme could be instituted whereby the U.S. Department of Commerce designates a list of occupations at risk of being automated, and in turn, states, firms, or unions apply for federal help once occupation levels drop below a designated threshold and there is evidence of technology-driven job loss.

While we don’t know exactly which jobs will be replaced by technology, we do know with some certainty the types of occupations that are at risk. By pre-certifying specific occupations, this streamlined process would take advantage of existing expert consensus, allowing us to prepare a more robust and rapid response to deliver support to workers whose jobs are suddenly made obsolete. In this way, if millions of long-haul truck drivers become unemployed due to the proliferation of self-driving fleets, Congress and state governments will be ready to help them get back to work.

TTAA participants would be eligible for similar benefits available in the TAA program, such as wage insurance, subsidized COBRA, and career counseling and job placement services. They could receive up to two years paid retraining with income support so they could pay their bills while also preparing for a new career. Workers in TTAA-certified occupations could even begin this training while they’re still employed, which would give them a head-start if they were to lose their job, in addition to increasing their chances of finding a new role within their existing company. A machine operator in a factor, for example, could be trained to operate a computer-controlled tool that was replacing his old job.

For years, political leaders have recognized the need to expand active adjustment programs, on which other major nations spend 0.6% of GDP, compared to just 0.1% in the U.S. Updating TAA would provide an easier glide path for Congress, since it expands an existing program (something always done easier than creating a new program) and has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades (many dislocated workers live in conservative districts). And, a TTAA would be directly responsive to changing free market conditions, in the same way that unemployment insurance benefits rise in downturns.

Policymakers could start small, too, and develop a TTAA pilot to study the program’s effectiveness. Based on my estimates, a pilot program from 2020-2025 would see roughly 103,000 workers participate, at the relatively small cost to the government of $1.8 billion. Were the program to be successful and its price-tag rise, lawmakers could consider a number of paths to fully fund benefits without adding to the deficit or cutting spending elsewhere. A vehicle-miles tax on self-driving cars, for instance, could be directed toward retraining programs. As Bill Gates put it last year: “The robot that takes your job should pay taxes.”

To be sure, a TTAA program is no panacea for the millions, perhaps tens of millions, of jobs that are likely to be affected by automation and AI. No amount of planning or policy proposals can fully prepare us for what’s ahead; there’s no way of knowing what jobs will be lost, or how many, or where, or when. What we do know is that many Americans will experience job loss as a result: workers will miss out on pay, their skills will become of little value, and some will face a long and difficult road to finding new work.

A TTAA program would make that road as navigable as possible, not only helping workers and their families stay afloat during hard times, but also strengthening our workforce overall and making America more competitive on a global stage. It is a fiscally-responsible and politically-feasible approach, based on a model with a long track record of success.

While we can’t predict our economic future, we can prepare for it. A technology adjustment assistance program is as good a place to start as any.

Artificial intelligence is a key component of the future of healthcare. Indeed, the era of the AI doctor seems to be unavoidable.

Today, we see AI in hospitals helping clinicians identify medical risks; predict when to provide targeted, life-saving interventions; form treatment plans for patients with rare diseases; and deliver precision medicine.

However, one of the benefits associated with AI may actually be a disadvantage in healthcare. While AI excels at making unbiased, purely logical decisions, it cannot yet appreciate the complex blend of emotional, social, cultural and physical needs of people. If left in the hands of a purely AI-driven doctor, the diagnosis and treatment plan may be correct, but it may not be what the patient will respond best to.

Human doctors understand how to treat people, rather than just diseases. They will read the non-verbal clues, understand when to probe more deeply for a better reading of the patient’s condition, and the type of care plan that is most likely to work for that individual. The human doctor builds a relationship with their patient, even if only fleeting, based on emotional connections.

If the human touch is fundamental to healthcare, can AI ever step in to play a role in the softer side of care?
Crunch time

With the demands placed on the healthcare system by an ageing population, the focus has understandably been on continued efficiency and higher productivity. However, this tends to leave less time for the equally critical, softer, caring side of healthcare.

Discharged hospital patients going home to self-care, with only occasional follow-up medical appointments, may struggle to maintain their care plans. They may be confused about what to do or how to do it; they may feel better and hence decide to discontinue their medicines. They may even forget or lose motivation. This is particularly true for seniors living alone.

When you add social isolation into the mix, and the increased likelihood of depression, keeping people well at home can become a real challenge.

Despite the fact that this softer side of care is less logical and more about relationship building and behavioural nudges, it appears that AI can also play a role here.
The social robot

At the simplest level, AI chatbots at home can help patients keep on top of care plans. AI applications that remind seniors when to take medication, about doctors’ appointments, and even when to eat, can help in removing the anxiety and confusion that many of them face.

Above and beyond this, AI-powered social robots can provide some level of companionship for lonely seniors. We have seen in our own projects that seniors begin to create some form of relationship with AI chatbots. Social robots can also tailor their engagement to begin to nudge self-caring behaviours.

For example, letting seniors know about social activities in their neighbourhood may encourage them to go out of the home and interact with others, reducing social isolation. Sharing stories with health-promoting messages can entertain and subliminally provide education about healthier living. AI suggesting healthier food choices and encouraging them to get active can help to build healthier habits.

These are just some of the ways in which social robots can engage with their senior, helping the senior to build a relationship with their robot as well as sending self-care nudges.
Combating isolation

Integrating social robots with sensors worn on the body can support seniors in managing illnesses such that they feel reassured and more confident about living alone.
 
Integrating social robots with sensors can help seniors feel reassured and more confident about living alone.
One of the biggest fears seniors express when they live alone is that they will fall over in their home and no-one will realise. AI devices that can predict and prevent falls are evolving . This may give seniors with conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease the confidence to leave the house, rather than have the fear of falling keep them prisoner at home.

Sensors within the home can additionally determine when someone has fallen, or has encountered other accidents at home, and can notify emergency services for help, again providing reassurance and building confidence in living well at home.

The benefits of AI for this softer side of care may ultimately produce measurable impacts in our clinical systems. If AI can help seniors to care better for themselves, and to live at home for longer, resources in our healthcare facilities can be freed up.

The power of AI for health appears to lie in a combination of applications. Clinical applications will continue to be invested in, and will become increasingly powerful at keeping people alive. Empathy-based AI applications to support the softer side of care could help us to keep people from requiring clinical treatment altogether.

The business case for AI in the continuum of care could be very powerful indeed, and the impact on health outcomes could be transformative.

Artificial Intelligence Experts: How Much Can They Earn?

How much can tech pros who specialize in artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning hope to earn in any given year? The short answer: an astronomical sum. The New York Times recently analyzed a tax filing by OpenAI, a nonprofit that specializes in A.I. work, and found that its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, made nearly $2 million in 2016. Another researcher earned $800,000. “I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Sutskever told the newspaper. “Others did the same.” His reasoning for rejecting that extra cash? He believes strongly in OpenAI’s mission to help create A.I. that’s friendly to humanity; in pursuit of that goal, the organization not only conducts research and publishes papers on a regular basis, but also offers a variety of tools for building and refining A.I. platforms. Previous reports back up Sutskever’s claim that tech firms are paying out enormous salaries to those with A.I. knowledge. At a conference last summer, for example, Tom Eck, CTO of industry platforms at IBM, said that “top-tier A.I. researchers are earning the same salaries as NFL quarterbacks.” As you can imagine, many quarterbacks make many millions of dollars per year. The Dice Salary Calculator, meanwhile, suggests that a tech pro in San Francisco with at least five years’ experience in technologies related to artificial intelligence (including data analytics and natural-language processing) can earn as much as $121,000 per year; in a “cooler” market like Kansas City, salaries can still approach (and often exceed) six figures. Maybe that’s not what an NFL quarterback makes, but that’s still really good. Take a look:  There’s a simple reason for this cash flood: tech firms believe that whoever “wins” A.I. will “win” the future (whatever it looks like), and nobody wants to lose out. But demand far outstrips supply; a recent analyst report from McKinsey & Company places the number of qualified A.I. experts in the world at fewer than 10,000. That report also suggested that practical applications of artificial intelligence could add a staggering $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in value across various industries over the next several years. For those interested in participating in this burgeoning market, there’s some good news: companies and educational organizations are rolling out more and more tools you can use to learn at least the rudiments of A.I. and machine learning. For example, Google offers a three-hour course on deep learning and machine-learning tools via its Google Cloud Platform Website, and Facebook hosts a series of videos that break down fundamental A.I. concepts such as algorithms. And for those who want to go the MOOC route, there are Coursera and Udacity, which offer instruction in A.I., and the opportunity to self-teach via materials on GitHub. Whichever pathway you choose, you don’t necessarily need to become a top A.I. researcher in order to benefit from the opportunities in this field; even having some basic machine-learning skills can make you exponentially more attractive to a range of employers.

 Paris – Total and Google Cloud have signed an agreement to jointly develop artificial intelligence (A.I.) solutions applied to subsurface data analysis for oil and gas exploration and production.  The agreement focuses on the development of A.I. programs that will make it possible to interpret subsurface images, notably from seismic studies (using Computer Vision technology) and automate the analysis of technical documents (using Natural Language Processing technology). These programs will allow Total’s geologists, geophysicists, reservoir and geo-information engineers to explore and assess oil & gas fields faster and more effectively. Under this partnership, Total geoscientists will work side-by-side with Google Cloud’s machine learning experts within the same project team based in Google Cloud’s Advanced Solutions Lab in California.  “Total is convinced that applying artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry is a promising avenue to be explored for optimizing our performance, particularly in subsurface data interpretation. We are excited to work with Google Cloud towards this goal. This builds on the strategy being developed at Total, where A.I. is already used, for example, in predictive maintenance at facilities,” said Marie-Noëlle Semeria, Senior Vice President, Group CTO at Total. “We believe that the combination of Total’s geoscience expertise and Google’s artificial intelligence skills will ensure the project’s success. Our ambition is to give our geoscience engineers an A.I. personal assistant in the next few years that will free them up to focus on high value-added tasks.” said Kevin McLachlan, Senior Vice President Exploration for Exploration & Production at Total. “We are thrilled to welcome Total in our Advanced Solutions Labs for the development of A.I. solutions,” said Paul-Henri Ferrand, President of Global Customer Operations Google Cloud. “We are keen to engage our best A.I. engineers to work with Total’s geosciences’ experts.” Artificial Intelligence Applied to Exploration & Production at Total Total started applying artificial intelligence to characterize oil & gas fields using machine learning algorithms in the 1990s. In 2013, Total used machine learning algorithms to implement predictive maintenance for turbines, pumps and compressors at its industrial facilities, thus generating savings of several hundred million dollars. Today, Total teams are exploring multiple machine learning and deep learning applications such as production profile forecasting, automated analysis of satellite images or analysis of rock sample images.* * * * * Total contacts Media Relations: +33 1 47 44 46 99 l presse@total.com l @TotalPressInvestor Relations: +44 (0)207 719 7962 l ir@total.com Cautionary note This press release, from which no legal consequences may be drawn, is for information purposes only.

Summary

89% of law firms are already utilising Artificial Intelligence or have imminent plans to do so
61% of firms have adopted an agile working policy - a doubling over 12 months
98% of firms do not expect Brexit to have a significant impact on their London business








Nearly half (48%) of London law firms are already utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a further 41% have imminent plans to do so, according to a survey of over 100 law firms from CBRE, the world's leading real estate advisor.
Of the firms already employing AI, 63% of firms are using it for legal document generation and review, and the same proportion for e-discovery. Due diligence (47%) and research (42%) were also common applications, along with compliance and administrative legal support (each 32%).
The use of AI will affect employment levels, with the greatest impact predicted at the junior and support levels, where nearly half (45%) of firms believing that there will be a reduction in headcount. In contrast, only 7% of firms believe that senior headcount levels will be reduced.
As far as agile working is concerned, there are clear signs that the traditional partner’s office culture is declining among law firms, with 33% now in more open or activity based working environments. This figure is likely to increase, particularly amongst UK law firms.
 




“






Our study found considerable uncertainty around the impacts of AI on employment, reflected by over 30% who were unsure of the potential impact at each level. This will make formulating a dynamic real estate strategy, to cope with these structural changes to the sector, particularly problematic for law firms.

We expect the proportion of firms engaging in activity-based agile working environments to increase in the coming years. Compared with some other professional services businesses, such as consulting firms, the legal sector has been slow to adapt to agile working, but this is changing. Of the firms surveyed, 61% have now implemented agile working policies – a doubling since last year’s report. 
Frances Warner Lacey, Senior Director, Central London Tenant Advisory Group, CBRE„






 





In spite of speculation about businesses moving away from London following the EU Referendum, the study indicated that the vast majority of law firms (98%) expect no impact on profitability as a result of the referendum.In total, the CBRE Legal 100 occupy almost 10 million sq ft, spending a total of £495m per annum on rent, up 6.2% from 2013 and representing an average of £49.41 per sq ft, compared to £43.51 per sq ft five years earlier.Frances Warner Lacey concludes: “Along with other professional services, it is interesting to see that law firms who have traditionally been more conservative by nature, are embracing new technology and agile working as key strategies to boost efficiency and collaboration. Whilst employees do not seem in the main to object to agile working, the greatest single challenge to implementation, stated by over a quarter of respondents (27%) is resistance from senior management.“With a number of law firms actively seeking requirements, we expect take-up of office space by law firms to be strong this year, boosted by a number of international law firms who have expanded or plan to expand their presence in London including Sidley Austin, Quinn Emanuel and Akin Gump.”

But the commission distanced itself from proposals to give the most advanced robots the legal status of personhood.“I don’t think it will happen,” Andrus Ansip, a commission vice-president in charge of digital single-market policy told journalists. “I don’t think my vacuum cleaner has to get human rights.”Give robots 'personhood' status, EU committee arguesRead moreLast year a committee of MEPs argued that robots should have a form of electronic personhood, raising the idea of machines being sued in law courts. The proposals were made under the parliament’s own-initiative powers, meaning they had no implications for EU law.The commission said it would appoint a committee to draw up ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. The group of experts from business, civil society and academia will be convened by July to consider AI and its impact on society, including work, social inclusion and privacy.Commission officials stressed they wanted a human-centric approach to AI policy. “Robots will never become humans,” said Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European commissioner for industry.Researchers have said Europe risks being left behind, as the US and China ramp up spending. US tech firms have been luring top British PhD researchers with six-figure salaries. In an attempt to stop the brain drain, leading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European AI institute. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems – or Ellis – it would have centres in a number of countries, including the UK.Last month Emmanuel Macron, the French president, announced €1.5bn in public funding for artificial intelligence by 2022, in a move to turn France into a “startup nation”.To meet the €20bn target, the commission promised to increase its spending by €1.5bn in 2018-20, under the EU research programme known as Horizon 2020. It hopes this will trigger €2.5bn in extra spending through public-private partnerships.The UK is among a group of 24 European countries that signed a declaration this month pledging a European approach to artificial intelligence. “It can ... solve key societal challenges, from sustainable healthcare to climate change and from cybersecurity to sustainable migration,” the ministerial declaration said.Against the backdrop of Brexit, tensions have flared over Britain’s role in EU scientific projects. The UK is considering plans to launch its own satellite navigation system as a rival to the EU’s Galileo, amid a row over information security.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has taken legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim €1.4bn it has invested since the project’s launch, the Financial Times reported.Bieńkowska, who will be delivering the project, said she would be speaking to the secretary of state later on Wednesday. “The fact is that the UK, Britain, will become a third country from 30 March next year and of course we are assessing the consequences ... both for the 27 member states and for the UK.”She said it was “the right time to start thinking about adjusting cooperation” on Galileo, adding that her main priority was to deliver the satellite navigation system “on time and on budget”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)European CommissionComputingEuropean UnionEuropeHuman biologyChinanewsShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And so, inspired by real life as well as entertainment role models, Dr. Howard set her course for a career in robotics.Growing up in Pasadena, California, Dr. Howard didn’t realize she could be labeled by her appearance. It wasn’t until college that she discovered racism in the classroom when she and the only other two minority women in the class had their grades cut unfairly.

For example, an investigation led by MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini and partner Timnit Gebru, on facial-analysis programs from major tech companies, uncovered skin-type and gender biases. The AIs only had a 0.8 error rate when analyzing light-skinned men and up to a 34 percent error rate when analyzing dark-skinned women. Implicit racism and sexism such as this led Dr. Howard to question how much the field of robotics is affected.In Dr. Howard’s 2017 paper in The Science and Engineering Ethics Journal, “The Ugly Truth About Ourselves and Our Robot Creations: The Problem of Bias and Social Inequality,” she points out that the biases of the world at large appear to have crept into artificial intelligence. “Intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society. They find patterns within datasets that reflect implicit biases and, in so doing, emphasize and reinforce these biases as global truth.”The solution? Dr. Howard says roboticists and programmers need a data set that mirrors the US Census Report.

In other words, the technology adapts to the needs of the individual, rather than forcing the individual to adapt to the technology.“They’re learning and they’re provided access to thinking logically,” Dr. Howard says of the children. “A child who’s given the tools,” may not become an engineer or computer scientist, “but if they think like one, they can start solving their own problems.

A 2017 US Department of Defense study of the future operating environment has described artificial intelligence as the most disruptive technology of our time. The potential applications of artificial intelligence, and the deep learning capabilities it brings, may be one of the most profound artifacts of the fourth industrial revolution. Indeed, for the first time in two centuries, informed and experienced experts such as Secretary James Mattis and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work are questioning whether AI will result in changes in not just the character, but also the nature of war. This highlights how disruptive this technology may be for society, commerce, as well as human competition and conflict.
As a recent Belfer Center report finds, it is vital for non-technologists to be conversant in the basics of AI and machine learning. The aim is to develop a baseline literacy in AI among more military and national security leaders to supplement the expertise of the few technical experts and contractors who design algorithms. This will permit a wider institutional capacity to develop new operating concepts underpinned by human-AI teaming, but also to effect quality control and address the risks of misbehaving algorithms. The military needs an institutional reservoir of generalists who understand the use of AI, and who appreciate how human and AI collaboration can be applied most effectively at each level of command.
To this end, I have assembled some resources that I have found useful as I have developed my knowledge of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the application of these technologies. It is by no means comprehensive, and there will be many War Books readers who can add to the list. I trust this reading list will be a good start, however, in building knowledge about AI among generalist military personnel.

Facing a diminishing workforce, some farmers in the United States are looking to artificial intelligence as a means to adapt to the changing labor landscape. In Florida, for example, Gary Wishnatzki of Wish Farms is rolling out AI-powered robots that are capable of picking his crops. 
Wish Farms in FL made a name for itself as a producer of premium strawberries and blueberries. Strawberries are a particularly demanding crop; since every three days, the plant will give off new ripe fruit. If these fruits are not harvested according to their cycle, the strawberry plant dies. 
According to Wishnatzki, his farms need around 600 workers to harvest his 600 acres of crops every two or three days. Thus, during season, workers are faced with very few rest days. In a statement to CBS News, Wishnatzki noted that his farms’ labor force, a significant number of whom is from Mexico, has been facing challenges over the past 15 years.

“We’ve seen a shrinking labor force and an aging labor force. People just aren’t showing up anymore to do this work. I started to look at what was really causing it. It was more of a demographic issue than a political issue or anything else. As the Mexican economy continues to improve as more fruit is being grown in Mexico, people aren’t going to be coming anymore,” Wishnatzki said. 
In order to address his farm’s shortage of workers, Wishnatzki looked to automation through AI-powered robots. He co-founded Harvest CROO Robotics, a company aimed at developing a machine that can pick crops using robots and artificial intelligence. A few years later, Harvest CROO has created an AI-powered robot that uses imaging technology to determine which berries are ripe enough to pick. The technology behind the AI-powered robot was described to CBS News by Paul Bisset, Harvest CROO’s CEO. 
“We’re collecting 50 to 100 images a plant, and all of those images are fed into our AI system in order to tell us, OK, this is a good berry, this is one we want to go after,” Bisset said. 
Even farming giants are turning to Silicon Valley to advance their operations. Farming equipment producer John Deere, for one, has opened an office in San Francisco aimed at developing smart solutions that can be used for the agricultural sector. Alex Purdy, the head of John Deere Labs, stated that the future of farming lies in advanced tech. 
“We know that we absolutely need to go and seek out capabilities in machine learning, in deep learning, in robotics and advanced analytics. And Silicon Valley has been receptive,” he said. 
As we noted in a previous report, using technology in agriculture has been the focus of Kimbal Musk through his company, Square Roots. Square Roots converts old shipping containers into advanced vertical farms, which would enable even the most populated cities to have access to fresh, organic food. So far, Kimbal’s initiative continues to gain ground, just as his nonprofit, Big Green, continues to expand its reach into schools across America.

Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a NonprofitShare full articleRead in appArtificial intelligence experts are commanding eye-popping salaries. Including a signing bonus, OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016.By Cade MetzApril 19, 2018SAN FRANCISCO — One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 — even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can’t offer stock options.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSalaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research — about double from a year ago.“There is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options — something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Mr. Sutskever said. “Others did the same.” He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its “mission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.”OpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.ImageAn old video game used for training an autonomous system at OpenAI, a nonprofit lab in San Francisco.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesPeople who work at major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them have told The New York Times that A.I. specialists with little or no industry experience can make between $300,000 and $500,000 a year in salary and stock. Top names can receive compensation packages that extend into the millions.“The amount of money was borderline crazy,” Wojciech Zaremba, a researcher who joined OpenAI after internships at Google and Facebook, told Wired. While he would not reveal exact numbers, Mr. Zaremba said big tech companies were offering him two or three times what he believed his real market value was.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company’s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.Researchers like Mr. Sutskever specialize in what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. They are used in everything from digital assistants in smartphones to self-driving cars.Some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.Mr. Sutskever was part of a three-researcher team at the University of Toronto that created key so-called computer vision technology. Mr. Goodfellow invented a technique that allows machines to create fake digital photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.“When you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,” Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. “You are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab’s first year.In 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field — though still very young — made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.Though the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. “If anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,” Mr. Nicholson said.That means it can be hard for companies to hold on to their talent. Last year, after only 11 months at OpenAI, Mr. Goodfellow returned to Google. Mr. Abbeel and two other researchers left the lab to create a robotics start-up, Embodied Intelligence. (Mr. Abbeel has since signed back on as a part-time adviser to OpenAI.) And another researcher, Andrej Karpathy, left to become the head of A.I. at Tesla, which is also building autonomous driving technology.In essence, Mr. Musk was poaching his own talent. Since then, he has stepped down from the OpenAI board, with the lab saying this would allow him to “eliminate a potential future conflict.”A version of this article appears in print on April 20, 2018, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Soaring Salaries In A.I.

Fortunately, today you don’t have to take years out of your life studying at university to become familiar with this seemingly hugely complex technology. A growing number of online courses have sprung up in recent years covering everything from the basics to advanced implementation.
Some are aimed at people who want to dive straight into coding their own artificial neural networks, and understandably assume a certain level of technical ability. Others are useful for those who want to learn how this technology can be applied by anyone, regardless of prior technical expertise, to solving real-word problems.
PROMOTED
In this post I will give a rundown of some of the best free ones which are available today.
Learn with Google AI

This newly launched resource is part of Google’s plan to broaden the understanding of AI among the general public. Material is slowly being added but it already contains a Machine Learning with TensorFlow (Google’s machine learning library) crash course.
The course covers the ground from a basic introduction to machine learning, to getting started with TensorFlow, to designing and training neural nets.
It is designed so that those with no prior knowledge of machine learning can jump in right at the start, those with some experience can pick or choose modules which interest them, while machine learning experts can use it as an introduction to TensorFlow.

Google – Machine Learning
This is a slightly more in-depth course from Google offered through Udacity. As such, it isn’t aimed at complete novices and assumes some previous experience of machine learning, to the point where you are at least familiar with supervised learning methods.
It focuses on deep learning, and the design of self-teaching systems that can learn from large, complex datasets.
The course is aimed at those looking to put machine learning, neural network technology to work as data analysts, data scientists or machine learning engineers as well as enterprising individuals wanting to make use of the plethora of open source libraries and materials available.
Stanford University – Machine Learning
This course is offered through Coursera and is taught by Andrew Ng, the founder of Google’s deep learning research unit, Google Brain, and head of AI for Baidu.
The entire course can be studied for free, although there is also the option of paying for certification which could certainly be useful if you plan to use your understanding of AI to increase your career prospects.
The course covers the spectrum of real-world machine learning implementations from speech recognition and enhancing web search, while going into technical depth with statistics topics such as linear regression, the backpropagation methods through which neural networks “learn”, and a Matlab tutorial – one of the most widely used programming languages for probability-based AI tools.
Columbia University – Machine Learning
This course is also available in its entirety for free online, with an option to pay for certification should you need it.
It promises to teach models, methods and applications for solving real-world problems using probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods as well as supervised and unsupervised learning.
To get the most out of the course you should expect to spend around eight to ten hours a week on the materials and exercises, over 12 weeks – but this is a free Ivy League-level education so you wouldn’t expect it to be a breeze.
It is offered through the non-profit edX online course provider, where it forms part of the Artificial Intelligence nanodegree.
Nvidia – Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision
Computer vision is the AI sub-discipline of building computers which can “see” by processing visual information in the same way our brains do.
As well as the technical fundamentals, it covers how to identify situations or problems which can benefit from the application of machines capable of object recognition and image classification.
As a manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia unsurprisingly covers the crucial part these high-powered graphical engines, previously primarily aimed at displaying leading-edge images, has played in the widespread emergence of computer vision applications.
The final assessment covers building and deploying a neural net application, and while the entire course can be studied at your own pace, you should expect to spend around eight hours on the material.
MIT – Deep Learning for Self Driving Cars
As with the course above, MIT takes the approach of using one major real-world aspect of AI as a jumping-off point to explore the specific technologies involved.
The self-driving cars which are widely expected to become a part of our everyday lives rely on AI to make sense of all of the data hitting the vehicle’s array of sensors and safely navigate the roads. This involves teaching machines to interpret data from those sensors just as our own brains interpret signals from our eyes, ears and touch.
It covers the use of the MIT DeepTraffic simulator, which challenges students to teach a simulated car to drive as fast as possible along a busy road without colliding with other road users.
This is a course taught at the bricks ‘n’ mortar university for the first time last year, and all of the materials including lecture videos and exercises are available online – however you won’t be able to gain a certification.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

This analysis can help take some of the guess work out of your skincare choices, by highlighting the areas of your face you may want to focus on (for example, smile lines or forehead wrinkles) and the perceived age and quality of your skin. Most applications also recommend targeted skincare products that might be suitable for you, cutting out some of the trial and error of searching a crowded beauty hall.Olay have dubbed their web-based platform a ""personal at-home beauty advisor"" and the process is certainly accessible, with most of the online and app-based programs that use AI-technology available completely free and on-the-go. This makes them an effective tool for consumers who are looking to be increasingly information rich without becoming cash poor, by being as informed as possible when spending their money on skincare products.""AI is increasingly playing a greater role in the beauty industry, as consumers seek to navigate the millions of products available and to find the personalised skincare choices which are right for them"", explains Dr Frauke Neuser, principal scientist and associate director for scientific communications at Olay. ""Over 3.8 million women globally have been reached by Olay Skin Advisor since its global launch in September 2016; this tells us that the introduction of a platform which gives an objective assessment of their skin and helps to remove confusion in the skincare aisle was very much needed and welcomed by women.""Of course, AI-technology in the skincare industry is not yet an exact science. As with any selfie, the level of lighting and make-up you are wearing will affect your results and it's not yet possible to scan the whole beauty industry for a completely personalised regime. We also wouldn't recommend using it as a complete replacement for appointments with a professional dermatologist who can provide expert advice about more serious or specific skin concerns.Even so, the technology shows promises, with the way artificial intelligence is used to identify the vague concept of 'skin age' showing continued improvements and further updates to the algorithms that pinpoint product recommendations. The technology is also good news for the skincare brands themselves, as the data collected about skincare habits are powering new product innovations:""Olay Skin Advisor offers a fascinating insight into women’s skincare behaviour and habits which we as a company can learn from. As a result, we are developing the right products for every woman and making sure that they aware of them through the tool's recommendations.""

In turn, she received a call from a business-travel agency highly interested in her talents. Laura accepted the interview and, dressed in a new business suit and with a polished and relevant resume in hand, she showed up 30 minutes early ready to put her best foot forward.After an hour wait, an assistant ushered her into the CEO’s office, where she was drilled on where she came from, if her parents graduated from college, if they suffered from any mental illnesses, what they did for a living (“just to ensure she was professional material”), if she was married or had children, and how she would appeal to potential clients Laura knew weren’t remotely interested in business travel. To close the interview, the CEO awkwardly revealed he didn’t care what happened to the company following his soon-to-be retirement. Politely thanking the CEO, Laura left hoping no one from the agency would ever call her again. Sadly, four months later, she did receive a call back.Yes, this is a true story. And, unfortunately, such interview horror stories are not uncommon.A Broken Hiring Process Means More Time Job HuntingLiz Ryan, Fortune 500 human-resource (HR) senior vice president and Forbes HR writer, confirms that “the hiring process has been breaking down for 20 years, but the pace of its devolution has been picking up lately.”And, even after landing the job, bad hiring processes translate into less-than-favorable employment experiences: 65% of people begin searching for their next job within 3 months of being hired.The good news is job hunters now have an up-and-coming companion ready to fight for their interests: artificial intelligence (AI).Artificial Intelligence Offers Job Hunters Better Long-Term SuccessKen Lazarus, Marlina Kinnersley, WorkFusion, Scout Exchange, Fortay.ai and countless AI firms are in the trenches, researching, building and honing the AI-powered platforms job hunters can lean on for improved experiences. Their expertise and solutions reveal four ways AI is working behind the scenes to offer smoother and more successful job-hunting journeys.AI Helps Job Hunters Get Matched with the Right Role for their Skill SetWhile searching for available positions, researching companies, catering resumes to positions, writing cover letters, networking, and attending several interviews for each job opening, job hunting is often a full-time job. This is especially true when job hunters don’t filter out interviews for positions unlikely to match their skill sets. AI makes seeking relevant employment opportunities more efficient and, as such, more successful.Ken Lazarus, CEO of Scout Exchange, a talent-matching platform serving startup brands and Fortune 10 companies alike, explains how job seekers can lean on AI. He says good recruiters know their industries well, including the skill sets needed to perform their respective jobs and the connections needed to earn an audience before key employers.“If I’m in Virginia and I want a job doing defense research and analysis for the government, there are recruiters who specialize in that and the best way to get the job is to get to know them,” he says.But, not all recruiters are equally good at their jobs. So, he stresses the importance of job hunters forming relationships with the right recruiters. They can use AI-powered Scout Exchange to gauge participating recruiters. To do so, he encourages job seekers to ask recruiters their platform rating.Scout Exchange generates an AI-powered rating that reflects how successful each recruiter matches candidates to jobs. A poor rating alerts job hunters a recruiter is unlikely to recommend them to jobs worth their effort and time to land.AI helps job hunters find the perfect working culture.Organizational cultures have endless variations and quirks. One organization may have casual communication norms but a strong hierarchy while another has formal social norms but stresses team work and a flat-organizational structure.Likewise, job seekers have equally varied work-environment preferences. They may prefer a startup culture, a flat organization, a strong social environment, a team environment, or to work independently.To ensure candidates remain engaged and committed to the jobs they’re offered, talent firms are leaning on AI to match job hunters’ organizational-culture preferences to companies that align with them. Though many talent-matching platforms are meant for employers to use, Fortay offers job hunters a quiz they can take to determine what company cultures they would most likely thrive in.Once a quiz is completed, Fortay’s AI algorithm goes to work compiling a list of relevant companies. Job seekers then receive a list of companies in their inboxes, complete with a button that, once pushed, guides them through applying to available jobs within those companies.AI ensures hiring bias doesn’t create obstacles.Studies show that humans are unconsciously biased even when we don’t meant to be. As a result, hiring bias can create road blocks for job seekers. “If we assume people are bias…then we know that whatever data set we have is going to have bias baked into it because that data set is based on human decision-making that has happened in the past,” explains Ken Lazarus.As a result, he says experienced data scientists program algorithms to eliminate hiring bias and, thereby, prevent algorithm contamination. The good news is that, given a good size data set and when data scientists lean on AI, they can reduce bias’s impact for a better future-of-work.For example, Ken knows there is a 25% higher chance a male or female recruiter will recommend job candidates matching their gender. So, when a male recruiter recommended four male candidates, Scout Exchange’s data scientists removed one of them to eliminate bias from results. They then programmed this formula into their talent-matching algorithm to prevent bias from being baked into their predictions going forward.Once programmed into the AI-powered algorithm, this formula is then scaled to affect millions of talent-matching events. In turn, as employers receive less biased job-candidate lists, job seekers enjoy a fair representation in their industries and before key employers.AI helps to match internal employees to growth opportunities.Thus far, we’ve looked at how AI works behind the scenes to help candidates in job hunting. But, AI continues to work even after candidates are hired to ensure they keep their hard-earned jobs and grow successful careers from them.WorkFusions AI-powered SmartCrowd solution, for example, allows brands to monitor employee performance to pinpoint areas in which employees could develop new skill sets. Then, it devises catered-training programs so employees are set up for success in their current roles and have more opportunities for advancement.In addition, it monitors employees to pinpoint their strengths, then allocate jobs to those with highest performance ratings. This means AI works behind the scenes to single out employees who best match available internal positions, then recommends them to those managers in positions to make promotion decisions.In the End, honesty allows AI to walk alongside job seekers at all stages of their journey.Laura learned the hard way that accepting every interview can be a mistake. Irrelevant skill sets, misaligned cultural preferences, hiring bias, and poor propensity for on-the-job success can lead to horror-story interviews and even worse job experiences.But, AI is clearly making job seekers’ journeys easier. And, there’s more good news: it’s only going to get better from here. Growing data sets and continuous AI learning means AI platforms like WorkFusion’s, Fortay’s, and Scout Exchange’s will only get smarter and more efficient.The trick for job seekers to take advantage of all AI has to offer now and in the future is honesty, says Ken Lazarus. Make sure resumes accurately align with job performance and skill sets. In doing so, you feed AI data sets that power a brighter future for all job seekers at all stages of the employment journey.",https://towardsdatascience.com/the-future-of-work-is-now-ai-helps-job-hunters-find-land-keep-dream-jobs-b58a3a247c34,,"The Future of Work is Now: AI Helps Job Hunters Find, Land, & Keep Dream Jobs",,,,,,,,,,,,2018-04-18T13:01:09.070Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,b58a3a247c34,['Alana Rudder'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2016 it was the ancient game of Go. Now it seems computers have mastered a task that stretches the human brain to its limit. In a paper just published in Science Robotics, a group of researchers at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, report having managed to get a pair of ordinary industrial robots to assemble most of a piece of flat-pack IKEA furniture.The chair in question was a model called STEFAN. The robots’ job was to assemble the frame. This requires several pieces of dowelling to be inserted into pre-drilled holes before the parts are pressed together. In total, says Pham Quang Cuong, one of the paper’s authors, 19 components are involved. The robots were off-the-shelf arm-shaped machines of the sort found in factories around the world, combined with a stereoscopic camera that can produce three-dimensional images. A pair of videos released by the researchers show the robot arms making various mistakes, dropping dowelling on the floor or misaligning components, before succeeding at their task after almost nine minutes of slow, careful work.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming many human activities ranging from daily chores to highly sophisticated tasks. But unlike many other industries, the higher education sector has yet to be really influenced by AI. 
Uber has disrupted the taxi sector, Airbnb has disrupted the hotel industry and Amazon disrupted first the bookselling sector, then the whole retail industry. It is only a matter of time then until the higher education sector undergoes a significant transformation.
Within a few short years, universities may well have changed beyond all recognition. Here are five ways that AI will help to change and shape the future of universities and higher education for the better.
1. Personalised learning
Universities are already using AI algorithms to personalise learning and deliver content that is suited to the students needs and pace of learning – and this is only likely to continue. This idea is built on research that shows different people have different aptitudes, skills and orientations to learn when exposed to the same content and learning environments. 
Offering personalised, adaptive learning platforms recognises the diversity that is part of any learning ecosystem. This will be a significant change for universities, as it moves away from the traditional model of “one module guide for all”. 
It will see educators equipped with data sets to analyse and understand the needs of individuals. And work can be automatically adapted to the style and pace of learning for each particular student.

2. Moving beyond the classroom
As educational AI develops, students will be able to study where they want, when they want and using whatever platform they want. This is likely to mean that tablets and mobile phones will become the main delivery methods.
Universities are already using AI-enabled smart building concepts to redesign learning spaces. Modern “smart” classroom spaces are now generally equipped with circular tables, laptops, flat screen monitors, multiple projectors, and whiteboards to encourage and support collaborative and engaged active learning.
This helps educators move away from a traditional classroom set-up, to a more interactive style of working, to encourage deeper learning approaches. And this will start to include more hybrid methods of learning – such as both face-to-face and online interactions.



3. Welcome to the smart campus
The Internet of Things also has the potential to transform universities into smarter places to work and learn. At its core, the technology is simple, it’s all about connecting devices over the internet and letting them talk to us, as well as each other. 
Smart classrooms will also enhance the learning experience of the students. A classroom connected to the Internet of Things equipped can adapt to the personalised settings to prepare the classroom for different faculty members. Monitoring attendance and invigilating exams will also be automated and made much more robust.
This development in technology will also enable smart campuses to adopt advanced systems to automatically monitor and control every facility. Universities will be able to monitor parking spaces, building alarms, room usage, heating and lighting all very easily.



Say goodbye to traditional learning environments.

4. Great customer service
Universities are also using AI to streamline their processes, resulting in cost savings and better service levels – and this is something that is set to continue. A good example of this is Deakin University in Australia, which has partnered with IBM to be the first university worldwide to implement Watson. Watson is a supercomputer developed by IBM that combines AI and sophisticated analytical software to answer users’ questions. 
Watson’s main functionality is to replicate a human’s ability to answer questions. This functionality uses 90 servers with a combined data store of more than 200m pages of information and processed against six million logic rules. 
Deakin’s aim is to create a 24/7 online student advisory service, that will improve the student experience. Integrated with their single interface platform and online personal hub, DeakinSync enables students to ask questions and receive instant online answers.



5. Monitoring performance
Another dimension of using AI innovations in universities will be the use of block chains. This will revolutionise how universities operate, as higher education institutions use this technology to automate recognition and the transfer of credits, potentially opening up learning opportunities across universities.  
Universities can also use block chains to register and record the intellectual property rights arising from scholarly research. Copyright could be notarised at the date of publication and later reuse can be tracked for impact assessments. This will transform the way universities operate and help to demonstrate the true impact that academic research can have.

And that could unintentionally make employers even more discriminatory than before.Thor BensonPublished Apr. 20, 2018 11:01PM EDT GettyTake the horribly complex and difficult task of hiring new employees, make it less transparent, more confusing and remove all accountability. Sound good to you? Of course it does not, but that’s the path many employers are taking by adopting artificial intelligence in the hiring process. Companies across the nation are now using some rudimentary artificial intelligence, or AI, systems to screen out applicants before interviews commence and for the interviews themselves. As a Guardian article from March explained, many of these companies are having people interview in front of a camera that is connected to AI that analyzes their facial expressions, their voice and more. One of the top recruiting companies doing this, Hirevue, has large customers like Hilton and Unilever. Their AI scores people using thousands of data points and compares it to the scores of the best current employees.But that can be unintentionally problematic. As Recode pointed out, because most programmers are white men, these AI are actually often trained using white male faces and male voices. That can lead to misperceptions of black faces or female voices, which can lead to the AI making negative judgments about those people. The results could trend sexist or racist, but the employer who is using this AI would be able to shift the blame to a supposedly neutral technology. Other companies have people do their first interview with an AI chatbot. One popular AI that does this is called Mya, which promises a 70 percent decrease in hiring time. Any number of questions these chatbots could ask could be proxies for race, gender or other factors.   An algorithm that judges resumes or powers a chatbot might factor in how far away someone lives from the office, which may have to do with historically racist housing laws. In that case, the black applicant who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood far away from the office gets rejected. Xerox actually encountered that exact problem years ago.  “You can fire a racist HR person, you might not ever find out your AI has been producing racist or sexist results.” “If you use data that reflects existing and historical bias, and you ask a mathematical tool to make predictions based on that data, the predictions will reflect that bias,” Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program, told The Daily Beast. It’s nearly impossible to make an algorithm that won’t produce some kind of bias, because almost every data point that can be connected to another factor like someone’s race or gender. We’ve seen this happening when algorithms are used to determine prison sentences and parole in our justice system. “Algorithms, by their very nature, are going to carry some kind of bias,” Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at New America and the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Their designers come from a certain background and have to express their ideas through code—through writing—and whenever you’re expressing an idea on paper or in print or in code, that idea is coming out in a way that is unilaterally defined and necessarily carries some bias in it.” You can fire a racist HR person, you might not ever find out your AI has been producing racist or sexist results.This is not to say programmers are going out there and intentionally making racist hiring robots. Most times, Ghosh explained, the programmer created a biased piece of AI completely on accident. The problem is that companies that create these products do not want to reveal how their algorithms work, because then anyone could recreate the algorithm and profit from it. Ghosh compared it to revealing your “secret sauce.”“You see vendors make these claims that because their tools don’t explicitly incorporate race or gender or other protected class-related factors that they cannot be discriminatory, when the opposite is in fact true,” Goodman said. “Without analyzing the results of an algorithm using data about race or gender to understand the results, it’s extremely likely that proxies for those factors will end up being part of the tool and part of its results.”Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute at Cornell University, told The Daily Beast that one major problem is companies let things like AI make decisions instead of just using them as tools while making a decision. “You don’t have to misuse technology in HR decisions, but employers usually do,” Maltby said. “Nobody in HR wants to hire someone when a test says they shouldn’t. If they turn out to be a bad employee, the HR person’s career is going to be compromised.”Maltby pointed out that employers have been misusing exciting new technology during the hiring process for decades. “Employers have a long history of falling in love with technology that promises easy answers to difficult decisions,” he said. Maltby referenced how employers used to have applicants do polygraph tests while “every scientist in the country said they were junk.” Polygraphs measure stress, not truthfulness, and a pathological liar might feel no stress while lying. An honest person might feel stress simply because they’re nervous. Employers didn’t stop using them until Congress passed a law barring it. He said it’s extremely unlikely Congress will act to stop the same problem with AI.“If stress is something the AI is looking for, it’s going to be the same problem,” Maltby said. “Stress sometimes means there’s a problem, and sometimes it doesn’t.”Rather than removing bias and discrimination from the hiring process, AI could very well bake it in and perpetuate it. We cannot hold machines accountable for their actions, so it’s likely no one would be held accountable for such behavior. Unless the companies making these tools become willing to reveal how they work, which seems unlikely, we’ll never know where bias is or is not being expressed. Technology is supposed to be neutral, but often it’s a reflection of us.   Thor Benson@thor_bensonGot a tip?

Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, by Joseph E. Aoun (MIT Press, 2017)
It is not an accident that I’m putting my review of Robot-Proof in ""Inside Digital Learning."" My goal is to drive maximum awareness of this book among anyone thinking about the future of higher education.
Aoun, a linguist who also happens to head Northeastern University, makes the case that our economy is on the cusp of enormous change. He is largely supportive of the argument that accelerating improvements in the bundle of technologies that comprise artificial intelligence (sensors, processing, big data analysis) will drive fundamental changes at every level of our economy. This artificial intelligence driven shift will be as consequential as the two earlier large-scale economic shifts, that of agricultural to manufacturing and then from manufacturing to services.
Our higher education sector, according to Aoun, is not moving fast enough in the face of this large-scale economic change. Just as our colleges and universities are finally getting aligned with today’s service-based labor market, we are doing too little to prepare our students for an age of smart machines.
What is the recipe for higher education to become robot-proof? This answer will be context dependent, as every institution must build on its own strengths and traditions. Aoun does not claim to offer any algorithm for organizational change. He is sensitive to the complexity of our institutions, and is not an advocate of simplistic notions around disruption. What Aoun does forcefully for is an end to the traditional thinking which places a liberal arts education in opposition to preparation for employment. He finds that liberal arts / employment preparation dichotomy no longer accurate, or particularly useful in evolving our institutions.
We should, argues Aoun, seek to align teaching and learning at our colleges and universities with the research on learning. What this scholarship demonstrates is that there are limits to both abstract and applied learning. The two must be married. Active and experiential learning opportunities are critical components of a valuable postsecondary education.
Aoun believes that in an economy where smart robots do much of the work that people do today -- including the information-based service work (accounting, legal services, etc.) that was previously protected from automation -- that the skills prioritized in a liberal arts education will be increasingly in demand. These skills include judgment, collaboration, curiosity, communication, empathy, team work, leadership and many others. These creative, social and leadership qualities represent tasks that can’t be automated.
These classical attributes of a liberal arts education, however, will hold little value, Aoun argues, unless students have the opportunity to apply these skills. The learning cycle between abstraction and action needs to be shortened. What you learn in college and what you do with that learning are not separate things. They reinforce one another.
The approach that each college or university takes to integrate thinking and doing, the abstract and the concrete, will differ by institution. Aoun describes Northeastern’s co-op program in some detail. This is one model for prioritizing experiential learning. There are many others.  
Aoun never says it this directly, but you get the sense after reading Robot-Proof that any school that is not significantly re-orienting all their teaching practices to align with the research on learning -- and in particular is not prioritizing active and experiential learning -- is committing education malpractice.
Robot-Proof is a bold call for change in the business of usual of higher education. There is much else in this book that anyone who is thinking about the future of college will find interesting. The model that Aoun proposes for our institutions being places of lifelong learning is fascinating.
One not have to be a believer that we are bound for a future of technologically driven unemployment to enjoy Robot-Proof. I’m actually quite skeptical that robots will take all the jobs. Mostly, I think that robots will take many of the not so great jobs -- leaving better employment available for humans. Those jobs, however, will increasingly require the qualities and skills that one gets through a liberal arts education.
What would be the one book about the future of higher ed that you would recommend to someone who will only read one book on the subject this year?
Is your school moving aggressively to prioritize active and experiential learning?
Where can digital learning serve as an enabler of active and experiential learning?
What are you reading?

In a country with a staggering 27.7% unemployment and jobless youths making up 75% of unemployment, the future looks bleak,"" she commented.The research found that among the top 10 jobs at risk from automation are those of clerks, tellers, mining and maintenance workers, insurance claim and policy processors, bill and account collectors, moulders, casters, furnace operators and team assemblers. In position one of those whose jobs are most at risk are accountants, auditors and bookkeepers.The research, Phillips continued, showed occupations that allocated more time to human-like activities had a lower probability of automation, while workers involved in occupations such as production, office administration, tellers, cashiers, farming, food preparation, accounting, auditing, insurance claim and policy processing, construction, mining, transportation, installation and maintenance were at the highest risk.""Automation isn't a force that will affect one part of our society only, all fields will be affected.""MethodologyThe process used to collect data, according to Accenture, consists of researching various job categories drawn from Statistics SA to gain insight into human-like and machine-like activities, taking into account the type of work, skills and tasks; the recent skills evolution in jobs; degree of work automation; work supply demographics and productive structure.Furthermore, Accenture's corporate citizenship team interviewed more than 40 practitioners and thought leaders from a wide range of fields spanning neuroscience, workforce development, corporate learning and talent development and so on. The team also analysed over 130 million job postings; reviewed 1 000 workforce development programmes; established a learning circle made up of experts from around the world; and assessed around 25 of the leading frameworks on the future of work and skills.Headcount reducedThe PwC Global CEO Survey released at the start of this year found SA's already strained job market will come under further pressure over the next 12 months, with CEOs planning to reduce headcount as a result of rapid technology advancements.Dion Shango, CEO of PwC South Africa, believes the connection between technology and talent is a critical area that will determine the future sustainability of many enterprises and economies in the coming years. The reduction in headcount that has been forecast is clearly being impacted by this trend as well.A study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that between 400 million and 800 million of today's jobs will be automated by 2030 as digital platforms and other innovations change the fundamental nature of work.However, the research also takes a positive perspective, adding that while tech will replace some jobs, it will also create new positions that will require new skill sets.""Technology adoption can and often does cause significant short-term labour displacement, but history shows that, in the longer run, it creates a multitude of new jobs and unleashes demand for existing ones, more than offsetting the number of jobs it destroys even as it raises labour productivity,"" notes McKinsey Global Institute.A research report from Forrester echoes the results of the McKinsey Global Institute study, saying while automation will displace 24.7 million jobs globally by 2027, new technology will also create 14.9 million new jobs in the next decade, with automation creating jobs equivalent to 10% of the workforce through 2027.Share",,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': '5.7m local jobs at risk due to automation', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/57m-local-jobs-at-risk-due-to-automation/LPp6VMr4J86vDKQz'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only one merits consideration at the constitutional level.Six of the eight are a mishmash blending of issues. For example, amendment 7 blends a ban on oil drilling with vaping in the workplace. Amendment 9 mixes community college governance with death benefits for first responders. Of the remaining two on the ballot, Amendment 13, banning greyhound racing, is clearly not a constitutional issue for voters but a legislative one in a representative government. Only a vote on Amendment 12, addressing ethics issues on elected officials and government employees, provides a clear choice for voters that resembles a constitutional issue. The end product of the CRC serves to clearly demonstrate that we need to have a constitutional amendment to ban any future Constitutional Revision Commissions.Steve Shimp, Fort Myers Lee Health monopoly?  Is our local health system scaring away the best health personnel in the area? The domestic economic situation of health is maintained and supplied by the Lee Health System.  Since Lee Health is the only seller in the market, it can charge higher prices compared to markets where there are multiple sellers as well as restrict consumer sovereignty. The health system has become a price-maker thus causing a potentially fatal problem for the physical health care in the community.The wage rates of a monopolist firm can be lowered past the actual value of its employees hence causing skilled medical personnel to seek employment elsewhere. Lee Health may cause an exodus of needed skilled laborers from hospitals around the county.With the system operating as a monopolist firm, it will have no incentive to be efficient or diminish its dead weight loss. The health system may need to be rethought to ensure proper care for the community and its employees. Jeremy Rosauer, student at FSW   Artificial intelligence possibilities As we progress, the likelihood of your job being replaced by artificial intelligence or “robots” is highly likely.It may seem like a theory straight out of a science fiction novel or movie; however, we are already living in an environment already familiarizing itself with advanced technology. If it's through self-driving cars or your smart speakers we are already living in a high tech era. Many theorist and economist believe in some sort of future not too long from now that will involve a higher concentration on machines in the labor market.But when it comes down to theorizing about the future two major topics appear: “with the rise of artificial intelligence, this would bring new occupations to the job industry or Artificial intelligence with its vast capabilities would control almost the entire labor market.If artificial intelligence comes to fruition, jobs that would most likely exist would be those that require deep thinking or creativity; others would involve nursing or care. If the impact was so served we could see high taxation on companies that use this technology, however, this could prompt companies to move their business overseas increasing the prices of their products.Other solutions would be a wage floor. This would be an attempt to keep those struggling to find a job out of severe poverty. Artificial intelligence would also increase the gap between the poor and wealthy. The reason being is machines have the capability to conduct equality or higher quality of work for a cheaper price. With the adoption of this new technology, this would spell higher profits for companies influencing them more to adopt these new practices. Automation, as we have seen, made a huge impact in the car industry, replacing humans with machines and even today, robots have already replaced hundreds of thousands of jobs.Some benefits that may happen with artificial intelligence could be more jobs and cheaper products. Ashton Frias, Cape Coral  Wealthy benefitsI found it most interesting that Rep.

Commentary by Hon. Powes Parkop, Governor of National Capital District

Yesterday we ended our official trip to the City of Shenzhen. We were guest of the Deputy Mayor of Shenzhen Mr Ai Xuefeng and the China Steel Construction Engineering (CSCE) Ltd. This is the company that the Shenzhen Municipal Government engaged to built our new college, The Butuka Shenzhen Friendship College.

This college symbolizes the Sister city relationship between our two cities. I signed an MOU in 2016 to make Shenzen our sister city. This college will be the first in PNG in that we will have a three in one campus comprising of elementary, primary and secondary school. It will also have indoor and outdoor sporting complex and cafeteria.

We ended the official trip to Shenzhen with a visit to the massive assembly and fabrication plant owned the CSCE in the City of Huizhou which is about an hours drive from Shenzhen.

What impressed me about the visit wasn’t just the massive size of the assembly and fabrication plant but significantly more was the almost lack of workers in this massive plant. In the entire gigantic building comprising of various stages of formulating steel to customer design, we hardly saw any human work force.

In a country of almost 2 billion people, many I believe would love to work in this innovative plant. The absence of workers therefore was a big surprise to me and all of our delegates.

Instead of using human workforce to complete the stages of assembling and fabricating, all of the work was being done by robots, including cutting and welding. It was an astonishing cutting edge technology at its best but it also spoke volumes for the future.

This technological advancement will not just have an impact on production line and quality of products and services, it will completely change the nature of the economy and how we humans relate to the economy in terms of employment and our overall lifestyle.

This is not just a feature or an ad hoc decision by the assembly plant. It was a well thought out plan and vision of this giant company which started in 1985 as part of the State owned mother company called China State Construction Engineering Company.

Their future goal is to develop steel to a level and capacity which can enable them to be part of inter planetary travel and settlement, building space cities as depicted in the Star Wars movies, building floating cities in the ocean of the world and also building undersea cities.

I was totally wowed by this vision when we visited their steel museum on the first day of our official trip. The museum tells a very powerful story of human progress since the discovery of steel. It takes you through the history of how steel was developed, enhanced and used to build industries generally but particularly to build infrastructures and monuments that litters all over the world today including the Eiffel Tower in Paris and other land marks like the Golden Gate Bridge in Los Angeles.

At the end of the tour we were ushered into a 3D cinema where we were given their futuristic vision of how steel will take human civilization and technological advancement to another level. The sky is no longer the limit. It seems, a vision we only see in movies can be a reality soon.

While that might seem like something we all dream of, I can’t begin to imagine what would it mean for us in terms of economic development and lifestyle into the future? Because it is already happening. It’s here now.

We have to start waking up to a reality that employment and the economy as we know now it, would not be the same as it is today. Human doctors, engineers, pilots, factory workers especially in steel fabrication, nurses etc might be a thing of the past. Instead we will have these professions filled by artificial intelligence; robots which are already happening in China as I write this.

Humans in the near future will have a lot of time to spare on their hands because almost all manual work might be out-sourced to robots and even professional jobs. Lifestyle and service industry, arts, music, sports and entertainment etc will be the mainstay of human activities in the coming future.

The physical, mental and the manual aspect of human activity would be and can be outsourced by artificial intelligence.

Where does that leave us humans? We may have to spend more time on holistic and lifestyle industry which would be hard to outsource to artificial intelligence robots.

How we are employed or utilize our time and sustain ourselves will be a big challenge in this robotic future. This is a scenario that is devoid of the reality in PNG but it will happen sooner than later. It’s already making a presence in the most populated country in the world as our visit showed.

This is a company that has K2 trillion worth of contract all over the world and is ranked 24 out of 500 top companies in the world. It is a giant global company that is investing in and already utilizing artificial intelligence on a massive scale. It’s vision is to perfect, improve and out source more so they can be competitive and relevant into the future.

That’s means we in PNG and the world generally must start to wake up from our comfort zone and ignorance!

It has already started  inPNG. Don’t be complacent. We need to dive into the future with a positive outlook and dare to dream the impossible. I ask you to see the world in new perspectives and courageous to be different and futuristic!

SINGAPORE — An artificial intelligence-powered jobs search portal has been launched to better connect jobseekers with career opportunities relevant to their skills.MyCareersFuture.sg, which will eventually replace the National Jobs Bank, seeks to reduce “missed matches” by recommending jobs that are best matched to the job title, skills and minimum salary desired, indicated by the user.Advertisement 











The portal, first announced by Second Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo during the Budget debate last month, was officially launched on Tuesday (April 17) at the inaugural Adapt and Grow roadshow, which showcased a series of Workforce Singapore’s (WSG) career preparation and matching services.Mrs Teo had said in March that four in 10 of 25,000 jobseekers placed via the Adapt and Grow initiatives, which seek to help Singaporeans affected by economic slowdown and restructuring, encountered some form of job mismatch. This proportion has grown significantly from just 25 per cent in 2016, she said.Developed by statutory boards WSG and the Government Technology Agency, the portal uses machine learning technology to scour various job descriptions posted in the Jobs Bank and filter the skills required for each type of job.The user can then check off the skills he or she possesses and view results of the search, where jobs which best correspond with the skills declared will show up at the top, each labelled with a percentage indicating the extent of match.For instance, a user who searches for the keyword “accountant” will be prompted with a list of relevant skills, such as “financial reporting”, “budgets”, “account reconciliation” and “Microsoft Excel”, among others.Advertisement 











A search for jobs related to “journalist” will render skills such as “social media”, “blogging”, “new media” and “online journalism”.The user will also receive recommendations of jobs in other sectors matched to the skills they had provided.On Tuesday, Mrs Teo said that the new jobs portal aims to provide a “smarter and faster way” for jobseekers to find opportunities.“New jobs keep coming up, and skills and profiles of jobs are changing very quickly… (the portal) will indicate to you how much of a skills match you have (to your desired jobs). You can then ask yourself, where are the areas in which you can enhance your skills, and how to find the opportunites that will enable you to do so,“ she said.In the long-term, the authorities aim to link MyCareersFuture.sg closely with MySkillsFuture, an education and career guidance portal aimed at helping Singaporeans chart their learning and plan their career paths.Advertisement 











About 280,000 visitors have used MyCareersFuture.sg since it went live on Jan 2. One of them is 43-year-old Simon Oh, who said it has helped him to narrow down his job search based on his skills.“I think in the past, I used to throw out resumes all over the place, but that was not very focused and I realised it was not working out,” said Mr Oh, who was let go by his previous firm in the oil and gas industry last October amid corporate restructuring.Mr Oh, who was trained in mechanical engineering but is currently taking a part-time course in computer science, now has his eye on the technology industry.Through the portal, jobseekers can also find employers who are open to hiring mature workers, as well as those who are willing to recruit people without relevant experience. They can also filter job opportunities based on location. MyCareersFuture.sg is currently available only for jobseekers’ use, but an interface for employers is in the works. It will be up by the end of the year, and allow employers to update the core skills needed and application status for each role more efficiently, said WSG.Advertisement 











In the meantime, employers will continue to post jobs and search for candidates via the Jobs Bank, which is synced to the portal. More than 300,000 jobseekers and 30,000 employers have used the Jobs Bank since its launch in July 2014. It now receives about 44,000 job postings per month.

Why One Collector Bought a Work of Art Made by Artificial Intelligence—and Is Open to Acquiring More
See the novel work, which joins Nicolas Laugero-Lasserre's pieces by Banksy, Shepard Fairey, and other human artists.

The Paris-based collector Nicolas Laugero-Lasserre is known for his extensive collection of urban art by the likes of Shepard Fairey, Invader, Banksy, and Swoon. But recently, he made a novel acquisition by a very different kind of artist. His latest purchase, Le Comte de Belamy, was created by artificial intelligence.
Laugero-Lasserre bought the work directly from Obvious, the collective that created the AI behind it, for around €10,000 ($12,000) in February. The AI portrait joins 150 works in his collection made by 50 human artists. It is now on view alongside other highlights from his holdings at Paris’s Art 42, a gallery inside technology entrepreneur Xavier Niel’s foundation école 42.
“I just find it amazing that some young people built a program allowing the creation of an original artwork, based on a selection of the ‘bests’ from past art history,” Laugero-Lasserre, who is also the director of ICART, a private art school, tells artnet News. He calls the innovation “grotesque and amazing at the same time.”

“Have we ever imagined that creativity could come from a machine?” Laugero-Lasserre asks. “It’s not just inspiration from the past, but actual new pieces.” 
Might he consider splurging on another work made by AI? “Why not?” he says. “If I fall for another one.”

The work was made without human intervention by a machine using an artificial intelligence system called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). It works by mimicking characteristics of images in a training data set (in this instance, paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries) until it can fool an observer into thinking the image is human made.
The French collective responsible for the AI behind Le Comte de Belamy, Obvious, says this is only the beginning. They will soon offer a companion AI-generated piece, La Comtesse de Belamy, at auction at a starting price of 10,000 euros ($12,000). (They have not yet determined which auction house will offer it and remain open to private offers.)

A spokesperson for Obvious told us that although the works were created independently, the collective chose the titles of both artworks, which are the first in a limited series. “We chose ‘Belamy’ as a tribute to Ian Goodfellow, the AI researcher that, together with his team, came up with the mathematical formula which is at the basis of the models we use to create these artworks.” (Goodfellow—who, just to make you feel unaccomplished, was born in 1985—roughly translates into “Belamy” in French.)
 The collective says that although they are not the first to engineer AI-produced artworks, nothing has previously been good enough to be sold due to computational limitations. The legitimization of AI-made work on the market, they believe, is a sign of the dawn of a new artistic movement.
What Obvious calls “GANism,” a movement that takes its name from its AI system of choice, “brings, through the generation of art with machines, a new complexity, an increased attention for detail, and the multiplication of possibilities of interpretation to the very notion of art,” the collective tells artnet News.
The proceeds from the recent and forthcoming sales will be used to further the collective’s research into training its algorithm and delving into 3D modeling.

When Artificial Intelligence Clashes With Fashion, How Will Our Future Dresses Look?
Having algorithms perform creative tasks may seem like a failed experiment, but tech-native companies firmly believe in its potential.

On the website of online personal shopping service Stitch Fix, the company features a customer review that reads, “I love that my stylist listens to my feedback. The personal note included in my Fix shows how much pride she takes in serving each client.”

Stitch Fix’s personal stylist is the best of its kind. Indeed, few stylists in the industry has achieved the same level of success at outfit pairing and shopping recommendation. Measured by business terms, Stitch Fix’s stylist has transformed a startup in an apartment into a public company in just seven years.
Except that the “stylist” is not a “she”—nor is it a “he.” 
Stitch Fix picks clothes for each customer from a sea of inventory with the help of a set of algorithms coded by the company’s 85-person data team. Although a human stylist would make final decisions on clothes selection, algorithms help recommend items within each customer’s price, size and style preferences, a company spokesperson told Observer. 
For each customer, the algorithm-assisted “stylist” analyzes fashion preferences based on a customer’s profile with the site (including information on size, general preference on color, price range and occasion, etc.), purchase and return history with Stitch Fix, and activities on social media such as fashion pictures saved on Pinterest. The more data the algorithm collects about the customer, the better it knows about that person’s fashion tastes and the better it gets at recommending outfits.
The technology behind Stitch Fix’s robot-assisted styling tool, which venture capitalist Mary Meeker called e-commerce’s “aha” moment, is now being used in the field of original design. 
The initiative, named “hybrid design,” aims to ultimately create clothes from scratch just like a human designer does.  
“We noticed gaps in the market and an opportunity to produce something that doesn’t exist, but should,” Eric Colson, Stitch Fix’s chief algorithm officer, told Co.Design when the initiative took off last year.  
The market gaps, Colson said, are a result of an unprecedented trove of user data thanks to the proliferation of social media and subscription sites like Stitch Fix.
“We’re uniquely suited to do this. This didn’t exist before because the necessary data didn’t exist. A Nordstrom doesn’t have this type of data because people try things on in the fitting room, and you don’t know what they didn’t buy or why. We have this access to great data, and we can do a lot with it,” he said in a separate interview with Glossy.
To the “hybrid design” algorithm, fashion design is a puzzle work of 30 to 80 pieces—color, fabric type, collar shape, the number of buttons, just to name a few. As its name implies, however, “hybrid design” still relies on human designers to come up with the actual garments based on guidance provided by the algorithm’s analysis. 
“It’s machine learning with expert human judgment,” Colson said.
Currently, “hybrid design” produces about one percent of Stitch Fix’s total inventory. The company said these items were well received among customers. And yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, the approach has drawn skepticism from industry insiders.
Stitch Fix analyzes a shopper’s fashion preference based on online activities on its website, as well as on social media sites. Stitch Fix
“I find it hard to imagine that AI algorithms can produce anything avant-garde or creative on purpose,” Natalie Nudell, a fashion historian who teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, told Observer.
“It’s possible that they can make something truly creative by accident, though,” she joked.
The possibility of A.I. robots taking over human jobs has been a hot topic among tech communities and social scientists for some time, but such discussion has so far largely focused on repetitive, low-skill jobs such as supermarket cashiers and, at best, tasks dealing with a finite pool of data, like basic stock analysis and language translation. 
Having an algorithm perform creative tasks sounds overly ambitious, if not totally unconceivable.
The most obvious shortcoming is a lack of a cognizant consistency that only humans share.
The first company to experiment with this idea was Google (GOOGL). In 2015, a Google engineer released a project called DeepDream, where a neural network learned to fill in gaps in an incomplete images with graphic elements that it guessed would naturally fit.
The results, though, were hardly anything “natural.”
Nevertheless, tech-native companies believe firmly in the potential of artificial intelligence, at least in fashion. 
Last year, Amazon (AMZN) launched a “virtual fitting room” service called Prime Wardrobe that would allow buyers one week to try on three or more clothing items (shipping included in Prime membership) and return items they don’t like. With these keep-and-return records, Amazon analyzes a customer’s fashion preference to fine-tune its outfit recommendations. 
The fundamental technology behind automatic outfit selection or design isn’t new. 
Similar algorithms have been used in language translation (Google Translate) and speech recognition (Amazon’s Alexa). A key challenge of making algorithms work for fashion is visual search, a still nascent area in machine learning research. As a leading A.I. scientist recently told Observer, discerning subtle differences in images takes a more complex “intelligence” process than recognizing text or sound.  
“Visual search is still a new and challenging field, yet it’s one of the most exciting technologies for both retailers and consumers,” Kavita Bala, a computer science professor at Cornell University, told Observer.
The most promising area, Bala said, is improving trend forecasting in the fashion industry. 
“Designers will continue to be the driving force for creativity, but they represent a top-down cycle of fashion, where new designs debut on the runway and then spread to a wider base. These aspirational designs are usually not accessible to the average person,” Bala explained. “What machine learning can influence is ‘bottom-up’ fashion. For example, street style, where fashion trends emerge from average people on Instagram, Pinterest and other social media.”
At Cornell, Bala co-leads a research project called “StreetStyle,” where a deep learning algorithm aims to derive fashion trends in cities across the world through analyzing millions of photos posted on Instagram and other social media platforms. 
“As machine learning gets more sophisticated, it will be able to detect micro trends before they become widely popular. This will be the holy grail of retail. With this, retailers can respond a lot faster to changing preferences,” she added. “If we can forecast trends fast, it will fundamentally change how designs spread and might open the doors for ‘smaller’ designers to reach larger audiences. A more democratic spread of design ideas can potentially be enabled.”
To consumers, that means fast fashion will likely get faster. And whether it is a robot or not that’s sketching out the dress for the next season, fashion still seems to need a human touch—at least for now.
“It’s just interesting to me that Stitch Fix doesn’t mention ‘A.I.’ or other tech terms on their website. They even refer to their stylist as ‘she,’” Nudell said.

It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not “ever build warfare technology.”ImageThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is “Don’t be evil,” a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington’s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the “lethality” of the United States military.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFrom its early days, Google has encouraged employees to speak out on issues involving the company. It provides internal message boards and social networks where workers challenge management and one another about the company’s products and policies. Recently, the heated debate around Google’s efforts to create a more diverse work force spilled out into the open.Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company’s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.Employees raised questions about Google’s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google’s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.The company subsequently described its work on Project Maven as “non-offensive” in nature, though the Pentagon’s video analysis is routinely used in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, and Defense Department publications make clear that the project supports those operations. Both Google and the Pentagon said the company’s products would not create an autonomous weapons system that could fire without a human operator, a much-debated possibility using artificial intelligence.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that “any military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.” It added, “We’re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.” The company called such exchanges “hugely important and beneficial,” though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.The statement said the company’s part of Project Maven was “specifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,” though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google’s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.Google said the Pentagon was using “open-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer” and based on unclassified data. “The technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,” the company said.Some of Google’s top executives have significant Pentagon connections. Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Google and still a member of the executive board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, serves on a Pentagon advisory body, the Defense Innovation Board, as does a Google vice president, Milo Medin.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn an interview in November, Mr. Schmidt acknowledged “a general concern in the tech community of somehow the military-industrial complex using their stuff to kill people incorrectly, if you will.” He said he served on the board in part “to at least allow for communications to occur” and suggested that the military would “use this technology to help keep the country safe.”An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google’s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company’s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google’s defense connections.As Google defends its contracts from internal dissent, its competitors have not been shy about publicizing their own work on defense projects. Amazon touts its image recognition work with the Department of Defense, and Microsoft has promoted the fact that its cloud technology won a contract to handle classified information for every branch of the military and defense agencies.The current dispute, first reported by Gizmodo, is focused on Project Maven, which began last year as a pilot program to find ways to speed up the military application of the latest A.I. technology. It is expected to cost less than $70 million in its first year, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman. But the signers of the letter at Google clearly hope to discourage the company from entering into far larger Pentagon contracts as the defense applications of artificial intelligence grow.Google is widely expected to compete with other tech giants, including Amazon and Microsoft, for a multiyear, multibillion-dollar contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department. John Gibson, the department’s chief management officer, said last month that the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud procurement program was in part designed to “increase lethality and readiness,” underscoring the difficulty of separating software, cloud and related services from the actual business of war.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe employees’ protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.“This plan will irreparably damage Google’s brand and its ability to compete for talent,” the letter says. “Amid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.” It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.“The argument that other firms, like Microsoft and Amazon, are also participating doesn’t make this any less risky for Google,” the letter says. “Google’s unique history, its motto Don’t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.”Like other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.Paul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of “Army of None,” a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company’s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.“There’s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government’s use of technology,” said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “Now A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.”Scott Shane reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

That's problematic as AI can be used everywhere: it controls driverless cars and powers voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa, but also helps HR departments sift through resumes, decides who gets parole, and examines medical images. As its uses get more widespread and important, AI missteps and abuses become more dangerous.If we don't get it right, sexism, racism, and other biases will be literally encoded into our lives, trained on incorrect data that continues to leave women and people of color out of decision making. ""We're ending up coding into our society even more bias, and more misogyny and less opportunity for women,"" says Tabitha Goldstaub, cofounder of AI startup CognitionX. ""We could get transported back to the dark ages, pre-women's lib, if we don't get this right.""Trending NowThe History of YellowfaceWhat is AI?AI is made of up of a myriad of different, related technologies that let computers ""think"" and make decisions, helping us automate tasks. That includes ideas such as neural networks, a machine-learning technique that can be trained on datasets before being set loose to use that knowledge. Show it a bunch of pictures of dogs, and it learns what dogs look like — well, sometimes the machines manage it, other times they can't tell chihuahuas from muffins.AdvertisementAI is meant to make our lives easier. It's good at filtering information and making quick decisions, but if we build it poorly and train it on biased or false data, it could hurt people.""A lot of people assume that artificial intelligence… is just correct and it has no errors,"" says Tess Posner, co-founder of AI4All. ""But we know that that’s not true, because there's been a lot of research lately on these examples of being incorrect and biased in ways that amplify or reflect our existing societal biases.""How AI can hurtThe impacts can be obvious, such as a resume bot favoring male, ""white""-sounding names, but they can also be subtle, says Professor Kathleen Richardson, of the school of computer science and informatics at De Montfort University. ""It's not like we go out into the world and the bank machine doesn't work for us because we're female,"" she says. ""Some things do work for us. It's more just about the priorities that we start to have as a society. Those priorities, for example, often become the priorities of a small elite.""For example, researchers from the University of Washington have shown how one image-recognition system had gender bias, associating kitchens and shopping with women and sports with men — a man standing at a stove was labeled as a woman. ""The biases that are inherited in our own language and our own society are getting... reflected in these algorithms,"" Posner says.And those biased labels and data are used to make decisions that impact lives. Goldstaub points to research at Carnegie Mellon University that found Google's recommendation algorithm was more likely to recommend ""high-prestige and high-paying jobs to men rather than to women,"" while separate research from Boston University showed CV-sifting AI put men at the top of the pile for jobs such as programming.Enter your email to get Teen Vogue's newsletterclose dialogGet all your news in one place, daily.email addressPlease enter aboveGoBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Teen Vogue.

""This was shown to be biased against African Americans,"" Posner said. A report by ProPublica showed that COMPAS rated black people as more likely to reoffend than their white counterparts, and as such was ""remarkably unreliable"" at its job of forecasting who would break the law again.""It's actually showing the same biases that society already has, it's extremely problematic,"" says Posner. ""It's affecting people's lives, whether they're getting parole and what decisions the court is making… it's going to further marginalize certain populations.""Consider health care, says Goldstaub. ""Men and women have different symptoms when having a heart attack — imagine if you trained an AI to only recognize male symptoms,"" she says. ""You'd have half the population dying from heart attacks unnecessarily."" It's happened before: crash test dummies for cars were designed after men; female drivers were 47% more likely to be seriously hurt in accidents. Regulators only started to require car makers to use dummies based on female bodies in 2011.""It's a good example of what happens if we don't have diversity in our training sets,"" says Goldstaub. ""When it comes to health care, it's life or death — not getting a job is awful, but health care is life or death.""Educating womenThere's one obvious way to encourage better systems, says Richardson: ""we need more women in robots and AI.""Right now that's not happening. According to the AAUW, only 26% of computing professionals in the U.S. are women — and there used to be more. Back in the 1990s, more than a third of those working in tech were female. According to Google's own diversity figures in 2017, 31 percent of its workforce is women, but only 20 percent of its technical roles are filled by women. And, only 1 percent of all their tech employees (of any gender) are black; 3 percent are hispanic. For AI in particular, Goldstaub suggests about 13 percent of those working in AI are women.""I believe as a feminist the more women we can get into roles, the more diverse the output will be — and fewer shockers will get through,"" Goldstaub says.Thankfully, groups such as AI4ALL have sprung up to help women step into careers in AI by encouraging high school students to take science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects.  ""When we look at the research about underrepresented populations and why they don’t go into the field, a lot of the research shows this actually stems back in high school at around age 15, which is when folks get discouraged or lose interest in STEM fields,"" says Posner.Why is that? Posner points to a lack of role models, no exposure to technical subjects or innovation, and a general lack of encouragement. To fight back, AI4All shows high school students — in particular girls, those from low-income families, and from different ethnic backgrounds — the path to an AI career, offering educational camps and mentorships with industry leaders. ""And then we’re supporting you throughout your career path and into your career, if this is the path that you choose,"" she says.To help push selected students toward creating ethical AI, the camps work on projects under the AI for Good banner, which designs systems specifically for humanitarian causes such as computer vision for hospitals or natural-language processing for disaster relief efforts. ""We've seen that it's actually really effective to teach rigorous AI concepts in the context of societal impact,"" she says.And some of the projects AI4All students have made have been incredible, Posner says — by not including a diverse range of people in AI development, we not only risk biases but also miss out on better ideas. ""When we give access to more people incredible things happen and things that we could have never imagined before,"" she says. ""That’s why it’s especially critical to let’s not miss out on the potential inventions and talents of all these amazing underutilized groups.""Being heardCompanies need to remember that there's more to diversity than hiring a token lady for the team, and women shouldn't be made to feel they need to represent their entire gender or race. ""A lot of women go into science and the last thing they talk about is sexism or gender or differences like that,"" Richardson says. ""When they enter these fields, the last thing they want to do is make an issue out of being a woman, if you know what I mean.""That means it's not just women's responsibility to encourage their female colleagues to feel comfortable speaking up. ""What tends to happen is when the most powerful groups let in other people with less power, is the people with less power go along with the people with the most power,"" Richardson says. ""I've done it myself.""Simply having women in the room isn't enough; they need to be heard — and often enough, that means we need to stand up and make people listen. ""You have to be brave and courageous to come in and challenge people with authority and power,"" Richardson says.Degendering AIOne way to make AI less problematic for women is to take gender out of the equation. Alexa and Siri have something in common: they're both clearly female characters and female voices. That's taken further with virtual girlfriends such as Gatebox in Japan — and that's before we start talking about sex robots. But Alexa and Siri are a good place to start.""What they tend to do is keep reproducing this idea of women as sexual objects to be used, to be appropriated,"" Richardson says, explaining that giving objects female personas cements existing power dynamics. ""Women are expected to give away power, to acknowledge and look after men, to laugh at their jokes, flatter their ego — these kinds of things. So when you've got men then creating models of relationships [with AI assistants], they're creating a model of relationship that is very egocentric, not very neutral… I think that's what's underlying a lot of robots and AI.""Because of that, such tools should be gender neutral, Goldstaub argues. ""We should degender our AI, so it's like a washing machine rather than a Tamagotchi. Things that are meant to stay as tools should stay as tools.""She adds: ""If I was in the room [when the decision that Alexa would be a woman was made], I would have suggested we try some other voices,"" says Goldstaub. ""Clearly that didn't happen.""Algorithmic accountabilityEven if we flood the labs and offices developing AI with women, and in particular with women of color — which we should do — there will still be abuses of this technology as well as unintended consequences. And we need to be able to spot both.That's why some researchers are arguing for algorithmic accountability. As it stands, many machine-learning and AI-based systems are essentially black boxes to end users: put data in, magic happens, and we get an answer. That's problematic when the data being pulled in is demographic, and the output is whether or not to keep an individual in jail pending trial.We need to see how algorithms work to make sure that they do. That could be through companies that make AI systems opening them up to researchers and regulators, or by forcing developers to publish their methods. Others suggest ethics boards that oversee such projects.It also means the rest of us need to understand how AI works — and not see it as dark magic. ""It's not just developers that need to understand — it's also healthcare workers, law enforcement, criminal justice, policy makers. You wouldn't think that they would have to deal with the impacts of AI, but they absolutely will,"" Posner says. ""So demystifying it so the average person knows this is just a math tool, a technology tool, is important.""No single answerSuch a complicated problem requires multiple solutions: we need to encourage more women into tech and AI development, and support them when they get there; companies need to stop conflating women and objects, and remove gender from AI; and we need transparency around the algorithms we use and not be intimidated or confused by them.If we don't get this right, there's a risk beyond the immediate damage: we may refuse to use it all, missing out on the potential benefits. ""The technology itself also has tremendous potential for good and for creating benefits to human society,"" Posner says. ""But we have to make sure that the ability to create with it and shape it is in the hands of as many people as possible that represent the diverse general population.""Related: It’s Not Just Facebook — Google Has Your Info, Too",https://www.teenvogue.com/story/artificial-intelligence-isnt-good-for-women-but-we-can-fix-it,my life,,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'My Life', 'item': 'https://www.teenvogue.com/my-life'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.teenvogue.com/tag/artificial-intelligence'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': ""Artificial Intelligence Isn't Good for Women, But We Can Fix It""}]",,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Teen Vogue'}",,"Artificial intelligence isn't necessarily good for women, but we can make it better.

AI and Employment

    On April 4 at 6 p.m., a lecture about artificial intelligence and how it may affect the future of employment, will be delivered by four university professors from the departments of Computer Science, Economics, Law, and Philosophy. This lecture is the first lecture of the Broader Considerations of Technology lecture series. This lecture is tailored for a broad audience including students studying STEM, Arts, Humanities, and the general public.
The development of technology impacts society in many ways. We, as engaged citizens, should be informed about recent developments in technology so we can most effectively shape a more favorable future. This lecture series aims to foster conversation about the development of technology, the ethics therein, and projections for the future. We intend to achieve this by presenting different disciplinary perspectives to best identify the social/societal implications of the development of technologies. 
Event Details:

In 2013, we published a paper entitled “The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?”, estimating that 47% of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.
Since then, numerous studies have emerged, arriving at very different conclusions. In particular, one study published by a group of researchers at the University of Mannheim suggests that only 9% of jobs are exposed to automation. And more recently, a study by the OECD suggests that it is actually 14%, with a further “32% of jobs have a risk of between 50 and 70% pointing to the possibility of significant change in the way these jobs are carried out as a result of automation.”
Many policymakers naturally find it hard to make sense of these results. Which study is right? And why do they arrive at very different conclusions? In this article, we shall seek to explain why these estimates diverge.
For all their differences, these studies build on the same intuition. This is that the future of work can be inferred by observing what computers do. And there are good reasons to believe that this view is right. Back in 2003, David Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard Murnane, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), showed that jobs which were intensive in routine tasks had disappeared since 1980. Their findings were entirely predictable.
In his 1960 essay, “The Corporation: Will It Be Managed by Machines?”, Herbert Simon predicted the decline of routine jobs, arguing that computers hold the comparative advantage in “routine” rule-based activities which are easy to specify in computer code. Through a series of case studies in 1960, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also arrived at a similar conclusion, suggesting that:

A little over 80% of the employees affected by the change were in routine jobs involving posting, checking, and maintaining records; filing; computing; or tabulating, keypunch, and related machine operations.

Despite their accurate insights, Simon and the BLS were careful enough not to provide a timeline for how long it would take before routine jobs would disappear in large numbers. And neither did we back in 2013.
Our study wasn’t even a prediction. It was an estimate of how exposed existing jobs are to recent developments in artificial intelligence and mobile robotics. It said nothing about the pace at which jobs will be automated away. What it did suggest is that 47% of jobs are automatable from a technological capabilities point of view. As we pointed out back then:

we focus on estimating the share of employment that can potentially be substituted by computer capital, from a technological capabilities point of view, over some unspeciﬁed number of years. We make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actually be automated. The actual extent and pace of computerisation will depend on several additional factors which were left unaccounted for.

Our estimates have often been taken to imply an employment apocalypse. Yet that is not what we intended or suggested. All we showed is that the potential scope of automation is vast, just as it was at the eve of the Second Industrial Revolution, before electricity and the internal combustion engine rendered many of the jobs that existed in 1900 redundant. Had our great grandfathers tried to make a similar assessment by the turn of the twentieth century, they would probably have arrived at a similar figure. Back in 1900, over 40% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Now it is less than 2%.
Seen through the lens of the twentieth century, our estimate, that 47% of jobs are exposed to future automation, does not seem extraordinarily high. On the contrary, the University of Mannheim and the OECD estimates seem extremely low.
Both of these studies take their starting point from our methodology, so let’s begin with a non-technical description of it.
 In 2013, we gathered a group of machine learning experts to assess the automatability of 70 occupations using detailed task descriptions. Specifically, we asked the experts to assess whether each task for these occupations was automatable, given the availability of state-of-the-art computer equipment and conditional upon the availability of relevant big data for the algorithm to draw upon. Data were derived from O*Net which, through surveys of the working population, has collected some 20,000 unique task descriptions along with data on the skills, knowledge and abilities possessed by different occupations. Such “big data” comes with one non-negligible problem: the human brain struggles to process it. But mercifully we live in the age of AI. And AI performed most of our analysis.
The role of the experts was to provide us with what machine learning researchers call a “training dataset”, allowing our algorithm to learn about the features of automatable vs. non-automatable jobs. While the task descriptions provided for each occupation in O*Net are unique, O*Net also provides a set of common features for all occupations, which also stems from surveys, during which workers are asked how often they engage in particular activities, such as taking care of customers, negotiating, developing novel ideas and artefacts. These features allowed our algorithm to learn about the characteristics of automatable as well as non-automatable occupations, which in turn allowed us to predict the automatability of another 632 occupations.
Thus, we were able to examine a total of 702 occupations, which in 2013 made up 97% of the U.S. workforce.
Using AI for our analysis had benefits beyond saving time and labour. Among the occupations the experts deemed non-automatable were waiters and waitresses. Our AI algorithm however gave us another answer. By examining the similarities between the tasks performed by waiters and those of other occupations, it suggested that the jobs of waiters are in fact automatable. And it was proven right: in 2016 the completely waiter-less restaurant chain Eatsa opened.
Of course, algorithms are only as good as the data we feed them, and our approach did have one drawback. As we pointed out in the paper, while “our probability estimates describe the likelihood of an occupation being fully automated, we do not capture any within-occupation variation […].” What we mean by this is that underlying our analysis was a set of occupation specific features. But every occupation employs thousands of individuals, of which some potentially perform slightly different tasks. This was also the point that the authors of the Mannheim as well as the OECD study picked up on, although within-occupation variation probably plays a minor role: the job of a taxi driver or a cashier, for example, is essentially the same across companies and locations. Still, by using individual instead of occupational level data, allowing them to also capture within-occupation variation, this approach has its merits.
However, we do have a number of other queries regarding these studies.
What all previous studies have in common, including our study, is that they infer the automatability of jobs by analysing their tasks. While the Mannheim study appears to take a task-based approach, a closer look at the variables being used shows that this is not the case.
Instead of relying primarily on tasks, the Mannheim study uses worker and firm characteristics, as well as demographic variables such as sex, education, age, and income. According to this approach, the more an accountant earns, the less automatable his job is. If he or she happens to have a PhD in sociology, the job is safer from automation. Similarly, a female taxi driver with a PhD is less likely to be displaced by a self-driving car than a man who has been driving a taxi for decades. Yet why should automation discriminate on the basis of worker characteristics? 
Back in 2013, we observed that workers who were employed in jobs that are exposed to automation tend to have lower levels of education and (typically) lower incomes. And we also noted that a disproportionate number of women work in occupations that are less exposed to automation relative to men. The Mannheim study, however, uses these outcomes as inputs into their analysis. In fact, jobs are not more or less exposed because of the sex of the worker, though some more male-dominated jobs are more exposed to automation.
The OECD study does not make the same mistake: it does not include demographic variables, which might explain why it finds a larger share of jobs to be exposed to automation. It suggests that between 6% (in Norway) and 33% (in Slovakia) of jobs are automatable across the OECD countries. While their headline figure suggests that only 14% of jobs across these countries are automatable, using our definition, their median automatability estimate is quite high: the median job is estimated to have 48% probability of being automated.
Like the Mannheim study, the OECD uses individual level data from the PIAAC survey, which they argue explains why they find a lower percentage of jobs to be automatable, relative to our estimate. However, they do not provide any evidence to actually show that this is the case. To take the example of the truck driver, our approach treats all truck drivers as equal: when autonomous vehicles arrive, all of them will become exposed to automation. The OECD study argues that their estimates are lower than ours because a large share of drivers will not find themselves exposed but without providing any data to show that this is the case. We would welcome the OECD’s publication of the distribution of workers that are exposed to automation by occupation.
We find it hard to believe that the tasks performed by different truck drivers (or workers within any other occupation) vary that greatly. We find it even harder to believe that this would explain a staggering difference between 14% and 47% being exposed to automation. More fundamentally, even if there is variation in the tasks being performed within occupations, would one not expect companies to simplify the tasks in production to be able to take advantage of the new technology? For example, depending on the soil and weather conditions, farm labourers in 1900 will have performed slightly different tasks. But in the developed world, nearly all of them eventually adopted the tractor after it arrived.
Given that the only source data that both studies consider on automatability is our training set, the only reasonable way to check which of their model and our model is preferable is how well it performs on that training set. A common way of evaluating such performance is “holding out” (hiding) elements of the training set provided to the model: later, the model’s predictions for these unseen occupations can be compared against their actual values. A frequently used metric to assess this is the AUC, which is the only comparable metric computed for both studies. By this measure, the non-linear model in our study is substantively more accurate (in predicting held-out members of the training set) than the linear model used in the OECD study. The bi-modal distribution of automatability scores in our study is the result of the confidence of our model (most occupations are confidently predicted to be either automatable or not): the fact that the model mostly correctly predicts held-out elements of the training set lends weight to this confidence. It is, unfortunately, not clear from the evidence in the OECD study that its model is (nor that the results that follow from it are) more reliable.
Furthermore, while our analysis examines 702 occupations, the OECD study results are broken down by broad occupational categories. And as the OECD study accurately notes, “valuable information is lost when the risk of automation is calculated based on the skill requirements of broad occupational categories.” As the OECD study finds that 14% of jobs are exposed to automation, it is possible that 2 to 3 occupations drive their results entirely.
We appreciate the attempt of the OECD to add to our work. The reason why we made our data publicly available is to allow others to build upon it. This is also the reason that the OECD and the University of Mannheim were able to adjust our methodology. We would welcome similar transparency from these studies.
Policymakers need to understand the thinking behind the disparate numbers in these studies to draw their own conclusions about the scale of the changes facing us, and so to be able to craft appropriate responses.

The technology has already yielded great success in streamlining work processes in the healthcare industry, reducing man-hours spent in administrative tasks in the education sector and reducing overhead costs in the manufacturing world. It seems as if a new AI startup pops up every day with the purpose of changing the way we think, interact and work on a day to day basis.In honor of this technology, we have compiled a plethora of stats that relate to AI in order to give you an idea of how prevalent the technology is nowadays. These stats cover the state of the technology as of 2018, which has seen companies such as WorkFusion emerge as leaders in the industry. The software company offers a wide variety of intelligent automation solutions for businesses looking to boost their ROI.Here are 15 AI stats you need to know in 2018:Only 15% of enterprises are using AI as of today, but 31% are expected to add it over the coming 12 months, according to Adobe.The number of active startups has increased by 1400% since 2000, per Stanford University.Investment into AI startups by venture capitalists has soared sixfold since 2000, per Adobe.The share of jobs requiring AI has increased by 450% since 2013, per Adobe.For enterprises using AI, top-performing companies said they are more than twice as likely as their industry counterparts to use the technology for marketing, 28% vs. 12%, per Stanford.According to BridghtEdge, the next big marketing trend is seen as being consumer personalization (29%), followed by AI (26%).The three most in-demand skills on Monster.com are machine learning (ML), deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that the compound annual growth rate for global sending on AI will be 50.1%, reaching $57.6 billion by 2021. This is thanks to investments in retail, banking, healthcare and manufacturing, which will make up over half of the worldwide spending on AI.Adobe also discovered that 47% of digitally mature organizations, which are those with advanced digital practices, have a defined AI strategy.Juniper Research discovered in a study that, in retail, global spending on AI will grow to $7.3 billion a year by 2022, up from $2 billion in 2018. This is because companies will invest heavily in AI tools that will help them differentiate and improve the services they offer customers.About 61% of companies with an innovation strategy are using AI to identify opportunities in data that they would have otherwise missed, according to Narrative Science. This figure is only 22% for companies without this strategy.About 38% of consumers believe that AI will improve customer service, according to Page.A PointSource study found that when AI is deployed tactically, 34% of shoppers will spend more money online.

“I’m fascinated with this,” he told Observer.
A fashion week wunderkind who made his meteoric rise at the age of 20, Posen is better known for designing handcrafted, red carpet-ready dresses than researching how algorithms imitate the human thinking process.
Nevertheless, he is deeply curious and optimistic about the potential impact of cutting-edge technology on the fashion industry. Posen is an avid follower of leading tech shows from Japan, and has even worked with engineers and the creative staff of Microsoft to develop software that could virtually synthesize his hands-on draping process.
“Artificial intelligence and bots are part of the evolutional story of life on earth,” he said. “AI is going to touch every part of our life—communication, medical fields and even trading commodities. They are living, functioning minds.”
“From a fashion sense, I think the curation of an algorithm is a really fascinating and interesting game… [for algorithms] to be able to compile personal data to tell people what they like,” he added.
AI-powered fashion is a concept both tech companies and traditional fashion retailers are aggressively experimenting with.
Stitch Fix, a seven-year-old startup, attracted millions of users to its fashion subscription service that can accurately predict what clothing items a user will like, thanks to a machine learning algorithm, based on “keep-and-return” records on Stitch Fix and other social media activities.
Amazon (AMZN) recently introduced a new device called Echo Look. Between any two outfit photos, the device (through it’s Style Check feature) can judge which one is more “stylish,” based on standards devised from a trove of fashion photos and fashion styles on the internet. The e-commerce giant is also exploring a fashion line entirely designed by robots.
Even more traditional fashion brands are jumping onto the AI bandwagon.
Earlier this year, Tommy Hilfiger partnered with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York on a project that utilizes IBM’s 3D design tool to speed up the retailer’s trend forecasting, design and supply chain overall.
Consumers seem to be welcoming these advancements with open arms. A January study by IBM showed that 52 percent of Generation Z women would like to see tools that allow them to customize products for themselves.
While all these initiatives are great strides toward digitalized fashion, most of them take place in the retail space and feel somewhat distant from the haute couture world where Posen lives.
“I find it hard to imagine that AI algorithms can produce anything avant-garde or creative on purpose,” Natalie Nudell, a fashion historian who teaches at the FIT, recently told Observer.
Few people in fashion value creativity more than Posen.
As Neiman Marcus’ fashion director Ken Downing said in 2017 documentary House of Z, “[Posen] wanted to be a creature, as opposed to just a fashion designer.”
In that sense, Posen is acutely aware of the possible weakness of robots overtaking a designer’s job.
“AI will not be able to synthesize the irrational surprises that only humans have. On a daily basis, a human brain processes so much experiences and influences that can lead to changes in taste and choices immediately and irrationally. That’s something I don’t believe AI or algorithms can be as quick or reactive yet,” he explained.
“For example, when I’m creating draping, there are mistakes and unexpected things that happen. A fan in my office can be blowing. It can blow a fabric in a certain direction that captures the moment that I want to capture. That kind of situational, spontaneous moments of beauty is disappearing when things are formulated and automated,” Posen continued.
In House of Z, supermodel Crystal Renn said, if she could only have one word to describe Posen, it would be “the builder.”
“He takes this fabric, which is ultimately a dead piece of fabric, and he builds it and manipulates it into this piece that, even standing alone, is alive,” she said.
That’s exactly what makes Posen’s work irreplaceable by robots.
“Technology can’t systemize something that’s emotional. And fashion is emotional. After all, AI is not wearing the clothes,” he said.
Another problem Posen sees in AI-assisted fashion is the boundary it sets for trend forecasting, an area where many retailers and scientists believe AI will make a real difference.
“I respect trend forecasting. That’s important if you are running a business. But I find it kind of irrelevant for the creative mind,” Posen said. “You can go on Pinterest and study a topic. But, at a certain point, the image stream you see is going to repeat itself. 
“My point is, basically any imagery that wasn’t inputted into a computer before the internet existed becomes irrelevant,” he added. “That unfortunately kills creativity.”
That said, in the vast landscape of fashion, there will likely be a space dominated by androids, sooner or later.
“The design process will become virtual. You will have brands that are designed by AI in the future,” Posen said. “As scary as it is, it’s exciting to be living in a time when we can see how tech becomes part of our evolutionary journey.”

A Brief Explanation for laymanReza Chu·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·4 min read·Apr 15, 2018741ListenShareIn the past two years, Artificial Intelligence has become one of the hottest topics. Thanks to AlphaGo, the general public believes A.I. is a monster that had beaten human and sooner it is going to take their jobs away. As a machine learning engineer, I see the necessity to explain what is A.I. to the layman which could clear the illustration forged by the media. Here we go.“AI is all about figuring what to do when you don’t know what to do.”, Peter Norvig.Artificial Intelligence is not a magical program that can think like a human. The mechanism behind it is to utilise different mathematic algorithms to learn from a tremendous amount of structured data to solve dedicated cognitive problems that originally can be only solved by human intelligence. And the robust part of A.I. is it can acquire a pattern from the provided data to solve a problem in high accuracy. Meanwhile, we don’t even know what is actually happening inside the program but the algorithm would take care of it. In a simple word, A.I. learns from the data feed by human to solve dedicated problem. Let’s take a look to these six major subfields in A.I.1. Computer Vision:e.g. Recognizing object from real world images or video, just like the iPhone X’s Face ID.2. Planning:e.g. Searching for the shortest path between your home and the nearest shopping mall.3. Natural Language Processing:e.g. Interpreting what are you saying, writing, etc.4. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:e.g. Chatbot that answer customer questions.5. Robotics:e.g. The self driving car that take care of your travel.6. Machine Learning:e.g Predicting the housing price by learning from the historical data.How does Artificial Intelligence Agent solve problems?So, how does A.I. learn? Typically, there are three learning methods, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In supervised learning, we would label the correct answer inside the data and the agent would learn the pattern by comparing the result with the target label in order to achieve accurate prediction.; In unsupervised learning, we would not tell what we are looking for but let the learning algorithm to help us divide the data into category as many as we desired.; Lastly, reinforcement learning is more like learning by doing. At the beginning, we do not have any labeled data, however, we would set up different policies with corresponding reward or penalty. The A.I. would learn the optimal by trying different actions in each condition to achieve the highest reward under the specified environment and policies.Can Artificial Intelligence Agent replace human?To develop an A.I. agent to solve a task, there are four basic criteria.1. We need to clearly define the problem domain and the learning objective.2. We have to provide structured data for the agent or we are able to design a good environment, policies and reward system for reinforcement learning.3. The data provided must contain useful information for the agent to learn from it. If the data fed in have no value, the agent would never be able to solve the task.4. Decide an evaluation method to measure the performance of the agent. Otherwise, we won’t know the model is accurate or not.Rule no.1: Garbage In, Garbage Out.From my experience, the hardest part of building a prediction model is to decide what sample data should I use and how to gather those data. Luckily, there are many open-sourced data and algorithm library that could let us to train our model much easier than few year before. However, you could also gather the desired data by yourselves.Conclusion ~ Will it take our job?Undoubtedly, A.I. would disrupt our world in the soon future, however, we should firstly understand it and think of the opportunities created by A.I. instead of blindly worrying the fourth industrial revolution would replace all of the jobs. A.I. technology required a large amount of training data to look for a specific pattern in order to resolve the problem. And it has its own bottleneck such as: Do we have the data? Does the specific problem has a pattern? Can we structure the information into computer interpretable data? Is the computer powerful enough to handle a huge amount of data. Moreover, A.I. would soon replaces jobs that are highly repeatable, however, it would also create many job posts, for instance: data scientist, data security engineer, etc. On top of it, applying the new technology to the real world needs to solve many political, legislative and humane problems which might take years. Let’s say the self driving car application, lots of researches and experiments proved that self driving car is safer than human driving. However, once it killed people in an accident (which happened lately in U.S.), who is going to take the responsibility? In addition, do we need a driver sitting in the driver seat in case of any malfunction, so he can switch it to manual mode to save lives? If a driver is compulsory for self driving car after legislation, it ain’t gonna bring a big impact on the driver job.It is very likely a large amount of traditional labor force, especially the grassroots class would be replaced by Robots and AI, however, the replacing process might take years and the society would have time to digest it gradually. The most important thing is we should learn about what is AI and think about how is it going to change our job instead of blindly panic. Hopefully this read could give you a brief glance of the A.I. world and motivated you to learn more about A.I.",https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/what-is-ai-a-brief-explanation-for-layman-f79f368702ea,,What is AI?

In their very provocative paper, Peter Battaglia and his colleagues, posit that in order for artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve the capabilities of human intelligence, it must be able to compute with highly structured data types, such as the ones humans deal with. This means that AI must be able to work with information about relationships between objects, which are effectively encoded as graphs, i.e. collections of nodes and edges between these nodes, and also attributes attached to the nodes and edges.
A simple example would be images, where one considers graphs which are shaped like a square grid, with the pixel values being the attribute attached to a particular node in the grid. The authors go on to describe the framework they have developed for computing with graph structured data, in particular describing how neural networks for this kind of computation can be built.  
Embedded in this work is the following question:
Where do the graphs come from?
The question recognizes the fact that most data is “sensory” in character, i.e. it is obtained by measuring numerical quantities and recording their values as coordinates of vectors in a high dimensional space, and consequently do not come equipped with any explicit underlying graph structure.
It follows that in order to achieve human like intelligence in studying such data, it is necessary to construct graph or relational structures from sensory data, and also that performing such constructions is a critical ingredient in human intelligence.  
The goal of this post is to describe a method for performing exactly this task, and to describe how neural networks can be constructed directly from the output of such methods. We can summarize the approach as follows.

A key ingredient is a geometry or metric on the set of features or sensors that are capturing the sensory data.
The second key ingredient is that of a covering of the set of features by subsets. The coverings typically are chosen to be well related to the geometry in a suitable sense.
The geometry and related coverings are used in conjunction to construct graph structures from the features defining the data.
They are also used to construct analogues of the pooling constructions used in convolutional neural networks, which permit the learning to be based on various levels of resolution.  

The interested reader should consult the Topological Data Analysis Based Approaches to Deep Learning and Topological Approaches to Deep Learning where the constructions are discussed in detail.
We strongly agree with the point of view expressed in the DeepMind/Google paper that their work rejects the false choice between “hand-engineering” and “end-to end” approaches to learning, and instead argues for the recognition that the approaches are complementary and should be treated as such. What follows is that we should be developing a wide variety of tools and methods that enable hand-engineering of neural networks. The methods described in the DeepMind/Google paper are a step in that direction, as are papers on TDA-based Approaches to Deep Learning and Topological Approaches to Deep Learning. 
We also observe that the benefits of such an approach go beyond improving the accuracy and speed of neural net computations. Once the point of view of the DeepMind/Google paper is adopted, one will be able to create algorithms which realize the idea of machine-human interaction.  In particular, they will be more transparent, so that one can understand their internal functioning, and also provide more complex “human-readable” outputs, with which humans can interact. This paper on the Exposition and Interpretation of the Topology of Neural Networks constitutes a step in that direction.
Finally, we observe that in order to fully realize this vision, it is important not only to make the computation scheme human readable, but also the input data. Without a better understanding of what is in the data, the improvements described by Battaglia and his colleagues will only get us part of the way to fully actualizing artificial intelligence. Topological methods provide tools for understanding the qualitative and relational aspects of data sets, and should be used in the understanding of the algorithms which analyze them.
Graphs from geometry
In the case of images, the graph structure on the set of attributes (pixels) is that of a square grid, with some diagonal connections included.  
  
Our first observation is that the grid is actually contained in a continuous geometric object, namely the plane. The importance of the plane is that it is equipped with a notion of distance, i.e. a metric in the mathematical sense (see Reisel’s work here).  The set of vertices are chosen so as to be well distributed through a square in the plane, so that every point in the square is close to one of the vertices.  In addition, the connections in the graph can be inferred from the distance. This is so because if we let r denote the distance from a vertex to its nearest neighbor (this is independent of what vertex we choose because of the regularity of the layout), then two vertices are connected if their distance is < √2r.  
So, the graph is determined by:
(a) a choice of subset of the plane and
(b) a notion of distance in the plane
The value of this observation is that we often have sets of attributes or features that are equipped with metrics. Some interesting examples were studied in this paper, where a study of the statistical behavior of patches in natural images was performed. One of the findings was that there is an important feature that measures the “angular preference” of a patch in the direction of a particular angle θ.  As we vary θ, we get a set of features which is geometrically laid out on a circle, which can be discretized and turned into the graph on the left below. A more detailed analysis showed a two-parameter set of features that are laid out in the form of a geometric object called a Klein bottle, shown with associated graph structure on the right below.

Analogous geometries can be found for 3D imaging and video imaging. The work in the Exposition paper has suggested larger spaces containing the Klein bottle which will apply to larger scale features and more abstract objects.
Purely data driven graph constructions
The constructions in the previous section rely on a prior knowledge concerning the features or a detailed data analytic study of particular sensing technologies. To have a method that is more generally applicable, without complicated data analysis, it is necessary to have methods that can quickly produce a useful graph structure on the set of features. Such a method exists, and is described in both the TDA paper as well as the Topology paper.  
Suppose that we have a data matrix, where the rows are the samples or observations, and the columns are features or attributes. Then the columns are vectors, and there are various notions of distance one might equip them with, including high-dimensional Euclidean distance (perhaps applied to mean centered and normalized columns), correlation, angle, or Hamming distance if the values are Boolean. There are typically many options. By choosing a distance threshold, we can build a graph whose nodes are the individual features. If the threshold is small, the graph will be sparser than if we choose a larger threshold. So, at this point we have a method for constructing a graph from sensory data. Further, the graph describes a similarity relation between the features, in the sense that if two features are connected by an edge, we know that their distance (regarded as a dissimilarity measure) is less than some fixed threshold, and therefore that they are similar to each other.
This construction certainly makes sense and generalizes the construction that is done for images. However, it produces graphs which are large in the sense that they have the same number of nodes as we have features.  They may also be dense in the sense that some nodes may have a very large number of connections, which is not ideal from the point of view of computation. We will address this problem via a form of compression of the graph structure.
To understand this construction, we will discuss another aspect of the deep learning pipeline for images, namely the pooling layers. We describe it as follows.
The “pooling” refers to pooling values of subsets of pixels, specifically smaller squares. The picture below describes the situation, where we have covered the pixel grid by nine smaller subgrids, each one two by two.

The idea of pooling is to create a new graph, this time three by three, with one node for each of the subgrids. The interesting point is that the creation of the new graph can be described in terms of the intersections of the subgrids only. Specifically, the nodes corresponding to two subgrids are connected by an edge if and only if the subgrids have at least one pixel in common.  The value of this observation is that this criterion generalizes to the general situation of a geometry on the space of features, provided that we can produce a covering analogous to the covering of this square by subgrids. We refer to the collection of subgrids as a covering of the set of pixels, where by a covering of a set X we mean a family of subsets U of X so that every element of X is contained in some member of the U covering.
Topological data analysis provides a systematic way of producing such coverings, using a method referred to as Mapper, which is described in the TDA and Topology papers.  
The output of this construction will be a family of graphs , ⌈1…,⌈r with the following properties.

Each vertex in each graph corresponds to a family of features.
The collections corresponding to vertices are small or localized in the assigned metric on the set of features.
Each graph is low-dimensional in the sense that the number of vertices that lie in a clique is bounded above.
The size of the sets of features corresponding to vertices grow as we move from ⌈1 to ⌈r. In other words, the graphs become coarser and coarser representations of the set of features.

The construction yields a systematic way of producing graph representations of the sensory data available from the data matrix.  It turns out that one can go directly from this representation to neural network architectures.
In fact, one could even imagine incrementally producing coverings using Mapper on the activation-values of the layers following the input layer. Occasionally recomputing the coverings and therefore the graph structure would allow the network to adapt its graph structure during training.
Constructing neural networks
The circular constructions given above can give some very simple geometric constructions of neural network architectures adapted to them.  For example, in the case of the circular networks described above, a picture of such a construction would look as follows.

Similar constructions are available for the Klein bottle geometries and others.
The construction of neural networks from the purely data driven constructions above is also quite simple.  Since each node of each graph corresponds to a set of features from the data matrix, we can declare that a node ν in ⌈r  is connected by a directed edge to a node w in ⌈r+1 if and only if the collection corresponding to ν and the collection corresponding to w contain at least one feature in common. This will describe a connection pattern for a simple feed-forward network with the nodes of ⌈r as the set of neurons in the r-th layer. A picture of a simple version of this construction is given below.

Summary
We have given an approach to assigning graph theoretic information to sensory or continuous data.  It depends on the assignment of geometric information in the form of a distance function on the set of features of a data set.  There are many constructions based on the mathematical discipline of topology (the study of shape) that should be useful for this task.  The methodology should yield the following:

Improvement of the transparency of the algorithms, since the sets of neurons are now organized in understandable geometric patterns.  In particular, coloring the geometric structures by activation values of neurons will make clearer the functioning of the network.
Improvement  in the explainability of the outputs, based also on the coloring of the topological models of the feature sets.  What such colorings often yield is a simplified understanding of the behavior of data based on groups of features rather than individual features, as is shown in the Ayasdi blog “Machine Intelligence for Statistical Inference and Human Interpreta….”
Because the topological model constructions have nodes that deal with groups of features, it is to be expected that using such models will help reduce the overfitting often occurring in such models.  Preliminary experiments suggest that this does in fact occur.
Structures that lend themselves to topological data analysis may be classified and their topological properties might have interesting and useful interpretations. For example, it has been shown that the spatial filters of CNN’s arrange themselves in simple circles and that these are indicative of a network’s ability to generalize to unseen data. In addition, the persistent homology of the activation maps of CNN’s can be used to detect adversarial examples.

Betterhalf.AI is looking to change the way traditional matchmaking sites offer matches in India by taking into account six relationship dimensions including emotional, intellectual, relationship, moral values. It will use these and more to offer matches driven by machine learning (ML) algorithm. Yeah, this means you will not have to sift through hundreds of matches to find relevant ones. Betterhalf.AI, launched by Pawan Gupta and Rahul Namdev in 2016, has created a grid of verified working professionals at companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Adobe and Accenture and applied a six-level verification system adding Facebook profiles, personal email, phone number, work email and government ID. “Our mission is to build world’s largest partner prediction engine. We live in a tech world today where we have prediction for self-driving cars — on Waymo/ Tesla, recommendations for e-commerce products — on Amazon, music — on Pandora/ Spotify and even friends — on Facebook. But we don’t have one for partners. Isn’t that surprising? We think building one is possible,” said CEO Gupta in an email interaction with indianexpress.com. ALSO READ: Google Home Mini review: Big things come in small packages The idea was conceived by the duo in 2015 while they were searching for their life partners on different matrimonial and dating sites. “Our friends were in the same boat and so we all had one issues or the other. We kept observing their partner search journeys for a year. Everyone around us complained.and at some point, we were not okay with this,” he said. Pawan, who is CEO of the company, claims the platform currently is used by more than a thousand users on a daily basis and is growing at 100 per cent week on week, with majority from the age group of 25-35 years. “Currently, we have done more than 300 matches on the platform and that is expected to cross 1000 in the next few weeks,” he added. Betterhalf’s AI engine uses the technology at five different stage - during registration, pre-chat stage, product gamification, post-chat stage and removal of any biased data using ML. Users can sign-up for the service by giving answers to 16 personality questions, which are used to find suitable matches. “We use the user’s basic partner preferences (Age range, height, caste, religion, location, education, salary etc.) to filter and rank those matches. This is how users receive matches and as they interact with more number of users, their matches improve over time, thereby leading them to find a compatible partner sooner with whom they are likely to be happier,” Pawan explained. The machine learning algorithm also improves with time and as users spend more time on Betterhalf.AI. “For example, if a user has visited 10 matches and five have mentioned that they like to travel, now if the user spends more time with these profiles then the system learns that this particular user is interested in matches who actually like travelling,” he pointed out. Betterhalf.AI also has a private ratings and feedback option that the company says helps it to “filter out the non-serious and creepy daters off the platform.” Currently available for desktop, the 10-member team of Betterhalf.AI is working on mobile app for Android and iOS, expected to become available in May 2018. “At Betterhalf, we take data security and privacy of user data very seriously. Firstly, we have stated clearly in our privacy policy that Betterhalf does not share, rent or sell any of personal or sensitive information with any third-party,” insisted Pawan. Once the matches are done, the company plans to tap their post marriage relationship happiness to offer users an even better AI-based partner prediction service.",,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.ie-premium-content-block', 'video': [], 'audio': []}",,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,,,,,2024.0,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}",,,,,1932.0,,,,,en,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-15,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/04/betterhalf_matches-page-with-focus-on-compatability-759.jpg', 'caption': '', 'description': 'Betterhalf, Betterhalf.

As time passed, they started opting for computer training. This summer, there are new trends. As you enter a training centre here, a robot welcomes you with folded hands, saying ‘Welcome to Smart Robotics’. And when you come to know they were made by Class IX students Ebel M Roy and Adhil S, you just realise how much the children as well as parents are hooked to the new technology in the state.Robotics, artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT) are in demand now..The camps provide awareness and hands-on training also in machine learning and mobile app development.The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) research officer Narayanan Kutty said the trend shows how children and parents are adapting to the changing education and job market..“The scope for conventional jobs is dwindling rapidly. At the same time, opportunities in future technology are growing. The parents, who have identified this change, are sending their kids to the summer classes dealing with robotics, artificial intelligence and IoT,” said Kutty..At the camps, the organisers teach electronics, mechanics and basic robotics. In addition, they impart training in the functioning of wired and wireless robots, 3D printing and unmanned aeriel vehicles. The projects are done by using Arduino, an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software and Raspberry Pi, a tiny and affordable computer that can be used to learn programming through fun, practical projects..Children are very much interested in robotics and coding of apps, according to Sajeesh Krishna, chief robotics engineer at Smart Robotics summer camp.“One advantage of the classes is it deviates the children from negative trends to the positive use of technology,” said Krishna. Students from Class V to engineering are attending the camps..While private institutions and a group of engineers are conducting these camps, co-operative players like UL Education are also joining hands with Kerala Startup Mission, UL Cyberpark, Tinker Hub and Fox Maker Labs to arrange summer camps.UL Education Director T P Sethumadhavan said career trends are fast changing..“Advanced IT and automation are acquiring momentum across the globe. It has been forecast by 2022, nine per cent of the jobs will be unknown to us. Internet will create lots of opportunities in the services sector. Digitalisation, e-commerce and advanced IT facilitate spectacular job opportunities. Innovation and technologies propel startups, which in turn will provide sustainable employment opportunities.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is penetrating industries from healthcare to advertising, transportation, finance, legal, education, and hospitality. Many of us may have already interacted with a chatbot on platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or We Chat. Chatbots are defined as an automated, yet personalized, conversation between software and human users.

The hospitality industry makes heavy use of chatbots to create more compelling customer and employee experiences. Consider Marriott's  Chatbotlr, a chatbot that helps customers make service requests from their smartphones. Chatbotlr provided early knowledge and learning for the development of MC, the Marriott Careers Chatbot, designed to enhance the job candidate experience.
David Rodriguez, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer at Marriott International, Inc., believes the key to success in using AI in the workplace is for HR to develop deeper and tighter relationships with strategic consumer-focused departments. ""At Marriott, we have created not only new HR roles but an entirely new department we call the Brand Talent Team, which is charged with re-imagining our employee experiences to emulate and support our best customer experiences. In fact, Marriott's new Chief Customer Experience Officer, Adam Malamut, was Marriott's Chief Talent Officer and worked in HR for 15 years before moving into Customer Experience, a role that reports to Marriott’s Executive Vice President and Global Chief Commercial Officer.
PROMOTED
As we enter a new industrial revolution, Accenture's latest research, Reworking The Revolution, polled over 14,000 workers across skill levels and generations and found that the full promise of AI depends on how humans and machines work together to deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. 

This research is reinforced by Gartner's latest prediction, estimating one in five workers will have an AI as their co-worker by 2022.
So, how are companies using AI to mirror their last best customer experience for employees? Marriott International and Hilton provide interesting use cases for how creating a compelling employee experience has gone beyond HR to become a key business initiative requiring a strong partnership between HR, IT, Marketing, Customer Experience, and Workforce Transformation. These type of partnerships are now starting to yield significant business results.  Four lessons in leveraging AI to enhance the employee experience are noteworthy for companies on the journey to create a best in class employee experience.

They include:
1. Identify a business problem to be solved using AI. 
Both Marriott and Hilton identified how AI could be used to deliver an improved candidate experience and leveraged AI to make deeper human connections with candidates. Marriott leveraged its early experience with launching Chatbolr to create MC, a Marriott Careers chatbot for Facebook Messenger which creates a more personalized candidate experience for job seekers. MC converses with job candidates much like a human recruiter, guiding them to apply for open jobs based on their skills and location, and even provides them with some education promoting the company culture and values as a fun way to learn about the various Marriott hotel brands which may align with their interests, skills and goals. As an indication of how engaging the job seekers find MC, 64% return later to initiate new conversations. Research reveals that 50% of job seekers do not hear back after submitting their resumes through traditional corporate channels, so one can see why MC has such a high return rate.
Similarly, Hilton saw an opportunity to create increased human connection and responsiveness in the application and interview process by integrating AI into the candidate experience. Matthew W. Schuyler, Hilton’s Chief Human Resource Officer, and Matthew Welsh, Hilton's Vice President of Global Recruiting, saw an opportunity to leverage the power of AI to reduce time to fill new job openings, improve the candidate experience, and reduce recruiters' administrative workload. This led to the development of Ally, a chatbot for inbound candidates found on the Hilton career site. As Welsh describes this: ""We leveraged AI into how we screen, source, and interview job candidates, and this means our recruiters have more time to focus on the candidate, communicate the Hilton employer brand proposition, and deliver a richer, and more uniquely human candidate experience."" Hilton went on to use AI for video interviews and assessments yielding a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 85 and a 40% improvement in interview hire rates. I used Ally to test the process for applying for a new job at Hilton, and after putting in my zip code and selecting the type of job I was looking for, I was immediately invited to apply for a possible job that fit my criteria. Then a description of the new job was sent to my cell phone with a link to complete the application. Total time for the process: Less than one minute and this left me with a very favorable impression of the Hilton brand!
Research documenting this relationship between the candidate experience and the consumer behavior indicates the growing importance of improving the candidate experience so it reinforces the employer brand. According to Talent Board's CandE Awards research, on average  41% of global candidates who feel they have had a “negative” overall one-star job seeker experience (based on a 1-5 Likert Scale rating) say they will take their alliance, product purchases, and relationship somewhere else. That means a potential loss of revenue for consumer-based businesses. On the other hand, 64% say they’ll definitely increase their employer relationships based on the very positive job seeker experiences they’ve have experienced with a brand.

2. Use AI to design recruiting for both successful job candidates and for disappointed ones.  
Marriott and Hilton both receive well over one million applications for job positions and extend offers to a fraction of them! While AI is being used to source, screen, interview, and make offers to job candidates, this should just be the start of using AI to improve the candidate experience. The question heads of HR and Global Recruiting must ask themselves is: what happens to the ""disappointed"" candidates, who have gone through the application process, but did not find a role that was right for them? One course of action is to bring forward-looking companies together to work on this issue. Hilton is now partnering with a consortium of companies in a collective talent network to share candidate profiles who were not offered positions and connect them to new job opportunities. In return, Hilton receives potential candidates from other employers for its open roles, thereby reducing sourcing time and costs.
3. Be a role model for the change you want to see in your workplace.
My recent book, The Future Workplace Experience: 10 Rules for Mastering Disruption in Recruiting and Engaging Employees, discussed the need for leaders to be workplace activists,  which was defined as a leader who gives a voice to making the changes we all desire in our organization. Workplace activists understand the importance of integrating the intelligent technologies we are using in our personal lives into the workplace, and will seize the opportunity to pull a team together and use agile principles of working to ""test, iterate, and re-test"" a new way to deliver value to employees.
If we want our careers to be relevant and employable,  I believe we must understand the power of these technologies to change, transform, and enhance the employee experience.  As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, say in their Harvard Business Review article, "" Over the next decade, AI won’t replace managers, but managers who use AI will replace those who don't. ""
4. Become a student of the Future of Work, regardless of your functional area.
Understanding the future of work is too important an area to leave to outside consultants or HR. All employees, regardless of their discipline, need to understand what work will look like tomorrow and how to prepare for this today. The pace of change we are experiencing in the workplace is exponential. The historian Norman Davies compared historical change to an avalanche. “The starting point is a snow-covered mountainside that looks solid. All changes take place under the surface and are rather invisible.” But the one certainty for anyone in the path of an avalanche is this: standing still is not an option.
As we contemplate the future of work, we must understand the power of AI to augment the employee experience. The new ways of sourcing, screening, scheduling, and interviewing candidates employed by Marriott and Hilton show just how much technological advances are impacting the candidate and employee experience.  How candidates discover potential employers, interview with them, and stay engaged in their talent communities is now being powered by AI.
But while AI is transforming the employee experience, HR leaders must examine and prepare for both the benefits and challenges of AI. One challenge looming is how to manage a workforce that is a blended one; including human workers, chatbots and robots.  HR leaders must be proactive in identifying this issue early and have a strategy in place for this.  The defining feature of the future workforce will not be job loss to AI but negotiating a new relationship between humans and machines. The future of work is here today, how prepared are you, your team and your organization?

      On March 18 in Tempe, Arizona, an Uber self-driving car struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, who was walking her bicycle across a street. The human driver was supposed to be monitoring the car’s behaviour, but did not do so. Its systems apparently did not detect the victim, as it neither slowed down nor tried to avoid hitting Herzberg

The fatal crash involving an autonomous car operated by Uber in the United States was a tragic but timely reminder of the dangers of companies rushing to implement artificial intelligence to be first to market.
At the time of the crash, the driver who should have been ready to react in just such an event as this was looking down. The car itself had apparently failed completely to see the pedestrian and didn’t slow down or try to avoid hitting her.
Real-world testing, and risks
Again, we are seeing a technology being principally tested to work under normal conditions so that it can be rolled out to market and not necessarily being built with safety as the primary focus. As the former developer of Uber’s machine learning and AI platform has said, car companies should be training their cars in simulated environments which can be programmed to train them in how to detect and avoid any number of possibilities of random events that the car could encounter on the road.
Machine learning suffers from a fundamental problem in that its ability to carry out a task depends on data that is used to train it. What exact algorithm it ends up using to fulfil its eventual purpose and what features are the most important is largely unknown. With deep learning, the multiple layers that make up the overall neural network of the machine learning software make this process even more mysterious and unknown.
We do know that machine learning software picks up biases in the data that is used to test it. Software that is used to calculate the risk of an offender committing a future crime and used frequently by courts in the US has been demonstrated to systematically calculate a significantly lower risk for white offenders than people of colour. Other researchers have shown that machine-learning algorithms learn gender biases that are inherent in the texts that are used to train them.
The dangers of now knowing how things work have been clearly demonstrated by Facebook’s recent admission that it really didn’t know what people were doing with data of millions of its users that Facebook had encouraged them to take. With the use of its platform for the spread of targeted fake news during the US presidential election, Facebook again admitted that it hadn’t realized that foreign governments would exploit this naivety to undermine democracy.
More than just Facebook
It would be wrong to single out Facebook for being the only company who didn’t know their software could be exploited to harm individuals and society. The “right to be forgotten” amendments to data-privacy legislation and enacted by the European Union was formulated specifically to deal with Google’s unwillingness to fix side effects of its search on the privacy of individuals. Legislation in many countries to make reporting of data breaches mandatory has been necessary because companies were unwilling to take cybersecurity, and the protection of their users’ data, seriously.
Given the past, there is no reason to believe that companies who are implementing systems based on AI are thinking of security and privacy by design. On the contrary, machine learning needs data, lots of it, and so companies are acquiring huge data repositories of detailed information in order to exploit it through algorithms. Whilst one could argue that handled responsibly, large amounts of data will be invaluable for research, in health matters in particular, the risks of collecting, storing and using that data, especially in a commercial setting are very high.

French government report
In France, Cédric Villani – the Field Prize–winning mathematician and member of the National Assembly – has delivered his final report detailing a national strategy for the study and exploitation of artificial intelligence. The recommendations cover many of the potential issues that could arise from trying to balance the demands for research, innovation and commercialisation of AI. They also recognise the need to safeguard society and individuals’ privacy and safety and suggests an active role for government in making sure that AI is used in a way that benefits society and respects human rights and values.
However, none of this will be easy. There has already been claims that Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into full effect on May 25, will put EU “firms at a competitive disadvantage compared with their competitors in North America and Asia.”
One must hope that tragedies like the death of 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, run down by a self-driving Uber car, and the widespread outrage of Facebook’s disregard for its users’ personal data will remind people that there is a benefit to measured technological progress and not today’s mantra of technological advancement at any price.

Published: Apr 06, 2018 05:23 AM ESTInteresting Engineering6 years ago0SharePixabayA prominent feature in science fiction over the years has been artificial intelligence. Since the earliest days of computing, scientists and other thinkers have been fascinated by the notion of creating a machine capable of replicating the human brain. It used to be thought that the analogy of the human brain is like a computer ran deep. However, we now know that the picture is much more complicated, the way that the brain works goes beyond a simple computer. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

We still do not fully understand how consciousness arises in the human brain, and there is still much debate surrounding whether consciousness can be separated from advanced intelligence. But artificial intelligence need not be this complex; we see far simpler examples of what we might describe as artificial intelligence on a regular basis. The voice assistants pre-installed on every modern smartphone are just one example and now these same AIs are being integrated into alarm clocks and speakers so that they can be used to control a variety of smart devices around the home.
Artificial intelligence is increasingly finding its way into industrial and manufacturing contexts. There are even AIs being used to conduct high-frequency trading on the stock market. AIs are now everywhere, meaning that it is becoming easy to forget just how amazingly complex they are. AIs have a great deal to offer the world of engineering. Some of the most exciting current and prospective uses of artificial intelligence are within the field of engineering.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
The term was first used at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. However, while artificial intelligence has long been considered and discussed in an abstract, theoretical sense, it is only in the last decade that we have begun to see it being used in consumer technology. It has now become so ubiquitous in our everyday lives that it is easy to forget what a complex demonstration of technological prowess and understanding artificial intelligence represents.
In answering the question of what artificial intelligence is, and what the term means today, we need to consider what constitutes intelligence. This is not as simple as many people assume it should be. For example, would you consider all animals to be intelligent? Or rather, to have intelligence?
Some animals, such as cats, octopuses, and even dolphins, among others, demonstrate high levels of intelligence. When comparing two different animals, such as a mouse and a gorilla, there are a number of ways that scientists can measure their relative intelligence. But objectively defining and measuring intelligence is difficult.
The AIs that are used in the engineering sector combine both software and hardware components. Think of the robots on a car assembly line and the software that controls them. They are in themselves quite impressive feats of engineering, but are they intelligent?
You might be surprised to learn just how smart and sophisticate our uses of artificial intelligence in engineering are becoming. Smart production lines are definitely the future. But how exactly does artificial intelligence make such a big difference to the engineering sector?
Manufacturing
The rise of artificial intelligence promises to allow us to develop machines capable of performing ever more complicated manufacturing, and even design, tasks. Machines that are capable of learning and improving without human intervention are the ultimate goal, and this would have significant, and far-reaching implications. Furthermore, in our pursuit of creating ever more powerful AIs, we are discovering information about how our own brains work and how we approach the learning process, both consciously and unconsciously.
Many engineers fear that their jobs could soon be taken over by sufficiently advanced robots. As our manufacturing and design capabilities have continued to expand, we have been able to build machinery that is capable of replicating just about everything that a human can do on an assembly line. These fears are not unfounded then, as automation is continuing to take jobs away from people in a number of different areas.
Things aren’t entirely bleak, however, a Stanford University study entitled ‘One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence’, reported that there was no imminent threat to workers. The study argued that even if or when artificial intelligence does have a significant impact on jobs, this will be balanced by numerous other positive effects on society.
Perhaps the most prominent example of artificial intelligence being used in engineering is in the field of automobile manufacturing.
The combination of software and hardware that has made its way on to the manufacturing line has grown progressively more sophisticated over the years. Initially, these robots were performing simple engineering tasks that involved relatively large components and movements. Today, they are capable of precision movements and of emulating the most intricate parts of the process.
Big Data
It would not be unreasonable to say that we are now living in an age of data. Data is a commodity unlike any other that the world has ever known. It is extremely valuable financially, but it can also be used directly in order to give a business a massive edge over the competition.
Artificial intelligence, especially in its most sophisticated implementations, relies heavily on large data sets and algorithmic learning. 
One of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence within the field of engineering is machine learning. Machine learning is dependent upon the constant generation and analysis of data. It is via this process, of extensively collecting data about performance and subsequently analyzing it, that an artificial intelligence is able to learn. If the program is equipped with the right algorithms to identify mistakes, and formulate solutions, then it can perform a process and continually refine it.
For engineers who are working on large scale public projects, big data will be a staple of their work. Big data analysis can tell researchers, in unprecedented detail, where the flow of people in urban environments is at its densest. This, in turn, means that public infrastructure decisions can be based on objective scientific analyses.
Also, within the context of engineering for public works, big data can be used to analyze how well certain solutions have performed when implemented elsewhere. Big data can also allow for an objective and detailed comparison of how similar the current environment is to ones where the solution has been used before. This is relatively simple when using big data analytics techniques, but would be a long and expensive process to complete otherwise.
Machine Learning
One of the most significant technological concepts for the future of artificial intelligence-led engineering is machine learning. Machine learning is the study of exactly how machines learn. The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence isn’t just to have machines that can learn, but to have machines that are capable of self-analysis. Such a machine could assess the efficiency of its learning methods and so refine its processes to a much greater degree.
But what would the practical applications of machine learning look like? Well, imagine if every one of those robotic arms you see putting cars together contained a tiny camera. Each arm could then look over the work of the previous robots along the assembly line. If they identify an issue then they could formulate a solution.
We already have the technology to accomplish the first part. We can take a high-resolution video of a half-assembled car and develop algorithms to identify whether there are any clear faults. We could then have the robots respond to the fault based on what they ‘see’. 
Machine learning takes this process to the next level. With machine learning, the data collected by all of the robots involved in production can be pooled together. With a central artificial intelligence to control each one, it can learn which problems are most likely to appear. With machine learning, that central artificial intelligence would also be able to formulate solutions to problems, rather than simply following pre-defined routines.
Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing is a field of study dedicated to improving the ability of humans and machines to communicate. In particular, natural language processing aims to improve the sophistication with which machines can respond to the human voice. Like with machine learning, natural language processing makes heavy use of large data sets and algorithm-based learning.
Think of the voice assistant in your smartphone. If you have owned a number of smartphones over the last decade or so, then you may well have noticed how much the accuracy with which they hear and transcribe our voices has improved. While your phone might be able to identify the words that you’ve said, this isn’t the same as understanding.
Right now, your phone looks for certain keywords that it understands and works out what you are asking it to do based on context. It then responds or performs an action, and sometimes vocalizes a response. Natural language processing aims to refine this process by allowing the machine to develop a deeper understanding of language. If this understanding is refined enough, then it will reach a point where the machine can deduce what someone wants when presented with an entirely new command or request.
In the Iron Man films, Tony Stark is able to have long conversations with his home assistant, an artificial intelligence called Jarvis. When Tony is designing his Iron Man suits he holds conversations with Jarvis, Jarvis is able to produce schematics according to specifications which Tony expresses, in usual conversational language. This seems like pure science fiction, yet this is exactly the direction that researchers hope to one day take the field in.
For example, if an engineer is trying to work out how to reinforce a particular feature in their design, wouldn’t it be great if they could just ask their computer? Or in the case of an assembly line, imagine if a human overseer could give the robots feedback. They could ask the robots to perform their roles in a slightly different way, to make adjustments, or even to try new things and analyze the result.
These applications are some way off, we still have much to learn about machine learning. However, in recent years we have already made some significant advances that few people could have predicted.
Image Processing
You might be wondering what image processing could have to do with engineering? The connection might not immediately seem obvious, but this is another technology which is vital to implementing artificial intelligence to its full potential in the field of engineering.
When humans see an object, it is because light is entering the eye and being converted into an electric signal. This signal is then carried to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain turns this electronic signal into an image, it is this image that we ‘see’.
Machines work in a very similar way. We can set up a camera in order to record an image, and we can display this image to a user. However, this is not the same as the machine understanding the image. With image processing algorithms, we can have machines analyze what they see and react accordingly. From an engineering perspective, this means we could have machines which are able to identify structural abnormalities and other issues that have identifiable visible signs.
This kind of image processing technology could also make a significant difference to the workplace safety of engineers. There may often be visual clues indicating structural deficiencies and weaknesses that are not immediately obvious until the structure fails. By combining image processing with data input from other sensors, artificial intelligence can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, on both construction sites and the scenes of fires, structural integrity can become a concern. Having a more reliable way for engineers to assess integrity could save lives.
Internet of Things
Many of you can probably still remember a time when being connected to other people meant being at home. Once you ventured outside, there was no 3G or 4G network in place for internet browsing. Eventually, very slow and expensive mobile internet came in the form of WAP.
Today, we are used to having vast amounts of data flying through the airwaves all around us. As smart devices become more common in our homes, we are also beginning to see the practical potential of being able to link devices together. 
The Internet of Things refers to a hypothetical network, which would connect everyday devices and things together, in the same way that the internet connects computers from around the world. Allowing the various devices in our lives to collect and share data would open up some exciting new possibilities.
As the Internet of Things gradually becomes a reality, it will increasingly become something that engineers consider during the design process. With the Internet of Things as a reality, the virtually endless number of ways that we can connect devices and have them work together will allow new and innovative solutions to many problems.
Jobs
No discussion of the impact that artificial intelligence is having on engineering would be complete without mentioning the impact of automation on jobs. In many places, there are widespread fears and anxieties surrounding automation. As machines begin to replace humans in certain jobs, there are worries that we will eventually have no need to hire people at all.
[see-also]
It should be acknowledged that the threat to jobs is very real, and in some areas, it has a significant effect on communities. However, most researchers agree that the long-term benefits of automation outweigh the potential drawbacks.
In the case of engineers specifically, artificial intelligence is opening some exciting new horizons for the field. These new opportunities should be embraced. It is important to realize that many of these advances will make a big difference to our ability to tackle the largest issues facing our civilization.

Artificial intelligence has had an impact on just about every conceivable industry and sector, engineering is no exception. There are a number of different applications of artificial intelligence that are of considerable use to engineers. From allowing more intuitive and innovative interactions with software and machinery, to keeping a watchful eye over the work of engineers as well as other machines, artificial intelligence has many roles to play.
As our methods of collecting an analyzing large data sets become more refined, we are able to unlock the full potential of big data and algorithmic learning. We have always understood that both of these concepts can yield impressive results, but the transformative nature that they both have on engineering demonstrate that they are even more powerful than we once thought.

        Can Artificial Intelligence Make Teaching More Personal?

Noah Berger for The ChronicleAlegra Eroy-Reveles (right), an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at San Francisco State U., uses Gradescope. “Getting feedback from a test you took two weeks ago is not going to help,” says Eroy-Reveles, shown here with Anna Martinez-Saltzberg, an instructor. “It’s important to get it in a timely manner.”





Consumer products like Alexa and Google Home can tell us how to prepare a meal and answer dinner-party trivia questions about the Treaty of Paris. So how long before tools powered by artificial intelligence start assuming more of the classroom work that professors handle today?The answer is simple: They already have. At the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, students in a statistics class last fall had their writing assignments evaluated by an automated text-analysis tool. And in 2016, some of the students in a computer-science class at the Georgia Institute of Technology were surprised to learn that one of the TAs answering their questions remotely all semester was actually a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.

Consumer products like Alexa and Google Home can tell us how to prepare a meal and answer dinner-party trivia questions about the Treaty of Paris. So how long before tools powered by artificial intelligence start assuming more of the classroom work that professors handle today? The answer is simple: They already have. At the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, students in a statistics class last fall had their writing assignments evaluated by an automated text-analysis tool. And in 2016, some of the students in a computer-science class at the Georgia Institute of Technology were surprised to learn that one of the TAs answering their questions remotely all semester was actually a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. The bigger question, however, is this: How does teaching change as these AI tools start assuming more classroom work? That’s harder to answer. A new grading tool called Gradescope — powered by AI and now being used for more than 175,000 students at 550 colleges — offers one window on the possibilities. The tool helps automate the grading process without requiring instructors to rely on multiple-choice tests. Several professors who use it say the automation has actually made it easier for them to personalize their teaching — although some of their students have needed some convincing.

 Instructors also say the technology has made their grading fairer and faster — the latter an especially useful factor for courses like chemistry, in which students’ mastery of new material depends on their understanding what came before. “Getting feedback from a test you took two weeks ago is not going to help,” says Alegra Eroy-Reveles, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at San Francisco State University, now in her third year of using the tool. “It’s important to get it in a timely manner.” Because Gradescope has made grading tests easier, Eroy-Reveles is giving more of them. Instead of three major exams a semester, she now gives eight smaller tests. “It will take me about three hours to grade about 100 of them,” she says. The tool can read handwritten answers and can group together all the correct formulas in one batch and each variation of the wrong answer in separate batches. Thanks to those AI features, she’s able to quickly see what her students are missing.  The timesaving tool was developed by Arjun Singh and Sergey Karayev as Ph.D. students at the University of California at Berkeley. Working as TAs in a computer-science class on artificial intelligence in 2012, they felt buried by the tedium of having to grade 100 tests by hand and, as Singh recalls, “writing the same thing 50 times as your students make the same mistakes 50 times.” As student of AI themselves, they figured there had to be a way to deploy machine learning to make their own jobs easier. By the summer of 2014 they had written the code that could read students’ names off a form and recognize patterns in handwritten answers, such as chemical formulas for acids, as long as they were entered in a designated area on standardized-test forms. Their software could also identify and cluster those answers into groups. “We built this because we wanted a tool for ourselves,” Singh says.

 With another college friend and Singh’s faculty adviser, they established Gradescope as a company. They hoped that the tool’s main AI feature — its ability to read patterns not programmed in ahead of time — would set it apart from the few other automated grading tools in use. The tool doesn’t do all the work. Instructors, using a standardized form, must still scan in all the tests and determine how much weight to assign to each answer. That’s fundamental to the process, says Singh. For many professors, “the exam is the last line of defense” in a teaching environment increasingly influenced by standardized-course materials provided by publishers and other courseware developers. “They want to be involved in it.” Seth Anthony, an associate professor of chemistry at the Oregon Institute of Technology, tried Gradescope for a final exam last fall and is now using it for his general chemistry course, which has 40 engineering students. He says the tool has made him more attuned to the patterns of students’ mistakes, which he can more easily spot in weekly quizzes. And because the tool requires him to establish the grading rubric upfront, he says, “I can tell that my grading is fairer as a result.” The AI features in Gradescope “are not profoundly deep at this point,” he notes. The tool recognizes handwriting and can cluster answers, but it does not actually learn from previous patterns. Still, he appreciates its benefits, even if some of his students have been a bit uneasy about receiving their grades from an automated system. For some of them, he’s had to provide reassurance that he, as the instructor, was really determining their grades. Artificial-intelligence, Anthony says, “enables me to be more personal, but I can see how students would perceive it as more impersonal.”

That down-home resistance raises a question farmers might be tackling before much of the rest of the workforce: Can new technology ever beat old intuition — even when it comes to a bunch of cows?The AI that Watson’s farm uses — called Ida, for “The Intelligent Dairy Farmer’s Assistant” — tracks his cows’ tiniest movements through their collars and then graphs and dissects them en masse. Those “real-time cattle analytics” are then used by the AI to assess diet and movement and predict health issues of concern, such as lameness or udder infections.As silly as this intricate level of maximum optimization might sound, particularly in relation to a herd of cows that spend much of the day staring blankly or relieving themselves,Watson said, it could mean the difference between a cow’s healthy milking or premature death — and the difference between making or losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Ida AI has sparked some early interest among farmers eager to compete in an industry in which low milk prices and farm layoffs have everyone on edge. And while truck drivers and ­cashiers see AI as an omen of job elimination, the farmers say they’re in a labor crunch from years of too few young people getting into farming and need all the help they can get.Connecterra, a development team based in the Netherlands, built Ida with help from TensorFlow, the giant AI toolbox that Google created for its own apps and opened to the public in 2015. That release sparked a major wave of AI development, giving start-ups a shortcut to calculating advanced mathematics and creating learning machines.Google has joined other tech giants in pushing forcefully into AI, with chief executive Sundar Pichai telling a town-hall crowd in January that AI “is one of the most important things humanity is working on” and “more profound than electricity or fire.” (He did not explicitly mention cows.)Standing one March morning among his cows at Seven Oaks Dairy, one of three farms he runs as part of his Hart Agriculture brand, Watson pulls out his iPhone to show off his Ida app. The AI says he has three “potential health problems to be checked” among his herd: Cow #14433 is eating less, while cows #10172 and #3522 are “ruminating,” or chewing, less, a sign they might feel ill. His herd’s cows “to be inseminated” count is at zero, as signified by a reassuring green check mark.At 6-foot-4, with combine-wide shoulders and a Kiwi accent, the New Zealand-born Watson, 46, looks like a rugby player — which he was, playing a linebacker-like position in the late 1990s for a semiprofessional team called the Hurricanes. Shortly afterward, he moved to lead a cattle-grazing research program at the University of Georgia, where he taught and advocated for the increasingly rare practice of letting cows amble about aimlessly on a pasture, eating as they go.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis farm’s cattle — crossbreeds of America’s classic black and white moo cow, the Holstein, and New Zealand’s relatively slimmer brown Jersey bulls — spend almost all day grazing on the thousands of acres of ryegrass and Bermuda grass on his farms. That makes tracking their free-range eating and movement harder than at the average American “confinement” dairy, where cows are kept in stalls and fattened on corn and grains.Share this articleShareSpotting problems the old way required closely watching the herd day and night, “unless it’s really obvious — you know, she’s walking or limping or there are buzzards flying overhead,” Watson said. “Buzzards aren’t a particularly good health program.”The cows’ orange transmitters beam data over the hills of Watson’s pastures to a set of antennae near the milking parlor. A “base station” computer then gulps up and processes all that sensor data, doing much of the AI work locally to avoid the problem of spotty rural Internet service. The sensors the animals wear pay the price for much of this data exchange, Connecterra co-founder Yasir Khokhar said: “You don’t want to know what cows do with them.”The Ida AI was first trained to comprehend cow behavior via thousands of hours of video and sensor inputs, as well as simpler approaches, including Khokhar’s mimicking bovine techniques with a sensor in his pocket. (“I was the first cow,” he said.) Every day brings more cow data and farmer feedback that help the AI learn and improve.The AI, Khokhar estimates, has processed about “600 cow years of data” and gains about eight years of new cow data every day.The AI now logs seven distinct cow behaviors: walking, standing, lying down, eating, chewing, drinking and idling. Other behaviors are on the way, Khokhar said, though he could not disclose them, calling them part of the “secret sauce.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDairy farmers have used sensors for years. But Ida’s developers say its AI can do things old programs can’t, by learning from cow behavior patterns that can pinpoint injuries, predict the onset of certain diseases and “predict peak ovulation time with over 90 percent accuracy.” The AI can also track how changes to cows’ bedding, feed and environment can affect, for instance, how much milk they’re making or how much they’re lying around.Khokhar, who said he conceived the AI idea while living on a Dutch dairy farm, launched his start-up in late 2016 and counts a few thousand cow “subscriptions” on farms in seven countries, including the United States, Spain and Pakistan. The company covers all the equipment and service work and sells monthly subscriptions. Farmers’ prices start at about $3 a month per cow, plus a $79.99-per-cow start-up fee, and Watson estimates he has invested about $17,000 in the system so far.Agriculture has long been one of Big Technology’s juiciest target industries. Revamping the way farmers feed the planet, in the face of existential crises such as food shortages and climate change, would be audacious, revolutionary — and highly profitable. Start-ups and farmers are using camera-equipped robots to pick apples and sort cucumbers, running driverless tractors to harvest grain, and flying scanner drones to spot poachers and survey livestock.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBeyond the Ida collars, other tech start-ups make cow pedometers, robot milkers, tail sensors and electroshock collars that can stop or shift a herd.But even some farmers who have invested heavily in new technology balk at the idea of paying for more. Everett Williams, the 64-year-old head of the WDairy farm near Madison, Ga., said his farm has all kinds of sensors that print out who-knows-how-many reports on matters such as cow activity and whether wild hogs have gotten into his pens. They give him less data than the Ida AI would, he says, but he feels that he doesn’t have the space in his brain for another data stream. “You can only handle so many text alerts,” he said.Systems such as Connecterra also are enduring early criticism beyond the farm. Because AI can help detect early disorders and walking disabilities, conservationists have criticized the systems as encouraging the breeding of a super-cow by speeding underperformers to the slaughterhouse.Rodgers, who runs his “daddy-daughter” family dairy farm in Dearing, Ga., said he’s no Luddite when it comes to farm technology. His “super-system” features cow-tracking transponders and, soon, a DeLaval VMS, which milks cows with laser-guided robot arms and is advertised as the “ultimate automatic milking machine.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHis system, unlike Ida, doesn’t track cud-chewing or use AI to tell him which cows to watch or what to do. But he’s okay with that. That’s the way things have always been done here, and he hopes they’ll be that way for a long time.“There’s no substitute for watching your animals. It’s an art and a science, and I hope my daughter and nephew get better at it than I am,” he said. The cattle, he added, don’t care much about evolving with the times. “You cannot bore a cow to death.”Share26 CommentsNewsletterWednesdaysThe Color of MoneyAdvice on how to save, spend and talk about your money for the short and long term from Michelle Singletary.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

				Reading brain waves was useless until A.I. got involved. Now mind reading has real-world, practical applications.

Here’s a thought: Mind-reading software is not only ready for commercial use, but it will actually be of practical use in everyday business applications.
But wait, you say. That’s creepy, invasive and useless. Read this column, though, and you just might change your mind about that. (And if you do, your gadgets will know.)
The missing ingredient
Futurists have predicted mind-reading technology for years. And while the detection of brain-wave patterns has been possible for decades, the missing ingredient was the ability to interpret them.











 
 
 
But now, thanks to artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning, we can finally know what’s going on inside people’s minds.

The general process is this. Researchers have developed software that takes readouts from people’s brains and matches them to words or pictures. Once mapped, future readouts can be read, interpreted and used for various kinds of mind-revealing or mental-control applications.
For example, MIT geniuses have invented a face-mounted device, plus a machine-learning application, that performs real-time speech-to-text conversion — but without the speech part.











 
 
 
I’d better explain that.
Electrodes on the device intercept neuromuscular signals sent by the brain to the face, and the machine-learning application transcribes them into text. It replaces vocalization with “subvocalization,” or “silent speech.”
Researchers use a neural network to match specific neuromuscular signals with specific words. Each person’s physiology is different. The researchers were able to achieve 92% accuracy after 15 minutes of customization and training.











 
 
 
The device also provides bone conduction output. That means you could make requests of a virtual assistant and get results audible only to you, all without the knowledge of people sitting right in front of you.
This is a surprising use for mind-reading technology, because it doesn’t “read” thoughts in general, only “instructions” sent from the brain to the face to speak (even if actual speaking doesn’t audibly or visually occur).
Also, it merely takes an existing behavior — spoken and audible interaction with a virtual assistant — and makes it silent and invisible, thereby increasing the range of situations where one could use a virtual assistant.











 
 
 
A video shows just how well this could work.
Of course, the device itself looks ridiculous. Nobody’s going to wear this in public. What’s important about this research is its proof that subvocalization can be a computer interface.
Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, have created a mind-reading device that also turns mental activity into text with better than 90% accuracy. Instead of understanding the words a person is subvocalizing, it can detect what that person is hearing, with brain activity alone.











 
 
 
The science was a bit gruesome.
The researchers took advantage of a kind of epilepsy treatment whereby electrodes are implanted directly on the surface of the brain. Scientists used those electrodes for a second purpose, which was to monitor brain waves in the auditory cortex. They took that data and used algorithms to decode the specific speech sounds as they were being heard by the subject.
It’s the first step toward creating an externally worn gadget that can be used to convert thoughts to text — either “perceived” or “produced” speech.











 
 
 
Carnegie Mellon University research has found ways to read “complex thoughts“ based on brain scans, and output text accordingly. The university’s study demonstrated that complex thinking could enable its A.I. to predict the next “sentence” in the thought process.
Even Facebook has a mind-reading project in the works. The social networking company’s secretive Building 8 division is working on a way for users to send Facebook Messenger messages using thoughts alone.
Microsoft, ever the user-interface company, was granted patents last year for interfaces that use brain activity to “change the state of a computer or applications.”











 
 
 
One example is to turn down the volume of music based on the mental activity of being irritated by loud noise. It could be used for any number of Microsoft-related products, from enhancing the accuracy of a mouse to enabling next-level applications in the company’s HoloLens mixed-reality system.
Mind-reading research is also making gains in reading visuals, not just words.
A recent University of Toronto Scarborough study was able to roughly re-create faces shown to subjects based on their brain activity.











 
 
 
Thirteen subjects were shown 140 faces. Electroencephalogram (EEG) readouts were processed by an A.I. algorithm developed by the scientists, and produced blurry but recognizable copies of what the subjects were shown.
Researchers are certain they’ll soon be able to re-create faces from memory alone, a feat that has obvious law-enforcement applications.
Japanese researchers at the University of Kyoto are working on a neural network system that performs in a similar way to the University of Toronto research. Subjects are shown pictures, then functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans plus A.I. can estimate what those pictures looked like based on blood flow to the brain.











 
 
 
Researchers at Purdue University are also reading minds using A.I. and fMRI machines. They showed subjects videos and used A.I. to train their software to predict brain activity in the visual cortex. Over time, they could figure out what the person was looking at based on brain activity alone.
Mind-reading apps are also showing up in other contexts.
A startup called Neurable is working on a sci-fi virtual-reality (VR) video game called Awakening, in which you pick up objects and even throw them with thoughts alone. The game comes with an electrode headband that connects to an HTC Vive VR headset.











 
 
 
As with the MIT technology, Neurable’s game doesn’t read “thoughts,” but instead uses neural activity as commands or instructions.
A participant in HTC’s Vive X accelerator program, called Looxid Labs, is building a mobile VR headset with built-in emotion-detection technology that uses both eye tracking and brainwave monitoring.
The company has also developed attachments for the HTC Vive that do the same thing. Developer kits are scheduled for release this summer.











 
 
 
On a more practical level, car giant Nissan revealed its IMx KURO concept car, complete with an EEG headset, at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show.
The system uses monitored brainwaves to speed up the reaction of the car. For example, when it detects that the driver intends to apply the brakes, it starts braking even before the driver stomps on the brakes. Nissan claims that reaction times can be sped up by as much as half a second.
The best application is for everyday business use
What’s now becoming clear is that the best use of mind-reading A.I. is not stand-alone applications for mind control or telepathy. Instead, it will almost certainly be the enhancement and perfection of existing business applications.











 
 
 
Autocorrect and speech recognition could be improved to something close to 100% accuracy by combining existing technologies with mind-reading applications to understand intent or thought processes.
Instead of the sci-fi scenario of some cyborg brainiac bringing finger to temple and mentally commanding armies of robots, mind-reading applications may simply make everything happen more accurately and automatically.
Lights and sounds may turn up or down based on mental preference at the moment. User interfaces could always do exactly what we want them to.
And our own thoughts might be reflected back at us without manually writing them down and reading what we wrote.











 
 
 
Now that A.I. makes real mind reading possible, it’s time to consider that such applications might be practical, productivity-enhancing and actually enjoyable to use.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Elon Musk talks about AI in “Do You Trust This Computer?” (Cinetic Media / Papercut Films via YouTube)
If you want to get really scared about the future, you could see “A Quiet Place” this weekend at your local theater — or you could stream “Do You Trust This Computer?” for free.
The latter movie, about the potential threat posed by artificial intelligence, comes with a thumbs-up from Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla who has long voiced serious concerns about AI.
Musk is one of the prominent interviewees in “Do You Trust This Computer?” — which was made by Chris Paine, the filmmaker behind “Who Killed the Electric Car?” Paine’s new 78-minute documentary had its premiere on Thursday night, and is available for free streaming through Sunday.

Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paine’s new AI movie for free until Sunday night at https://t.co/WehHcZX7Qe
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 6, 2018
Musk brings the money quote when he points out that the evil leaders of the past, such as Adolf Hitler, held only limited sway because they were mortal. That wouldn’t be the case if an evil but superintelligent computer were to take control, he says.
“You would have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape,” he says.
Other cautions come from the likes of Berkeley’s Stuart Russell, the Singularity Institute’s Ray Kurzweil, MIT’s Max Tegmark, Stanford’s Jerry Kaplan and James Barrat, the author of “Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.”
You get the idea.
Microsoft Research’s Eric Horvitz, IBM’s David Ferrucci and Kitty Hawk’s Sebastian Thrun also chime in, but I get the feeling that they’re not as fearful of a Terminator-style takeover (and yes, there’s a clip from the “Terminator” movie).

The documentary touches on the current debate over Facebook’s flaws, but Musk singles out Google Deepmind for special concern. “With a little software update, that AI could take control of the whole Google system, which means they could do anything,” he says.
Rather than trying to beat the machines, Musk argues that we should assimilate them — by developing brain-computer interfaces that will give us AI powers. That’s the point behind Neuralink, one of the ventures he’s backing.
On that point, I side with Jonathan Nolan, the co-creator of HBO’s “Westworld,” who gets a lot of screen time in Paine’s documentary. When Nolan shared the stage with Musk at last month’s South by Southwest conference, he was somewhat skeptical about getting a brain implant.
“I’m keeping my brain air-gapped,” Nolan said.
There’s no question that automation, robotics and AI will transform society in the years to come — particularly when it comes to employment trends. But the outcome is sure to be more nuanced than a “Terminator” prequel.
For a different perspective on the issue, check out what Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, has to say in these reports:

The ongoing AI race between the US and China has taken another turn with news that Chinese firm SenseTime has raised $600 million (£425 million) at a valuation of $3 billion (£2 billion) – making it the world’s most valued artificial intelligence startup.
The company, behind the facial-recognition systems used by Chinese authorities, revealed on Monday it closed its series-C funding round with a record-breaking amount of capital. SenseTime CEO Li Xu said in a statement that the company plans to use the funds to grow its presence overseas and “widen the scope for more industrial application of AI”.

SenseTime hasn’t given specifics on who invested what, but Bloomberg is reporting that ecommerce titan Alibaba has sought the biggest stake in the company, with chipmaker Qualcomm, electronic retailer Suning.com Co and Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte among the other contributors.

Joe Tsai, Alibaba’s executive vice chairman, said: “SenseTime is doing pioneering work in artificial intelligence. We are especially impressed by their R&D capabilities in deep learning and visual computing. Our business at Alibaba is already seeing tangible benefits from our investments in AI and we are committed to further investment.”
SenseTime reportedly serves more than 400 customers, including Honda, Huawei and, Nvidia, although its most notable partner is, inarguably, the Chinese government. The firm’s AI systems are used by the state’s surveillance, processing vast amounts of data across the nation’s CCTV cameras, along with newer systems such as facial-recognition sunglasses. The company eventually aims for its developing ‘Viper’ system to juggle 100,000 live-streams simultaneously from ATMs, traffic cameras and a range of other scanners, automatically processing and tagging individuals.    
The company’s rapid growth emphasises China’s wider goal to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. The competing development of AI technology between China, the US and the rest of the world, is raising questions about the ethical standpoint of future technologies.
“Clearly there is a global competition happening in terms of AI,” Antony Walker, deputy CEO of techUK, told Alphr at the end of last year. “China in particular is very focused. People are coming to realise that your fundamental values need to be embedded in your approach to AI, and doing this with the democratic tradition in Europe and the US is something we need to get right.”
