The European Commission recently published a proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence (AI). This is the first document of its kind to attempt to tame the multi-tentacled beast that is artificial intelligence. 
“The sun is starting to set on the Wild West days of artificial intelligence,” writes Jeremy Kahn. He may have a point.
When this regulation comes into effect, it will change the way that we conduct AI research and development. In the last few years of AI, there were few rules or regulations: if you could think it, you could build it. That is no longer the case, at least in the European Union. 
There is, however, a notable exception in the regulation, which is that is does not apply to international organizations like the United Nations.
Naturally, the European Union does not have jurisdiction over the United Nations, which is governed by international law. The exclusion therefore does not come as a surprise, but does point to a gap in AI regulation. The United Nations therefore needs its own regulation for artificial intelligence, and urgently so.
AI in the United Nations
Artificial intelligence technologies have been used increasingly by the United Nations. Several research and development labs, including the Global Pulse Lab, the Jetson initiative by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , UNICEF’s Innovation Labs and the Centre for Humanitarian Data have focused their work on developing artificial intelligence solutions that would support the UN’s mission, notably in terms of anticipating and responding to humanitarian crises.
United Nations agencies have also used biometric identification to manage humanitarian logistics and refugee claims. The UNHCR developed a biometrics database which contained the information of 7.1 million refugees. The World Food Program has also used biometric identification in aid distribution to refugees, coming under some criticism in 2019 for its use of this technology in Yemen.
In parallel, the United Nations has partnered with private companies that provide analytical services. A notable example is the World Food Programme, which in 2019 signed a contract worth US$45 million with Palantir, an American firm specializing in data collection and artificial intelligence modelling.

No oversight, regulation
In 2014, the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded a US$20 billion-dollar contract to Palantir to track undocumented immigrants in the U.S., especially family members of children who had crossed the border alone. Several human rights watchdogs, including Amnesty International, have raised concerns about Palantir for human rights violations.
Like most AI initiatives developed in recent years, this work has happened largely without regulatory oversight. There have been many attempts to set up ethical modes of operation, such as the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ Peer Review Framework, which sets out a method for overseeing the technical development and implementation of AI models. 
In the absence of regulation, however, tools such as these, without legal backing, are merely best practices with no means of enforcement.
In the European Commission’s AI regulation proposal, developers of high-risk systems must go through an authorization process before going to market, just like a new drug or car. They are required to put together a detailed package before the AI is available for use, involving a description of the models and data used, along with an explanation of how accuracy, privacy and discriminatory impacts will be addressed.
The AI applications in question include biometric identification, categorization and evaluation of the eligibility of people for public assistance benefits and services. They may also be used to dispatch of emergency first response services — all of these are current uses of AI by the United Nations.

Building trust
Conversely, the lack of regulation at the United Nations can be considered a challenge for agencies seeking to adopt more effective and novel technologies. As such, many systems seem to have been developed and later abandoned without being integrated into actual decision-making systems.
An example of this is the Jetson tool, which was developed by UNHCR to predict the arrival of internally displaced persons to refugee camps in Somalia. The tool does not appear to have been updated since 2019, and seems unlikely to transition into the humanitarian organization’s operations. Unless, that is, it can be properly certified by a new regulatory system. 
Trust in AI is difficult to obtain, particularly in United Nations work, which is highly political and affects very vulnerable populations. The onus has largely been on data scientists to develop the credibility of their tools. 
A regulatory framework like the one proposed by the European Commission would take the pressure off data scientists in the humanitarian sector to individually justify their activities. Instead, agencies or research labs who wanted to develop an AI solution would work within a regulated system with built-in accountability. This would produce more effective, safer and more just applications and uses of AI technology.

This article is part of ""The age of surveillance,"" a special report on artificial intelligence.
Clocking in? Take a selfie. 
That's how Uber drivers have to tell the ride-hailing app that they've signed on. Should the facial verification software the company uses decide the driver is lying about their identity — even when they’re not — they’re banned until further notice.

Uber’s algorithm also monitors workers’ performance and ranks them on a five-star basis. Consistently low ratings also mean they get kicked off the app.
This isn't exceptional. Companies are developing and purchasing an increasing number of workplace tools, many powered by artificial intelligence, to monitor and analyze their employees. Policymakers and workers say many of the tools are intrusive, discriminatory, and in some cases illegal.
With millions of workers forced to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, companies say they need tools that ensure productivity and appropriate behavior when a corridor-strolling supervisor isn't around.
“Our Real-Time ID Check is designed to protect the safety and security of everyone who uses the app by ensuring the correct driver or courier is using their account,"" said an Uber spokesperson, who added that ""manual human reviews"" take place prior to any decision to block an Uber driver from the app, and that anyone removed from the platform can appeal the decision with the company.
In February, Amazon started tracking its drivers with cameras featuring biometric feedback indicators that monitor when drivers look away from the road or go past the speed limit. An Amazon spokesperson pointed to ""remarkable driver and community safety improvements"" as a result of the indicators, which led to a 48 percent decrease in accidents.
""Don’t believe the self-interested critics who claim these cameras are intended for anything other than safety,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company's use of surveillance tech in its workplaces is ""in line with local laws and conducted with the full knowledge and support of local authorities.""

The testing ground
While workplace surveillance continues to grow across sectors, the gig economy in particular has become a testing ground for AI-powered surveillance, according to the European Commission’s Jobs and Social Rights Commissioner Nicolas Schmit — and the technology is “quickly spreading” to other forms of work.
Companies were already beginning to lean on workplace analytics in a bid to boost productivity and efficiency, but those trends got a massive boost from the pandemic. Ford required some of its workers to wear wristbands with trackers to ensure social distancing at its plants. Amazon is planning to use AI to monitor which muscles employees use, which it says will ""decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from [musculoskeletal disease] risks.""
A report by the U.K-based Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that surveillance tech is on the rise. Fifteen percent of workers it surveyed said they had experienced new performance and productivity monitoring technology since the onset of the pandemic. 
AI systems are well-qualified for worker surveillance. They are efficient at counting and identifying the words typed in and websites visited; the number of emails sent; the number of steps taken in a warehouse; the number of bathroom breaks; their length — everything needed to monitor an employee's behavior on or offline.
U.S. tech company Sapience Analytics, which produces workplace surveillance software, says its products increase ""employee engagement,"" resulting in ""stronger productivity and higher career satisfaction.""
It drives ""transparency"" and objective decision-making, the company says, and is used by more than 90 companies in 18 countries. Sapience Analytics CEO Bradley Killinger has said that in using the company’s own surveillance software, he’s been able to see a number of employees operating at 145 percent capacity for six straight weeks.

“It’s to the point that I’m ordering people to just take three days, do something else,” he said.
But those kinds of tools have received pushback. 
The British bank Barclays has been under investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office — the country's privacy watchdog — since last August, over allegations it used Sapience Analytics' surveillance software to spy on staff.
The bank has since switched to only tracking anonymized data through the software, following critical media coverage. 
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s popular 365 office software suite has been criticized for workplace surveillance because it created “productivity scores” that allowed managers to track how actively employees email or collaborate in shared files.
It has since backtracked, also anonymizing such data so employers are no longer able to monitor individual workers.

""At Microsoft, we’re committed to both data-driven insights and user privacy,"" it said in a statement. ""We always strive to get the balance right, but if and when we miss, we will listen carefully and make appropriate adjustments.""
Experts warn that what looks like increased productivity may come at the cost of a greater risk of burnout, stress and mental health issues. According to a report commissioned by the European Parliament’s employment committee, surveillance technologies “reduce autonomy and privacy, lead to greater work intensification, and blur the boundaries between work and personal/family life.”
Can I speak to the manager?
The problem is that much of workplace surveillance is not regulated, according to Aída Ponce Del Castillo, a senior researcher at the European Trade Union Institute. 
“We don't have a law that says to the employer … you don't go beyond private life. We don't go beyond emotions. [Companies] don't trust the intimacy, privacy and dignity of a human worker,” Ponce Del Castillo said.
The Commission says it recognizes the severity of AI-powered surveillance in workplaces. Schmit said algorithmic management — the term given to the digital tools and techniques used to manage workers remotely — “leaves the workers with few means to challenge unfavorable decisions.”
The tech represents a “fundamental challenge for the future world of work in democratic societies,” Schmit said.

The Commission is currently working on an initiative to improve working conditions for platform workers, which is, in part, expected to address algorithmic management.
The bloc also introduced an AI law, which regulates “high-risk” uses of the technology. In the Commission’s proposal, workplace surveillance qualifies as a high-risk use, which means AI providers will have to meet certain standards, such as human oversight, to legally operate.
Countries including France, Germany and Italy limit how tech tools can be used to monitor workers at the workplace.
Rage against the machine
One line of defense for workers is the EU’s stringent data laws, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which says workers have the right not to be “subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling.”
This seems to have some bite. In 2020, Hamburg’s data protection authority fined Swedish clothing giant H&M €35 million for profiling employees in records that included data about religious beliefs, details of health conditions and family problems. 
In a win for data and workers' rights campaigners, Spain passed a new law regulating online delivery platforms like Uber and Deliveroo, which requires them to inform labor unions of how algorithms affect their working conditions and includes provisions about algorithmic transparency.

Ponce Del Castillo said workers need to get AI-savvy to protect themselves. 
“It doesn't mean that they have to become AI experts or computer scientists, but they can well understand the impacts and the risks of this emerging technology at the workplace and in the tasks they produce,” she said.
Trade unions are also waking up to the risks presented by AI in the workplace.
“Technology has been the cornerstone of why trade unionism in Europe came out, because the Industrial Revolution initiated automation. And that's exactly what we're seeing today. It’s the same automation but for things we don't see,” she said.

This article originally appeared in the April edition of IT Pro 20/20, available here. To sign up to receive each new issue in your inbox, click here.Artificial intelligence (AI) is now part of our everyday lives. Many of us now wake up to our lights turning on automatically with the temperature of our home set just how we like it, and that's before we begin interacting with tools such as digital assistants and IoT doorbells, and even automation-powered services that write our emails for us.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, automation technologies have also become more widely used in the enterprise too. Some 73% of organisations worldwide are now using automation technologies, two-thirds of business leaders used automation to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a quarter of workers have seen a change to their role and ways of working because of the implementation of these technologies, according to research from Deloitte on robotic and intelligent automation.However, while we've long heard about the benefits of AI for businesses, from the fact that it can enable companies to save time and money by automating and optimising routine processes and tasks as well as increase productivity and operational efficiencies, some believe the technology could be making us lazy.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProDumbing it downIn 2015, Nigel Barber PhD, a biopsychologist and author, wrote in Psychology Today that much like how after the Industrial Revolution people became less physically active and began to gain weight as machines replaced manual workers, reliance on automation could make people less intelligent.The future of AI in the legal industry""AI is embedded in many features of modern life for the simple reason that intelligent machines can already outperform humans, including some aptitudes where there was once thought to be a human advantage, such as playing chess or recalling trivia in a game of Jeopardy,"" he said. ""In the future, the electronic assistant will develop to the point that it serves similar functions as a real living butler, fulfilling requests such as: 'Organize a dinner party for six on Thursday, Jeeves, and invite the usual suspects.""""At that point, our long struggle with challenging technologies is at an end. We can take it easy knowing that the hard work of planning and organising is being done by a better brain – the electronic assistant. Starved of mental effort, our brains will regress. The future is an aristocratic fog.""Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

""For example, most famously, in 2009 an Air France plane crashed into the Atlantic en-route from Brazil to France,"" Putoni tells IT Pro. ""The cause of the tragedy was the pilot's inappropriate response following the disengagement of the autopilot system during a storm.""Second, we need to avoid becoming complacent. In many situations, human supervision and vigilance remain crucial to ensure all runs smoothly and to step in where necessary to avoid error. For example, the first death in an accident involving the Tesla autonomous driving system was due to a combination of the system mistaking a white truck for the sky and the driver's complete lack of attention.""Putoni also warns that even when tragedy is not involved, AI technologies can create discomfort when it prevents individuals from exerting effort and practising skills that they care about.""For example, we show that people for whom cooking is an important part of their identity tend to dislike an automated cooking machine when this is presented with the purpose of taking over the cooking responsibilities completely,"" he adds. ""However people's responses became less negative when the same product was presented as still enabling the user's involvement, allowing collaboration between people and technology. Sometimes more automation is not better.""Work-shy AISome believe, too, that AI has the potential to make us lazy in the workplace – particularly if the implementation of the technology isn't well thought out.Jeet Mukerji, lead AI product manager at Beamery, tells IT Pro: ""AI has the potential to make us lazy in the workplace if we agree on three things. The first is that the original work, now done by AI, is worth mastering by humans. We choose to not do this, however, so will eventually lose this skill set – empathising, or doing mental maths, for example.""Secondly, we choose to consistently spend the time and energy, freed up by AI, in lower value moments such as deciding to scroll social media without an aim rather than read a book or to learn a new skill.""Finally, we choose to not understand the limits of AI we are using, expect too much of it, shirk our responsibility fully on it and don't engage the outputs of the AI correctly – by this I mean we think it is incapable of error, so don't sense check the outputs.""Machine learning vs AI vs NLP: What are the differences?Mukerji believes that we can prevent AI from making us lazy, but to do so we need to make the right choices: We need to understand the technology's limitations by engaging with it correctly and be proactive and curious enough to learn how to improve and add further value.""A further important point here is that this has nothing to do with AI, but is more focused on general training on how to be a productive human,"" Mukerji adds.AI don't agreeOthers, however, believe that AI is not making us lazy and suggest it's having the opposite effect: Giving us more headspace to spend on productive and enjoyable tasks at work.James Coombes, CEO of vector.ai, an AI startup for enterprise operations, tells IT Pro: ""It's still surprising today that employees continue to manually reconcile and organise documents and email communications. It's a waste of human talent. The good news is this is a problem AI can solve. There is so much value to be had by adding an intelligent layer that can do the more basic cognitive tasks and give us all our headspace back.""By automating monotonous tasks like 'answer that email', 'key in that data' and 'find that piece of information', employees can spend their time on delivering great customer service, learning new skills, increasing business development and pursuing passion projects. Not only will this lead to a better and more profitable business but a happy workforce freed from process pain.""This is a viewpoint shared by Rachel Roumeliotis, vice president of Data and AI at O'Reilly, an online learning platform focussing on digital skills, who tells IT Pro that AI will only make us lazy if businesses use it in a lazy way. She says that if the technology is used correctly, it should allow people to be more creative and use their time doing tasks that can make a palpable difference to the business.The future of AI in manufacturing""For example, AI can be used to take on the burden of repetitive, administrative tasks, such as reporting. This is work which is often necessary, but which can take a long time and is more of a tick-box exercise than anything else,"" she says. ""The onus, however, is then on businesses to encourage and enable their employees to replace that work with something more engaging and strategic.""In some instances, this will be easy for businesses. Those hours spent on administrative tasks can be replaced by brainstorms or extra hours of content production. For others, it might require some restructuring of the business. Either way, training should be at the very heart of it. The time saved on performing admin tasks can instead be used by employees to learn new skills and impact the business in a new, innovative way.""AI shouldn't be making us lazier, it should be enabling greater creativity and a greater sense of fulfilment within work.""Dr Lindsey Zuloaga, chief data scientist at HireVue, also believes that the benefits of utilising AI in the workplace far outweigh the potential downsides – particularly as a result of the COVID pandemic, which has caused workers to suffer from increased workloads and depleted resources over the past 12 months.""In hiring, for example, recruiters are able to spend less time on scheduling and more time on candidate engagement and personalised interactions, as well as streamlining communication between recruiters, hiring teams and candidates,"" she tells IT Pro.""All of these elements facilitate a faster turnaround time for new hires. This is far from laziness, but a modern way of driving efficiency and focusing your staff's time on tasks that hold greater value.""

Energy communities will play a key role in building the more decentralised, less carbon intensive, and fairer energy systems of the future. Such communities enable local prosumers (consumers with own generation and storage) to generate, store and trade energy with each other -- using locally owned assets, such as wind turbines, rooftop solar panels and batteries. In turn, this enables the community to use more locally generated renewable generation, and shifts the market power from large utility companies to individual prosumers. 
Energy community projects often involve jointly-owned assets such as community-owned wind turbines or shared battery storage. Yet, this raises the question of how these assets should be controlled - often in real time, and how the energy outputs jointly-owned assets should be shared fairly among community members, given not all members have the same size, energy needs or demand profiles.
It turns out that we can use Artificial Intelligence not only to use more renewable energy and protect the lifetime of expensive assets (such as batteries), but also to devise fairer ways to divide joint gains.
A paper recently published in Applied Energy: doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116575  by researchers from the Smart Systems Group (SSG) at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK), has shown that tools from distributed AI (specifically multi-agent systems)  and cooperative game theory can be efficiently used to answer these questions. 
Their work develops new algorithms for smart control of community energy assets (such as local wind turbines and batteries), both to use more locally generated electricity, and to extend the lifetime of energy assets. They compare the case when individual households invest in their own home battery vs. investing in a larger community energy storage unit, and show the benefits of a pooled storage approach. Next, they propose several practically applicable and computationally efficient mechanism to share the outputs of these assets between homes in a fair way. Their works makes use of the key concept of marginal value - borrowed from coalitional game theory and distributed AI, looking at what each member contributes to (and costs) the local community. 
The authors were motivated in their work by real case studies from communities in the Responsive Flexibility (ReFLEX) project - the UK's largest smart energy demonstration project running on Orkney Islands in Scotland. In ongoing work, they also aim to explore the use of their methods for energy communities in India, in the framework of the CEDRI project (Community Energy Demand Reduction in India), a project led by researchers Heriot-Watt University in Scotland and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India.
Sonam Norbu, the PhD student leading the work from the SSG group said: ""This work is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to integrate a battery depreciation model in community energy optimization modelling. Data-driven monitoring of battery state of health is crucial for economically viable integration of local renewable generation, and the community energy model provides a very attractive application. Moreover, for researchers interested in cooperative game theory application in energy (which is a growing research area), the proposed model is one of the first to use such concepts in a community energy setting. Specifically, we propose a redistribution model for benefits in a community based on marginal value, a key concept in cooperative game theory.""
Dr. Valentin Robu, Co-Director of the Smart Systems Group added: ""This work, led by our PhD student Sonam Norbu, who joined us from Bhutan 3 years ago, demonstrates an excellent mix of top-level scientific impact and practical contribution. The contribution of the Responsive Flexibility project on Orkney Islands, one of the largest smart energy demonstration and ""living lab"" projects in the UK. I was delighted that Sonam's work was recently recognised by a nomination for the Young Professional Green Energy Academic Award, awarded yearly by Scottish Renewables, to top industry body for the renewable energy industry in Scotland.""

Therefore, Analytics Insight has listed the top 50 business use cases of artificial intelligence in diverse sectors..HERE ARE THE TOP 10 TED TALKS ON AI THAT ARE A MUST-WATCHTRANSFORMING THE WORLD WITH HIS LATEST AI INVENTIONS: ELON MUSKHUMILITY IN AI: CREATING PRINCIPLED AND RELIABLE AI DEVICES.Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.Predictive analytics to validate the need for surgery.Predictive analytics is a gift to healthcare. Sometimes, we come across patients who say they underwent an unnecessary surgery due to a lack of predictions on what was coming. Fortunately, artificial intelligence is changing the fate of such burdensome risks and avoidable surgeries. By using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, healthcare professionals can identify if the patient needs surgery or not. The technology will assist doctors to evaluate whether the operation is actually necessary or if there is an alternative with far less risk involved..Machine learning to diagnose infectious disease.Over the past one and a half years, medical experts have been whining that if the government knew the impact and influence of coronavirus, then they should've taken immediate action to control it. The repeated statement we hear is 'no one was aware of Covid-19's seriousness. Therefore, artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies could be used to detect future pandemics. Machine learning and big data can help change the way we diagnose infectious diseases. Using a proprietary database and ML algorithms, doctors can run genetic testing to see if the disease is infectious or not..Healthcare apps as medical assistants .Besides the actual medical services at hospitals and healthcare centers, artificial intelligence is helping patients in their daily care, be it at home or workspace. The tremendous amount of healthcare apps blooming on the App Store and Play Store, which could keep track of the patient's health conditions. Powered by voice assistant technology, the healthcare applications indicate patients to take medications and check their health performance. They also send alerts and education materials to keep the patients on their heels all the time when it comes to taking care of their health..AI-powered wearables track health conditions.Most of the time, follow-ups post a health condition are very mandatory. Unfortunately, we, humans, are very careless about keeping track of our health conditions. Some healthcare facilities offer such follow-ups or life coaching services, which are extremely expensive. However, AI-powered wearables can help patients in keeping track of their health issues. For example, when a patient wears an AI-powered watch, the device captures their real-time healthcare data and gives suggestions on required medication, exercise, activities, and even habits that could help them maintain their body..Early detection of dementia.Dementia is seen as an expensive disease. Serious conditions of dementia cost up to US$500 billion worldwide for patients. However, with early predictions, the patients can escape the haunting expenses and save up to US$118,000. Fortunately, the early detection of dementia is turning out to be possible with artificial intelligence. A sensitive diagnostic tool can compare the way patients answer questions and validate their accuracy, speed, and image properties. The tool can further say if they are likely to get dementia or not..Intelligent robots in surgery.Owing to the increasing global population and demand for doctors, robot surgeons are a must for the 21st century. Besides filling in for human surgeons, robot surgeons can actually do better in most cases. Surgery procedures require utmost patience and precision, and the skill of medical surgeons does not falter even when they operate without pause for hours and hours. Therefore, robotic assistants in surgeries can further help the surgeon achieve a new level of precision even for the most minute movement..AI in drug discovery and production.Drug and vaccine discovery is a very lengthy process. Generally, it takes up to 10-12 years for a pharmaceutical company to discover a vaccine or a drug that is fully effective on people. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for the rapid discovery of a vaccine. Pharmaceutical companies across the globe used artificial intelligence, especially, machine learning technology to detect the right base components that could work well in creating immunity against the virus. They also used data analytics to fast-track the trial process..Converting doctors' unstructured notes with NLP.Whether you agree or not, doctors' notes are beyond recognition in most cases. However, they are very important for diagnostic and tracking purposes. They define a patient's health condition, improvement or deteriorating situations, etc. Fortunately, natural language processing can unlock unstructured data directly from doctor's notes, and convert it to structure data. This helps reduce errors and speed up the transfer of information..Image analysis for medical diagnostics.However well trained and experience a physicist is, they are likely to end up missing something or the other in medical diagnostics. Fortunately, with the help of image analysis, doctors can get help from technology to analyze many of the medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Besides, the technology can also provide feedback on what the human eyes miss out on..Automating the administrative tasks.Healthcare institutions are a big hub for data. On a daily basis, many patients come in and go out. Even though many don't need follow-ups, it is the responsibility of the healthcare workers to keep a record of patients' medical data. Therefore, they use AI to automate administrative tasks. It is expected that by implying AI in automating administrative tasks, healthcare institutions can save up to US$18 billion. Machines can also help doctors and nurses save time on labor-dense works..Artificial Intelligence in Banking and Finance.NLP to detect the risk of insurance.Insurance companies rely highly on data. They check for the applicants' background before processing the insurance procedures. Insurance companies sort through vast sets of data to identify high-risk cases and lower the risk. Using Natural language processing, insurance companies can analyze large volumes of text and identify key considerations affecting specific claims and actions..AI in fraud detection.Banking and financial institutions are highly prone to fraudulent transactions. Unfortunately, human employees can't keep track of all the transactions and mind malicious content or suspicious payments. But machine learning algorithms can analyze thousands of data points in real-time and flag suspicious or plain-right fraudulent transactions, stopping many fraudulent claims in the process..Machine learning helps in investment.As technology evolves, banking and financial institutions are employing artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies in their working system to do predictive tasks. One such predictive work is identifying the best investment plan or place. Machine learning-enabled technologies give advanced market insights allowing the fund managers to identify specific market changes much earlier as compared to the traditional investment models..AI-powered apps provide financial advice.Budget management apps are mushrooming like never before in the digital world. These apps powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology offer customers the benefit of highly specialized and targeted financial advice and guidance. They allow customers to track their spending daily using these apps and also help them analyze the data to identify their spending patterns.Customization of services.In the digital era, financial institutions are using AI-powered mobile applications to track user behavior and provide valuable personalized suggestions to them. Besides, banks are leveraging the facility for consumers to do unlimited transactions from their smartphones. Banks are also tying up with financial transaction platforms and are rolling out services, offers, and insights based on users' search patterns..Artificial Intelligence in Automobile .AI Application in Enhancing Design .Artificial intelligence (AI), programmable shading, and real-time ray-tracing are heavily used in transforming the traditional design process of the product. The advanced AI has disrupted to form an advanced ecosystem that accelerates new design workflows and improves team collaborations.

Online exam proctoring company ProctorU will have humans review AI reports of possible student misconduct on tests before forwarding them to colleges and universities, it said this week.

Online exam proctoring company ProctorU announced earlier this week that it will no longer send artificial intelligence-generated reports of potential student misconduct to institutions without ProctorU staff members first reviewing the footage -- a development raising more questions than it answers about higher education’s use of the technology.
ProctorU, like many companies offering remote proctoring services, employs AI technology to monitor student movement during tests and flag activity that might indicate a student is cheating. Typical behavior that may be flagged by the AI includes students getting up from their seats, not looking consistently at their screens or talking out loud.
Previously, as part of its cheapest proctoring package, ProctorU sent AI-generated incident reports to instructors without staff members reviewing them first. The company offered this package on the condition that any AI-generated reports would be reviewed by instructors. But that wasn’t happening, said Jarrod Morgan, founder and chief strategy officer of ProctorU.
“It’s not appropriate for AI to be making decisions, and it’s unfair to expect faculty to do that work,” Morgan said.
The company will continue to use AI, but two ProctorU staff members will now review webcam footage to try to ensure that students are not penalized inappropriately for innocent actions. This is particularly important for students granted special accommodations, Morgan said.
Finding a way to ensure that there is human oversight over academic integrity decisions is something that ProctorU has been discussing for a long time, Morgan said. During the pandemic, when use of remote proctoring software exploded, it became undeniable that the proctoring services were not being used as intended, he said.
Some institutions use online proctoring simply as a deterrent and rarely proceed with disciplining students when AI flags suspicious behavior. But others do not understand the AI is fallible and may act on reports without reviewing them, said Shea Swauger, a librarian and researcher at the University of Colorado at Denver who is critical of instructors’ reliance on online proctoring tools.
This can be a problem, because companies avoid responsibility for making the call on what is and is not cheating.
“It’s pretty standard for all proctoring companies that are offering AI-assisted or fully AI monitoring services to encourage faculty to review any flagged behavior before making any academic integrity judgements,” Swauger said. “That’s kind of the main way that these proctoring companies are sidestepping accountability when it comes to discrimination. No company is saying that they determine if there is cheating. They all say that they flag suspicious behavior, then it’s up to individual institutions to determine if there’s cheating.”
The potential to discriminate against students with disabilities, students who are neurodivergent, students of color and even caretakers and parents is high when remote proctoring services rely on AI and not human judgment, Swauger said.
Even with human judgment, there is room for implicit biases and discrimination, Swauger said. If you’re a faculty member and you’re constantly being alerted that students with disabilities or medical conditions and students of color are suspected of misconduct, there is a possibility that will change how you interact with those students, he said.
“Even if you never have a finding of academic misconduct, that repeated suspicion could trigger implicit biases and discriminatory responses from faculty,” said Swauger.
It is positive that there may be fewer instances of students being accused of cheating when they did nothing wrong, said Amelia Vance, director of youth and education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum. Still, she sees potential for things to go wrong when people are involved in making judgments. She wants to know more about the training that ProctorU staff members receive.
By making such a public statement about its change of heart, ProctorU hopes to differentiate itself from its competitors and deflect some of the negative press that online proctoring companies have recently received. But Swauger says he feels the move is little more than a PR stunt.
“I’d describe it as ethics-washing,” Swauger said.
ProctorU’s competitors do not appear to be ready to follow in the company’s footsteps by imposing similar limits on the use of AI technology in online proctoring.
“It’s a bit funny they chose to lob grenades over their shoulders as they exited the room,” said Jodi Feeney, chief operating officer of online test monitoring company Respondus, in an email. The vast majority of online proctoring sessions in higher education use automated systems instead of human proctors because they are much more cost-effective, she said.
“I don’t think ProctorU was committed to cannibalizing their lucrative human proctoring service,” Feeney said. “A typical university using Respondus Monitor spends less than 25 cents per proctoring session. Live, human proctoring often costs $25 per exam. The price points and services are entirely different.”

The pandemic-induced acceleration of technology adoption has led many sectors, both private and public to leverage AI for their advantage and growth. In the last few years, AI has enabled many innovations and driven the proliferation of technologies like IoT, robotics, analytics, and voice assistants. According to a report, AI topped the patent filings in 2020. This is not new, AI has been securing a large number of patents in the last few years..AI and its Impact.Artificial intelligence has had huge impacts in the healthcare sector, especially since the pandemic last year. AI and other disruptive technologies powered a patient-centered healthcare system. This new care scenario is all digital and highlights the importance of data and analytics. Predictive analytics, machine learning, and AI played a pivotal role in drug discovery and vaccine development. In the coming years, the use of these advanced technologies will become the norm, and easily accessible electronic medical records will simplify diagnostics. AI will enable healthcare systems to track and monitor patients in real-time, gain genetic data, and each person's lifestyle. Algorithms will take up the charge of diagnosing health conditions and prescribing suitable treatments.The combination of AI and human intelligence will lead to the development of sophisticated cybersecurity innovations in the future. AI will enable an efficient battle against the rising cyberattacks and crimes.AI has a lot to offer to the transportation and manufacturing sectors. In the coming years, we might witness the perfect evolution and commercialization of smart and autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are already available today, but by the next two to three decades, the world will witness more people using them. The manufacturing sector will also gain benefits from AI. Increased use of robots in factories and predictive analytics in the sector will enhance the quality of products and streamline the logistics and supply chain..Other potential impacts of AI would be in elder care systems, education, finance and business,  customer services, media, space exploration, smart cities, and smart homes..Will AI Dismantle the Human Workforce?.This fear has always been looming on artificial intelligence. Experts and tech giants like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawkings have warned humans against the adverse consequences and threats of the technology. One of the widely claimed consequences is AI taking over the human workforce and causing massive job losses. This claim is highly overblown and researchers agree that although AI might displace humans from some job roles, it will not replace the whole workforce. AI is likely to replace routine jobs and repetitive tasks like picking and packaging goods, separating and segregating materials, responding to repetitive customer queries, etc. Even today some of these functions are still done by humans and AI will take over these tasks in the future..Thus, the human workforce engaged in these simple and routine jobs should be upskilled and trained to perform new skills. As we are very far from reaching artificial general intelligence, the current technology cannot augment human intelligence fully. This is the reason people should be trained to do high-skilled tasks like programming, coding, and others that are essential for the future. The transition from the old to the new job should be smoothened to reduce the massive impacts..The Future of AI- Should We Fear Apocalypse?.Recently, a paper published by researchers at AMOLF's Soft Robotic Matter group, exhibited how self-learning robots can easily adapt to changing circumstances. These small robotic units were connected to each other for them to learn on their own to move..The future will harness the hidden capabilities of AI and encourage the creation of self-learning robots. Reinforcement learning and training algorithms based on Generative Adversarial Networks will be explored. AI will also prove a flagbearer for sustainable technologies and will be used against fighting climate change by reducing pollution levels and encouraging green AI research..Artificial intelligence is highly criticized for its bias and privacy infringement concerns. Many companies and research firms are thus trying to develop ethical AI approaches and algorithms that are unbiased. We can expect that this will become possible in the coming years..Another threat posed by AI is the violation of human rights by impacting privacy. For example, voice assistants like Alexa and technologies like facial recognition have been blamed for invading the privacy of humans and probably eavesdropping into their lives. These technologies are feared to be used by the powerful state and federal authorities against specific minorities and will curtail the freedom of speech and expression. Thus, AI needs to evolve much to move ahead of these criticisms and enable an ethical and trustworthy system in the future..Apart from these critical issues, AI is not going to cause an apocalypse as Hollywood Science-Fiction portrays. The AI we are using today is known as narrow AI and for it to be able to create on its own, there needs to be a huge evolution. This evolved AI is named artificial general intelligence (AGI). We are still very far from achieving AGI and its future is still hypothetical. To reach this advanced phase, AI should be able to fully comprehend and augment the complex human brain, which is a far-fetched thought right now..Hence, AI as such might not become a threat to human existence. However, there are chances that humans might misuse the capabilities of the technology for causing harm. The scenario of war robots being used to feed harmful motives through their algorithms can be an example. Therefore, in the years ahead, it is necessary to develop an ethical AI ecosystem without human biases and this might alleviate the potential risks of AI in the future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The purpose of automation is to reduce the amount of human effort needed to do a task. But we need more human effort than ever to build and maintain those automated systems.

That’s the paradox of technology, and now that parts of the world are emerging on the other side of the Covid crisis (hopefully), the job market is heating up again, and companies are hungry for human talent who can alleviate their need to hire human talent. Amazon — which turned many labor markets on their heads by accelerating e-commerce and on-site automation — recognizes this shift, providing free cloud computing training to 29 million people around the world by 2025, in addition to committing more than $700 million to upskill 100,000 of its own employees in that time.


Cognizant released its quarterly Jobs of the Future Index, predicting a “strong recovery” for the US jobs market this coming year, especially those involving technology. The technology market, which saw lower rates of hiring six to eight months ago, but is primed for strong recovery as organizations accelerate their adoption of cloud strategies and AI solutions, the survey shows. Of all the jobs tracked in the Cognizant report, AI, algorithm and automation jobs saw a 28% gain over the last quarter, with “robotics engineer” and “video game designer” being two of the fastest-growing jobs - with 73% and 54% growth in jobs postings for these positions in the last three months. Algorithms, automation, and AI, the largest family in the index, realized a 28% gain over the quarter.

Ardine Williams, VP of workforce development at Amazon, believes the past year was one of revitalization and reinvention for many people as they reconsider their career options. “The scale of the disruption was staggering and so was the pace of adaptation,” she says. “Many used this disruption as an opportunity to revitalize or to reinvent their skills. Last year we saw unprecedented participation in cloud skills training during the lockdown. This interest came from learners on both ends of the spectrum – from those who were completely new to the cloud and looking to understand the fundamentals, to seasoned professionals who were looking to take advanced courses in areas like machine learning.”

PROMOTED
This interest was reflected in AWS’s array of cloud courses. The number of learners taking the vendor’s free, fundamental cloud courses — AWS Training and Certification — in May 2020 versus May 2019 jumped 152%, Williams shares. “We’re seeing the cloud support accelerated growth across industries, and this has been especially true during the pandemic,” Williams says. “When we look back, we’ll see that the pandemic accelerated cloud adoption.”
The impending shortage of STEM skills poses the greatest risk to post-Covid growth, Williams says. “There is a shortage of talent with the necessary cloud skills that is leaving many technical roles unfilled and hampering businesses’ digital transformation objectives.” There is no way around this — it’s incumbent for enterprises to invest in training their own talent to tackle this skills shortage, she adds. Amazon’s own investment in close to $1 billion illustrates its efforts to address potential skill shortages.

Along with sharpening technology skills, the drive to re-invent extends to business innovation. “What we’ve seen over the past year is a wellspring of creativity and reinvention, driven by necessity,” says Williams. “The greatest barrier to reinvention is often how difficult it can be to take apart something you’ve worked hard to build. The pandemic forced the issue for many. A key feature of businesses that survived and flourished was innovation.”

Williams sees “tremendous opportunity to integrate that innovation into the culture of organizations. Looking forward, leaders need to be intentional about creating and nurturing an environment that places employee skills, learning, and experimentation at the forefront.”
She adds that “it’s hard to think of an industry that is not evolving, and the pace of innovation seems to be accelerating. The area that has been very interesting to watch and experience is the restaurant industry. Integrated technology solutions helped businesses get their restaurants online, connect with delivery services, and run outdoor operations with minimal staff via QR code menus, contactless payments, and the scale of the cloud.”
As the world re-opens, “these changes are helping restaurants cope with limited labor availability and with their bottom line,” says Williams. “I suspect that like the profound changes we saw in oil-field staffing models after the Great Recession, many of these shifts in restaurant business models are here to stay. That means that a lot of workers from the food service industry will need to upskill.”

All 7,400 tonnes of it.Around 260 miles away in Plymouth, another submarine made its debut that same day. A minnow compared to HMS Anson, this secretive nine-tonne craft may have greater implications for the future of the navy than the £1.3bn nuclear boat. MSubs of Plymouth, a specialist in autonomous underwater vehicles, won a £2.5m Ministry of Defence contract to build and test an Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV) that should be able to operate up to 3,000 miles from home for three months. The big innovation here is the autonomy. The submarine's movements and actions will be governed entirely by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Ollie Thompson is a recent graduate who is studying for a master's degree in robotics at Plymouth University. He also works for MarineAI, the MSubs arm that is fitting out the XLUUV's brain. MsubsMSubs of Plymouth won a £2.5m contract to build and test an Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV)Mr Thompson has no doubts about the challenge he and his colleagues face: ""We know a lot of people don't have confidence in AI. So we work with elements we can test, we separate things into boxes.""He divides the AI problem into components - and mission management is the toughest. This attempts to simulate the presence of a trained captain in the little submarine's programming. This is AI working in total isolation from human contact, not least because maintaining strict radio silence is critical to a submarine's covert role. The technical principle here is machine learning, showing an AI program examples of how a task should be performed until it has embedded the right actions in its own repertoire. To do this, MarineAI is using a huge IBM AC922 supercomputer, ""a monster, one of the biggest in the South-West of England"" Mr Thompson boasts. In contrast the on-board brain of the submarine resides in a 15cm square box and relies on an Nvidia chip often found driving computer games.""We built it off the back of the Nvidia chip because it's highly energy efficient,"" says Mr Thompson. Just like a tiny but powerful Raspberry Pi device used to teach schoolchildren basic programming tasks this approach takes up very little power. And keeping power consumption to the bare minimum is critical to making the submarine's battery last. BAe SystemsHMS Anson and others under construction. In future, submarines will launch their own autonomous vesselsIt's clear that the Ministry of Defence is paying very close attention to battery technology for this project. So far MarineAI is relying on existing technology derived from car batteries. But it notes that research in this field is leaping forward. The AI content of the computer should prioritise tasks. The project envisages a boat that can travel to an area of the sea-bed to search for mines or plant a sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering package or stay in place and scour its environment for information on a hostile navy. So MarineAI is creating a decision-making capacity for the submarine's brain. It will know how much battery life is left and how to weigh that against prevailing weather conditions and sea states, reaching a logical decision on whether to sail on or return home in the face of strong tides. The project has oceans left to cross. For instance, how can the submarine detect small objects on the surface such as jet-skis?  All of these dilemmas are small beer for human submarine captains. Commander Ryan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer HMS Turbulent and taught on the Perisher, a five-month-long course the navy uses to push prospective submarine skippers to the limit.  Ryan RamseyRyan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer submarine HMS TurbulentThis decides if they are fit to command 100 or more submariners working punishing watches consisting of six hours on, six hours off for the duration of a long patrol. Cdr Ramsey worked in AI after leaving the navy and can see where smart software and human instinct might not produce the same response.""AI will struggle to match human decision-making skills. There are lots of submariners skills you can transfer to it, but you have to accept that the first generation will not be perfect."" He cites how he would study opposing Nato submarine commanders he went up against in exercises, learning how far each individual was prepared to push a vessel. ""The reality is that if you don't know how a guy operates he will find your submarine before you find him. You can't replicate that emotional input in AI."" More Technology of BusinessMind-boggling magnets could unlock plentiful powerTaking an invention from idea to the marketplaceFood giants respond to worries over packaging'It's your device, you should be able to repair it'What will happen to all the dead car batteries?If the XLUUV is ever to be armed that might create serious problems. The decision to fire a torpedo rests on a huge reserve of each officer's instincts and experience. ""If you leave that to a rules-based system you might escalate things. There is just so much to learn about the underwater battlespace.""In the future Cdr Ramsey believes submarines will be equipped with the ability to launch their own autonomous vessels. The next generation of surface warships entering service are already planned to feature mission-bays for launching uncrewed vessels. And autonomous submarines can be deployed by transport aircraft, giving the batteries a rest and the XLUUV a global reach. The longer-term prospect for AI-controlled submarines is rosy, says Cdr Ramsey. ""I can see a way to do a Perisher for AI. Get the right people to recreate their experiences in a simulator and let the AI learn from that, including human decisions that might be wrong. Give it ten years' worth of data and it will be able to build its own rules."" This simulator-based course for computer code promises another big benefit. ""The AI can test out its own rules without any risk. My worry with autonomous submarines is the political impact if the vessel does something wrong or gets caught in hostile waters,"" he says.   BoeingBoeing is working on autonomous subs for the US NavyPlymouth's trial submarine is based on an MSubs design known as the S201. And across the Atlantic, Boeing is building a series of large uncrewed submersibles as the US Navy works out how these vessels can be used. Former submariners talk about the degree of teamwork and close comradeship required to perform their missions. AI cannot replicate this, but it does not need to if all it is doing is saving sailors from exhausting and repetitive tasks better allocated to a drone. The Royal Navy is coy about its plans for this technology and is committed to a next generation of crewed nuclear submarines. Yet the work of Plymouth's AI pioneers may see their most perilous missions delegated to an AI program that never goes off watch.

We all know the drill&mdash;you polish your cover letter, spruce up an old resume and summon the courage to click send. After that, your career is in the hands of the hiring manager.Except that isn't always the case. In many instances, instead of your application being tossed aside by a HR professional, it is actually artificial intelligence that is the barrier to entry. While this isn't a problem in itself&mdash;AI can reduce workflow by rapidly filtering applicants&mdash;the issue is that within these systems lies the possibility of bias.It is illegal in the U.S. for employers to discriminate against a job applicant because of their race, color, sex, religion, disability, national origin, age (40 or older) or genetic information. However, these AI hiring tools are often inadvertently doing just that, and there are no federal laws in the U.S. to stop this from happening.Kevin Butler is CEO at Centigy, a company that assesses human resources AI software. He told Newsweek there are ""over a thousand AI HR tools on the market right now. Lots of organizations are using them, the uptake is pretty high.""These programs range from screening resumes and rating competency, to using facial recognition tools and analyzing a person's voice, body language or even, controversially, their emotions.But how can a computer system, devoid of feeling or social prejudices, discriminate?Well, a recent example of a piece of HR AI software that may have displayed racial bias was a facial identification tool that Uber used to conduct security tests on its drivers.The software, created by Microsoft, has a record of not recognizing darker-skinned faces, and in 2018 there was a recorded 20.8 percent failure rate for females with darker skin, as opposed to 0 percent when tested on white men.Fourteen Uber couriers lost their jobs after the new security measure was adopted last April, and claimed this was down to the AI failing to recognize their dark skin color.An Uber spokesperson told Newsweek that while ""there is always room for improvement"" the company ensures the software is ""fair and important"" with additional human reviews.Dr. Robert Elliot Smith, chief of science and technology at Centigy, explained to Newsweek that these problems can arise because ""many facial recognition software programs have been trained primarily with white faces, oftentimes with white male faces.""He said: ""When you've trained a program on data, it will automatically absorb whatever biases existed in the data."" However, issues around racial biases also happen because hiring AI is often trained on historical data and classifications of race have evolved over time.Smith, who wrote the book Rage Inside the Machine: The Prejudice of Algorithms, and How to Stop the Internet Making Bigots of Us All, said: ""When I was a kid, growing up in Alabama, certainly you were asked to record your personal data but if you were asked about race it would be white or Black. They might have had 'other,' or Native American perhaps.""Well America is a much more diverse place than that now, and categories have expanded. If you think about when 50 years ago there was segregation of races and a lot of people didn't identify as mixed, it just didn't exist when people were segregated.""While many hiring tools may have inbuilt racial biases because of such blind spots, this historical data can also mean there is gender-based discrimination.Smith explained: ""A lot of those programs, if you would say 'the doctor came into the room', they would insert the pronoun 'he' because the vast majority of data would be that men are doctors.""If it is trained on historical data it can very subtly and very undetectably absorb the language biases that are from the past. There are tons of examples of gender biases in computer programming.""This is problematic when a company is using a tool to seek out a candidate as it will favor men. In 2018 Amazon scrapped plans for its own AI hiring system, as Reuters reported that it had ""taught itself that male candidates were preferable"" due to them often having more tech industry experience on their resume.An Amazon spokesperson told Newsweek it had trialed the system but due to its failings it was ""never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates.""However, there have also been examples of AI systems being discriminatory even before someone applies for the job. Back in 2015 the MIT Technology Review found that Google's algorithms meant men were more likely to be advertised better-paid and more senior roles than women.For people who are transgender, Butler explains, AI hiring tools can also be unfair. He said: ""I was talking to a representative from the trans community a few weeks ago. She struggles to get a job in some organizations because she can't pass the background check. The system is trying to find her name, and can only back so far, because her name was changed a few years ago &hellip; You're just not hired because it is too difficult.""However, one of the most contentious uses of an AI hiring tool pertains to not what a person is, but how a person feels. In January HireVue, one of the industry leaders in the hire tech sector, scrapped its widely criticized software that used a candidate's facial expressions from video interviews as a factor its algorithms considered.HireVue told Newsweek its decision to remove the visual analysis was based on its own research and it had been independently audited twice recently, with no issues in terms of bias.Smith explained how analyzing facial expressions could be discriminatory. ""Take if you are a person who is a minority part of neurodiversity, you are a person who emotionally reacts differently, a person on the spectrum, for instance,"" he said. ""You are going to be discriminated against based on emotion detection because the way that you encode emotion and react to emotion is entirely different from the average person.""But there is good news, as these inadvertent biases will not go legally unchecked for much longer. The European Union has proposed regulation governing artificial intelligence, which includes the HR sector. Within a year companies using these hiring tools will need access to employment attorneys who understand technology, AI, as well as these EU privacy and tech regulations.In America, too, this is beginning to gain traction. In February 2020 New York City introduced a bill that regulates the use of AI in hiring, compensation and other HR decisions. If enacted this will prohibit the sale of AI technology unless it has been audited for bias or passed certain anti-bias tests in the year prior to its sale.However, Smith predicts that before the U.S adopts widespread regulation, there will be legal battles. He said: ""America is very anti-regulation compared to European countries. However, it is very driven by litigation&mdash;people get sued.""There will be people out there looking for patterns of decision making in algorithms that effectively violate anti-discrimination laws. So what we may see in the future in America is before there is regulation there may be lawsuits. Those lawsuits could be a class actions.""Newsweek has contacted all the companies mentioned in this article for comment.Update 05/20/21, 12:40 p.m. ET: This article was updated to add a comment from HireVue.",,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        New Artificial Intelligence-supported job-match application “IshtApp”  launched in Kyrgyzstan
      


        New Artificial Intelligence-supported job-match application “IshtApp”  launched in Kyrgyzstan

Photo: Nurbek kyzy Sonun / UNDP KyrgyzstanA new mobile application “IshtApp” for job-match between the unemployed and employers, developed by UNDP with the financial support of the Government of Japan, was launched in Bishkek today. 
In support of socioeconomic recovery, UNDP has developed an application for job search in all regions of Kyrgyzstan, offering an innovative matching system for the unemployed and employers to meet their respective needs in searching jobs and adequate workforce. It is targeted to help the recently unemployed, many of whom were working in the shadow economy, such as daily workers and returning migrants, including women, youth, and minorities to link to new employment opportunities and access skills upgrading services.
A job seeker can register an account, add, change or remove her resume, search vacancies using multiple settings or directly chat with potential employers. An employer can register an account, and create, edit or remove vacancies. The website www.ishtapp.kg(link is external) allows to administer all processes related to this job-match platform to include management and monitoring of resumes, generation of analytics related to the labor-market trends based on information processed and received from all users including the unemployed and employers. In addition, users can access the free training courses. The application is available in both Kyrgyz and Russian languages.
UNDP Resident Representative Louise Chamberlain said: “The economic and social disruption caused by COVID-19 has caused many businesses to fail and forced them to let go of their workers. The impact is becoming more apparent as the pandemic continues with deepening poverty and affecting the vulnerable populations most. But the pandemic has also brought opportunities, and the digital economy offers a recovery path that is more equitable and greener. The App helps match job seekers and employers throughout the country and enables investment in digital entrepreneurship,” said Chamberlain.
“We will carry out a number of activities to help solve the social and economic issues that emerged in Kyrgyzstan due to COVID-19. We expect that the application will become a reliable platform for job seekers and employers to find one another. Citizens of Kyrgyzstan who have lost their jobs, labour migrants forced to return home during the pandemic, employers, and small and medium-sized businesses will benefit from this platform,” said His Excellency Maeda Shigeki, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Kyrgyz Republic.
 “Our goal was to create a convenient and functional application with the best vacancies in Kyrgyzstan in real time. The app has an Artificial Intelligence-based analytical system which shows users only the most relevant vacancies. The online platform allows to find most suitable employers or job seekers in the shortest time,” Mr. Mirbek Okenov, the Director of Ulut Soft company that worked on the application explains.
The mobile application was first created under the pilot project “Skills for Reintegration” implemented by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) in 2018. Granted the rights by GIZ to develop the application further, UNDP makes efforts to develop additional services within the app.
IshtApp offers an opportunity to build on digital connectivity in Kyrgyzstan, where the mobile Internet penetration is 94 percent (Freedom House, 2020) and 92 percent of the population has mobile phones (National Statistics Committee of Kyrgyzstan, 2018).
In 2020, a joint report(link is external) (2020) by the Asian Development Bank, UNDP, and the Economic Policy Research Institute under the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic titled “COVID-19 in the Kyrgyz Republic: Socioeconomic and Vulnerability Impact Assessment and Policy Response(link is external)”, expected the unemployment rate to exceed 20%. Recently, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic presented a sample survey “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Households”, in which approximately 22% of households claimed that at least one member of their families lost their job or was forced to return from abroad due to loss of earnings.The app is available at:

A new cross-disciplinary research initiative at MIT aims to promote the understanding and use of AI across all segments of society. The effort, called Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE), will develop new teaching approaches and tools to engage learners in settings from preK-12 to the workforce.

“People are using AI every day in our workplaces and our private lives. It’s in our apps, devices, social media, and more. It’s shaping the global economy, our institutions, and ourselves. Being digitally literate is no longer enough. People need to be AI-literate to understand the responsible use of AI and create things with it at individual, community, and societal levels,” says RAISE Director Cynthia Breazeal, a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT.

“But right now, if you want to learn about AI to make AI-powered applications, you pretty much need to have a college degree in computer science or related topic,” Breazeal adds. “The educational barrier is still pretty high. The vision of this initiative is: AI for everyone else — with an emphasis on equity, access, and responsible empowerment.”

Headquartered in the MIT Media Lab, RAISE is a collaboration with the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MIT Open Learning. The initiative will engage in research coupled with education and outreach efforts to advance new knowledge and innovative technologies to support how diverse people learn about AI as well as how AI can help to better support human learning. Through Open Learning and the Abdul Latif Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL), RAISE will also extend its reach into a global network where equity and justice are key.

The initiative draws on MIT’s history as both a birthplace of AI technology and a leader in AI pedagogy. “MIT already excels at undergraduate and graduate AI education,” says Breazeal, who heads the Media Lab’s Personal Robots group and is an associate director of the Media Lab. “Now we’re building on those successes. We’re saying we can take a leadership role in educational research, the science of learning, and technological innovation to broaden AI education and empower society writ large to shape our future with AI.”

In addition to Breazeal, RAISE co-directors are Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and education; Eric Klopfer, professor and director of the Scheller Teacher Education Program; and Hae Won Park, a research scientist at the Media Lab. Other principal leaders include Professor Sanjay Sarma, vice president for open learning. RAISE draws additional participation from dozens of faculty, staff, and students across the Institute.

“In today’s rapidly changing economic and technological landscape, a core challenge nationally and globally is to improve the effectiveness, availability, and equity of preK-12 education, community college, and workforce development. AI offers tremendous promise for new pedagogies and platforms, as well as for new content. Developing and deploying advances in computing for the public good is core to the mission of the Schwarzman College of Computing, and I’m delighted to have the College playing a role in this initiative,” says Daniel Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.

The new initiative will engage in research, education, and outreach activities to advance four strategic impact areas: diversity and inclusion in AI, AI literacy in preK-12 education, AI workforce training, and AI-supported learning. Success entails that new knowledge, materials, technological innovations, and programs developed by RAISE are leveraged by other stakeholder AI education programs across MIT and beyond to add value to their efficacy, experience, equity, and impact.

RAISE will develop AI-augmented tools to support human learning across a variety of topics. “We’ve done a lot of work in the Media Lab around companion AI,” says Park. “Personalized learning companion AI agents such as social robots support individual students’ learning and motivation to learn. This work provides an effective and safe space for students to practice and explore topics such as early childhood literacy and language development.”

Diversity and inclusion will be embedded throughout RAISE’s work, to help correct historic inequities in the field of AI. “We're seeing story after story of unintended bias and inequities that are arising because of these AI systems,” says Breazeal. “So, a mission of our initiative is to educate a far more diverse and inclusive group of people in the responsible design and use of AI technologies, who will ultimately be more representative of the communities they will be developing these products and services for.”

This spring, RAISE is piloting a K-12 outreach program called Future Makers. The program brings engaging, hands-on learning experiences about AI fundamentals and critical thinking about societal implications to teachers and students, primarily from underserved or under-resourced communities, such as schools receiving Title I services.

To bring AI to young people within and beyond the classroom, RAISE is developing and distributing curricula, teacher guides, and student-friendly AI tools that enable anyone, even those with no programming background, to create original applications for desktop and mobile computing. “Scratch and App Inventor are already in the hands of millions of learners worldwide,” explains Abelson. “RAISE is enhancing these platforms and making powerful AI accessible to all people for increased creativity and personal expression.”

Ethics and AI will be a central component to the initiative’s curricula and teaching tools. “Our philosophy is, have kids learn about the technical concepts right alongside the ethical design practices,” says Breazeal.  “Thinking through the societal implications can’t be an afterthought.”

“AI is changing the way we interact with computers as consumers as well as designers and developers of technology,” Klopfer says. “It is creating a new paradigm for innovation and change. We want to make sure that all people are empowered to use this technology in constructive, creative, and beneficial ways.”

“Connecting this initiative not only to [MIT’s schools of] engineering and computing, but also to the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences recognizes the multidimensional nature of this effort,” Klopfer adds.

Sarma says RAISE also aims to boost AI literacy in the workforce, in part by adapting some of their K-12 techniques. “Many of these tools — when made somewhat more sophisticated and more germane to the adult learner — will make a tremendous difference,” says Sarma. For example, he envisions a program to train radiology technicians in how AI programs interpret diagnostic imagery and, vitally, how they can err.

“AI is having a truly transformative effect across broad swaths of society,” says Breazeal. “Children today are not only digital natives, they’re AI natives. And adults need to understand AI to be able to engage in a democratic dialogue around how we want these systems deployed.”

GBHProf. Eric Klopfer, co-director of the RAISE initiative (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment in Education), speaks with GBH reporter Diane Adame about the importance of providing students guidance on navigating artificial intelligence systems. “I think it's really important for kids to be aware that these things exist now, because whether it's in school or out of school, they are part of systems where AI is present,” says Klopfer. “Many humans are biased. And so the [AI] systems express those same biases that they've seen online and the data that they've collected from humans.”

The New York TimesNew York Times reporter Natasha Singer spotlights the Day of AI, an MIT RAISE program aimed at teaching K-12 students about AI. “Because AI is such a powerful new technology, in order for it to work well in society, it really needs some rules,” said MIT President Sally Kornbluth. Prof. Cynthia Breazeal, MIT’s dean of digital learning, added: “We want students to be informed, responsible users and informed, responsible designers of these technologies.”

Bias a Chief Barrier to Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare


The potential for algorithms to perpetuate bias and exacerbate disparities is a critical hurdle for artificial intelligence in healthcare.

To ensure the safe and effective use of artificial intelligence in healthcare, researchers and developers will need to work to eliminate bias in these tools, according to a perspective paper by Stanford University researchers.







As artificial intelligence tools grow more prevalent in the medical field, leaders need to make sure these technologies benefit all populations and demographics.
“The white body and the male body have long been the norm in medicine guiding drug discovery, treatment and standards of care, so it’s important that we do not let AI devices fall into that historical pattern,” said Londa Schiebinger, the John L. Hinds Professor in the History of Science in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford.
“We’re hoping to engage the AI biomedical community in preventing bias and creating equity in the initial design of research, rather than having to fix things after the fact.”
To develop equitable AI devices, adequate data collection is a key first step. The team noted that while public datasets often fail to represent minority populations, private datasets that may be more diverse are usually restricted to a single hospital or academic center.
Improving the reliability of AI systems will require leaders to fix this gap, and there are several existing efforts that aim to do so.
“The paucity of annotated photos of darker-skin individuals is a significant barrier for dermatology and telehealth algorithms. The Stanford Skin of Color Project is an ongoing crowd science effort to collect and curate the largest publicly available dataset of dermatologically relevant images from darker skin tones. This data can help to train and assess machine learning models,” researchers said.
“In genetics, there are similar efforts to prioritize the collection and analysis of non-European genetics data, which is necessary for genetic understandings of diseases such as polygenetic risk scores to benefit diverse populations. For example, the recent PAGE study demonstrates a robust framework to identify new genetic correlates of phenotypes using over 49,000 non-European individuals.”
In addition to collecting diverse data, researchers emphasized the importance of consistently evaluating AI tools, even after organizations have deployed them.
“Post deployment monitoring of AI algorithms is an emerging area of research. Researchers have developed statistical tests to detect if the data that an algorithm is applied to is substantially different from the data that the algorithm was trained on. These tests trigger real-time warnings that the deployed AI algorithm may have biases due to its training data. This can be a practical approach for monitoring,” the team wrote.
“We recommend that hospitals and regulators such as the FDA consider the monitoring framework and the AI algorithm as a holistic package to be evaluated and deployed together.”
In terms of longer-term solutions, the team cited the need for regulatory agencies to promote equity in AI use.
“The FDA has set out five criteria for excellence in its Digital Health Innovation Action Plan. The specific guidelines to certify medical computer-aided systems, however, do not mention sex, gender, or other axes of health disparities in data collection,” researchers stated.
“We recommend expanding the current FDA guidelines for software as a medical device (SaMD) to include a four-part pre- and post-market review of ML health tools: an analysis of health disparities in the clinical domain of interest; a review of training data for bias; transparency surrounding decisions made regarding model performance, especially in relation to health disparities; and post-market review of health equity outcomes.”
Universities could also support the development responsible AI by refining coursework and curricula.
“Ethics is most often taught in stand-alone modules (39 percent) and not linked to core curricula (28 percent–the other 33 percent combine both approaches),” the group said.
“The AI for biomedicine community can also benefit from curriculum that incorporates ethics into computational training by drawing from the relevant material in both CS and medical ethics.”
Teams should also be diverse to ensure algorithms don’t exacerbate disparities, the team stated.
“Additional problems may arise from the lack of gender and ethnic diversity in AI teams, a situation that can contribute to perpetuating unconscious biases in research design and outcomes. Teams should be diverse in terms of participants and also in terms of skill sets and methods,” researchers said.
“AI researchers themselves should understand the basics of sex, gender, diversity, and intersectional analysis as these relate to their technical work.”
The widespread use of AI in healthcare will depend on the ability for researchers and developers to eliminate potential bias.
“As with other biomedical technologies such as genome sequencing and editing, it is critical that innovation in biomedical AI is complemented by efforts to reduce human risk and to ensure that its benefits are broadly shared by diverse countries and populations,” the team concluded.
“Clearly, technology alone is not the fix; large social problems that undergird structural inequality need to be addressed. Nonetheless, researchers and educators can do their part to develop education and technologies that strive toward social justices.”

You’d get your prescription from your doctor, then start picking up frames and trying them on at random. You had no idea what would look good on you, so your best option was to try on everything and hope for the best.

If your eyes are bad, trying on frames and trying to decide if they were suitable was extremely challenging – you might not be able to see your hand in front of your face without your prescription lens. How could you decide what frames to invest in by squinting in the mirror?

PROMOTED
These days – especially in the midst of a global pandemic – we don’t want to make an appointment to visit an optician, then be confined to a tiny selection of glasses. We also don’t want to guess about what’s going to look good on us, or spend hours physically trying on frames.

The way we buy glasses is ripe for disruption. Now, with the help of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI), the entire process of getting an eye exam and purchasing eyewear is changing radically.

VR headsets are evolving so quickly, and experts predict that soon they’ll be enabled with cameras that can deliver a 100% virtual eye test. The headset will be able to shine a light into the back of your eye to detect problems, as well as determine your prescription with precision.

Then the VR system will automatically deliver a digital prescription – you no longer have to worry about carrying around a paper prescription to give to a commercial retailer.
Once you have that prescription, you can enter a virtual showroom to “try on” frames and make a selection.

Shopping Using Augmented Reality
Warby Parker already leverages augmented reality to help their customers shop for glasses online.
They use the face-mapping features of Apple iPhones to help users put on virtual frames, similar to using SnapChat filters that let us add cat whiskers or ears to our faces. The glasses even stay on your face as you turn your head.
In this new “virtual try-on” world, powered by AR, you also get personalized recommendations that go far beyond the advice you’d get at an in-person optician’s showroom. With AI, online retailers can scan the shape of your face and make recommendations for frames that will look good on you.
The AI can even scan your social media profiles to get a sense of your style and preferences, then make recommendations for frames that will suit your personal style. With VR and AR, the entire process becomes far more customer-centric.
Instead of standing in a showroom feeling frustrated, then ending up getting glasses that don’t actually look good on you, you can select the perfect pair using a personalized, fun process enabled by AR, VR, and AI.

Aryballe, a startup that uses artificial intelligence and digital olfaction technology to mimic the human sense of smell, helps their business customers turn odor data into actionable information.

You’d be surprised how many practical use cases there are for technology like this. I interviewed Sam Guillaume, CEO of Aryballe, and asked him how digital olfaction works, how it's currently being used on the market, and what his predictions are for the future of fragrance tech.

PROMOTED
How the Nose Knows
Our human noses work by processing odor molecules released by organic and inorganic objects. When energy in objects increases (through pressure, agitation, or temperature changes), odors evaporate, making it possible for us to inhale and absorb them through our nasal cavities.
The odors then stimulate our nasal olfactory neurons and the olfactory bulb. Our brains pull together other information (like visual cues and memories of things we’ve smelled before) to identify the smell and decide what to do next.

How Digital Olfaction Works
Digital olfaction mimics the way humans smell by capturing odor signatures using biosensors, then using software solutions to analyze and display the odor data. Artificial Intelligence (AI) interprets the signatures and classifies them based on a database of previously collected smells.

“Over the last few years, technology has allowed us to essentially duplicate the way human olfaction actually works,” Guillaume says. “And by porting this technology to readily available techniques like semiconductors, for instance, we can make sensors that are small, convenient, easy to use, and cheap. In terms of performance and its ability to discriminate between smells, it's pretty close to the way your nose works.”

Practical Use Cases for Digital Olfaction
So how does all this digital olfaction data turn into valuable insights for companies?
Odor analytics can help companies do things like:
●    Engineer the perfect “new car” smells in the automotive industry
●    Predict when maintenance needs to be done in industrial or automotive equipment
●    Automatically detect food spoilage in consumer appliances
●    Reject or approve raw material supply
●    Reduce R&D time for new foods and beverages
●    Ensure fragrances of personal care products like deodorants and shampoos last for a long time
●    Give riders peace of mind on public transportation by emitting an ambient smell
●    Create personal care devices and health sensors that use odors to detect issues and alert users
Leveraging the Power of Odor Data
In the future, companies like Aryballe will potentially be collaborating on projects that will create digital odor libraries for companies, or even creating devices that help COVID-19 patients recover their sense of smell.
Look for more advances as we can continue to find ways to teach computers how to sense the world around them and use the data they collect to help us in our everyday lives.

Artificial intelligence to help fuel London’s cycling boom

TfL has worked with London tech firm Vivacity Labs on a UK-first trial of artificial intelligence technology, which could make it much easier to plan and operate new cycle routes in the capital.
Until now, TfL has relied mainly on manual traffic counts to work out how many people are cycling on any given road. This helps assess demand for new cycle routes and helps TfL improve how it operates the road network for the growing numbers of people cycling. Manual traffic counts, which are carried out at limited locations on London’s road network, are only able to give a snapshot of road use on the given day or time.
Since 2018, TfL has trialled using Vivacity Labs sensors at two busy locations along Millbank. The sensors use artificial intelligence to detect road users and decide which mode of transport they are using. The competitive trial, which is the first time the technology has been used within London, showed that the Vivacity sensors are up to 98% accurate.
Mark Nicholson, CEO and co-founder of Vivacity Labs, said: “We are delighted to have been successful in the competitive trials, and to now be rolling out a set of sensors at critical junctions in a global city such as London.”
The sensors gather data around the clock, which provides a significantly more detailed picture of how London’s roads are being used by everyone 24/7. All video captured by the sensors is processed and discarded within seconds, meaning that no personal data is ever stored. TfL is in the process of introducing 43 more Vivacity sensors at 20 central London locations to gather data and further test to understand the full range of capabilities the technology has to offer.
London’s walking and cycling commissioner Will Norman said: “By getting more people cycling and walking, we can help to tackle congestion and pollution in London and improve our health. Our Healthy Streets approach is based on evidence and data and we welcome new technology that supports this.”



Data about the numbers of people cycling is part of TfL’s planning for new Cycleways across London. As the network continues to grow, TfL will use data from sources such as the sensors to work out where investment in new infrastructure can best be targeted. Enabling more people to walk and cycle is central to the Mayor’s efforts to tackle London’s toxic air, ill-health and the climate emergency. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy target is for 80% of journeys in London made by walking, cycling and public transport by 2041.
Glynn Barton, TfL’s director of Network Management, said: “We work around the clock to keep people on in London moving and we’re always looking for innovative new ways of making our roads safer and more efficient. New data from trials such as this will be really valuable as we invest and make day-to-day decisions to enable more people to walk and cycle.”
As well as detecting people cycling, the sensors also detect people walking and other types of traffic, including cars, HGVs, vans, motorcyclists and buses. The sensors are part of a wider programme of modernisation of TfL’s current road network systems and have the potential to link up to London’s traffic signals and control centre systems to provide data in real time.
The technology used by Vivacity has been developed over four years of research and development, supported by investment from the Mayor of London.

Until now, TfL has relied mainly on manual traffic counts to work out how many people are cycling on any given road. This helps assess demand for new cycle routes and helps TfL improve how it operates the road network for the growing numbers of people cycling. Manual traffic counts, which are carried out at limited locations on London's road network, are only able to give a snapshot of road use on the given day or time.

Since 2018, TfL has trialled using Vivacity Labs sensors at two busy locations along Millbank. The sensors use artificial intelligence to detect road users and decide which mode of transport they are using. The competitive trial, which is the first time the technology has been used within London, showed that the Vivacity sensors are up to 98% accurate.

Mark Nicholson, CEO and co-founder of Vivacity Labs, said: ""We are delighted to have been successful in the competitive trials, and to now be rolling out a set of sensors at critical junctions in a global city such as London.""

The sensors gather data around the clock, which provides a significantly more detailed picture of how London's roads are being used by everyone 24/7. All video captured by the sensors is processed and discarded within seconds, meaning that no personal data is ever stored. TfL is in the process of introducing 43 more Vivacity sensors at 20 central London locations to gather data and further test to understand the full range of capabilities the technology has to offer.

London's walking and cycling commissioner Will Norman said: ""By getting more people cycling and walking, we can help to tackle congestion and pollution in London and improve our health. Our Healthy Streets approach is based on evidence and data and we welcome new technology that supports this.""

Data about the numbers of people cycling is part of TfL's planning for new Cycleways across London. As the network continues to grow, TfL will use data from sources such as the sensors to work out where investment in new infrastructure can best be targeted. Enabling more people to walk and cycle is central to the Mayor's efforts to tackle London's toxic air, ill-health and the climate emergency. The Mayor's Transport Strategy target is for 80% of journeys in London made by walking, cycling and public transport by 2041.

Glynn Barton, TfL's director of Network Management, said: ""We work around the clock to keep people on in London moving and we're always looking for innovative new ways of making our roads safer and more efficient. New data from trials such as this will be really valuable as we invest and make day-to-day decisions to enable more people to walk and cycle.""

As well as detecting people cycling, the sensors also detect people walking and other types of traffic, including cars, HGVs, vans, motorcyclists and buses. The sensors are part of a wider programme of modernisation of TfL's current road network systems and have the potential to link up to London's traffic signals and control centre systems to provide data in real time.

The technology used by Vivacity has been developed over four years of research and development, supported by investment from the Mayor of London.",,,,,,,,,,,#Breadcrumb,2020.0,{'@id': '#Publisher'},{'@id': '#Publisher'},,,,,,,

Summary
AIoT, the confluence of AI and Industrial IoT technological forces, gives rise to a new digital solution category – the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). AIoT is built for industrial companies looking for better ways to connect their evolving workforce to data-driven decision tools and digitally augment work and business processes and make better use of industrial data already collected. ARC Advisory Group has observed that the convergence and overlap of IT and OT groups, driven largely by the digital transformation of industry in recent years has created organizational confusion and a significant “gray-space” of common technologies between each area, one area being AI.
However, leveraging AI requires data science capability, which adds additional complexity to an already complex environment. While engineering roles are skilled in analyzing large amounts of data, setting up and creating production grade machine learning environments is not easily accomplished. Unlocking the value of industrial data through AI requires a hybrid approach. This is where we get to the paradigm of Industrial AI, which combines data science and AI with software and domain expertise to deliver measurable business outcomes for capital-intensive industries.
At one time, this manufacturing digital nervous system was primarily based solely on legacy systems and architectures. But today, the industry is borrowing from IT approaches and architectures developed for enterprise systems with a focus on speed and scale. These next generation of Industrial AI solutions make it easier for the industry to embed and deploy AI into industrial systems and allow users to solve industrial problems without retraining or adding data science capabilities to industrial organizations.
Key drivers for AI-IoT convergence include:

The overlap of IT and OT groups driven largely by the digital transformation and significant “gray-space” of common technologies between each area.
Interest in the democratization of the application of AI in the industrial domain by converging data science with IT systems and OT domain expertise.
Aspen Technology announced the Aspen AIoT Hub that provides production-grade integrated data management, edge, and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy and host industrial AI applications and unlock the business value from industrial data assets at enterprise speed and scale.

IT/OT Organizations Leave an Abundance of Gray Space
Information technology or “IT” commonly provides the applications and infrastructure that enables business functions to run their respective business processes. Operational technology or “OT,” in turn, executes the physical value-add via real-time systems.

Historically, the scope and ownership of IT covers the spectrum of systems that support centralized corporate functions like finance, HR, supply chain, order management, sales, etc. These functions and their processes tend to have commonality across industries. However, OT involves the spectrum of systems that deal with the physical transformation of products and services. These task-specific and often mission-critical systems are highly customized for individual industries. They typically fall under the domain of a centralized (global) engineering services group or de-centralized (plant-level) engineering group.
ARC has observed that the convergence and overlap of IT and OT groups, driven largely by the digital transformation of industry in recent years, has created organizational confusion around ownership and responsibility. This historical view is somewhat clouded by technology change and convergence, centralization versus decentralization, and the prevalence of significant “gray-space” of common technologies between each area.
Convergence of AI and Industrial IoT
Industrial companies are looking for better ways to connect their workforce to decision tools and digitally enhance or augment work and business processes. At the center of industrial technology strategies, leaders are looking to make better use of industrial data already collected and help diverse persons within the organization make better decisions that improve business performance. We see this dynamic across all aspects of manufacturing, from design engineering to operations and maintenance to supply chain and human resources.
However, leveraging AI requires data science capability, adding additional complexity to an already complex environment. An AI system built for industrial processes without adequate knowledge of a plant or process or without appropriate controls and systems could create a potentially dangerous situation by introducing serious errors and impacting plant decision making.
Industrial manufacturing has not typically built organizational competency in data science. While engineering roles are skilled in analyzing large amounts of data, setting up and creating production-grade machine learning environments is not easily accomplished.
AIoT is the convergence of AI and the IoT, bringing intelligence from the edge to the cloud in industrial environments, transforming the data into useful information for an improved decision-making process, with processing done in a location where it is most needed. The foundation of Industrial IoT is the ability to collect massive quantities of data at high frequency and making these integrated datasets mobile and accessible across the organization for strategic decision making. AIoT is the democratization of AI and machine learning in the industrial domain by converging data science with IT providing software at scale and OT domain expertise.

Artificial Intelligence is the brain of a system, while the Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) functions like the digital nervous system. At one time, this digital nervous system was primarily based solely on legacy systems and architectures, such as control systems, networks, and process historian infrastructure. But today, the industry is borrowing again from IT and approaches and architectures developed for enterprise systems including the cloud. These systems make it easier for the industry to embed AI into operational technologies by leveraging a scalable data infrastructure to power Industrial AI models from training to productization and allow users to solve industrial problems without significantly adding data science capabilities to industrial organizations.
AspenTech Industrial AI Infrastructure: Aspen AIoT Hub
To help embed data science, Aspen Technology announced the Aspen AIoT Hub -- a fit-for-purpose, cloud-ready and built-for-industry Industrial AI infrastructure solution. The AIoT Hub provides the integrated data management, edge and cloud infrastructure and production-grade AI environment to build, deploy and host industrial AI applications at enterprise speed and scale.
The Aspen AIoT Hub consists of several well-established and innovative technologies. At its core is Aspen InfoPlus.21, which integrates cloud-native connectivity, capabilities providing the ability to assemble and deploy AI-driven IoT applications, and the advanced enterprise workflows, analytics, and governance that is designed for industrial companies. Key capabilities of the Aspen AIoT Hub include:
Data Integration & Mobility
Through the Aspen AIoT Hub, organizations will be able to access and leverage fully integrated data, from sensors to the edge and cloud, across the enterprise.
Cloud-ready Infrastructure
Scaling AI requires providing the tools, infrastructure, and workflows for broader collaboration between development, data science, and infrastructure capabilities such as CloudOps, DevOps, MLOps and others.
Enterprise-wide Visualization
The Aspen AIoT Hub enables enterprise users access to real-time data and analytics to do all of this – improving collaboration, project efficiency and operations by tapping into the power of accelerated insights and enhanced visualizations.
Industrial AI Applications Ecosystem
Provides an embedded workbench for feature engineering, training, and rapidly productizing machine learning (ML) models, as well as supports versioning and collaboration. It empowers data scientists, at customers and partners, to collaborate with domain experts on data-rich AI apps.

Conclusion
ARC Advisory Group research finds interest in AI in manufacturing to be strong; however, a recent digital transformation study of 157 process manufacturers finds barriers to organizational accountability, change leadership, and competency. This disconnect between ambition and ability is cause for industrial companies to seek ways to democratize application of AI through Industrial AI, just as Industrial IoT has democratized the access to data.
The confluence of AI and Industrial IoT technological forces gives rise to a new digital solution category -- the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) -- that centers on unlocking the untapped business value in industrial data. This category describes the combination of AI technologies with the Industrial IoT to enable the next generation of Industrial AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to enable seamless human-machine workflows, harmonize industrial data management, and rapidly transform raw data into tangible business outcomes.
Today, the industry stands at a tipping point – they must tap into the disruptive power of these technologies to transform their business operations and redefine their sustainable competitive advantage or else risk obsolescence. As AI and Industrial IoT converge into AIoT, the information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) functions are also converging -- unlocking additional opportunities and challenges.
Drivers for AI and Industrial IoT convergence place an emphasis on using data already gathered. ARC Advisory Group recommends industrial users consider the following business drivers to justify an AIoT strategy.

Miller works with some of the world’s most innovative Artificial Intelligence companies in her role at Amazon Web Services. Her career path and unique job helped her get involved in a new report that looks at the opportunities for women in AI and ways to close the industry’s gender gap.“My job didn’t exist three years ago. It was nowhere in the world."" said Miller, global head of machine learning and business development for startups and venture capital at AWS. “Today, there are infinite paths to get into AI and machine learning. It’s not this narrow little sidewalk you have to tiptoe. It’s a 14-lane highway.”Miller was one of several women in AI leadership positions interviewed for Women in AI, a new report by AWS partner Deloitte and their AI Institute. The report examines the roots of the gender gap in the industry—as well as what can be done to fix it—and the opportunities available to women in the fast-growing field. Allie K. Miller, global head of machine learning and business development for startups and venture capital at AWS.The report is based on in-depth interviews with 12 executives, all women, and a survey of 200 experts working in AI, a quarter of whom identified as male. AWS co-sponsored the Women in AI report. It includes a foreword from LaDavia Drane, who heads Global Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity at AWS, and Kavitha Prabhakar, chief officer of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Deloitte.In order to build an effective AI system, an AI team needs to be as diverse as the population the team’s AI will impact. Given that half the world’s population is female, having more gender diversity in AI is “common sense,” as Miller put it. Yet women only make up 26% of data and AI positions in the global workforce. Why?One of the main barriers to women working in AI comes long before they enter the job market, according to the report. Social and cultural stereotypes, such as girls not being as capable as boys in math or science, often dissuade young women from pursuing study focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math).Many of the women Deloitte researchers interviewed said they wouldn’t have pursued a path to AI had they not had a direct influence to get into STEM, such as a mother who worked in science or an engineering camp in middle school. The women also emphasized the roles of mentors. “When I look back at my career, most of my successes can be traced back to a mentor,” Miller said. “The benefits of the mentor-mentee relationship cannot be overestimated.”“The advice I would have given my younger self on my professional development is ‘don’t be afraid to ask for help,’” said Dr. Nashlie Sephus, applied science manager for AWS, another leader interviewed for the report.Dr. Nashlie Sephus, applied science manager for AWS.The report emphasizes that although a strong mathematical or statistical background can be important in AI, it is not a prerequisite. And even though men outnumber women in the AI industry, men aren’t necessarily more advanced in their AI careers, according to the report. AI is still a nascent field where relatively few people have leading expertise, and many organizations and workforces are just beginning their AI journeys.Among the report’s key recommendations:Build and showcase archetypes of women working in AI Researchers said it is vital to have women in visible roles as scientists or AI leaders within business and society. Those leaders provide other women working in AI with clear examples of how to advance professionally, and their visibility helps deconstruct stereotypes about women and girls not belonging in STEM fields.Provide education on AIOrganizations need to remove the ambiguity surrounding what it means to work in AI and showcase the numerous opportunities in the industry beyond engineering and tech roles. Businesses also must promote a culture of continuous learning and provide women interested in AI with professional development opportunities.Mentor future women in AIMany of the women interviewed for the report said mentorship was a key driver behind their success. They said informal relationships had as much, if not more, influence on their trajectory than formal programs.Create a culture of diversity and inclusion at all levelsThe report found that organizational programs to address gender diversity are likely not enough on their own. Creating a culture of inclusion means constantly searching for and eliminating biases and discrimination against women in the workforce, while at the same time placing women into organizational opportunities where they have been historically underrepresented.“What struck me most about this research is that it clearly shows the way to increase representation of women in AI goes far beyond recruitment,” said Drane, who leads AWS’s global inclusion, diversity, and equity efforts.“It starts with supporting early STEM education and showing young women and girls what AI roles are out there. It’s real, active mentorship that’s organic and from peers, and it’s ongoing training and development to build AI leaders that organizations can then champion.“All of this resonates with me because it's clear we're on the right track at AWS with our focus and commitments,” Drane said. “But it's also clear we need to do more. We all do. And now we know the path to get there.”Get the full report here.",Building career paths for women in AI,https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/building-career-paths-for-women-in-ai,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/building-career-paths-for-women-in-ai'}","[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 1025, 'url': 'https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/9f0fe84/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2000x1380+0+0/resize/1486x1025!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2Ff0%2F11fd2abf4fda9dde8553c2566598%2Fallie-miller-headshot-2.jpg', 'width': 1486}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 675, 'url': 'https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/72d02f9/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2Ff0%2F11fd2abf4fda9dde8553c2566598%2Fallie-miller-headshot-2.jpg', 'width': 1200}]",AWS,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Amazon Staff '}]",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'US About Amazon', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://amazon-blogs-brightspot-lower.s3.amazonaws.com/about/00/92/0260aab44ee8a2faeafde18ee1da/amazon-logo-inverse.svg'}, 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Amazon', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com'}}",,"May 10, 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Vivino: Choose Your Next Great Wine With Big Data And Artificial Intelligence Adobe Stock
I interviewed Heini Zachariassen, Vivino’s Founder and CEO, about how Vivino is using big data and artificial intelligence to help people find and purchase their perfect wine.

PROMOTED
Getting More Info in the Wine Aisle
Most people aren’t wine experts, and there are a lot of choices on the market. So when people walk into a supermarket or beverage store and see a wall of wine choices, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.
Heini Zachariassen originally founded the Vivino app to empower people with the knowledge to make better choices for them, and remove a lot of the mystery from the wine world.
When you snap a photo of a bottle of wine, you can immediately look at crowdsourced reviews, check prices, and even place an order right from your phone. You can also scan wine lists in restaurants to help you pick the right vino when you’re out at a nice restaurant.

Vivino’s unique wine shopping experience is 100% powered by community data – 20,000 new users download the app every day.
When asked how important data is to Vivino, Heini said:

""The real game-changer for us is that we know all these wines by now. We have 1.5 billion pictures of wine labels, 200 million ratings, and 10 million wines in the database. 200 million ratings. The data is the key to our business, and no other company can compete with us because we have that information and have 50 million users helping us maintain it.”

The Vivino app can tell you whether the wine has the level of smoothness or dryness you’re looking for, whether it’s a good match for your meal, and even whether or not it’s a good deal.
After you’ve tried the wine, you can record your own rating and tasting notes in the app, and it will add that information to your profile to expand its knowledge of your tastes and preferences.
Personalized Matches for Every Wine Drinker
Vivino recently built artificial intelligence (AI) on top of all their review and profile data to create algorithms that generate a personalized match score for every user and every wine.
Once you've rated at least five wines, every wine in the database will have a ""match score"" that's generated just for you, letting you know if there's a high, medium, or low chance that you’ll like it.
These match scores are generated specifically for you – Vivino knows that a 5-star wine for someone else might not be a knockout choice for you.
“Even I'm surprised how accurate it is,” Heini says. “The app knows things about me that I didn't even realize. For example, I love champagne. Some champagnes are based on Pinot Noir, and some are based on Chardonnay. The Vivino algorithm actually recognized that the champagnes I didn’t care for were all Chardonnay-based ones. I had no idea.”
The Data That Connects User to Vineyard
Heini believes that the wine industry will be able to build on the big data Vivino and other wine tech companies have gathered, and use machine learning and artificial intelligence to continue to push the boundaries of the industry in the future.

I love being surrounded by plants every day. Here, it’s February, and I’m in my laboratory in San Francisco, California, where I work for a company called Brightseed. I break plants down into fine powders so our scientists can uncover each plant’s metabolome — the complete set of small molecules that it makes. Brightseed aims to find the molecules that matter in terms of human health and nutrition.

For Sanskrit to be the first language or mother tongue is rare. But it can be the third or fourth language. We don’t capture that. Hence, we don’t know how many Indians speak Sanskrit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Union government has been keen to preserve and promote Sanskrit. Among the more recent examples is the passing of the Central Sanskrit Universities Bill — granting central university status to three deemed-to-be Sanskrit universities — to broaden the scope of Sanskrit education and research in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the New Education Policy 2020 called for Sanskrit to be available for study across the school and higher education levels, notably pulling back the grade at which a student can begin learning Sanskrit, to the primary level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons to promote Sanskrit are good and many, but perhaps the most tempting is to unveil the vast treasure house of ancient Indian knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;ins&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.dailyo.in/arts/ten-sanskrit-texts-everyone-must-read/story/1/1067.html""&gt;more to Sanskrit literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; than the &lt;em&gt;Vedas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Puranas&lt;/em&gt;, and the epics &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt;. If only Sanskrit is made more accessible to the interested, it allows us to tap into an earlier era of Indian history, culture, and thought, and discover more about our past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the efforts of a computer scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, and his team is commendable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Dr Pawan Goyal are working to make Sanskrit texts more accessible with the help of automated computational processing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work combines machine learning and traditional linguistic knowledge to build an artificial intelligence system for processing ancient literature.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Dr Goyal studied electrical engineering at IIT Kanpur (2003-2007) and received his doctoral degree from the University of Ulster, United Kingdom, in 2011. He thereafter worked as a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Paris Rocquencourt, developing the “Sanskrit Heritage Site” with Gérard Huet, for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, he joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur and has been there ever since, exploring the research areas of text mining, natural language processing, and Sanskrit computational linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Goyal has also taught the course “natural language processing” as part of the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) educational initiative by the seven IITs and the Indian Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also the recipient of various awards, like INAE Young Engineer Awards 2020, Google India AI/ML Research Awards 2020, and Facebook AI and Ethics Research Award India, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Goyal spoke to &lt;em&gt;Swarajya&lt;/em&gt; about his work combining two things dear to him — Sanskrit and computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) You have devised a way to digitally process Sanskrit texts. What led you in this direction of research?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit has a rich literary tradition spanning more than two millennia that encapsulates the cultural ethos of this civilisational nation. Works in Sanskrit, numbering more than 30 million extant manuscripts, include extensive epics, subtle and intricate philosophical, mathematical, and scientific treatises, and rich literary, poetic, and dramatic texts. The design and implementation of computer-aided processing tools is thus of paramount importance to analyse the enormous store of knowledge and literature available as Sanskrit text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first encounter with the computational aspects of Sanskrit was through Panini’s grammar. More recently, the Paninian computational system was recognised as a pioneer in information theory and informatics. While my initial efforts were concentrated on computational implementation of Panini’s grammar, as I pursued my research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I realised that NLP can really be an effective tool to provide a better access to the Sanskrit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed AI-based system, used in conjunction with interactive tools such as the &lt;a href=""https://sanskrit.inria.fr/""&gt;Sanskrit Heritage reader&lt;/a&gt;, can aid the users in easier analysis of these manuscripts with word by word analysis and translation, relation between words, poetry to prose conversion, search and question answering, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Your work with computer science and Sanskrit extends back to your days at the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria). You worked there on ""&lt;ins&gt;&lt;a href=""https://sanskrit.inria.fr/""&gt;The Sanskrit Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;"". Could you tell us about your work there and what you were trying to build?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit Heritage Site at INRIA provides various web services for Sanskrit users. Developed by Prof Gérard Huet, the main web service for this site is Sanskrit Heritage Reader which, given a Sanskrit sequence, provides all possible ways of doing word segmentation (संधि विच्छेद). At the back end, it uses elegant finite state machinery to provide all possible solutions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As can be seen from an example sentence from Kalidasa, the number of solutions can be really large for long sentences. One of the works we did was to develop this lean interface, which could show all the solutions in a compact form, and a Sanskrit expert could then select the correct segmentation solution (&lt;em&gt;pada patha&lt;/em&gt;) by using clicks.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Other notable work was to align all the root forms (lemma) information for this interface to Sanskrit-English Monier Williams dictionary. Thus, the interface now offers lexicon access to both Heritage dictionary (Sanskrit-French) and Monier Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Sanskrit is considered a 'morphologically rich language'. What does that mean exactly, and how does it dictate your approach to working with it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence construction and comprehension in any language relies a lot on how the grammatical information is encoded. Sanskrit has a rich morphology and the grammatical information is encoded using morphological markers. Thus, “सुन्दरः रामः रावणम् हन्ति” and “रावणम् हन्ति सुन्दरः रामः” mean the same because the morphological markers encode the information, but this is not the case for “Dog kills cat” and “Cat kills dog”, where the information is encoded in the word order. This also makes Sanskrit a relatively free word order language. A lot of the literature is in the form of verses and follows relatively free word order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping these in mind, we propose a generic graph-based framework that is able to take advantage of the free word order nature of the language. Our search-based structured prediction framework allows encoding of relevant linguistic information as constraints. Further, we automate feature learning for the structured-prediction model, based on the morphological properties expressed by the words in the language.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4) Ever since the &lt;ins&gt;&lt;a href=""https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/aimagazine/article/view/466""&gt;Rick Briggs article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; about Sanskrit and AI appeared in &lt;/em&gt;AI Magazine&lt;em&gt; in 1985, there have been various interpretations of how the two (Sanskrit and AI) might be linked favourably or otherwise. From your point of view as an expert in the field, could you clarify what we should be taking away on this matter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a very interesting article, which focused on how concepts from Indian grammatical tradition could be used for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence research. The article itself is rigorous and interesting, but it spread on the Internet as uncontrollable disinformation. At some point it was quoted saying that Sanskrit is the ultimate programming language, studied in secret NASA laboratories. These are just rumours. Sanskrit, like any other natural language such as English or Hindi, is definitely not directly usable as a programming language. These rumours are detrimental to the respect that the ancient science of Vyakaraṇa genuinely deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5) How is it to computationally process Sanskrit relative to any other language(s)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit presents unique challenges in automated computational processing. In addition to the sheer volume and diversity, both stylistic and chronological, found in these texts, the linguistic peculiarities expressed by the language, pose several challenges in making these works accessible to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, following the oral tradition, the phonetic transformations at the word boundaries (&lt;em&gt;sandhi&lt;/em&gt;) are reflected also in writing. Secondly, the language shows high lexical productivity in terms of inflection, derivation, and compounding. Thirdly, a lot of the literature is in the form of verses and follows relatively free word order.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6) What doors do you see your AI system opening for us in the future, especially in regard to our relationship with Sanskrit? Will we see, for instance, better access to our ancient literature?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/46/4/785/97327/A-Graph-Based-Framework-for-Structured-Prediction""&gt;current work&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Computational Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; journal (published by the MIT Press) presents a machine learning system and addresses the tasks of word segmentation (संधि विच्छेद), morphological parsing (पद विश्लेषण), dependency parsing (कारक विश्लेषण), and poetry to prose conversion of Sanskrit text (अन्वय). We are now actively collaborating with several research groups to extend the application of the proposed system for automatic speech recognition and question-answering in Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end-objective is to develop robust tools that can be used to access the ancient literature seamlessly, like we are able to access information available in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7) Does your work with Sanskrit have a personal significance for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it has a lot of personal significance. During my B.Tech days at IIT Kanpur, I attended various seminars and courses organised by Prof. Laxmidhar Behera on the essence of the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;. Going through the books of His Divine Grace A C Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, I developed immense respect for our ancient literature, in particular, the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Srimad Bhagavatam&lt;/em&gt;. I have been greatly benefited by this timeless knowledge in my own pursuit, and I hope that my small efforts will help in making this knowledge accessible to one and all.&lt;/p&gt;","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://swarajyamag.com/science/how-an-iit-kharagpur-computer-scientist-is-unveiling-sanskrit-literature-through-artificial-intelligence', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://swarajya.gumlet.io/swarajya/2021-05/13d9796d-0217-4a23-aef5-41a2a801d244/Prof_Pawan_Goyal_pics.png?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,False,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Artificial Intelligence (AI) Is Helping Musicians Unlock Their CreativityAdobe Stock
Many artists feel we’re about to enter a “golden age” of creativity, powered by artificial intelligence, that can push music in new directions.

PROMOTED
Let’s look at some of the newest ways artificial intelligence is transforming the music industry from top to bottom.
Creating New Songs with the Help of AI
For 30 years, musician and composer David Cope has been working on Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI). EMI originally began in 1982 as an effort to help Cope overcome ""composer's block,"" and now his algorithms have produced a large number of original compositions in a variety of genres and styles.

Grammy-nominated producer Alex da Kid used IBM Watson to analyze five years’ of hit songs, as well as cultural data from films, social media, and online articles to figure out a theme for an AI-generated song that fans would enjoy. The final song, “Not Easy,” reached number four on the iTunes Hot Tracks chart within 48 hours after its release.

Composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes, and Michael Hobe were working on music for big-budget movies like The Dark Knight when they started getting requests for simple background music for television and video games. They worked together to create Amper, a consumer-friendly online tool that helps non-musicians and online content creators make royalty-free music – using their own parameters – in a few seconds.
Creating Virtual Pop Stars
One thing is clear: Since the start of the pandemic, fans miss going to concerts.
To fill the void, Authentic Artists has introduced a large collection of AI-powered virtual artists who can deliver new music experiences.
Authentic Artists’ animated virtual musicians generate all-original compositions to play on screen, and also respond to audience feedback by increasing or decreasing the tempo or intensity, or even fast-forwarding to the next song in the set.
Finding the Next Big Artists
Audio-on-demand streaming like Spotify totaled $534 billion in the United States alone, according to Buzz Angle Music’s 2018 report.
So how do promising new artists get discovered, with all that competition?
Artificial intelligence helps the music industry with A&R (artist and repertoire) discovery by combing through music and trying to identify the next breakout star.
Warner Music Group acquired a tech start-up last year that uses an algorithm to review social, streaming, and touring data to find promising talent. In 2018, Apple also acquired Asaii, a start-up that specializes in music analytics, to help them boost their A&R.
AI Complementing Creativity
AI technology is transforming the music industry in a myriad of ways, but creatives shouldn’t be worried about losing their jobs and being replaced by computers. We’re still a long way from artificial intelligence being able to create hit songs on their own.
But as tools develop and the music industry learns how to use AI as a supplement to human creativity, our world will continue to sound sweeter and sweeter every year.

Case Western Reserve University scientists show that artificial intelligence tools can work effectively for different locations, populations
For artificial intelligence (AI) to realize its full potential to benefit cancer patients, researchers will have to prove that their machine-learning successes can be consistently reproduced across settings and patient populations.
That’s why Case Western Reserve biomedical engineering researchers are increasingly focused on applying their novel algorithms to patient scans from multiple locations.
Earlier this spring, for example, they published promising findings involving lung cancer diagnosis among 400 patients from three health care systems. And a 2020 study showed that their approach could predict recurrence in 610 early-stage lung cancer patients across four sites.
Anant Madabhushi
“This is no small thing—this is an important next step in making AI useable for clinicians someday, and it’s one of things we have to address head on,” explained Anant Madabhushi, director of the university’s Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) said. “For instance, we know that even within a single hospital, one could have patients scanned on different CT scanners, resulting in images with differing appearance, so the AI has to be able to account for these differences.”
So if AI is ever going to be trusted—and then routinely used—by physicians and clinicians, Madabhushi said, those end users must be convinced not only that computer diagnosis is possible, but that it can be reproduced—and specifically work for their own patients.
The difference: ‘stable’ featuresTo this point, Anant Madabhushi and his group at the university’s Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) have successfully applied their AI determining which lung cancer patients would respond well to chemotherapy, immunotherapy or, in some cases, whether cancer would return or how long a patient might live.But in each case, those outcomes have only come from analysis of existing data and/or images after the fact and only for a single group of cancer patients.Now, instead of just teaching their computers to focus on features in the scans that differentiate between malignant and benign tumors, for example, they programmed the AI to also remember lesser features which are consistent from one scan to another—even if those features were unrelated to the cancer itself.Key to this work was the evaluation of hundreds of image features by biomedical engineering PhD student Mohammadhadi Khorrami, Madabhushi said.Khorrami considered not only how texture and shape of lung nodules could lead to a diagnosis of lung cancer and predict outcomes, but also how consistent, or stable, these features were across CT scanners and sites.“To do this, we identified a set of features that were most accurate—but at the same time stable across sites,” Khorrami said. “So, when we evaluated the machine learning models with these accurate and stable features on external sites, these models did better when compared to ones created with only the most accurate features, the ones where the stability of features was not considered.”
Next steps: re-proving reproducible results
Researchers call this reproducibility or often “generalizability,” the idea that a successful method, treatment or tool can work no matter when, where, or on whom—or in the face of virtually any other variable.
It has proven an elusive goal and has even called a “myth” by other researchers, who have identified several daunting hurdles. Those difficulties include differences in how CT machines produce images, variations in hardware and software and patient demographics.
To that end, Madabhushi and his group are planning prospective clinical trials using the generalized AI signatures for lung cancer on CT scans that they have already identified.
The researchers have been working with hospitals in Northeast Ohio to assess the real-world generalizability of these AI tools for problems relating to diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancers.
Now, new published research builds on previous and ongoing work within CCIPD over the last few years in the area of developing generalizable AI models.
What’s new is the creation of a more formal framework for identifying stable and accurate features, while also validating the approach on much larger numbers of studies and institutions. 
The research by Madabhushi, biomedical engineering PhD student Mohammadhadi Khorrami and collaborators appeared, respectively, in April 2020 in the journal Lung Cancer, and in March 2021 in the European Journal of Cancer.
Others on the European Journal paper from Case Western Reserve included Kaustav Bera, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Pingfu Fu, from the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the School of Medicine.
Among more than a half-dozen other contributors was longtime Madabhushi collaborator Vamsidhar Velcheti, director of thoracic oncology at NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, who previously worked in Cleveland.

The Takeaway
An AI neural network built to predict protein and RNA sequence interactions cannot explain what patterns it sees. CSHL Assistant Professor Peter Koo found a way to “quiz” the network with a carefully designed set of synthetic RNA sequences to find out what it learned. The answer was a little surprising.


Artificial intelligence (AI) learning machines can be trained to solve problems and puzzles on their own instead of using rules that we made for them. But often, researchers do not know what rules the machines make for themselves. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Assistant Professor Peter Koo developed a new method that quizzes a machine-learning program to figure out what rules it learned on its own and if they are the right ones.  
Computer scientists “train” an AI machine to make predictions by presenting it with a set of data. The machine extracts a series of rules and operations—a model—based on information it encountered during its training. Koo says:
“If you learn general rules about the math instead of memorizing the equations, you know how to solve those equations. So rather than just memorizing those equations, we hope that these models are learning to solve it and now we can give it any equation and it will solve it.”
Koo developed a type of AI called a deep neural network (DNN) to look for patterns in RNA strands that increase the ability of a protein to bind to them. Koo trained his DNN, called Residual Bind (RB), with thousands of RNA sequences matched to protein binding scores, and RB became good at predicting scores for new RNA sequences. But Koo did not know whether the machine was focusing on a short sequence of RNA letters—a motif—that humans might expect, or some other secondary characteristic of the RNA strands that they might not. 
Koo and his team developed a new method, called Global Importance Analysis, to test what rules RB generated to make its predictions. He presented the trained network with a carefully designed set of synthetic RNA sequences containing different combinations of motifs and features that the scientists thought might influence RB’s assessments.  
They discovered the network considered more than just the spelling of a short motif. It factored in how the RNA strand might fold over and bind to itself, how close one motif is to another, and other features. 
Koo hopes to test some key results in a laboratory. But rather than test every prediction in that lab, Koo’s new method acts like a virtual lab. Researchers can design and test millions of different variables computationally, far more than humans could test in a real-world lab. 
“Biology is super anecdotal. You can find a sequence, you can find a pattern but you don’t know ‘Is that pattern really important?’ You have to do these interventional experiments. In this case, all my experiments are all done by just asking the neural network.”
The team published their new methods and tools in PLOS Computational Biology. Their tools are now available to everyone online.

In 2016, ProPublica reported that an artificial intelligence tool used in courtrooms across the United States to predict future crimes, the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), was biased against Black defendants. 
COMPAS takes into account factors such as previous arrests, age, and employment. Its output — risk scores for recidivism — are one of the factors judges use to determine whether defendants will face jail or prison time. Using COMPAS, Black defendants were incorrectly labeled as “high-risk” to commit a future crime twice as often as their white counterparts. Northpointe, the parent company of COMPAS, refuted ProPublica’s claims, stating that the algorithm was working as intended.
Northpointe argued that Black people have a higher baseline risk of committing future crimes after an arrest — and this results in higher risk scores for Black people as a group. Northpointe, now rebranded as Equivant, hasn’t publicly changed the way it computes risk assessments. 
To call risk assessment algorithms objective is to ignore the social systems and structures in which they are created
Computer science researchers have tried to fix racist algorithms by imposing a set of criteria they’ve dubbed “fairness.” Research on fairness — the mathematical criteria that researchers place on algorithms to ensure that outcomes aren’t based on race — has grown, with Amazon alone putting 20 million dollars into it last year. But a coherent picture of fairness in the field remains frustratingly elusive. 
The answer may lie in simply changing how we define “fairness.”
Experts in algorithmic fairness worry the current approaches to defining fairness will never result in actual fair outcomes for Black people. They warn that a purely mathematical solution focused on “accuracy” is a myopic approach to deciding what is fair. Accuracy, in the context of fairness, is a measure of how correct an algorithm’s predictions are. But an algorithm used to predict a future crime will only reinforce the logic of the carceral system, where some people are always more likely to be deemed high-risk because of how law enforcement treats race. Solving this problem means considering the outcomes of the use of an algorithm, the impact of oppression, and tackling the inherent unfairness in society at its root. 
The use of algorithms in social spaces, particularly in the prison system, is an inherently political problem, not a technological one
“[The] discourse has largely been motivated by a concern that there’s no convergence on a single notion of what would make an algorithmic system fair,” says Lily Hu, a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Harvard University who studies algorithmic fairness. Hu argues that the reason for this is because the use of algorithms in social spaces, particularly in the prison system, is an inherently political problem, not a technological one. “There are societal problems where technological solutions are great,” Hu says, “like indoor plumbing.”
“But many of the problems we’re trying to solve,” Hu continues, “aren’t problems of that kind.” 
The use of artificial intelligence algorithms in predictive policing and risk assessments is only growing despite continuous reporting that these tools often perpetuate harsher sentencing of Black defendants and harsher policing of Black communities. Risk assessments, like COMPAS, are commonly used in pretrial detention. They’re often marketed as methods to aid in criminal justice reform across jurisdictions in the United States. They are used in 46 states in the US. 
Because of their many problems, many criminal justice experts caution against the use of risk assessments in criminal justice reform. Yet to proponents, the appeal of artificial intelligence algorithms in place of a human decision-maker in assessments is clear: they allow law-makers, justices, and police officers to shift responsibility onto a seemingly more objective actor. Proponents argue that algorithms are a way of overcoming the social biases of human decision-makers, citing their increased “accuracy” (compared to humans) as an asset. They continue to be adopted in jurisdictions across the US.

To call risk assessment algorithms objective is to ignore the social systems and structures in which they are created. It is clear now that artificial intelligence algorithms can carry the biases of their mostly-white programmers. They base predictions on data, which can be incomplete or carry socially-ingrained stereotypes and prejudices. Both sources of bias can lead to bad predictions that hurt people of color. Recent, high profile examples include Facebook face-recognition algorithms mislabeling photos of Black people as gorillas, or mistakenly labeling Asian people as blinking in photos. 
In the previous cases (and within the context of social media), the solution might be to build fairer, more “accurate” algorithms, trained on more representative data. In the case of criminal justice, experts argue that even perfect algorithms — those with 100 percent accuracy — will still perpetuate systemic bias and end up hurting people of color. Inaccurate predictions lead to bias, but accurate ones reinforce existing bias.
“The underlying problem here is that we have racialized hierarchies of what crime means and who is at ‘risk’ of committing those crimes (not to mention who is at risk of being caught for those crimes), combined with a policy that punishes those at high risk with the loss of liberty,” writes Ben Green, a Professor at the University of Michigan who studies algorithmic fairness, in an email to Massive. “Even if risk assessments could attain some type of perfect prediction, that wouldn’t solve the problem. A perfect risk assessment could have the perverse effect of making this policy appear more legitimate and making those who are detained as a result appear to be more truly deserving of that punishment.”
For true “fairness” — true equality for marginalized people — the prison system must abandon the use of algorithms in risk assessments altogether.

Much of the tension (including the ProPublica-Northpointe debate) around fairness circles around the inherent incompatibility around two major mathematical definitions of fairness.  One, called calibration, supposes that what an algorithm predicts to be the actual underlying risk that someone will reoffend (50% chance of reoffending means 50% chance of rearrest, regardless of the offender’s race). Another is that the number of errors be equal for both groups. Both definitions can’t be satisfied at once. This (statistically proven) incompatibility has been dubbed the “impossibility of fairness” and has led some researchers to conclude that implementing algorithms requires inherent, unavoidable trade-offs. Others have argued that calibration is sufficient and algorithms like COMPAS, which meet the calibration criteria, are fair.
Hu argues that the impossibility of fairness is just illustrating the political and ethical nature of the problem. “The impossibility of fairness just shows in mathematical terms that we can’t have it all,” she says.
According to Green, the problem is that two common notions of fairness don’t properly tackle the unfairness imposed by social inequality. Algorithms meant to ensure that offenders remain imprisoned fail to account for the systemic reasons why more Black people may end up in jail and reoffend. Such narrow definitions aren’t promoting just outcomes — they’re perpetuating broken definitions of what justice is. 
“The fundamental problem here is not actually that there are different definitions of fairness that could be used. The problem is that our focus is incredibly narrow, considering only a single decision point. If we think about the two major fairness notions, neither really get to the heart of the matter of social hierarchy and institutionalized inequality. We need to take a broader view of the matter — and by doing so we can also realize that the impossibility of fairness doesn’t provide as intractable of a dilemma as is typically assumed,” writes Green.
According to Green, it isn’t clear that we should assume that we want algorithms to work to increase the number of offenders in jail or prison. Incarceration is in itself harmful, and has long-term negative impacts. We can think about mathematical fairness all we want, but instead, we should just abolish jails and prisons.

Interesting article! It’s also important to note that these algorithms are trained using a stand-in measure of the actual outcome - so “likelihood of being convicted of a crime” is often treated as an accurate measure of “likelihood of committing a crime” by the people developing the algorithm. I think this is mentioned in the article but it’s one of the key reasons these kind of algorithms will always be racist - they are being trained with the goal of accurately predicting the decisions of an inherently racist system.

Great article, Natalia! I think the quote from Ben Green really nails the heart of this issue: even if we could somehow make a perfectly “fair” risk assessment, it would still be created on the basis of a criminal justice system that has a built-in racialized hierarchy, and, as he says, “…a perfect risk assessment could have the perverse effect of making this policy appear more legitimate and making those who are detained as a result appear to be more truly deserving of that punishment.”

However, I’m not convinced that this argument necessitates the statement that “for true “fairness” — true equality for marginalized people — the prison system must abandon the use of algorithms in risk assessments altogether.” While we certainly can’t assume that algorithms are the perfect solution, the fact is that all risk assessments, whether done by machines or by humans, are based in a biased system. What we need is transparency in risk assessment, something that human-generated risk assessments largely do not offer. So using an algorithm (although, obviously, a much improved one) might actually provide an opportunity to increase that level of transparency in the future. Clearly the algorithms currently being used are hugely flawed and must be overhauled, but I don’t think that this means that algorithmic risk assessment in general could not ever function in a way that provides meaningful transparency and equality.

 Hi Elizabeth! Thank you! And thanks for taking the time to read the piece and comment. I agree that Ben’s quote really nailed down the issue, I would check out his recent academic papers if you’re interested! I see where you’re coming from, but I stand by my statement. Generally, I’m not a person that thinks algorithmic technologies shouldn’t be used–– I’m in favor of algorithmic technologies that improve reduce harm and promote positive interventions (see: DataSF | Keeping Moms and Babies in Nutrition Program). 
In the piece, I challenge the idea that we need risk assessments in the prison system (especially pre-trial, where I would advocate just releasing people), or even the prison system at all. I think we need to be careful and selective about how we use algorithmic technologies. I know I don’t go into this a lot in the piece, but my logic is that the prison system itself is harmful and that the way to tackle this is to abolish it (and I know this is a pretty radical position, but it’s the framework I use to think about how to use algorithmic technologies. 
A question I ask is: how does this technology reduce or perpetuate harm?). In a biased system, algorithms used to punish people will always be biased, and that’s essentially what I wanted to say in this piece. The call for more transparency is important but doesn’t get to the heart of the issue, which is the fact that risk assessments in the way they are currently part of the carceral system and no amount of improvements to them are going to fix structural inequality. Really complicated issue and I could talk about it all day so I’ll just stop here. Really great comment!

This article tackles a significant problem I’ve always had with AI. Although many people assume it avoids the problem of human judgement and bias, that just isn’t true. It is a machine/robot/technological thing instead of a person, but a person programmed it. As long as humans are behind the programming, this will continue to be a problem. Until people can look beyond race and judge fairly themselves, AI won’t be able to either.

Even though AI continues to thrive and grow, there remain challenges to use the technology. Just some include finding data scientists, determining the right problems to focus on, getting quality data and scaling the models.


No doubt, these problems are even worse for non-tech companies. They generally do not have the expertise or sufficient resources to make AI a success.

“Research shows non-tech companies in particular have struggled to take their AI programs beyond the proof of concept and pilot phases–with just 21% of retail, 17% of automotive, 6% of manufacturing, and 3% of energy companies successfully scaling their AI use cases,” said Jerry Kurtz, who is the Executive Vice President of Insights and Data at Capgemini North America.

But despite all this, there are still a myriad of companies that are beating the odds. And they are becoming much more competitive. “There are many opportunities for non-tech companies to leverage AI to improve efficiency and provide a better customer and employee experience,” said Margaret Lee, who is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Digital Service Operations Management at BMC.

PROMOTED
So what are some of the non-tech companies that have been able to move-the-needle with their AI efforts? Here’s a look at two and the lessons learned.
John Deere: Keep in mind that the company has a long history of innovation, going back to the invention of the steel plow in 1837. The result is that John Deere is a world leader, with a market capitalization of $120 billion and annual sales of over $35 billion.   
The company’s AI efforts began with machine vision because of its advantages with GPS connectivity in its equipment and rich datasets. For example, during the spring, the peak data ingestion was 425MB per second or about 50 million sensor measurements per second.

“Our projects have resulted in products in the market, or soon to be in the market, that reduce chemical inputs but sensing weeds from non-weeds and selectively apply chemical to the weeds only,” said Jahmy Hindman, who is the Chief Technology Officer of John Deere. “In addition, this work has led to vision-based automated control systems in combine harvesters that optimize the processing settings of the ‘factories on wheels’ to minimize the grain lost during harvest.”

A key lesson for the company has been the importance of keeping customer needs and wants in mind. “We work tirelessly to help our customers advance their business and feed the world,” said Hindman.

Levi Strauss: An early project for this company came in response to the Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe. Levi Stratus looked for ways to manage the inventory pile-up. To this end, the company gathered unique datasets on dynamic price elasticities and then applied AI to it. 
It was a small project but was able to scale quickly. What started as a test in 11 stores in Germany in May 2020 grew to 17 countries in Europe by October.  The system was also used for the 11/11 Singles’ Day in China. 
“I have three pieces of advice from this experience,” said Louis DiCesari, who is the Global Head of Data, analytics, and AI at Levi Strauss. “First, choose real, commercial problems that are aligned to your company’s strategic priorities, and chunk them into actionable steps. Second, don’t get too hung up on having perfect data or technology, or using the latest algorithms. Instead, embrace agile, deliver minimum viable products, continuously measure the impact, and continue to iterate and add new features. And, of course, set a vision, communicate the progress toward that vision throughout the organization, and invite feedback.”
DiCesari attributes AI to the company’s ability to accelerate innovation and move faster than ever before. “In 2021, we aim to deliver more value and support all countries and functions of the enterprise, infuse data and AI throughout the business, enable new ways of working and continue streamlining processes, while also digitizing assets,” he said.

As the pandemic further accelerates our digital transformation, companies are relying even more on automation and particularly on artificial intelligence. Two-thirds of CEOs surveyed last year by a major consulting firm said they will use AI even more than before for the creation of new workforce models. Even higher numbers plan to digitize operations, customer interactions, business models, and revenue streams. This huge acceleration and shift will surely bring massive failures, leaving companies — and in some cases even critical infrastructure — vulnerable to loss as critical decision-making is handed off to AI.
As a technologist who has built platforms and worked in the major industries that employ AI often (such as FinTech and health care), I have seen first-hand what goes wrong when some of the world’s biggest companies leave their intelligence to their AI. Based on the hype around AI, it would appear that everything can be improved by sophisticated algorithms sifting through masses of data. From streamlining customer care to inventing new perfumes, and even coaching soccer teams, AI looks like an unstoppable purveyor of competitive advantage, and practically all that company executives have to do is let it loose and go have lunch (cooked by an AI Robot Chef) while they watch their company’s profits climb.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Sadly, what we see in execution is a different world altogether — from mismanaged expectations to extremely expensive failures and mistakes. All too often AI is not the shining light to a bright company future but rather the blind leading the blind down the wrong path, until someone falls off a cliff. Many of those most responsible for hype in the world of artificial intelligence have never written a line of code, let alone deployed AI in production. Even few developers have the incentive to give you a dose of reality. I am happy to share some of the practical failures of AI, based on my own experience, and provide some insight into what decision makers need to be aware of.
Here are some of the worst ways to use AI, as demonstrated by hedge funds, Wall Street investment banks and companies from Fortune 100 enterprises down to startups:
1. Making decisions based on the wrong data
AI is great at finding patterns in huge datasets and is efficient at predicting outcomes based on those patterns and finding uncorrelated alpha (hidden patterns in the dataset). But big problems arise when the wrong data (or outlier information) gets pulled into the dataset. In one famous example in the late 2000s there was a military coup in Thailand, and the algorithm behind a major fund interpreted that military coup as a market event, shorting a lot of Asian equities, quickly losing nine figures in dollar value.
I worked with a small hedge fund focused on the TMT sector (technology, media, telecommunications). The founders came from a large financial firm and brought with them some programmers who had worked on trading systems for REITS and the energy sector. Their goal was to build an analytics engine that the traders in this new TMT-focused hedge fund could use for signaling certain key events. The problem was that their developers had copied and merged two engines that were built for REITS and energy trading and tried to fit technical indicators more relevant to the TMT sector into this hybrid. I was called in to do forensics after it was built because the engine was giving sporadic and inconsistent results, and it took us some time to realize that, although the founders thought their team had built a brand new engine designed specifically for TMT, it was really built from spare parts. Although all three sectors share similar technical indicators, like implied volatility, or 52-week moving average, AI is sensitive and detailed work and each engine should be customized.
Make sure your AI is making recommendations based on relevant data.
2. Failing to train your AI properly
You can feed your AI engine all the right data and have it spit back the right answers, but until it gets tested in the wild you don’t know what it will do. Rushing to give it more responsibility than it is ready for is like sending a small child out into the real world — neither one is going to bring good results.advertisement
A hedge fund client was interested in AI for quant trading. They had hired an external team to build a proof-of-concept model of an AI engine, and my team later provided consulting services on that POC. To build a good AI engine to generate alpha (meaning, to increase the measure of ROI on investment), you would need to have a large dataset of historical data that is homogeneous. In finance, datasets are structured in a time series format, offering data points with widely different levels of granularity. Generally, the more data points we have in a dataset, the better the engine will be at detecting future results; those data points will help a well-designed engine discover non-linear correlation of data to help in predictions. We advised the client to give the AI engine more time to process their dataset to make it more homogeneous and to not follow mainstream pricing signals. Sadly, they didn’t, and the POC was overfitting and so finely tuned to the specific dataset that it didn’t work with new, unseen data. In other words, it was useless with live market data.
Give your AI time to process and learn new information.
3. Ignoring the human responsibility for decisions
No matter what you program your AI to do, it will not share your human goals or bear their consequences. Thus we’ve seen early examples of AI leading early GPS users into a river, or deleting critical information to “minimize” differences in a dataset.advertisement
I’ve seen more than one startup built on the assumption that AI algorithms can learn credit approval models and replace the credit approval officer in granting/denying credit loans. However, when you are denied a credit loan, federal law requires a lender to tell you why they made that decision. Software doesn’t really make decisions (it just identifies patterns) and isn’t responsible for decisions; humans are. Since federal law agrees that humans are responsible for credit decisions, many of these startups burned through venture capital funds and then could not legally launch to customers because the AI they developed was inherently biased. When it denied loans, no human could adequately explain why the denial occurred.
Make sure to keep people responsible for human consequences.
4. Overvaluing data
Some data simply can’t be used to build anything useful. One of our clients that failed at using AI was a popular medical diagnosis platform with its own data lake and a broad array of datasets. The company that owned it had acquired another platform with its own array of siloed datasets. The executives wanted to glean some insight into the jumble of disconnected datasets and needed help with onboarding potential customers. The problem was that these datasets were describing different medical issues/profiles, and trying to find common denominators of any real value was not possible. Despite all the compiled information, working with this client’s data was like having lego pieces that didn’t actually connect. Just because they are alike in many respects does not mean that you can build a castle out of them. After consulting with the client, we recommended they not do the project.
A real estate developer wanted us to design AI for build-decision insights, the notion being that if we could ingest enough data from real estate listings, we could perform analytics that would inform their decisions about the layout of their new developments. The client hoped the AI insights would tell them what would be the most optimal layout, based on the location of the building. For example, should the building have one large apartment per floor, or divide the floor into three one-bedroom apartments? Should it be a mixed-use building with commercial stores at the bottom and residential rentals? After we ingested real-estate listings data from different states, worked on dataset analysis, and interacted with subject matter experts, it became obvious that because the real estate market is highly localized, a one-size-fits-all algorithm would not work. The real estate of Midtown Manhattan East is slightly different from Midtown West, and Brooklyn is different from Queens, let alone New York state as an entire dataset. The many datasets were too small independently to build a meaningful classification algorithm, and the project didn’t go through.
In these cases, the companies cut their losses, but many others just keep throwing money at AI, digging deeper into details that never connect to their goals.
Before building an AI engine, make sure you have the right parts.
Where do we go from here?
AI may be the future of this accelerated digital business world, but for now too much of it is still a world of hype. Enterprises should consider AI, but with a grounded view and proper understanding of what it really does. And they should develop a proper perspective for any related initiatives. Decision makers need to understand the reality of AI, the potential it brings, and challenges behind it. Have a clear strategy of any potential AI project, taking into account the data available, timelines, costs, and expectations. Usually, successful AI projects provide long-term results rather than immediate benefits.
AI, at its core, is simply inference; it can help analyze tremendous detail, but only humans can understand the big picture.  We understand that as humans our decisions have consequences (business, legal, ethical), and giving AI false human traits covers up the fact that it does not think like we do. Humans may make more “mistakes” than AI, but we also have more power to recognize them. So, consider “artificial intelligence,” but when you’re thinking about how to deploy it, make sure that your own intelligence is still leading the way.

Hofstadter’s book Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid was published. It became a very popular and influential work.Hofstadter’s main subjects in that book (at least as I read it) are Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, self-reference and “strange loops”. He also tied these subjects to artificial intelligence (AI) and the nature of computers.Just to get one thing straight out of the way to begin with.Neither this piece nor Hofstadter’s book have much — or indeed anything — to do with the debate about IQ (i.e., intelligence quotient) and how it’s related to human groups and individuals. (This has become such a politicised issue — on all sides — that it’s hardly worth contributing to.)Predictably, the question “What is intelligence?” is raised (if often obliquely) in Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid. Thus Hofstadter offered his readers eight “essential abilities for intelligence”. So what immediately follows are some biographical details and quotes from Hofstadter which may help put this piece in some kind of perspective.Hofstadter once said that “a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology”. Indeed his work “has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence”. Yet Hofstadter himself has also (rhetorically?) said that he has “no interest in computers”.Hofstadter has also advanced various sceptical positions on AI. For example, when Garry Kasparov was defeated by Deep Blue, Hofstadter wrote:“It was a watershed event, but it doesn’t have to do with computers becoming intelligent.”Yet despite all that, Hofstadter did once write (in his collection of articles Metamagical Themas) that“in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?”Indeed Hofstadter went so far as to organise a symposium (at Stanford University and in April 2000) called ‘Spiritual Robots’.Big Data JobsEight Essential Abilities for Intelligence?The following piece is not a set of arguments which attempts to state that computers are identical to humans when it comes to all aspects of intelligence. Instead, it’s simply an attempt to challenge what are seen — by many — to be absolute and (as it were) eternal differences between computers and human beings when it comes to intelligence.It’s worth saying here that some of my responses to each of Hofstadter’s eight “essential abilities for intelligence” may get a little repetitive. That’s mainly because what can be said about one such ability — in relation to artificial intelligence or computers — can be said about (some of) the others too.In any case, much depends on how one takes these abilities. And, as we shall see, it certainly depends on how the words (or concepts) contained in the sentences which express them are interpreted.It’s also worth noting that Hofstadter’s eight essential abilities for intelligence have been extensively quoted over the years (though little discussed) in the literature on AI and other related matters. (See the pages of quotes — on Google Search — here.)The following is the relevant extract from Hofstadter’s book (to which I’ve added numbers):“No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies, in fact, to suggest that a sharp border exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:(1) to respond to situations very flexibly;(2) to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;(3) to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;(4) to recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situation;(5) to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;(6) to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;(7) to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;(8) to come up with ideas which are novel.”It can be seen in the above that Hofstadter uses the words “intelligent behavior”, not the more abstract and general word “intelligence”. This suggests that he believed that if any x is capable of behaving — or acting — intelligently, then it is intelligent. Thus this position works against the idea that intelligence is some kind of entity in the mind or brain that effectively works as a kind of all-purpose and private mental “organ”. Behaviourists (from Gilbert Ryle and before) have, of course, argued against this conception of intelligence — and for many good reasons.I shall now tackle each essential ability for intelligence one by one.Trending AI Articles:1.

Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than Kaggle(1) To respond to situations very flexiblyThe problem here is that not all adult human beings “respond to situations very flexibly”. Some human beings are very inflexible and they are so in many different ways. So reacting very flexibly can’t be entirely definitive of what it is to be a human being. Of course many humans do respond to situations very flexibly — yet the point still stands.And neither can it be said that all computers (or all computer programmes) don’t respond very flexibly. In many contexts, they do. Think of an Internet search in which your wording (either for a question or for something else) is very ungrammatical or includes misspellings. Despite all that, the search picks up on these things and still provides a good answer. Of course sceptics may question this and say that it’s not a good example of responding to a situation very flexibly. But why isn’t it a good example — at least within this limited context? That said, one can also cite the well-known case of computerised robots and their not being able to navigate very well around new environments (but see here). But this is also true of some adult human beings and all young children. (Incidentally, many other animal species are better navigators than most humans.)Of course all this will partly depend on what “very flexibly” means because, as with all Hofstadter’s examples, this phrase is — to some extent at least — vague. Indeed Hofstadter probably wouldn’t have denied this problem of vagueness when it comes to these abilities for intelligence.(2) To take advantage of fortuitous circumstancesThis is even vaguer — or simply broader — than (1) above.The obvious thing which will be argued here is that computers won’t know anything about specific “fortuitous circumstances”… unless they’ve been programmed to know about them. Of course if they’ve been programmed to know about specific fortuitous circumstances, then they won’t actually be fortuitous circumstances to that computer. The problem here is that human beings also need to be programmed (or educated) enough in order to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances. And, as with all the other abilities cited by Hofstadter, some human beings are not very good at taking advantage of fortuitous circumstances. Still, compared to most computers (or computerised robots) and in most situations, humans are good at this.Yet all that hints at a central problem.This particular distinction between humans and computers isn’t absolute. Indeed there’s no categorical reason why computers can’t be programmed to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances.Again, this is not an argument which states that computers are identical to humans when it comes to all aspects of intelligence. Instead, it’s simply to challenge what are seen — by many — to be absolute and eternal differences.(3) To make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messagesSome human beings are often not very good at making sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages. Indeed some adult humans are no good at this in any circumstances. Of course many other human beings are good at this. Yet because not all human beings are good at this, then this can’t be seen as a clear cut and definitive dividing line between human beings and computers. In other words, in order to make clear cut and definitive distinctions between human beings and computers one mustn’t rely on the best human beings and the worst computers to do so. (This is what the physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose does when he highlights the ability of higher-level mathematicians to “see” Gödelian “truths”.)It’s hard to reason as to why computers can’t— at least in principle — be suitably programmed to make sense of ambiguous or contradictory messages. Sure, it would need a lot of detailed and fine-tuned programming; though human beings also need a lot of detailed and fine-tuned programming to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages.(4) To recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situationIf anything, a computer could be better at recognising the relative importance of different elements of a situation than many human beings. (A point which also applies to some of the other abilities cited by Hofstadter.) This would of course depend on the “situation” and its “different elements”. In addition, we’d need to know how exactly humans recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situation and if it would be possible — or impossible - to replicate this cognitive ability in computers. As it is, this ability — as expressed by Hofstadter — is almost too vague to comment upon.(5) To find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate themAs already stated, some of these responses may be getting a little repetitive. This is because what can be said about one ability for intelligence — in relation to computers — can be said about others too. Thus the main response to (5) can also be found in (6) below.A computer could be better at finding similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them than most — or even all — human beings. That primarily because a computer may have easy access to a huge amount of data. Of course human beings also have easy access to a huge amount of data (in memory, by reading books, etc.) too. A computer may, of course, find many irrelevant or useless similarities between situations — which are otherwise different — without “knowing” that they are in fact irrelevant or useless… yet the same is true of some human beings in some circumstances. So it must now be said that computer programmers have spent much time “training” computers to ignore irrelevant or useless information and therefore irrelevant or useless similarities or differences. (See Daniel Dennett’s ‘Cognitive wheels: the frame problem of AI’.)(6) To draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link themThe ability to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them too is hard to grasp because it’s a fairly vague ability. And again it must be said that a computer could be very good at this. After all, some computers have very-easy access to a vast amount of data which they can quickly sort out. Admittedly, a large data pool may not be helpful here if the computer hasn’t got the ability to “draw distinctions” in the first place. However, that’s unless a computer — or its programme — contains something that enables it to draw distinctions. And then we’d need to know how that can — or could — be done.As it is, computers (or programmes) do often make the mistake of linking things which are really dissimilar (as in Internet searches based on word connections); rather than of drawing distinctions between things which are otherwise similar. But, here again, many adult human beings do this too. After all, don’t psychologists tell that adult human beings tend to automatically use (or employ) “stereotypes” and “generalisations” in which clear distinctions are ignored and vague similarities are emphasised?(7) To synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new waysIt can be intuitively accepted that this ability does seem to go beyond what computers will be capable of… at least at the present time. It does seem like a problem to get a computer to take “old concepts” and put them “together in new ways”. This would require a lot of semantic nous and contextual skill.Yet all this depends.It depends on which kind of concepts are being discussed. It may even depend on what’s meant by the word “concept”. Computers can certainly — and with ease — shuffle numbers and equations around. They can even answer questions that haven’t been asked before — and surely that would require putting old concepts together in new ways.(8) To come up with ideas which are novelFirstly we’d also need to establish what an “idea” is. Computers can, after all, establish their own theorems (although a distinction has to be made between proving theorems and creating them — see here), design better routes from A to B, connect given sets of data to other data, respond to human questions which themselves express ideas (say, in Internet searches, etc.) and so on.In any case, surely it would be very easy for a computer to come up with ideas which are novel. What’s important is whether those novel ideas would also be interesting, informative, useful and relevant. In other words, novelty in itself can be a very shallow phenomenon. That said, even if it is a shallow phenomenon, it may still be something that computers are very bad at. As it is, it’s hard to say if computers are bad at creating novel ideas because the notion is fairly vague and/or broad. I suppose we can say — and few AI aficionados would at present deny it — that no computer could come up with a novel theory for a new form of political government or a solution to the mind-body problem. That said, most humans couldn’t do these things either. In addition, it isn’t — in principle — impossible that a computers could do these things.Finally, no one is claiming that any computer can do these kinds of thing today. The claim is that it is possible — and even very likely — that some of these things will be done in the future by computers or by other examples of AI.[I can be found on Twitter here.]Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",Douglas Hofstadter’s Eight Abilities for Intelligence: Humans vs. Artificial Intelligence,https://becominghuman.ai/douglas-hofstadters-eight-abilities-for-intelligence-humans-vs-artificial-intelligence-b6953af1ace4,https://becominghuman.ai/douglas-hofstadters-eight-abilities-for-intelligence-humans-vs-artificial-intelligence-b6953af1ace4,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*ts0UWY_uYx227R3y-B-wOQ.png'],,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Paul Austin Murphy', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@paulaustinmurphy2000'}",['Paul Austin Murphy'],"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",2021-05-13T14:10:14.190Z,2021-05-13T14:10:14.190Z,2023-05-03T06:21:32.449Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,b6953af1ace4,,

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) has warned artificial intelligence tools could also be used to track the amount of time spent on social media.Advertisement
In a submission to the Department of Employment on the introduction of the right to request remote working, the ICTU urged the Government to develop clear guidance on how employers can monitor employees working remotely.
In the submission, ICTU social policy officer Dr Laura Bambrick warned working from homes or hubs could involve technology that can count keystrokes and emails, or even use photographic records taken via webcam.
“Trust is crucial for remote working arrangement to be effective,” the ICTU said.
Necessary monitoring
AdvertisementDr Bambrick said employers, remote workers and office-based colleagues needed to trust that work will be completed in a timely manner and that productivity will not suffer due to remote working.Advertisement
An employer is already permitted to monitor activities within limits, she said, such as monitoring the use of the company’s phone and email.
“However, all monitoring must be necessary, legitimate and proportionate to workers’ right to privacy,” the ICTU said.
“An employer’s ICT policy must clearly make workers aware of any monitoring and must set out why monitoring may take place, the nature of the monitoring, how information will be used, and who will have access to it.
“Covert surveillance is only permitted in exteme cases, such as if there are grounds to suspect criminal activity or serious malpractice, and only for a limited period.”Advertisement
AI-driven technology used to monitor employee activity while working from home can count the number of mouse clicks, keystrokes, emails in an hour
The ICTU said it was concerned by “the general trend” towards the use of AI-powered technologies by employers, for purposes including candidate selection, performance evaluation and redundancy decisions.
“AI-driven technology used to monitor employee activity while working from home can count the number of mouse clicks, keystrokes, emails in an hour, record time spent on social media sites, and take photographic ‘timecards’ every 10 minutes via a webcam,” it said.
“In the EU draft regulations on the use of AI applications, published last week, AI systems used in employment, worker management, and access to platform work were classed as high-risk.”
Dr Bambrick said for many workers, flexible and remote working was not just an optional “nice to have” perk of the job, but vital to be able to enter or remain in employment.
“Congress, therefore, recommends the legislation requires employers to publish flexible and remote working options in job adverts and gives the new postholder the right to take up the advertised flexibility from day one,” the ICTU said.

BMW Uses Artificial Intelligence to Create Its Newest Art Car Series
Published: May 15, 2021  | By: American Luxury StaffBMW’s reveal of its newest Art Car series entry is perhaps best accompanied by a thought-provoking presentation by the automaker that looks at AI-powered design.The new BMW design halos came about by designer-AI partnership, and to foreground the introduction of the car by recapping news about AI forays into art and the ‘generational design’ pieces that come about through artistic or artisanal manipulation of algorithmic learning is useful. The process has come to be called ‘co-creativity,’ and it illuminates the role of AI in artistic creation and industrial and architectural design.BMW titles the 8-series lineup — there are three this time around instead of one — under the heading of The Ultimate AI Masterpiece. BMW used California-based tech company Nvidia’s AI-driven ‘StyleGAN’ software to pack 50,000 artworks representing nearly a millennium of human history and 50 contemporary works into the mix. Gary Yeh — who founded appreciation organization ArtDrunk — and creative tech-friendly designer Nathan Shipley helped guide the project.COVID-19 isolation provided the time and space to conceptualize the project, work it through and bring the gran tourers to the stage. It appears that at least seven distinct finished 8-Series Art Cars were completed for this latest round. Each design given the green light is an amalgam, and in some cases oddly cohesive.Will AI-generated work ever be considered art? The well-publicized 2018 sale of an AI algorithm-created portrait netted almost $450K, but the jury’s out when it comes to calling it a work of art.But ‘co-creativity’ is only just beginning.

The hidden work created by artificial intelligence programs

Why It Matters		



As AI programs become more prevalent, researchers say that companies need to prioritize behind-the scenes workers and those affected by the programs.

Artificial intelligence is often framed in terms of headline-grabbing technology and dazzling promise. But some of the workers who enable these programs — the people who do things like code data, flag pictures, or work to integrate the programs into the workplace — are often overlooked or undervalued.
“This is a common pattern in the social studies of technology,” said Madeleine Clare Elish, SM ’10, a senior research scientist at Google. “A focus on new technology, the latest innovation, comes at the expense of the humans who are working to actually allow that innovation to function in the real world.""
Speaking at the recent EmTech Digital conference hosted by MIT Technology Review, Elish and other researchers said artificial intelligence programs often fail to account for the humans who incorporate AI systems into existing workflow, workers doing behind-the-scenes labor to make the programs run, and the people who are negatively affected by AI outcomes.
“This is a challenge for ethical AI, because overlooking the role of humans misses what’s actually going on,” Elish said.  
Here are their insights about making AI systems more effective and more ethical.
Consider how AI will be integrated into a workplace
In her previous job leading the AI on the Ground initiative at Data & Society, Elish and Elizabeth Anne Watkins, SM ’12, studied an initiative by Duke University and Duke Health System called Sepsis Watch. This is a clinical decision support system that uses AI to predict a patient’s risk of sepsis, a leading cause of death in hospitals that is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat quickly.

The program has dramatically improved the cases of patients with sepsis, Elish said, but for workers in the hospital, Sepsis Watch was disruptive. It changed the way rapid response nurses and doctors typically communicate, and nurses had to figure out the best ways to relay risk scores to doctors. Nurses also had to fit the Sepsis Watch information into existing emergency department practices.
“This hadn’t even crossed the minds of the tech development team, but this strategy proved essential,” Elish said. “We saw skilled individuals performing essential but overlooked and undervalued work.”
The nurses ended up doing what Elish and her fellow researchers call repair work — the work required to make a technology actually effective in a specific context, and to weave that technology into existing work practices, power dynamics, and cultural contexts.
The way many people focus on the technology and development of AI programs leaves out people doing on-the-ground innovation to make them work.
“So much of the actual day-to-day work that is required to make AI function in the world is rendered invisible, and then undervalued,” Elish said.
Even the language used to talk about launching AI systems tends to discount the importance of this work, Elish said.
“I actually try to avoid talking about ‘deploying systems’,” she said. “Deploy is a military term. It connotes a kind of contextless dropping in. And what we actually need to do with systems is to integrate them into particular context. And when you use words like ‘integrate,’ it requires you to say, ‘Integrate into what, or with whom?’”
In the case of Sepsis Watch, people respected the autonomy of the nurses, and they were allowed the discretion and flexibility to improvise and create ways to communicate about sepsis risk scores, Elish said. Those creating AI systems need to allocate resources toward supporting the people who will be doing this type of repair work, and making sure they are part of the project from beginning to end.
“An AI solution, in theory, doesn’t actually get us very far,” Elish said. “Responsible implementation, effective implementation, comes from focusing on how individuals will be empowered to use the solution in a particular context.”

Don’t forget about ‘ghost workers’ behind the scenes 
Repair work to integrate AI into the workplace isn’t the only unseen labor. AI has created millions of new jobs, including for human workers who do things like labeling images so a machine learning model can learn, said Saiph Savage, director of the Civic Innovation Lab at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Other human tasks might include transcribing audio, which helps voice assistants understand the world, or flagging violent content or disinformation on social media platforms.
The workers operating behind the scenes, often called ghost workers or invisible workers, are usually hidden to the end user, Savage said. Her research shows that these workers often earn below minimum wage and have limited opportunities for career growth and development.
Taking workers into account requires understanding systemic challenges they face, and what values they have. Savage said there are several ways AI programs can be used to help ghost workers, including some tools she’s created:
AI programs that can detect when an employer is being unfair to a worker, perhaps through things like negative feedback, and then nudge the employer to reconsider. AI programs can also be used to guide workers to achieve different goals.
Studying workers who have been able to grow and thrive, and building programs based on their strategies. “I computationally find those workers and I organize them to share tips and strategies for other workers, so that those other workers can follow [these] strategies and also increase their wages,” Savage said. She has developed web plug-ins that allow workers to share advice.
Auditing tools to understand the conditions workers are exposed to — things like hourly wages and invisible labor.
“We really need to think about the risks that we are exposing workers to,” Savage said. “For instance, the amount of invisible labor that we're forcing workers to do.”
Ask who’s not at the table, and whom AI might harm 
Abeba Birhane, a PhD candidate in cognitive science at University College Dublin, questioned the assumption that AI is a universally good thing that can solve any problem. AI and algorithmic systems “carry actual, tangible consequences to real people, whether it’s in policing or in the health care system,” she said.
A recurring theme across AI tools is that “individuals in communities that are at the margins of society, people who are the most vulnerable, are always the ones who pay the highest price,” Birhane said.
Things like facial recognition systems, health care algorithms, and privacy violations tend to disproportionately affect and disadvantage Black and transgender people, immigrants, and LGBTQ children.

Machine learning, explained 


“If we ask who benefits, we find that people who are creating and deploying these systems benefit, while the cost falls heavily on the marginalized,” she said.
People creating artificial intelligence systems tend to be from privileged backgrounds she said, and are often ill-equipped to understand potential problems and provide solutions. (For example, AI programs used to look for welfare fraud have had inaccurate and disastrous results for some welfare recipients.)
Even conferences like EmTech, she pointed out, are aimed toward company presidents, CEOs, and directors.
“The idea of including or thinking of the end user, or those impacted as the stakeholders, seems a bit of a radical stance,” Birhane said, but those developing AI should consider talking to people in communities where the technology is going to be used.
To be ethical, AI should benefit the most marginalized and the most impacted, Birhane said. This starts with recognizing unjust structural and social power dynamics and hierarchies that benefit some and marginalize others, and thinking of ethics and fairness as concrete and urgent matters.
Companies should also think of ethics as an integral part of the process, from ideation to deployment, rather than an add-on.
“It's an ecology, it's a culture, it's a habit, it's a safe and supportive environment that is not hostile to critique, but that actively seeks critique,” Birhane said.

Physicists are increasingly developing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to advance our understanding of the physical world but there is a rising concern about the bias in such systems and their wider impact on society at large. Julianna Photopoulos explores the issues of racial and gender bias in AI – and what physicists can do to recognize and tackle the problem







Built-in bias

on the already marginalized. (Courtesy: iStock/imaginima)

In 2011, during her undergraduate degree at Georgia Institute of Technology, Ghanaian-US computer scientist Joy Buolamwini discovered that getting a robot to play a simple game of peek-a-boo with her was impossible – the machine was incapable of seeing her dark-skinned face. Later, in 2015, as a Master’s student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab working on a science–art project called Aspire Mirror, she had a similar issue with facial analysis software: it detected her face only when she wore a white mask. Was this a coincidence?
Buolamwini’s curiosity led her to run one of her profile images across four facial recognition demos, which, she discovered, either couldn’t identify a face at all or misgendered her – a bias that she refers to as the “coded gaze”. She then decided to test 1270 faces of politicians from three African and three European countries, with different features, skin tones and gender, which became her Master’s thesis project “Gender Shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification” (figure 1). Buolamwini uncovered that three commercially available facial-recognition technologies made by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii misidentified darker female faces nearly 35% of the time, while they worked almost perfectly (99%) on white men (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 81 77).
Machines are often assumed to make smarter, better and more objective decisions, but this algorithmic bias is one of many examples that dispels the notion of machine neutrality and replicates existing inequalities in society. From Black individuals being mislabelled as gorillas or a Google search for “Black girls” or “Latina girls” leading to adult content to medical devices working poorly for people with darker skin, it is evident that algorithms can be inherently discriminatory (see box below).
“Computers are programmed by people who – even with good intentions – are still biased and discriminate within this unequal social world, in which there is racism and sexism,” says Joy Lisi Rankin, research lead for the Gender, Race and Power in AI programme at the AI Now Institute at New York University, whose books include A People’s History of Computing in the United States (2018 Harvard University Press). “They only reflect and amplify the larger biases of the world.”
Our main goal is to develop tools and algorithms to help physics, but unfortunately, we don’t anticipate how these can also be deployed in society to further oppress marginalized individuals
Jessica Esquivel
Physicists are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in a variety of fields, ranging from medical physics to materials. While they may believe their research will only be applied in physics, their findings can also be translated to society. “As particle physicists, our main goal is to develop tools and algorithms to help us find physics beyond the Standard Model, but unfortunately, we don’t step back and anticipate how these can also be deployed in technology and used every day within society to further oppress marginalized individuals,” says Jessica Esquivel, a physicist and data analyst from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Chicago, Illinois, who is working on developing AI algorithms to enhance beam storage and optimization in the Muon g-2 experiment.
What’s more, the lack of diversity that exists in physics affects both the work carried out and the systems that are being created. “The huge gender and race imbalance problem is definitely a hindrance to rectifying some of these broader issues of bias in AI,” says Savannah Thais, a particle-physics and machine-learning researcher at Princeton University in New Jersey. That’s why physicists need to be aware of their existing biases and more importantly, as a community, need to be asking what exactly they should be doing.
1 Accuracy across the spectrum Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru, Deborah Raji and colleagues work on the Gender Shades project to evaluate the accuracy of AI gender-classification products. The study looked at three companies’ commercial products and how they classified 1270 images of subjects from African and European countries. Subjects were grouped by gender, skin type, and the intersection of gender and skin type. The study found that while the products appear to have relatively high accuracy overall, there are notable differences in the error rates between different groups. All the companies performed better on male than female faces; and on lighter subjects than those with darker skin colour. The worst recognition was on darker females, failing on over 1 in 3 women of colour. A key factor in the accuracy differences is the lack of diversity in training images and benchmark data sets. (Courtesy: Joy Buolamwini)
‘Intelligent being’ beginnings
The idea that machines could become intelligent beings has existed for centuries, with myths about robots in ancient Greece and automatons in numerous civilizations. But it wasn’t until after the Second World War that scientists, mathematicians and philosophers began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial mind. In 1950 the British mathematician Alan Turing famously asked whether machines could think and proposed the Turing Test for measuring their intelligence. Six years later, the research field of AI was formally founded during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in Hanover, New Hampshire. Based on the notion that human thought processes could be defined and replicated in a computer program, the term “artificial intelligence” was coined by US mathematician John McCarthy – replacing the previously used “automata studies”.
Although the groundwork for AI and machine learning was laid down in the 1950s and 1960s, it took a while for the field to really take off. “It’s only in the past 10 years that there has been the combination of vast computing power, labelled data and wealth in tech companies to make artificial intelligence on a massive scale feasible,” says Rankin. And although Black and Latinx women in the US were discussing issues of discrimination and inequity in computing as far back as the 1970s, as highlighted by the 1983 Barriers to Equality in Academia: Women in Computer Science at MIT report, the problems of bias in computing systems have only become more widely discussed over the last decade.
Turning tides In the early days of computing, it was low-paid work largely performed by women. As the field became more prestigious, it was increasingly dominated by white men.

The bias is all the more surprising given that women in fact formed the heart of the computing industry in the UK and the US from 1940s to the 1960s. “Computers used to be people, not machines,” says Rankin. “And many of those computers were women.” But as they were pushed out and replaced by white men, the field changed, as Rankin puts it, “from something that was more feminine and less valued to something that became prestigious, and therefore, also more masculine”. Indeed, in the mid-1980s nearly 40% of all those who graduated with a degree in computer science in the US were women, but that proportion had fallen to barely 15% by 2010.
Computer science, like physics, has one of the largest gender gaps in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (PLOS Biol. 16 e2004956). Despite increases in the number of women earning physics degrees, the proportion of women is about 20% across all degree levels in the US. Black representation in physics is even lower, with barely 3% of physics undergraduate degrees in the US being awarded to Black students in 2017. There is a similar problem in the UK, where women made up 57.5% of all undergraduate students in 2018, but only 1.7% of all physics undergraduate students were Black women.
This under-representation has serious consequences for how research is built, conducted and implemented. There is a harmful feedback loop between the lack of diversity in the communities building algorithmic technologies and the ways these technologies can harm women, people of colour, people with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community, says Rankin. One example is Amazon’s experimental hiring algorithms, which – based as they were on their past hiring practices and applicant data – preferentially rejected women’s job applications. Amazon eventually abandoned the tool because gender bias was embedded too deeply in their system from past hiring practices and could not ensure fairness.
Many of these issues were tackled in Discriminating Systems – a major report from the AI Now Institute in 2019, which demonstrated that diversity and AI bias issues should not be considered separately because “they are two sides of the same problem”. Rankin adds that harassment within the workplace is also tied to discrimination and bias, noting that it has been reported by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that over 50% of female faculty and staff in scientific fields have experienced some form of harassment.
Having diverse voices in physics is essential for a number of reasons, according to Thais, who is currently developing accelerated ML-based reconstruction algorithms for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider at CERN. “A large portion of physics researchers do not have direct lived experience with people of other races, genders and communities, which are impacted by these algorithms,” she says. That’s why marginalized individual scientists need to be involved in developing algorithms to ensure they are not inundated with bias, argues Esquivel.
It’s a message echoed by Pratyusha Kalluri, an AI researcher from Stanford University in the US, who co-created the Radical AI Network, which advocates anti-oppressive technologies, and gives a voice to those marginalized by AI. “It is time to put marginalized and impacted communities at the centre of AI research – their needs, knowledge and dreams should guide development,” she wrote last year in Nature (583 169).

Role of physicists
Back at Fermilab, Brian Nord is a cosmologist using AI to search for clues about the origins and evolution of the universe. “Telescopes scan the sky in multi-year surveys to collect very large amounts of complex data, including images, and I analyse that data using AI in pursuit of understanding dark energy which is causing space–time expansion to accelerate,” he explains. 
But in 2016 he realized that AI could be harmful and biased against Black people, after reading an investigation by ProPublica that analysed a risk-assessment software known as COMPAS, which is used in US courts to predict which criminals are most likely to reoffend and make decisions about bail setting. The investigation found that Black people were almost twice as likely as whites to be labelled a higher risk; irrespective of the severity of the crime committed, or the actual likelihood of re-offending. “I’m very concerned about my complicity in developing algorithms that could lead to applications where they’re used against me,” says Nord, who is Black and knows that facial-recognition technology, for example, is biased against him, often misidentifies Black men, and is under-regulated. So while physicists may have developed a certain AI technology to tackle purely scientific problems, its application in the real world is beyond their control and may be used for insidious purposes. “It’s more likely to lead to an infringement on my rights, to my disenfranchisement from communities and aspects of society and life,” he says.
Nord decided not to “reinvent the wheel” and is instead building a coalition of physicists and computer scientists to fight for more scrutiny when developing algorithms. He points to companies such as Clearview AI – a US facial-recognition outfit used by law-enforcement agencies and other private institutions – that are scraping social-media data and then selling a surveillance service to law enforcement without explicit consent. Countries around the world, including China, are using such surveillance technology for widespread oppressive purposes, he warns. “Physicists should be working to understand power structures – such as data privacy issues, how data and science have been used to violate civil rights, how technology has upheld white supremacy, the history of surveillance capitalism – in which data-driven technologies disenfranchise people.”
To bring this issue to wider attention, Nord, Esquivel and other colleagues wrote a letter to the entire particle-physics community as part of the Snowmass process, which regularly develops a scientific vision for the future of the community, both in the US and abroad. Their letter, which discussed the “Ethical implications for computational research and the roles of scientists”, emphasizes why physicists, as individuals or at institutions and funding agencies, should care about the algorithms they are building and implementing.
Thais also urges physicists to actively engage with AI ethics, especially as citizens with deep technical knowledge (APS Physics 13 107). “It’s extremely important that physicists are educated on these issues of bias in AI and machine learning, even though it typically doesn’t come up in physics research applications of ML,” she says. One reason for this, Thais explains, is that many physicists leave the field to work in computer software, hardware and data science companies. “Many of these companies are using human data, so we have to prepare our students to do that work responsibly,” she says. “We can’t just teach the technical skills and ignore the broader societal context because many are eventually going to apply these methods beyond physics.”
Both Thais and Esquivel also believe that physicists have an important role to play in understanding and regulating AI because they often have to interpret and quantify systematic uncertainties using methods that produce more accurate output data, which can then counteract the inherent bias in the data. “With a machine-learning algorithm that is more ‘black boxy’, we really want to understand how accurate the algorithm is, how it works on edge cases, and why it performs best for that certain problem,” Thais says, “and those are tasks that a physicist did before.”
Another researcher who is using physics to improve accuracy and reliability in AI is Payel Das, a principal research staff manager with IBM’s Thomas J Watson Research Center. To design new materials and antibiotics, she and her team are developing ML algorithms that can combine learning from both data and physics principles, increasing the success rate of a new scientific discovery up to 100-fold. “We often enhance, guide or validate the AI models with the help of prior scientific or other form of knowledge, for example, physics-based principles, in order to make the AI system more robust, efficient, interpretable and reliable,” says Das, further explaining that “by using physics-driven learning, one can crosscheck the AI models in terms of accuracy, reliability and inductive bias”.

In 2015 a Black software developer Tweeted that Google Photos had labelled images of him with a friend as “gorillas”. Google managed to fix this issue by deleting the word “gorilla”, and some others referring to primates, from its vocabulary. By censoring these searches, the service can no longer find primates such as “gorilla”, “chimp”, “chimpanzee” or “monkey.”
When searching for the terms “Black girls”, “Latina girls” or “Asian girls”, the Google Ad portal would offer keyword suggestions related to pornography. Searches for “boys” of those same ethnicities also mostly returned suggestions related to pornography, but searches for “white girls” or “white boys” offered no suggested terms. In June 2020 the Google Ad portal was still perpetuating the objectification of Black, Latinx and Asian people, and has now solved the issue by blocking results from these terms.
Infrared technology, such as that in pulse oximeters, does not work properly on darker skin because less light passes through the skin. This can lead to inaccurate readings that may mean not getting the medical care needed. The same infrared technology has also been shown to fail in soap dispensers.



Auditing algorithms
In 2020 the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the UK government’s independent advisory body on data-driven technologies, published a review on bias in algorithmic decision-making. It found that there has been a notable growth in algorithmic decision-making over the last few years across four sectors – recruitment, financial services, policing and local government – and discovered clear evidence of algorithmic bias. The report calls for organizations to actively use data to identify and mitigate bias, making sure to understand the capabilities and limitations of their tools. It’s a sentiment echoed by Michael Rovatsos, AI professor and director of the Bayes Centre at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s very hard to actually get access to the data or to the algorithms used,” he explains, adding that companies should be required by government to audit and be transparent about their systems applied in the real world.
Some researchers, just like Buolamwini, are trying to use their scientific experience in AI to uncover bias in commercial algorithms from the outside. They include the mathematician Cathy O’Neil, who wrote Weapons of Math Destruction in 2016 about her work on data-driven biases and who in 2018 founded a consultancy to work privately with companies and audit their algorithms. Buolamwini also continues her work trying to create more equitable and accountable technology through her non-profit Algorithmic Justice League – an interdisciplinary research institute that she founded in 2016 to understand the social implications of AI technologies.

Following her 2018 Gender Shades study, published with computer scientist Timnit Gebru who co-founded Black in AI, the findings were sent to the companies involved. A year later, a follow-up study was carried out to rerun the audits and added two more companies: Amazon and Kairos (AIES ’19: Proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society 429). Led by Deborah Raji, a computer scientist and currently a Mozilla Foundation fellow, the follow-up found that the two had huge accuracy errors – Amazon’s facial recognition software even failed to classify Michelle Obama’s face correctly – but the original three companies had improved significantly, suggesting their dataset was trained with more diverse images.

These two studies had a profound real-world impact, leading to two US federal bills – the Algorithmic Accountability Act and No Biometric Barriers Act – as well as state bills in New York and Massachusetts. The research also helped persuade Microsoft, IBM and Amazon to put a hold on their facial-recognition technology for the police. “We designed an ‘actionable audit’ to lead to some accountability action, whether that be an update or modification to the product or its removal – something that past audits had struggled with,” says Raji. She is continuing her work on algorithmic evaluation and in 2020 developed with colleagues at Google a framework of algorithmic audits (arXiv:2001.00973) for AI accountability. “Internal auditing is essential as it allows for changes to be made to a system before it gets deployed out in the world,” she says, adding that sometimes the bias involved can be harmful for a particular population “so it’s important to identify the groups that are most vulnerable in these decisions and audit for the moments in the development pipeline that could introduce bias”.
In 2019 the AI Now Institute published a detailed report outlining a framework for public agencies interested in adopting algorithmic decision-making tools responsibly, and subsequently released an Algorithmic Accountability Policy Toolkit. The report called for AI and ML researchers to know what they are building; to account for potential risks and harms; and to better document the origins of their models and data. Esquivel points out the importance of physicists knowing where their data has come from, especially the data sets used to train ML systems. “Many of the algorithms that are being used on particle-physics data are fine-tuned architectures that were developed by AI experts and trained on industry standard data sets – data sets that have been shown to be racist, discriminatory and sexist,” she says, using the example of MIT permanently taking down a widely used, 80-million-image AI data set because existing images were labelled in offensive, racist and misogynistic ways.
Gebru and her colleagues also recently highlighted problems with large data sets such as the Common Crawl open repository of web crawl data, where there is an over-representation of white supremacist, ageist and misogynistic views (FAccT ’21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) – a paper for which she was recently fired from Google’s AI Ethics team. Consequently, Esquivel is clear that academics “have the opportunity to act as an objective third party to the development of these tools”.
Removing bias
The 2019 AI Now Institute report also recommends AI bias research to move beyond technical fixes. “It’s not just that we need to change the algorithms or the systems; we need to change institutions and social structures,” explains Rankin. From her perspective, to have any chance of removing or minimizing and regulating bias and discrimination, there would need to be “massive, collective action”. Involving people from beyond the natural sciences community in the process would also help.
It’s not just that we need to change the algorithms or the systems; we need to change institutions and social structures
Joy Lisi Rankin
Nord agrees that physicists need to work with scientists from other disciplines, as well as with social scientists and ethicists. “Unfortunately, I don’t see physical scientists or computer scientists engaging sufficiently with the literature and communities of these other fields that have spent so much time and energy in studying these issues,” he says, noting that “it seems like every couple of weeks there is a new terrible, harmful and inane machine-learning application that tries to do the impossible and the unethical.” For example, the University of Texas in Austin only recently stopped using an ML system to predict success in graduate school, whose data was based on previous admissions cycles and so would have carried biases. “Why do we pursue such technocratic solutions in a necessarily humanistic space?” asks Nord.
Thais insists that physicists must become better informed about the current state of these issues of bias, and then understand the approaches adopted by others for mitigating them. “We have to bring these conversations into all of our discussions around machine learning and artificial intelligence,” she says, hoping physicists might attend relevant conferences, workshops or talks. “This technology is impacting and already ingrained in so many facets of our lives that it’s irresponsible to not contextualize the work in the broader societal context.”
Nord is even clearer. “Physicists should be asking whether they should, before asking whether they could, create or implement some AI technology,” he says, adding that it is also possible to stop using existing, harmful technology. “The use of these technologies is a choice we make as individuals and as a society.”

One of Biplav Srivastava’s long-term goals is to help people use technology to solve the problems they face. This wasn’t always his top priority, though – for many years after completing his Ph.D., he didn’t really worry about connecting his research to real-world impacts. Then, he says, he started to become very concerned that while his work was having significant commercial success, “it meant nothing on the street… it has limited value if you can’t see it around you.”
Srivastava is a 2020-21 AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellow and last July, he became a professor of computer science at the University of South Carolina’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Institute after many years at IBM. Starting in 2011 while still at IBM, he began applying his knowledge of AI to sustainability projects around the world, particularly related to developing smarter cities through addressing issues like water access, electricity, transportation, and public health. One example of this work is Water Advisor, a chat-based tool he and his team at IBM developed, which uses machine learning techniques to help users easily find information about water quality in different locations. 
This turn towards impact-oriented research eventually led Srivastava to the AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute, which supports scientists and engineers in public engagement that has broader societal impacts. The fellowship cohorts are focused on science and engineering issues with societal significance. And the importance of AI, the focus of Srivastava’s cohort, only increased with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when AI was put to use in multitude of response efforts. Srivastava put together a collection of resources on AI and COVID, and created a tool to analyze the effect of mask-wearing. He is featured in a video and article on The Conversation about this tool, which can calculate, for specific locations, how many lives were saved or lost depending on when mask mandates were implemented – showing that early mandates had exponentially greater benefits.
As one of his key activities for the public engagement fellowship, Srivastava organized a hybrid virtual/in-person event at his university in October 2020 to promote the ethical use of digital assistants in society. It brought together perspectives on data-driven decision support from across the science, engineering, and societal aspects of AI technologies. Six additional Leshner Fellows from the AI cohort spoke on a panel about the role of AI in handling COVID-19 at universities and in communities, and Emily Therese Cloyd, director of the AAAS Center for Public Engagement with Science, introduced the Leshner Leadership Institute. Srivastava reports that people from across the university are now thinking about how they can work together. Several proposals have arisen as a result, as well as follow-on events including organizing an AI summer program for high school students. 
Moving forward, Srivastava has several related goals -- he is interested in open data collaborations, and has spoken with the local government in Columbia, South Carolina, where his university is located, about the possibility of making more of their data public. Although the local government doesn’t currently have the capacity to do this, his vision is to eventually create fun, competitive events for students to try to solve local problems using local data – such as prioritizing which water pipes need to be replaced. However, he also wants to promote the message that while AI can be extremely useful, it can’t solve everything in isolation: it has to be developed in conversation with end users and the public more broadly, so that it works for the people it’s intended to serve. 
The AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute was founded in 2015 and operates through philanthropic gifts in honor of CEO Emeritus Alan I. Leshner. Each year the Institute provides public engagement training and support to 10-15 mid-career scientists from an area of research at the nexus of science and society.

Since the very beginning of the computer revolution, researchers have dreamed of creating computers that would rival the human brain. Our brains are information machines that use inputs to generate outputs, and so are computers. How hard could it be to build computers that work as well as our brains?
In 1954 a Georgetown-IBM team predicted that language translation programs would be perfected in three to five years. In 1965 Herbert Simon said that “machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.” In 1970 Marvin Minsky told Life magazine, “In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.” Billions of dollars have been poured into efforts to build computers with artificial intelligence that equals or surpasses human intelligence. Researchers didn’t know it at first, but this was a moonshot—a wildly ambitious effort that had little chance of a quick payoff.

So far, it has failed. We still know very little about how the human brain works, but we have learned that building computers that rival human brains is not just a question of computational power and clever code.
A.I. research was launched at a summer conference at Dartmouth in 1956 with the moonshot vision that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” Seventeen years later, the 1973 Lighthill report commissioned by the U.K. Science Research Council concluded that “in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised.” Funding dried up and an A.I. winter began. There was a resurgence of A.I. research in the 1980s, fueled by advances in computer memory and processing speed and the development of expert systems, followed by a second A.I. winter as the limitations of expert systems became apparent. Another resurgence began in the 1990s and continues to this day.

We still know very little about how the human brain works, but we have learned that building computers that rival human brains is not just a question of computational power and clever code.

Widely publicized computer victories over world champions in backgammon, checkers, chess, Go, and Jeopardy! have fueled the idea that the initial hopes for A.I. are on the verge of being realized. But just as in the first decades of moonshot hope, ambitious predictions and moving goalposts continue to be the norm.
In 2014, Ray Kurzweil predicted that by 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence and will have all of the intellectual and emotional capabilities of humans, including “the ability to tell a joke, to be funny, to be romantic, to be loving, to be sexy.” As we move closer to 2029, Kurzweil talks more about 2045.
In a 2009 TED talk, Israeli neuroscientist Henry Markram said that within a decade his research group would reverse-engineer the human brain by using a supercomputer to simulate the brain’s 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.

These failed goals cost money. After being promised $1.3 billion in funding from the European Union, Markram’s Human Brain Project crashed in 2015. In 2016, the market research firm PwC predicted that GDP would be 14 percent or $15.7 trillion higher in 2030 because of A.I. products and services. They weren’t alone. McKinsey, Accenture, and Forrester also forecast similar figures by 2030, with Forrester in 2016 predicting $1.2 trillion in 2020. Four years later, in 2020, Forrester reported that the A.I. market was only $17 billion. It now projects the market to reach $37 billion by 2025. Oops!

The $15 trillion predictions made in 2016 assumed the success of A.I. moonshots such as Watson for health care, DeepMind and Nest for energy use, Level 5 self-driving vehicles on public roads, and humanlike robots and text. When moonshots like these work, they can be revolutionary; when they turn out to be pie in the sky, the failures are costly.

We have learned the hard way that winning a game of Go or Jeopardy! is a lot easier than processing words and images, providing effective health care, and building self-driving cars. Computers are like New Zealander Nigel Richards, who memorized the 386,000 words in the French Scrabble dictionary and won the French-language Scrabble World Championship twice, even though he doesn’t know the meaning of the French words he spells. In the same way, computer algorithms fit mathematical equations to data that they do not understand and consequently cannot employ any of the critical thinking skills that humans have.
If a computer algorithm found a correlation between Donald Trump tweeting the word with and the price of tea in China four days later, it had no way of assessing whether this correlation is meaningful or meaningless. A state-of-the-art image recognition program was 99 percent certain that a series of horizontal black and yellow lines was a school bus, evidently focusing on the color of the pixels and completely ignoring the fact that buses have wheels, doors, and a windshield.

The health care moonshot has also disappointed. Swayed by IBM’s Watson boasts, McKinsey predicted a 30–50 percent productivity improvement for nurses, a 5–9 percent reduction in health care costs, and health care savings in developed countries equal to up to 2 percent of GDP. The Wall Street Journal published a cautionary article in 2017, and soon others were questioning the hype. A 2019 article in IEEE Spectrum concluded that Watson had “overpromised and underdelivered.” Soon afterward, IBM pulled Watson from drug discovery, and media enthusiasm waned as bad news about A.I. health care accumulated. For example, a 2020 Mayo Clinic and Harvard survey of clinical staff who were using A.I.-based clinical decision support to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes gave the program a median score of 11 on a scale of 0 to 100, with only 14 percent saying that they would recommend the system to other clinics.

Following Watson’s failure, the media moved on to Google health care articles in Nature and other journals that reported black-box results with unreported tweaks that were needed to make the models work well. After Google published its protein folding paper, an expert in structural biology said, “Until DeepMind shares their code, nobody in the field cares and it’s just them patting themselves on the back.” He also said that the idea that protein folding had been solved was “laughable.” An international group of scientists described a Google paper on breast cancer as another “very high-profile journal publishing a very exciting study that has nothing to do with science. … It’s more an advertisement for cool technology. We can’t really do anything with it.” Such cautions are well deserved in light of the flop of Google’s highly touted Flu Trends algorithm. After claiming to be 97.5 percent accurate in predicting flu outbreaks, Google Flu Trends overestimated the number of flu cases for 100 of the next 108 weeks, by an average of nearly 100 percent, before being quietly retired.

The self-driving vehicle moonshot is in a similar state. By late 2018, it was becoming clear that self-driving cars were much harder than originally thought, with one Wall Street Journal article titled “Driverless Hype Collides With Merciless Reality.” In 2020, startups like Zoox, Ike, Kodiak Robotics, Lyft, Uber, and Velodyne began layoffs, bankruptcies, revaluations, and liquidations at deflated prices. Uber sold its autonomous unit in late 2020 after years of claiming that self-driving vehicles were its key to future profitability. An MIT task force announced in mid-2020 that fully driverless systems will take at least a decade to deploy over large areas.
Overall, A.I. moonshots are proving to be an expensive collection of failures. An October 2020 Wired article titled “Companies Are Rushing to Use AI—but Few See a Payoff” reported that only 11 percent of firms that have deployed A.I. are reaping a “sizable” return on their investments. One reason is that costs often turn out to be higher—much higher—than originally assumed. According to a fall 2020 MIT Sloan Management Review article, “A good rule of thumb is that you should estimate that for every $1 you spend developing an algorithm, you must spend $100 to deploy and support it.”

The 2020 edition of the “State of AI Report,” published by A.I. investors Nathan Benaich and Ian Hogarth, concluded that “we’re rapidly approaching outrageous computational, economic, and environmental costs to gain incrementally smaller improvements in model performance.” For example, “Without major new research breakthroughs, dropping the [image recognition] error rate from 11.5% to 1% would require over one hundred billion billion dollars!”
The fact is most moonshots fail: nuclear fusion, synthetic fuels, supersonic flight, maglev, and blockchain for everything. Instead, successful technologies generally begin in small and often overlooked applications and then expand to bigger and more important ones. Transistors were first used in hearing aids and radios before becoming ubiquitous in military equipment, computers, and phones. Computers began with accounting applications and later expanded to every function of a company. LEDs were first used in calculators and automobile dashboards, long before being used for lighting. The internet began as a tool for professors before becoming the most widely used technology since electricity. Solar cells were used in satellites and remote locations long before they were used to generate electricity for urban homes and business. In almost every case, technologies begin in a niche and then incrementally expand to other applications over decades through exponential improvements in price and performance.

Some companies successfully focus their A.I. efforts on solutions to small problems with achievable benefits. For instance, DHL uses A.I.-controlled robots to find packages, move them around warehouses, and load them onto planes. And Microsoft recently acquired Nuance, a company best known for a deep learning voice transcription service that is very popular in the health care sector.
Many similar examples can be found in robotic process automation—software robots that emulate humans interacting with digital systems. It can be used for accounting, manufacturing, financial, and engineering transactions, and it is the fastest-growing segment of the A.I. market.

The same incremental approach can be used for health care, self-driving vehicles, and more. Mutually beneficial diffusion and progress can come from collaboration among large research hospitals within and across countries as researchers learn from one another and generalize from one case to another. The holy grail of a robotaxi that can operate without a driver in every geographic location no matter the weather remains elusive, but self-driving vehicles are used successfully in constrained environments like mining camps, large factories, industrial parks, theme parks, golf clubs, and university campuses. It is surely better to perfect small solutions before moving on to crowded public roads with a plethora of unforeseen hazards.
One of the reasons A.I. overpromised and underdelivered is that we didn’t anticipate that building a computer that surpasses the human brain is the moonshot of all moonshots. Computers may someday rival human intelligence. In the meantime, we should recognize the limitations of A.I. and take advantage of the real strengths of computers. The failure of A.I. moonshots is not a reason to give up on A.I., but it is a reason to be realistic about what A.I. can do for us.

Now it’s putting AI to work on businesses and the NHSSave this storySaveSave this storySaveAs the deadly first wave of the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK in March 2020, Marc Warner stopped going to his usual work meetings. The NHS had put out a plea for help from technology firms, and Warner, the CEO of London-based artificial intelligence firm Faculty, rang his investors and told them he would be focussing on the pandemic response. A symphony of government and NHS contracts ensued – five of them directly linked to the pandemic management. Warner says he threw himself into the work and didn’t attend company meetings for months. “One of the jokes we make is that 2020 was so bad I had to code again,” he says of the pandemic’s earliest days. “No one in Faculty wants that – I was never a great coder.”Faculty’s NHS work focused on two major areas: helping to bring together unruly sprawls of health information, and building AI for the NHS to forecast where supplies are needed. The first of these projects, called the NHS Covid-19 Data Store, is a collection of health datasets, including everything from populations and NHS staff levels to Covid-19 death data and calls to emergency services. The system, which Faculty created alongside Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir, organises and makes data available to decision-makers. “Keeping data in a good state is an incredibly tricky problem in a normal situation,” Warner says. “It was very clear, fairly early on, that it was going to be incredibly powerful to have a really good view of the system, [of] what's going on now.”The second stage was predicting what would happen next. What this looked like was an AI model – based on previous bed use and NHS 111 call volumes, among other data – that lets hospitals predict potential outbreaks for the next three weeks. The model has been given to local NHS Trusts after being used nationally by NHS England and forecasts where ventilators and beds, among other things, would be needed most. As Faculty’s pandemic work progressed, Warner, who has a PhD in quantum computing and a degree in physics, moved to “red teaming” its output: digging into the AI models, trying to break things.Trending NowThe Best of Tech Support: Ken Jeong, Bill Nye, Nicole Stott and MoreThe decision to focus on the pandemic had repercussions, he says: some of Faculty’s work became “unaligned” without the CEO overseeing it. “The other set of consequences that truthfully, we never anticipated going into it, [were] the media repercussions of me being more directly involved,” Warner says. The company’s early work in politics and government connections have made it, to some, one of the most controversial AI companies around.In 2020, The Guardian reported that Faculty had been given 14 government contracts in two years – including for its pandemic work – and that Warner’s brother and former employee Ben, now a Downing Street advisor, was sitting in meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Faculty’s original NHS Covid-19 Data Store contract said it could retain intellectual property rights to train its AI models with NHS data – something that would have allowed the company to profit from the access to usually inaccessible information. However, Faculty says this was later rewritten at its request to make clear it wasn’t using the data.This is on top of questions around the work Faculty did for the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum, and also about £260,000 of work for controversial former government advisor Dominic Cummings. (Details of the work have not been disclosed.) Faculty denies receiving any preferential treatment during the pandemic response and says it stopped working in politics in 2019. “If you want to help solve important problems, you will be exposed to scrutiny and that is a good thing in general,” Warner says. He adds 80 per cent of the company’s contacts are with private companies, rather than the government.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDTwo former members of staff say that, internally, Faculty is highly focused on the ethics of the work it does. They say Warner’s academic background shapes the company’s culture and that individual data scientists can refuse to be involved in projects they find ethically objectionable. This is in addition to an ethics board which assesses projects it does.AdvertisementWarner founded Faculty in 2014 – originally under the name of ASI Data Science – as a fellowship and mentoring company. From the outset, he decided it would train PhD graduates in data science and AI, with a final practical placement taking place at an established company. Since then, more than 300 PhDs have and 200 companies have taken part. While the fellowship sits at the heart of the company, it doesn’t make it a profit, the CEO says. Instead, it allows Faculty to hire PhDs – more than 50 of its 120-plus staff hold one – and make connections with companies.Faculty’s focus, Warner says, is deploying custom AI into businesses and helping them make the technology useful. To do this it has built its own data science software. The tool allows data scientists to import large datasets, run AI against them and then visualise the results. Warner says it’s like Excel, but for data scientists.The real trick, though, is getting more companies to use AI – for this Faculty is deploying its AI within companies focusing on consumer tech, health, engineering and government. Helping a variety of companies use AI has lessons that can be applied across all businesses. Warner stresses that Faculty’s clients own any AI model that has been trained on their data. However, as most AI that’s currently used matches patterns in data, it’s possible for the algorithms and code libraries to be used with different clients. Warner says: “A customer has data, we help them find patterns in it, and we help them use that understanding to sort of push the world in a direction that they want it to.”The hype around AI, which ballooned following DeepMind’s AI victory against Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016, has largely subsided and businesses are faced with the harsh reality that getting returns on investment in AI isn’t guaranteed. Research from the Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management in 2020 found only 11 per cent of firms using AI are getting a “sizeable” return on their investments.“The typical problem is: it's too broad as a proposition,” says Richard Sargeant, Faculty’s chief operating officer. One unnamed shipping company asked it to predict the price of containers for all of its routes for the next year, a task Sargeant says would have been like predicting exactly what the stock market is going to do. Instead of a broad-brush approach, Sargeant and Warner say deploying AI in narrow situations is best – where it can excel and perform better than humans. To do this they need to understand how a business operates and how the data it has can be used. They cite examples of helping a retailer reduce the number of printed catalogues they send to customers and the UK’s Network Rail using cameras on the front of trains and AI to identify trees and plants encroaching onto railways.For Warner and Sargeant, the secret to companies effectively using AI is building out a whole approach to it. It’s not just having the right data and knowing what can be done with it. The business value of AI comes from the entire system and not how advanced the AI model is, Sargeant says. “There will definitely be some small firms that just want to buy a black box off the shelf,” he says. “But my hunch is that for most enterprises… they're going to need to think in terms of the combination of technology and expertise.”Updated 06.05.21, 09:10 GMT: The headline and standfirst of this article have been updatedMore great stories from WIRED📚 The future of medicine, AI and climate change: get WIRED booksCanary Wharf is trying to reinvent itselfThe hunt for a drug that can stop Covid-19 infectionsHow to get your new puppy ready for post-lockdown lifePolice unions on Facebook are harassing LGBTQ peopleLewis Hamilton opens up about activism and life beyond F1🔊 Subscribe to the WIRED Podcast.

Back in the olden days, you had to write letters to your loved ones, learn about the nationwide events from newspaper columns, walk to the nearest supermarket for buying grocery, stand in long lines at the bank for undertaking a simple transaction, and do a 9-to-5 job, filing boring data day after day. Things have taken a 360° turn, now. You have social media to keep yourself updated about the minute-by-minute lives of your families and friends around the globe. Televisions and smartphone streaming applications entertain you with popular series and blockbusters films around the clock. E-marts like Amazon deliver products to your doorstep with a single click. There are online banking facilities for you to send or receive money at will. Got a question? You can just type it into the Google search bar and the engine will fetch millions of results within mere seconds. And, don't even get me started on the condition of work, which has gone remote, allowing you to fulfill your tasks or attend meetings from the comfort of your home. You can even start your own business without having to invest in a proper office space. So on and so forth..These are just a few examples of the monumental shift in the general lifestyle of people over the bygone decades. The credit goes to technology, and its proud creation – the internet. As you may very well know, the internet is nothing short of a necessity, these days. It has penetrated so deeply into our lives that we cannot imagine a single day without surfing the waves of the World Wide Web. Because of its high demand, ISPs offer competitive internet service plans and packages in the market, and the sales are never-ending. The moment you get your hands on a networking goldmine, like RCN internet plans, you are set for life. The high-speed internet connection will power so many devices in your household, starting from your smartphone to your smart vacuum. There is another piece of technology that a good internet connection will support, and it is called Artificial Intelligence. What is AI and how can it make your work and life easier than ever in the upcoming future? Let's find out below..Artificial Intelligence and Its Possible Impacts.Artificial Intelligence or AI is a budding field of technology, which develops and researches the capabilities of machines to mimic human intelligence and other behavioral traits. AI is the artificial simulation of the human mind and its thought patterns. In simple words, any machine that is programmed to think and act like a human can be called Artificial Intelligence. What is the benefit of AI? Here are several ways it can impact the future of your work and life:.Increased Personalization .The current trajectory of the world has a bad side effect of isolating people. It is evident by the huge number of depressed individuals, which is growing day by day. Technology can help people feel less lonely. How? Through AI-powered chatbots. There are smartphone applications and other mental health programs which utilize Artificial Intelligent chatbots to keep isolated people company during hard times. These chatbots study the user's behavior and adjust the tone of conversation accordingly. Such machine learning traits pave the way to a more personalized experience, which satisfies users largely..Even in the field of commerce, brands that bring AI bots to the front of customer service receive better results than those who do not. Customer service chatbots help buyers throughout the purchasing journey and even after that. Being technological in essence, they are available 24/7 to give customized replies to user queries, based on a prior assessment of the user's tone and attitude. This is just the start. AI has the potential to make people feel special through highly personalized and customized treatment, both in work and in life..Streamlined Operations.Gone are the days of menial drudgery. You no longer have to worry about minimal tasks that eat up your time, resources, and energy. Artificial Intelligence can take care of that. There are state-of-the-art AI programs and software in the making that can complete simple-to-complex assignments and jobs for you. For instance, if you are planning to set up a smart home system this year, consisting of smart lights, smart thermostats, automated locks, smart alarms, smart outdoor lights, smart kitchen appliances, smart stereo, smart switches, and more, then you can rely on the efficiency of an AI-assisted smart home hub to control and manage all these devices for you. A smart home hub can connect to your smart home device grid over the in-home network, and monitor it for optimized performance. It can dial the lights down automatically sensing the absence of human residents to save up energy and reduce your electricity bill, in addition to other things..Similarly, the integration of Artificial Intelligence in work can lead to streamlined business operations. AI can do the smallest of tasks, like data entry, data maintenance, inventory scan, supply chain monitoring, and information security within mere seconds and with greater accuracy, leaving no chances for error. Once AI takes up these tasks, it can open up more avenues of exploration for workers, saving their time and money in the meanwhile..Predictions for a Better Future.Artificial Intelligence cannot only analyze the current statistics but also predict the future curves, based on a set of patterns. Equipped with such information and forecast data, people will be able to prepare for anything, ranging from climatic emergencies like hurricanes, twisters, and wildfires, to business crises. Besides the preparation, they can use AI analysis to strive towards the betterment of the QoL index, or quality of life. This is how AI can help make the world a safer and sweeter place to live in..Wrapping Up.People are always looking for ways to introduce a greater degree of convenience and ease into their lifestyles. Technology has so far enabled them to walk on the path of progress, and with platforms like Artificial Intelligence on the rise, the future of work and life looks brighter than ever..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Deep neural networks excel at finding patterns in datasets too vast for the human brain to pick apart. That ability has made deep learning indispensable to just about anyone who deals with data. This year, the MIT Quest for Intelligence and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab sponsored 17 undergraduates to work with faculty on yearlong research projects through MIT’s Advanced Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (SuperUROP).
Students got to explore AI applications in climate science, finance, cybersecurity, and natural language processing, among other fields. And faculty got to work with students from outside their departments, an experience they describe in glowing terms. “Adeline is a shining testament of the value of the UROP program,” says Raffaele Ferrari, a professor in MIT’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, of his advisee. “Without UROP, an oceanography professor might have never had the opportunity to collaborate with a student in computer science.”
Highlighted below are four SuperUROP projects from this past year.
A faster algorithm to manage cloud-computing jobs
The shift from desktop computing to far-flung data centers in the “cloud” has created bottlenecks for companies selling computing services. Faced with a constant flux of orders and cancellations, their profits depend heavily on efficiently pairing machines with customers.
Approximation algorithms are used to carry out this feat of optimization. Among all the possible ways of assigning machines to customers by price and other criteria, they find a schedule that achieves near-optimal profit.​ For the last year, junior Spencer Compton worked on a virtual whiteboard with MIT Professor Ronitt Rubinfeld and postdoc Slobodan Mitrović to find a faster scheduling method.
“We didn’t write any code,” he says. “We wrote proofs and used mathematical ideas to find a more efficient way to solve this optimization problem. The same ideas that improve cloud-computing scheduling can be used to assign flight crews to planes, among other tasks.”
In a pre-print paper on arXiv, Compton and his co-authors show how to speed up an approximation algorithm under dynamic conditions. They also show how to locate machines assigned to individual customers without computing the entire schedule.
A big challenge was finding the crux of the project, he says. “There’s a lot of literature out there, and a lot of people who have thought about related problems. It was fun to look at everything that’s been done and brainstorm to see where we could make an impact.”​
How much heat and carbon can the oceans absorb?
Earth’s oceans regulate climate by drawing down excess heat and carbon dioxide from the air. But as the oceans warm, it’s unclear if they will soak up as much carbon as they do now. A slowed uptake could bring about more warming than what today’s climate models predict. It’s one of the big questions facing climate modelers as they try to refine their predictions for the future.
The biggest obstacle in their way is the complexity of the problem: today’s global climate models lack the computing power to get a high-resolution view of the dynamics influencing key variables like sea-surface temperatures. To compensate for the lost accuracy, researchers are building surrogate models to approximate the missing dynamics without explicitly solving for them.
In a project with MIT Professor Raffaele Ferrari and research scientist Andre Souza, MIT junior Adeline Hillier is exploring how deep learning solutions can be used to improve or replace physical models of the uppermost layer of ocean, which drives the rate of heat and carbon uptake. “If the model has a small footprint and succeeds under many of the physical conditions encountered in the real world, it could be incorporated into a global climate model and hopefully improve climate projections,” she says.
In the course of the project, Hillier learned how to code in the programming language Julia. She also got a crash course in fluid dynamics. “You’re trying to model the effects of turbulent dynamics in the ocean,” she says. “It helps to know what the processes and physics behind them look like.”
In search of more efficient deep learning models
There are thousands of ways to design a deep learning model to solve a given task. Automating the design process promises to narrow the options and make these tools more accessible. But finding the optimal architecture is anything but simple. Most automated searches pick the model that maximizes validation accuracy without considering the structure of the underlying data, which may suggest a simpler, more robust solution. As a result, more reliable or data-efficient architectures are passed over.
“Instead of looking at the accuracy of the model alone, we should focus on the structure of the data,” says MIT senior Kristian Georgiev. In a project with MIT Professor Asu Ozdaglar and graduate student Alireza Fallah, Georgiev is looking at ways to automatically query the data to find the model that best suits its constraints. “If you choose your architecture based on the data, you’re more likely to get a good and robust solution from a learning theory perspective,” he says.
The hardest part of the project was the exploratory phase at the start, he says. To find a good research question he read through papers ranging from topics in autoML to representation theory. But it was worth it, he says, to be able to work at the intersection of optimization and generalization. “To make good progress in machine learning you need to combine both of these fields.”
What makes humans so good at recognizing faces?
Face recognition comes easily to humans. Picking out familiar faces in a blurred or distorted photo is a cinch. But we don’t really understand why or how to replicate this superpower in machines. To home in on the principles important to recognizing faces, researchers have shown headshots to human subjects that are progressively degraded to see where recognition starts to break down. They are now performing similar experiments on computers to see if deeper insights can be gained
In a project with MIT Professor Pawan Sinha and the MIT Quest for Intelligence, junior Ashika Verma applied a set of filters to a dataset of celebrity photos. She blurred their faces, distorted them, and changed their color to see if a face-recognition model could pick out photos of the same face. She found that the model did best when the photos were either natural color or grayscale, consistent with the human studies. Accuracy slipped when a color filter was added, but not as much as it did for the human subjects — a wrinkle that Verma plans to investigate further.
The work is part of a broader effort to understand what makes humans so good at recognizing faces, and how machine vision might be improved as a result. It also ties in with Project Prakash, a nonprofit in India that treats blind children and tracks their recovery to learn more about the visual system and brain plasticity. “Running human experiments takes more time and resources than running computational experiments,” says Verma’s advisor, Kyle Keane, a researcher with MIT Quest. “We're trying to make AI as human-like as possible so we can run a lot of computational experiments to identify the most promising experiments to run on humans.”
Degrading the images to use in the experiments, and then running them through the deep nets, was a challenge, says Verma. “It’s very slow,” she says. “You work 20 minutes at a time and then you wait.” But working in a lab with an advisor made it worth it, she says. “It was fun to dip my toes into neuroscience.”
SuperUROP projects were funded, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, MIT Quest Corporate, and by Eric Schmidt, technical advisor to Alphabet Inc., and his wife, Wendy.

The technology is infiltrating every sector and transforming the tasks that computers perform into a lot of hype. Starting from fitness-focused smartphone apps that adapt to women's menstrual cycle to autonomous vehicles that use sensors and software to dodge at stray animals, artificial intelligence has influenced every part of human life. It has evolved from being just a trend to a core ingredient virtually across every aspect of computing. In the modern world, businesses across diverse sectors use artificial intelligence as a tool to meet their goals, be it customer service through an intuitive chatbot or streamlining video production through synthetic voiceovers. For a term that dates back to 1956 and celebrates its 65th birthday this year, artificial intelligence has performed and revolutionized more than how anybody imagined..As years passed, humans gained great faith in technology and machines, which eventually accelerated artificial intelligence adoption. Today, the role of artificial intelligence in an enterprise has become so important that it has touched every facet of business, and its crucial place will significantly grow over the coming years. Artificial intelligence, though revolutionary in itself, is an enabler that needs to be used effectively to achieve business objectives. Businesses are using AI agents to engage customers, rapidly create content, analyze transactions and detect fraud. Even though it comes with a lot of flaws, the speediness, customized content, and target recommendations, overweigh the cons..AI-driven technologies have the potential to enhance our lives as both learners and workers. Researchers and developers are continuously improving them to mimic human behaviors in routines like learning, problem-solving, and processing language. While they are growing to be strong imitators of humans, they still lack essential human traits such as wisdom, insight, humor, and empathy. Fortunately, the next generation's AI will carry all the objectives that humans think are essential for machines to cope up with them. The technological capabilities will attempt to solve real-world issues, moving beyond doing repetitive and routine works..While big guys like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft scramble to infuse their products with artificial intelligence, other companies are hard at work developing their own intelligent technologies and services. The rise of digitization and the thirst for automation are fuelling the demand for AI solutions. Not just companies, even the governments are focusing on deep research in the field of finding, investing, and growing local talent to make their country the AI hub. Artificial intelligence companies are also initiating to deliver a robust service to their customers by using sub-technologies like machine learning, deep learning, edge computing, business intelligence, etc. as their prominent business principle. In a nutshell, artificial intelligence is used as a tool to integrate multiple sources of data or a vast amount of data, data security, real-world applications, predictions, cloud operations, etc. With the arena of AI technologies at the beginning, the world has experienced so much so far. The future is anticipated to be more sophisticated and personalized with the help of artificial intelligence..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Organizations need to consider many factors when building or enhancing an artificial intelligence infrastructure to support AI applications and workloads .







These are not trivial issues. A company's ultimate success with AI will likely depend on how suitable its environment is for such powerful applications. While the cloud is emerging as a major resource for data-intensive AI workloads, enterprises still rely on their on-premises IT environments for these projects.

Big data storage: Infrastructure requirements for AI
One of the biggest considerations is AI data storage, specifically the ability to scale storage as the volume of data grows. As organizations prepare enterprise AI strategies and build the necessary infrastructure, storage must be a top priority. That includes ensuring the proper storage capacity, IOPS and reliability to deal with the massive data amounts required for effective AI.
Figuring out what kind of storage an organization needs depends on many factors, including the level of AI an organization plans to use and whether it needs to make real-time decisions.
For example, for advanced, high-value neural network ecosystems, traditional network-attached storage architectures might present scaling issues with I/O and latency. Similarly, a financial services company that uses enterprise AI systems for real-time trading decisions may need fast all-flash storage technology.
Many companies are already building big data and analytics environments designed to support enormous data volumes, and these will likely be suitable for many types of AI applications.
Another factor is the nature of the source data. AI applications depend on source data, so an organization needs to know where the source data resides and how AI applications will use it. For instance, will applications be analyzing sensor data in real time, or will they use post-processing?
You also need to factor in how much AI data applications will generate. AI applications make better decisions as they're exposed to more data. As databases grow over time, companies need to monitor capacity and plan for expansion as needed.



The amount of data collection and type of AI deployed should motivate big data storage architecture decisions.







AI networking infrastructure
Networking is another key component of an artificial intelligence infrastructure. To provide the high efficiency at scale required to support AI and machine learning models, organizations will likely need to upgrade their networks.
Deep learning algorithms are highly dependent on communications, and enterprise networks will need to keep stride with demand as AI efforts expand. That's why scalability must be a high priority, and that will require high-bandwidth, low-latency and creative architectures.
Companies should automate wherever possible. For example, they should deploy automated infrastructure management tools in their data centers.
Network infrastructure providers, meanwhile, are looking to do the same. Software-defined networks are being combined with machine learning to create intent-based networks that can anticipate network demands or security threats and react in real time.








Artificial intelligence workloads
Also critical for an artificial intelligence infrastructure is having sufficient compute resources, including CPUs and GPUs.
A CPU-based environment can handle basic AI workloads, but deep learning involves multiple large data sets and deploying scalable neural network algorithms. For that, CPU-based computing might not be sufficient.



Creating an AI-optimized hardware stack starts with analyzing CPU and GPU needs.





To provide the necessary compute capabilities, companies must turn to GPUs. Deploying GPUs enables organizations to optimize their data center infrastructure and gain power efficiency.
Numerous companies create AI-focused GPUs and CPUs, giving enterprises options when buying AI hardware. Nvidia, for example, is a leading creator of AI-focused GPUs, while Intel sells chips explicitly made for AI work, including inferencing and natural language processing (NLP).
Meanwhile, more recently established companies, including Graphcore, Cerebras and Ampere Computing, have created chips for advanced AI workloads.


Preparing AI data
Organizations have much to consider. Not only do they have to choose where they will store data, how they will move it across networks and how they will process it, but they also have to choose how they will prepare the data for use in AI applications.
One of the critical steps for successful enterprise AI is data cleansing. Also called data scrubbing, it's the process of updating or removing data from a database that is inaccurate, incomplete, improperly formatted or duplicated.
Any company, but particularly those in data-driven sectors, should consider deploying automated data cleansing tools to assess data for errors using rules or algorithms. Data quality is especially critical with AI. If the data feeding AI systems is inaccurate or out of date, the output and any related business decisions will also be inaccurate.


AI data management and governance
Another important factor is data access. Does the organization have the proper mechanisms in place to deliver data in a secure and efficient manner to the users who need it?



Creating an ethical AI infrastructure will aid in a company's fight against bias, reduce risk and ensure accountability.





As such, part of the data management strategy needs to ensure that users -- machines and people -- have easy and fast access to data. It should be accessible from a variety of endpoints, including mobile devices via wireless networks.
Access also raises a number of privacy and security issues, so data access controls are important. Companies need to look at technologies such as identity and access management and data encryption tools as part of their data management and governance strategies.


AIoT
No discussion of artificial intelligence infrastructure would be complete without mentioning its intersection with IoT. The artificial intelligence IoT (AIoT) involves gathering and analyzing data from countless devices, products, sensors, assets, locations, vehicles, etc., using IoT, AI and machine learning to optimize data management and analytics. AIoT is crucial to gaining insights from all the information coming in from connected things.
Business data platform Statista forecasted there will be more than 10 billion connected IoT devices worldwide in 2021. Furthermore, Statista expects that number to grow to more than 25 billion devices by 2030.
Imagine the staggering amount of data generated by connected objects, and it will be up to companies and their AI tools to integrate, manage and secure all of this information.
From an artificial intelligence infrastructure standpoint, companies need to look at their networks, data storage, data analytics and security platforms to make sure they can effectively handle the growth of their IoT ecosystems. That includes data generated by their own devices, as well as those of their supply chain partners.


AI training
Last but certainly not least: Training and skills development are vital for any IT endeavor and especially enterprise AI initiatives. Companies will need data analysts, data scientists, developers, cybersecurity experts, network engineers and IT professionals with a variety of skills to build and maintain their infrastructure to support AI and to use artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning, NLP and deep learning, on an ongoing basis.
They will also need people who are capable of managing the various aspects of infrastructure development and who are well versed in the business goals of the organization. Putting together a strong team is an essential part of any artificial intelligence infrastructure development effort.

Tweet Share Post Email Print LinkFont Size:A A A Federal agencies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) tools to do their work and carry out their missions. Nearly half the federal agencies surveyed for a recent report commissioned by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) employ or have experimented with AI tools. The agencies used AI tools across an array of governance tasks, including adjudication, enforcement, data collection and analysis, internal management, and public communications.Agencies’ interest in AI tools is not surprising. These tools promise improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of certain government functions, as they yield improvements in sectors ranging from regulatory enforcement to benefits adjudication. But AI tools also present potential problems for governance. If used extensively and without care, AI tools could hollow out agencies’ human expertise. Agency personnel might grow too trusting of AI tools or defer too readily to the tools’ determinations in fields that call for the exercise of human discretion. Artificial intelligence tools might also increase opacity in public decision-making when agencies rely on tools they cannot adequately explain. And AI tools might sometimes exacerbate human biases, whether because of their designs or the data on which the tools rely. Moreover, AI tools pose potential problems for agencies when it comes to considerations such as privacy, data security, developing technical capacity, procurement, data usage, oversight, and accountability.For scholars and students of AI, these are not new concerns. They have been discussed and debated for years. Despite the consideration they have received, however, problems persist. For instance, a 2018 study by researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru measured the accuracy of three commercial gender classification algorithms. Buolamwini and Gebru found that all three algorithms misclassified lighter-skinned males less than 1 percent of the time but misclassified darker-skinned females between 21 percent and 35 percent of the time. The stark discrepancy revealed by Buolamwini and Gebru’s research illustrates the need for care in deploying AI tools, particularly when federal agencies’ uses of such tools are rapidly expanding.For that reason, late last year ACUS convened a committee to identify issues agencies ought to consider when adopting, procuring, or modifying AI tools and when developing procedures for their use and regular monitoring. The committee included dozens of ACUS members, along with experts from academia and the private sector with relevant knowledge in different aspects of agency use of AI. The committee drew on two ACUS commissioned reports to inform the committee’s research: one report by law professors Daniel Ho, David Freeman Engstrom, Catherine Sharkey, and Supreme Court of California Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and the other report by University of Pennsylvania law professor Cary Coglianese. The committee convened four times, worked through several draft statements, and ultimately produced a ten-page statement that ACUS adopted during its December plenary session. The ACUS statement provides a series of factors for agencies to consult when making decisions about AI tools. ACUS divided the statement into nine subsections: transparency, harmful bias, technical capacity, obtaining AI systems, data, privacy, security, decisional authority, and oversight. Each section covers a different set of issues agencies will confront in many decisions about AI tools. Within each of the nine subsections, the statement identifies specific risks, and suggests strategies for mitigating them.Recognizing the various types of AI tools and the wide array of uses, the statement stops short of instructing agencies about specific tools or methods to employ in addressing particular problems. It respects that agencies might reasonably emphasize different considerations in making decisions about whether or how to use AI tools. Agencies may, for example, have different priorities and constraints, or need to employ the technologies for different purposes.For instance, in the section on decisional authority, ACUS does not prescribe a definitive test for ascertaining when an agency has delegated too much decision-making responsibility to an AI tool. Instead, it highlights the real risks that come with relying on an AI tool to make certain decisions. Those risks include the possibility that human operators will devolve too much responsibility to, or place too much trust in, the digital tools. The public in some instances might react negatively to having certain decisions made by AI tools instead of humans. The ACUS statement is clear that agencies ought to consider these risks when making decisions about what AI tools to deploy and how to deploy them, but it is silent about how agencies ought to balance those risks against countervailing considerations such as efficiency and predictability in decision-making. The “right” way to manage those tradeoffs is, ultimately, a question of policy, to be decided on an agency-by-agency basis. ACUS’s goal in adopting its statement is simply to make it more likely that agencies will resolve the policy questions related to their use of artificial intelligence with a more comprehensive understanding of the many different values at stake in decisions about AI tools.There will be those who wish the statement provided more precise and tailored guidance about the right and wrong ways to use specific AI tools or even the circumstances in which they should be deployed. But the committee made a conscious choice to avoid those questions. Agencies’ uses of AI tools are developing rapidly, as are the tools themselves. Recommendations aimed at specific practices or existing technologies would have a comparatively short shelf life. By contrast, ACUS grounded its statement in familiar administrative law principles—such as transparency, accountability, and reason-giving—and familiar objectives of agency administration—such as ensuring privacy and security and building institutional capacity. ACUS intends the statement to remain relevant and useful for as long as those key principles and objectives do.If agencies are attentive to the considerations laid out in the statement, they will make better and more informed decisions about AI tools, be more alert to the many considerations and values at stake in selecting, obtaining, and deploying AI tools, and be better equipped to monitor and understand the consequences of deploying AI tools in different environments. The statement should help agencies use artificial intelligence tools in ways that maximize their potential benefits and reduce the attendant risks. Given the growing ubiquity of AI in federal agencies, that is an outcome everyone should hope for. Mark Thomson is a deputy research director at the Administrative Conference of the United States.

DURHAM, N.C. --  An artificial intelligence tool being developed by Duke scientists can be added to the standard toilet to help analyze patients’ stool and give gastroenterologists the information they need to provide appropriate treatment for chronic issues such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
The work is being done by Duke University’s Center for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Infectious Disease (WaSH-AID), and was presented Saturday at the virtual conference Digestive Disease Week 2021.
“Typically, gastroenterologists have to rely on patient self-reported information about their stool to help determine the cause of their gastrointestinal health issues, which can be very unreliable,” said Deborah Fisher, MD, associate professor of medicine at Duke University and one of the lead authors on the study.
“Patients often can’t remember what their stool looks like or how often they have a bowel movement, which is part of the standard monitoring process,” Fisher said. “The Smart Toilet technology will allow us to gather the long-term information needed to make a more accurate and timely diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal problems.” 
For example, a flare of IBD could be diagnosed using Smart Toilet and response to a drug or diet treatment could be monitored. If the technology were installed in bathrooms in a long term care facility, initial diagnosis of acute conditions could be improved.
The technology can be retrofitted within the pipes of an existing toilet. Once a person has a bowel movement and flushes, the toilet will take an image of the stool within the pipes. The data collected over time will provide a gastroenterologist a better understanding of a patient’s stool form (i.e., loose, normal or constipated) and the presence of blood, allowing them to diagnose the patient and provide the right treatment for their condition.
To develop the artificial intelligence image analysis tool for the Smart Toilet, researchers analyzed 3,328 unique stool images found online or provided by research participants. All images  were reviewed and annotated by gastroenterologists according to the Bristol Stool Scale, a common clinical tool for classifying stool. Using a convolutional neural network, a type of deep learning algorithm that can analyze images, researchers found that the algorithm accurately classified the stool form 85 percent of the time and gross blood detection was accurate in 76 percent of the images.
“We are optimistic about patient willingness to use this technology because it’s something that can be installed in their toilet’s pipes and doesn’t require the patient to do anything other than flush,” said Sonia Grego, PhD, founding director of the Duke Smart Toilet Lab and a lead researcher on the study. “This could be especially useful for patients who may not be able to report their conditions, such as those who live in a long-term care facility.”
The prototype has promising feasibility, but it is not yet available to the public. Researchers are developing additional features of the technology to include stool specimen sampling for biochemical marker analysis that will provide highly specific disease data to meet the needs of patients and gastroenterologists.

A storm cell near Oklahoma City was likely to turn into a thunderstorm around the time Flight 1405 took off, and the airspace north of Amarillo would be closed for military exercises. Better to reroute, the young colleague said, suggesting an alternative that Ward admitted was safer and more efficient. The entire conversation lasted just seconds and passed without a word being spoken: a red box lit up on Ward’s computer screen when the colleague, an artificial intelligence program he has affectionately nicknamed Algo, had an idea. “This is the smartest person in the room,” says Ward, a solidly built man with the corner desk who has been a flight dispatcher for 21 years, responsible for planning flight routes and submitting them to air traffic control for approval. He gestures to the program running silently on his computer. “It’s smarter than me.”Read more: Airlines’ Emissions Halved During the Pandemic. Can the Industry Preserve Some of Those Gains?Algo’s formal name is Flyways, and it’s the product of a Silicon Valley company called Airspace Intelligence, which is hoping to make air travel more efficient and safer as airlines try to recover from a year in which the pandemic ravaged the travel industry. The idea of AI setting paths for jets streaking through the skies at hundreds of miles per hour might sound terrifying, but Flyways does not dictate—it advises, and humans always have the final say. This is a job Ward used to do alone by flipping through tabs on his computer screen and guessing where a flight would be when it encountered rough weather or other conditions. Now he has Algo, who dispenses advice, never gets tired, doesn’t get sick and is always in the office. Its machine learning enables Flyways to spot weather threats and other potential problems before humans are aware of them, which helps dispatchers and pilots avoid stressful last-minute changes. Once, when a government website showing restricted airspace went offline, Algo remembered which areas were usually closed to commercial flights at certain times and planned routes accordingly.Alaska Airlines dispatcher Brad Ward at work at his monitor at Alaska Airlines' Network Operations Center in Seattle on May 14, 2021. Ward is one of dozens of flight dispatchers trained to work alongside a new artificial intelligence program designed to make flights more efficient.Chona Kasinger for TIMEFor all the fears that artificial intelligence will replace our jobs, the more common application of AI in the workplace today is as a colleague, like Algo is to Ward. It can search CT scans for early signs of lung cancer, alerting radiologists to lesions they may have overlooked. It can come up with millions of possible designs for a chair working within parameters provided by designers. It can analyze an applicant’s body language and voice tone in interviews, speeding up the hiring process. A growing number of workers are interacting with multiple forms of AI as they go about their jobs every day.“A man/machine collaboration will do better than just a man or just a machine,” says Pedro Domingos, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington. Deep Blue, an IBM program, may have beaten Gary Kasparov at chess, he says, but “centaur chess teams,” in which humans worked with AI, beat both humans and machines. “It’s not that people will be out of jobs, it’s that they will use computers to do their jobs more,” Domingos says.The sky is really the big untapped opportunity.Of course, as workers become more productive, companies may need fewer of them doing the same job. Transport aircraft used to have as many as five people in the cockpit in the 1940s; now commercial planes have two. Some workers will have to learn new skills as their jobs change. Companies closed call centers during the pandemic and deployed AI chatbots, for example, in many cases leaving customer service agents to deal with complicated questions that the chatbots couldn’t answer; they were also needed to train and supervise the chatbots.Phillip Buckendorf, the 30-year-old CEO and co-founder of Airspace Intelligence, came up with the idea for Flyways after visiting a flight dispatch center. Like most people, he figured it would look something like Star Trek, with complicated computer systems helping dispatchers guide planes through the skies. Buckendorf instead found that many dispatch centers looked like accounting firms from the 1990s. Dispatchers often relied on paper printouts to see weather forecasts and figured out wind speeds by decoding strings of letters and numbers on a federal website.Phillip Buckendorf, Airspace Intelligence CEO and co-founder and Pasha Saleh, Alaska Airlines flight operations strategy and innovation director.Chona Kasinger for TIMEBuckendorf, a lanky German who had been working for a self-driving car company, liked the idea of applying to planes in flight the same kind of technology that teaches cars to avoid traffic jams or double-parked vehicles. “You have this incredibly dynamic environment where you want to predict— where are you going to be in the airspace? And what does the environment look like? And how do you optimize for that?” says Buckendorf, who camped out at the Alaska Airlines dispatch center in Seattle for months alongside his co-founders, collaborating with dispatchers like Brad Ward to build Flyways. He approached various airlines with his idea but says Alaska was the quickest to agree to a trial, and in May 2020 it began using Flyways on all of its continental flights for a six-month trial. During that time, the AI found an opportunity to reduce flight times and fuel on 64% of the flights, says Pasha Saleh, Alaska Airlines’ director of strategy and innovation. It cut an average of 5.3 minutes off each Alaska Airlines flight, saving a total of 480,000 gallons of fuel and avoiding 4,600 tons of carbon emissions. (Aircraft fuel consumption varies and has improved over the years, but large jetliners can burn anywhere from 600 to 750 gallons of fuel an hour. According to one study, a person flying on a round-trip trans-Atlantic flight accounted for about 1.6 tons of carbon emissions.) The airline, which gave TIME an exclusive look at how the system operates from the dispatchers’ and pilots’ point of view, is now rolling out Flyways to all of its flights, including the ones that go to Alaska and Hawaii, and while it would not say how much it pays for the program, the reduced flight times and fuel consumption seen in the trial could translate to millions of dollars in savings in the long run. In terms of places to improve efficiency, “the sky is really the big untapped opportunity,” says Saleh.Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis with the iPad containing the kind of data pilots once had to cart around in heavy suitcases filled with paper.Chona Kasinger for TIMEOn a recent Friday, Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis scrolled through an iPad outside Gate D4 at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, reviewing the route for Flight 1258 to San Francisco. Pullis, who was wearing small airplane stud earrings, wanted to be sure the Airbus 321 she was piloting wasn’t going to encounter bad weather. Flyways, working in tandem with Ward, had found the most efficient route, which would take Pullis west of the Puget Sound, past waypoints ETCHY and PYE near Point Reyes, and into San Francisco from the west.This is just a huge enhancement to what we do.Pullis climbed into the cockpit, a silver shell of panels, switches and levers, and uploaded the route into the plane’s system, using an iPad in a rose-colored case. It’s a far cry from just 10 years ago, when pilots like Pullis dragged around 35-pound suitcases filled with paper flight manuals. Ward texted her a greeting, using the ever-evolving technology that would enable him to stay in touch with Pullis throughout the trip and offer assistance if needed.“This is just a huge enhancement to what we do,” says Ward, whose desk looks out onto a parking garage, a Silver Dollar casino, and the Seattle airport a mile away, where Pullis was preparing for flight.Read more: Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic. AI and Robots Are Replacing Them Faster Than EverNot every human/AI relationship is as harmonious as Ward’s and Algo’s, either. A warehouse worker who is told where to walk and what packages to pick by an AI algorithm may find that AI makes the job more physically grueling and stressful. And assuming that AI will be a good colleague has repercussions. Experts said as early as 2017 that AI could diagnose pneumonia better than a radiologist could, which led to a shortage of radiologists being trained, says Gary Marcus, a NYU professor who co-wrote the book Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust. Yet that AI software is still years from being deployed on a large scale. Companies that use AI to screen loan or mortgage applications often incorporate bias, making it more expensive for Black and Latino families to get loans. Police departments that use AI for facial recognition have wrongfully arrested Black men when the software mistakenly identified them as suspects. Because humans design AI, they can feed their own biases into the algorithms, such as when an AI recruiting tool designed by Amazon discriminated against female applicants.Alaska Airlines Captain Kat Pullis boards Flight 1258, heading from Seattle to San Francisco.Chona Kasinger for TIMEBut AI is here to stay, and an AI colleague or colleagues can be an advantage as pandemic-era cutbacks force employees to take on extra tasks, all the while dealing with the distractions—think Slack, emails, instant messaging and video meetings—of the modern workplace. AI transcribed the interviews I did for this story, replied to emails scheduling those interviews, and alerted me to spelling errors in my draft. In the transportation industry in particular, automation and AI could help address impending labor shortages; as people venture out of lockdown and air traffic picks up, experts predict a pilot shortage. The trucking industry is already experiencing driver shortages. That’s before drones and unmanned aircraft make the airspace even more crowded, necessitating more dispatchers and air traffic controllers.Each time you board a commercial flight in the U.S., there is a flight dispatcher somewhere who has plotted your route. Commercial airplanes must pass over a number of “waypoints”—essentially geographic coordinates with names like IKPIF or KUJEF—as they go from Point A to Point B. The dispatcher chooses which waypoints a flight should hit, then submits the plan to air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who either approve or deny the route.There's no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into one place at one time.The algorithm from Flyways draws on data from past flights and current and predicted conditions to run through millions of route possibilities, and it reruns the process every few minutes for every flight. A red box lights up on the dispatcher’s screen if Flyways suggests a flight should be rerouted because of weather or safety issues; a green box lights up if a re-route is suggested for fuel efficiency; purple means a flight needs to be routed around restricted airspace.The predictive nature of Flyways can help dispatchers avoid things that they can’t see. If it knows that a storm cell in a geographic area usually grows or moves in a certain direction, it can find a new path before that storm shows up on weather maps. If many pilots have reported turbulence on their flights, it can map that turbulence and route other flights to avoid it. If it knows that many flights are planning to approach Seattle from the north later in the day, it may suggest approaching the airport from the south to avoid congestion. “There’s no way humans can grasp how to handle 20 or 30 airplanes going into a place at one time,” says Ward, who stands, in khakis and a green polo shirt, in front of the four monitors he uses to do his job. “You can have everyone on what you think is an optimal route, but then you create a traffic jam.”Network Operations Center at Alaska Airlines Hub in SeaTac, Wash. on May 14, 2021.Chona Kasinger for TIMEFlyways also shows Ward flights that can be slowed down for “network efficiency,” indicating how making one flight arrive later could help four other flights land earlier.Sometimes, Flyways suggests routes that Ward would never have tried. That’s when his judgement comes in handy. The FAA prefers that most flights from the east coast to the northwest go over Cleveland, for example, because this avoids traffic jams. If Flyways suggests a different route, Ward will often reject it because he knows that the FAA won’t accept it. If Flyways decides a flight can go close to a storm because there’s a strong chance the storm will dissipate, Ward may reject that route as too risky. Dispatchers accepted 32% of Flyways recommendations during the Alaska Airlines trial period, but that is expected to increase as Flyways memorizes dispatchers’ choices. Algo is already learning to plot more routes over Cleveland.“Humans will always be better at making the decisions. And the computer will always be better at supporting those decisions with good information.” says Ward, a self-described nerd who used to spend countless hours trying to find the best routes for his flights.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Could Help Solve America’s Impending Mental Health CrisisAlaska hopes to eventually use Flyways to figure out which flights have a lot of passengers making connections when they land, and to slow down other flights so that the connecting passengers can land on time. It could eventually tell Ward which planes have passengers transferring from one flight to another, so he can put them at adjoining gates. Alaska has 67 full-time dispatchers, and all are now trained to use Flyways. Airspace Intelligence says it is actively working with “multiple U.S. airlines” to deploy Flyways in their operations centers. Over time, if AI helps Ward make customers’ flight experiences more pleasant and less expensive, more people will fly, Domingos says, creating the need for more dispatchers.That’s what happened in the banking industry initially when ATMs were introduced. More people started using banks, so more branches were opened. The number of tellers increased, and their jobs evolved as they spent less time doling out cash and more time offering financial advice to customers. Now, the number of bank tellers is falling, but the number of financial advisors is projected to grow over the next decade.Flight 1258 to San Francisco International Airport via the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport prepares to depart on May 14.Chona Kasinger for TIMEAI has long been creeping into airspace. So many parts of piloting an airplane are done by computers that some pilots spend as little as three minutes actually “flying” the plane, says Mary “Missy” Cummings, a Duke professor who directs the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke Robotics and who was one of the Navy’s first female fighter pilots. Manufacturers are talking about designing passenger planes for only one pilot. As companies add drones and autonomous vehicles to the airspace, artificial intelligence will become more essential, Cummings says. There are already “near-misses” at airports because of heavy traffic, and that’s before drones begin flying at different speeds and levels, she says. “We’ll never be able to integrate unmanned vehicles without automation,” she says. That doesn’t mean humans won’t be needed, though—in aviation, there are always times when something unexpected like a thunderstorm or a flock of geese requires a human reaction. Besides, passengers want to know there is a human involved who will share their fate if something happens to the plane, says Cummings. There’s a reason it is comforting to walk by the cockpit when you board a plane. As Captain Pullis prepared to take off for San Francisco, she came on the plane’s loudspeaker, introducing herself and telling the passengers that their flight would be an hour and 33 minutes and they’d be cruising at 33,000 feet. She reminded them to keep their masks on and then added something very human. “I just want to let you know — I am so happy to see all your beautiful, wonderful eyes—it’s been a rough year,” Pullis said.

Technology advances faster each day, and it has a significant impact on many spheres. One of the biggest steps in technical development is artificial intelligence (AI). With AI’s help, many processes can be automatized, and it simplifies the work for difficult trades such as metallurgy, building, book printing, and others. When students learn artificial intelligence, they often like to describe their understanding of this subject in academic works. 
But when it comes to the process of writing about AI it becomes confusing. Writing an essay about AI takes a lot of time and effort. That is why a lot of students eventually prefer to buy college essay in order to get a clear, understandable, and engaging piece of writing. The difficulties of writing about AI come with its widespread use. Artificial intelligence is gradually coming to all branches of human activity, making ordinary software complexes intelligent: medicine and health care, online retail, politics, industry, gaming, education, and more.
Indeed, the field is interesting. But students might have trouble engaging the audience and presenting their ideas clearly. Thus, many of them are looking for a paper service out of fear of not meeting academic standards. After all, one has to structure their paper logically and adhere to certain formatting guidelines. 
Moreover, each student should avoid plagiarism and provide enough supporting details for their essay.
Often they don’t know how to do it properly and ask special writing services like WritingCheap for assistance. Otherwise, they can research online for more information or read our article with prominent tips on how to write an essay on AI effortlessly.
1. Choose a topic.
Firstly, you must research where AI is used and why it is beneficial for humanity. This helps you select the most interesting topic for your project and come up with a central idea. There are many fields AI is used in today, so go through the various aspects to choose the most engaging topic for your essay. Believe it or not, but when you write an essay on a subject you are barely engaged in, readers will also not be interested in the content. You can consider one of these themes and develop them with your imagination:
Applications of AI.Emotions, awareness, and consciousness in AI machines.Decision-making systems.Chess programs and their method of reacting to situations.AI and transport.Popular AI-based software.Natural language processing (NLP) and AI usage.How AI can be used in healthcare.Will AI replace human resources in all industries?AI and language: how can AI technologies be helpful for people worldwide?
2. Provide an engaging introduction.
Beginning your essay, consider writing it with your whole heart. Make sure you’ve chosen an interesting topic so you can engage your reader. Try to start from a general fact or unique idea that came to your mind while brainstorming. Like any academic essay, the starting point of an introduction on AI consists of a hook, thesis statement, and three key points which reveal your research method. An essay introduction about AI should have five-six sentences maximum and be a length of 100-150 words. Indeed, it depends on the overall volume, so remember that the introduction is no more than 10-20% of the entire essay.
3. Write a valuable body.
The body is 80% of the entire essay, so it should have enough ground for discussion. Include such elements as topic sentences and reveal them with evidence from sources. While researching, note down important information you can add during the writing process. Even if you are writing an essay on AI for the first time, remember that the first draft always matters.
Create three body paragraphs that are relevant to your topic and thesis statement. In the first one, you can reveal the first position toward the thesis. Provide strong support from valuable sources such as a book, scientific article, or video. Make sure you format all quotes correctly to avoid plagiarizing content. Indeed, your essay can contain more than three paragraphs, but we are providing the most common academic writing requirements.
4. Conclude logically.
Coming up with a concise and meaningful conclusion for an AI essay is sometimes more overwhelming than it seems at first sight. For instance, students can step away from the main idea and start to discuss something new. We caution not to begin any new conversation at the end of your essay because it only distracts the readers and makes your teacher lower your grade.
The summary is the final point of your essay that should confirm the content you’ve written in the essay and present the last thoughts concerning it. While writing an argumentative essay on artificial intelligence, tell your readers why your work is valuable and what your opinion means to other scholarly researchers.
5. Edit as if you are doing it for the last time.
Imagine that you have only one chance to improve your issues, so you spend your time editing more productively. When you focus on your text, you have a better understanding of what you’ve written about. With this attitude, you can see better which parts suit the overall context and which ones you should consider cutting. Concentrate on grammatical, punctuation, and spelling issues to prevent misunderstandings.
Indeed, the subject of AI represents a solid scientific discipline where students need to sort out different technological definitions. Still, you don’t need to depict complex statements which you don’t get yourself. Explain everything as simply as you would teach a first-grade kid from elementary school, and the reader will evaluate your diligence.
6. Format your essay according to the instructions.
As with any essay on computing science or technology, your work on AI should be formatted according to strict requirements. Formatting style includes instructions on fonts, title page, indents, margins, additional elements (picture, tables, graphs, figures, calculations, code, etc.), citations, and references list. Try to check everything before sending it to your teacher; otherwise, your essay could be rejected.
When you reference all quotes correctly and redirect the reader to cited works in the list, you save your AI essay from plagiarism. A reader can distinguish your opinion from evidence taken by different authors, so consider formatting seriously.
7. Keep it simple.
Instead of trying to connect yourself to the smart researchers’ community (we are sure you are smart), try to avoid long sentences and big words. Usually, it looks like the student pretends to be more serious, and it spoils everything. Let your reader understand your outlook even if you have to explain a complex subject with simple words. As we said earlier, try to speak to your reader through the lens of an elementary school teacher. Sometimes it is better to sound simpler but confident than smarter but vague. Anyway, if you have a perfect essay idea and individual approach, it doesn’t matter which definitions you use to deliver information to your reader. The main thing is it should be easy to understand.
8. Make it unique.
Don’t repeat after others because AI is an excellent field for new findings! As we said in the previous tip, if your essay maintains an original idea, it would be interesting for the reader to get into it. Think about AI as a field that is new to all humankind. It is actually new to us, so describe it in your essay. Having a first draft is a great point to analyze where you have borrowed content and your own personal outlook. It is not bad if you rely on someone’s works or cite other scientists, but it is more valuable to include unique findings in your project.
9. Read more literature and watch other researchers.
Check your essay one more time concerning repeated thoughts and hypotheses. You can compare the literature you’ve used to write an AI essay with other documents, articles, videos, and books that you haven’t included yet. It doesn’t mean you should rewrite your essay; you can always understand where to move forward.
An essay about AI is not only about training your writing skills and checking your knowledge, but it is a great first step to a practical scientific career. Find out how others explore the topic you work on and see how you can improve your approach. Try not to add like/dislike opinions towards someone’s findings; note down valuable quotes from discussions to place them in your further research.
10. Finally: make it happen!
Anyway, every student dreams of being recognizable in the scientific community, so try to write your AI essay like you are the first person to explore this discipline. At this last stage, we recommend turning back to the very first tip, where you should choose an engaging topic. Don’t underestimate this advice because you can significantly simplify your writing process if you choose a subject you are interested in. Show your work to a tutor, peer, or find an AI expert who works in this field. Ask for their advice and consider them while continuing work on your project.

May 25, 2021 - Healthcare is ripe for innovation and disruption through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and revenue cycle management might be one of the strongest use cases for this type of technology.
Revenue cycle management is a complex and oftentimes manual process. But even when provider organizations tap technology to streamline their revenue cycles, staff are generally hindered by fragmented systems and a lack of enterprise solutions, according to a recent KLAS and Center for Connected Medicine survey of health system leaders.
But revenue cycle management was one of the most cited responses when asked about areas for planned AI use, second only to virtual assistant applications.
Healthcare organizations have attempted to implement AI to streamline key revenue cycle tasks.
“Integrating artificial intelligence into an RCM solution allows us to have data driven approaches to automate each step in the process, whether it's when that first letter is going out, that first contact is happening, or that payment is going into a payment plan. Each step, there's a model supporting that decision which helps a person to take the right action at the right time,” says Greg Allen, senior director of data science and product management at Ontario Systems.
The technology has proven to work with revenue cycle tasks, such as prior authorizations, claim status verifications, and claims denial management, to name a few. However, the use of this technology in revenue cycle management is still maturing. Strong use cases now include innovative AI solutions that optimize accounts receivable management by identifying and directing account follow-up, finding patterns that maximize success. But the potential for AI in revenue cycle management is rapidly expanding.
Perhaps the strongest case for AI in revenue cycle management being used today is the capability to understand people to optimize collections in the era of high deductibles.
AI for patient financial responsibility
Patient financial responsibility is at an all-time high. Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported a 111 percent increase in the burden of deductibles across all covered workers. Meanwhile, over half of patients responding to a 2020 HealthCareInsider.com survey said they worry about out-of-pocket healthcare costs leading to household bankruptcy.
The growing burden of patient financial responsibility is having a major impact on healthcare, even preventing people from accessing the care they need. Revenue cycle leaders are also finding that they do not have the tools to address this growing burden, which is also slowing the entire collections process.
AI technology is poised to help providers accelerate patient collections while ensuring a positive experience for patients.
“Using data to understand people is a very strong use case because when you can understand a person and their financial position, you can help them and work with them all while providing a positive experience when they are in a difficult position,” says Allen.
“Maybe it's to understand when you should be contacting someone or what kind of individualized payment plan they should be provided based on their unique situation.”
But creating consumer profiles to optimize the patient financial experience is very difficult at scale, Allen adds.
“That's why we’ve leveraged technology to be able to do assist,” Allen says.
AI technology can create and analyze personalized consumer profiles at scale—a capability many organizations do not have because of resource restraints. By pulling data from disparate data sources, including third-party sources, the technology can identify patterns of behavior for every patient and direct staff to create a personalized financial experience for them, whether it be calling them in the morning because they work nights, emailing them a secure link to a digital statement because they prefer electronic communications, or even not contacting them at all because they frequently use the patient portal on their own to pay medical bills.
“From a data science perspective, if I can't understand my consumer and closely replicate the world around them, then I can't succeed,” adds Allen.
AI has the potential to increase revenue through collections while improving the patient experience and aligning it more with the customized billing solutions available across other industries, such as banking and retail. These patient experience improvements also carry their own financial benefits, if only provider organizations overcome privacy and security concerns.
Misunderstanding, trepidation, and concern about patient privacy have been barriers to AI implementation in the data-heavy world of healthcare. But they don’t have to be anymore.
Overcoming the challenges of AI implementation
Three-quarters of healthcare insiders are worried about the data security and privacy aspects associated with implementation of AI and machine learning tools, a 2020 KPMG survey shows. However, 86 percent of respondents to the survey said they are taking steps to protect patient privacy as they implement AI. Furthermore, the technology is evolving from “black box” technologies, which lack the ability to understand how decisions are made, into transparent and explainable solutions, providing deeper insight and accountability for the revenue cycle.
“We practice something called ‘explainable AI’ or ‘xAI’ to create auditability into our models and into the decision-making process so that we can reproduce our results and provide feedback, along with a clear explanation for why a decision was made,” Allen says.
“That is incredibly important in order to create widespread adoption across this industry, and others, as well, because we can't have a black box solution or hide behind the veil of proprietary technology. Being able to explain what we're doing in a digestible way is another way we combat the existing lack of transparency.”
Building customer profiles for optimized patient collections and experience carries its own risk since many solutions pull from credit bureaus and other third-party data sources containing personally identifying information (PII). This PII significantly increases the risk of a data breach, putting both providers and patients at risk of a costly security event.
AI technologies can pull from alternative data sources, reducing the risk of data misuse and expanding the methods in determining a patient’s propensity to pay, preferred payment methods, and more.
Future of AI in revenue cycle management
With explainable AI, technology has the potential to foster patient relationships, not take away from the human experience in healthcare. AI empowers human decision-making, enabling technology to take over redundant tasks so staff can get to know patients and their preferences. And revenue cycle management is ripe for this type of innovation.
“By having people spend less time on an individual account, by providing more information and insight in order to be more productive, we are able to save costs,” Allen states. “And it doesn't need to be through the reduction of personnel.”
In addition to privacy and security, many stakeholders fear AI will replace humans in the workplace. However, the technology is actually helping revenue cycle staff work more efficiently by supporting their workflows and allowing them to tackle accounts needing more human intervention.
In a world of falling margins and high-deductible health plans, increasing efficiency in revenue cycle management is paramount. And AI can be leveraged to drive business intelligence to communicate more effectively with patients.
“By incorporating AI into the backend financial aspect of the patient experience, providers have the opportunity to create a better business for themselves while simultaneously improving the patient experience, allowing all parties to benefit without losing sight of their human sides,” Allen states.

 Is Nigeria ready for Artificial Intelligence in schools? 


                            23rd May 2021                        









                                By  Jesusegun Alagbe 


Kindly share this story:

  








 

        In the past, artificial intelligence was just something relegated to science fiction propagated by books and movies.
Self-driving cars, a toothbrush that tells you the best way to brush your teeth, a voice recognition software that unlocks your phone, your face unlocking your laptop and other devices – all these were only scenes from sci-fi books and movies.
By way of definition, the American technology giant International Business Machines Corporation defines AI as referring to any human-like intelligence exhibited by a computer, robot, or other machines.
In popular usage, AI refers to the ability of a computer or machine to mimic the capabilities of the human mind – learning from examples and experience, recognising objects, understanding and responding to language, making decisions, solving problems – and combining these and other capabilities to perform functions a human might perform, such as greeting a hotel guest or driving a car. 






IBM notes that the surge in AI development is made possible by the sudden availability of large amounts of data and the corresponding development and wide availability of computer systems that can process all that data faster and more accurately than humans can.
Today, AI is completing our words as we type them, providing driving directions when we ask, vacuuming our floors, and recommending what we should buy or binge-watch next. AI is driving applications that help skilled professionals do important work faster and with greater success.
AI has come to life and is part of our everyday lives. It has disrupted and will continue to have tremendous impacts across sectors, including education.        
Speaking of AI and education, it is said that AI educational solutions are continuously maturing, filling the gaps in learning and teaching and allowing schools and teachers to do more.
According to Market Research Engine, a global market research and consulting organisation based in the United States, the global AI in the education market will reach $5.8bn by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 45 per cent.
The following are, therefore, five ways AI is changing the education industry as well as how institutions and educators can benefit from it.
Task automation
According to Ideamotive, a software company based in Warszawa, Poland, AI has shown great potential in automating administrative work and making the tasks of schools and teachers easier.
Normally, teachers have to manage numerous administrative and organisational tasks besides managing the classroom environment. They need to evaluate homework, mark tests/exams, manage teaching materials, and make periodic progress reports, and more.
In fact, a survey by Ideamotive reveals that teachers spend only about 43 per cent of their time on real teaching and the rest on non-teaching tasks.     
This is where AI can be quite handy as it has the power to grade tests and manage administrative work, taking a huge load off of teachers’ shoulders.
Smart content
Smart content refers to different types of virtual content, including digitised guides of textbooks, video conferencing, and video lectures.
Robots can now improve the learning experience by creating customisable learning interfaces and digital content that apply to students of different grades.
The robots are able to make the content easily digestible by dividing it into comprehensible chunks, highlighting important lesson stuff, summarising key points, and more.
Personalised learning
A study by Rand Corporation, a global policy think tank shows that customised learning can improve student performance no matter what their starting level is.  
As every student has a different approach to learning and teachers don’t have the time to personalise their teaching methods and provide one-on-one sessions for every student, AI can be of great help.
AI can do much more than making content easily digestible. It is also capable of giving recommendations to students and teaching them based on the difficulties they are facing in different lectures.

Such tools can also help teachers track each student’s progress and provide data that can help to create materials that are relevant for each student.
24/7 assistance
In the traditional environment, students have to wait until they are in class to ask their teachers any questions. Not anymore!
Now, there are various AI-powered chatbots created specifically for the education sector.
These chatbots serve as round-the-clock assistants that students can consult with anywhere and at any time. This allows the students to get quick and relevant answers or solutions without having to wait for the next class or office hours.     
Secure online exams
Today, many institutions and universities around the globe use AI-powered assessment tools to carry out tests or exams online.
AI can allow limiting the availability and creating different groups with a selection of random questions for each student so as to prevent cheating. This saves teachers lots of time and avoids the risk of human error.
Is Nigeria ready?
With the COVID-19 pandemic, the deployment of AI infrastructures is now much more inevitable as face-to-face meetings are being largely discouraged.
However, a Professor of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computing and Engineering Sciences, Babcock University, Ogun State, Oludele Awodele, says the infrastructures required to support AI are not yet available.
Awodele says there is a need for “intentional” efforts in creating an enabling environment for AI to work.        
He says, “Talking about education, with the new order (in terms of COVID-19 pandemic), one of the impacts is that people now know that they don’t need to meet face-to-face before they deliver or listen to lectures, and some of the tools being used relate to the concept of artificial intelligence. For example, if I give my students an assignment or an exam, machines can mark it.
“But the problem we are facing as a country is infrastructure, which cuts across every other sector. The infrastructures required to support AI generally are not available. I’m not sure we even have a standard AI laboratory, though we have people in this field who are ready to put in their efforts to ensure we get there. I think the government may have seen that, which is why they came up with the communication and digital economy initiative.”
Also speaking with Sunday PUNCH, the acting Head, Department of Computer Science at the University of Ibadan, Dr Ibiyinka Ayorinde, says AI will definitely impact education in Nigeria.
“With AI, you can trace the activities of your students and know who comes to class and who is absent; who has done your assignment and who hasn’t; when a student logs into the system. AI helps you know if your students are participating in class,” she says.
However, when asked if Nigeria is ready for AI’s disruption of the education sector, Ayorinde says the country is not fully ready.
She says, “We are both ready and unready when it comes AI’s role in education. We are in-between in the sense that it depends on a lot of factors. For instance, more than 70 per cent of students cannot adjust to the technology right now because of the level of poverty in Nigeria. Many students are indigent and cannot afford smartphones. For those who have access to smartphones, what about data availability?
“We have to be sincere, the infrastructures are not on the ground for both teachers and students. Let’s say they struggle to buy devices and data, what about network issues? Sometimes during learning, you have to switch between various networks and yet you get frustrated.”    ,,
