But as AI and automation becomes increasingly capable, how will this alternative labor source affect your future workforce? In this article, we&#039;ll take a look at both some optimistic and pessimistic views of the future of our jobs amidst increasing AI capabilities.    Technology-driven societal changes, like what we&#039;re experiencing with AI and automation, always engender concern and fear—and for good reason. A two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30 percent of the world’s current human labor. McKinsey suggests that, in terms of scale, the automation revolution could rival the move away from agricultural labor during the 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently, the explosion of the Chinese labor economy.     McKinsey reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely. How could such a shift not cause fear and concern, especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populations?     The Brookings Institution suggests that even if automation only reaches the 38 percent means of most forecasts, some Western democracies are likely to resort to authoritarian policies to stave off civil chaos, much like they did during the Great Depression. Brookings writes, “The United States would look like Syria or Iraq, with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war, violence, or theft.” With frightening yet authoritative predictions like those, it&#039;s no wonder AI and automation keeps many of us up at night.       “Stop being a Luddite”    The Luddites were textiles workers who protested against automation, eventually attacking and burning factories because, “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood.” The Luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811, so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from new.    When fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce, a typical response is thus to point to the past; the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfounded.    In 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace them.    Frame Breaking — The Luddites    So what happened?    Despite these fears and concerns, every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed. When particular tasks are automated, becoming cheaper and faster, you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated.    “During the Industrial Revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated, prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do, such as operating a machine, and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly. This caused output to grow explosively. In America during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50, and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98%. This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it, which in turn created more jobs for weavers: their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900. In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.” — The Economist, Automation and Anxiety    Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Bright Future?    Looking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process.        Beyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.    “Simply put, jobs that robots can replace are not good jobs in the first place. As humans, we climb up the rungs of drudgery — physically tasking or mind-numbing jobs — to jobs that use what got us to the top of the food chain, our brains.” — The Wall Street Journal, The Robots Are Coming. Welcome Them.    By eliminating the tedium, AI and automation can free us to pursue careers that give us a greater sense of meaning and well-being. Careers that challenge us, instill a sense of progress, provide us with autonomy, and make us feel like we belong; all research-backed attributes of a satisfying job.    And at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. By applying AI analysis to data from satellite images, this barrier can be surmounted, focusing aid most effectively.        Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Dark Future.    I am all for optimism. But as much as I’d like to believe all of the above, this bright outlook on the future relies on seemingly shaky premises. Namely:    The past is an accurate predictor of the future.We can weather the painful transition.There are some jobs that only humans can do.    The past isn’t an accurate predictor of the future    As explored earlier, a common response to fears and concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is to point to the past. However, this approach only works if the future behaves similarly. There are many things that are different now than in the past, and these factors give us good reason to believe that the future will play out differently.    In the past, technological disruption of one industry didn’t necessarily mean the disruption of another. Let’s take car manufacturing as an example; a robot in automobile manufacturing can drive big gains in productivity and efficiency, but that same robot would be useless trying to manufacture anything other than a car. The underlying technology of the robot might be adapted, but at best that still only addresses manufacturing    AI is different because it can be applied to virtually any industry. When you develop AI that can understand language, recognize patterns, and problem solve, disruption isn’t contained. Imagine creating an AI that can diagnose disease and handle medications, address lawsuits, and write articles like this one. No need to imagine: AI is already doing those exact things.    Another important distinction between now and the past is the speed of technological progress. Technological progress doesn’t advance linearly, it advances exponentially. Consider Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years.     In the words of University of Colorado physics professor Albert Allen Bartlett, “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” We drastically underestimate what happens when a value keeps doubling.    What do you get when technological progress is accelerating and AI can do jobs across a range of industries? An accelerating pace of job destruction.    “There’s no economic law that says ‘You will always create enough jobs or the balance will always be even’, it’s possible for a technology to dramatically favour one group and to hurt another group, and the net of that might be that you have fewer jobs” —Erik Brynjolfsson, Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy        In the past, yes, more jobs were created than were destroyed by technology. Workers were able to reskill and move laterally into other industries instead. But the past isn’t always an accurate predictor of the future. We can’t complacently sit back and think that everything is going to be ok.    Which brings us to another critical issue ...    The transition will be extremely painful    Let&#039;s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future; jobs will be eliminated but more jobs will be created to replace them. This brings up an absolutely critical question, what kinds of jobs are being created and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed?    “Low- and high-skilled jobs have so far been less vulnerable to automation. The low-skilled jobs categories that are considered to have the best prospects over the next decade — including food service, janitorial work, gardening, home health, childcare, and security — are generally physical jobs, and require face-to-face interaction. At some point robots will be able to fulfill these roles, but there’s little incentive to roboticize these tasks at the moment, as there’s a large supply of humans who are willing to do them for low wages.” — Slate, Will robots steal your job?        Blue-collar and white-collar jobs will be eliminated—basically, anything that requires middle-skills (meaning that it requires some training, but not much). This leaves low-skill jobs, as described above, and high-skill jobs that require high levels of training and education.    There will assuredly be an increasing number of jobs related to programming, robotics, engineering, etc.. After all, these skills will be needed to improve and maintain the AI and automation being used around us.    But will the people who lost their middle-skilled jobs be able to move into these high-skill roles instead? Certainly not without significant training and education. What about moving into low-skill jobs? Well, the number of these jobs is unlikely to increase, particularly because the middle-class loses jobs and stops spending money on food service, gardening, home health, etc.    The transition could be very painful. It’s no secret that rising unemployment has a negative impact on society; less volunteerism, higher crime, and drug abuse are all correlated. A period of high unemployment, in which tens of millions of people are incapable of getting a job because they simply don’t have the necessary skills, will be our reality if we don’t adequately prepare.    So how do we prepare? At the minimum, by overhauling our entire education system and providing means for people to re-skill.    To transition from 90% of the American population farming to just 2% during the first industrial revolution, it took the mass introduction of primary education to equip people with the necessary skills to work. The problem is that we’re still using an education system that is geared for the industrial age. The three Rs (reading, writing, arithmetic) were once the important skills to learn to succeed in the workforce. Now, those are the skills quickly being overtaken by AI.    For a fascinating look at our current education system and its faults, check out this video from Sir Ken Robinson:    https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en    In addition to transforming our whole education system, we should also accept that learning doesn’t end with formal schooling. The exponential acceleration of digital transformation means that learning must be a lifelong pursuit, constantly re-skilling to meet an ever-changing world.    Making huge changes to our education system, providing means for people to re-skill, and encouraging lifelong learning can help mitigate the pain of the transition, but is that enough?    Are We F*cked? Will All Jobs Be Eliminated?    When I originally wrote this article a couple of years ago, I believed firmly that 99% of all jobs would be eliminated. Now, I&#039;m not so sure. Here was my argument at the time:    The claim that 99% of all jobs will be eliminated] may seem bold, and yet it’s all but certain. All you need are two premises:    We will continue making progress in building more intelligent machines.Human intelligence arises from physical processes.    The first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial. The only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress, of any kind, is some extinction-level event that wipes out humanity, in which case this debate is irrelevant. Excluding such a disaster, technological progress will continue on an exponential curve. And it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is; all that matters is that it will continue. The incentives for people, companies, and governments are too great to think otherwise.    The second premise will be controversial, but notice that I said human intelligence. I didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human”. That human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate: if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence. Though a gloomy example, it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence. A well-placed poke in someone’s Broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speech.    With these two premises in hand, we can conclude the following: we will build machines that have human-level intelligence and higher. It’s inevitable.    We already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks, they can move faster, more precisely, and lift greater loads. When these machines are also as intelligent as us, there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can&#039;t learn to do quickly. Therefore, 99% of jobs will eventually be eliminated.    But that doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;ll be redundant. We&#039;ll still need leaders (unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords) and our arts, music, etc., may remain solely human pursuits too. As for just about everything else? Machines will do it—and do it better.    “But who’s going to maintain the machines?” The machines.“But who’s going to improve the machines?” The machines.    Assuming they could eventually learn 99% of what we do, surely they&#039;ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could.    The above argument is sound, but the conclusion that 99% of all jobs will be eliminated I believe over-focused on our current conception of a &quot;job&quot;. As I pointed out above, there&#039;s no guarantee that the future will play out like the past. After continuing to reflect and learn over the past few years, I now think there&#039;s good reason to believe that while 99% of all current jobs might be eliminated, there will still be plenty for humans to do (which is really what we care about, isn&#039;t it?).    The one thing that humans can do that robots can’t (at least for a long while) is to decide what it is that humans want to do. This is not a trivial semantic trick; our desires are inspired by our previous inventions, making this a circular question. — The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, by Kevin Kelly    Perhaps another way of looking at the above quote is this: a few years ago I read the book Emotional Intelligence, and was shocked to discover just how essential emotions are to decision making. Not just important, essential. People who had experienced brain damage to the emotional centers of their brains were absolutely incapable of making even the smallest decisions. This is because, when faced with a number of choices, they could think of logical reasons for doing or not doing any of them but had no emotional push/pull to choose.    So while AI and automation may eliminate the need for humans to do any of the doing, we will still need humans to determine what to do. And because everything that we do and everything that we build sparks new desires and shows us new possibilities, this &quot;job&quot; will never be eliminated.    If you had predicted in the early 19th century that almost all jobs would be eliminated, and you defined jobs as agricultural work, you would have been right. In the same way, I believe that what we think of as jobs today will almost certainly be eliminated too. But this does not mean that there will be no jobs at all, the &quot;job&quot; will instead shift to determining, what do we want to do? And then working with our AI and machines to make our desires a reality.    Is this overly optimistic? I don&#039;t think so. Either way, there&#039;s no question that the impact of artificial intelligence will be great and it&#039;s critical that we invest in the education and infrastructure needed to support people as many current jobs are eliminated and we transition to this new future.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence - Widespread Job Losses 




Calum McClelland -

In schools, the impact of artificial intelligence and automation is often portrayed in a good light. Think back to learning about the water wheel, mills, printing presses, steam engines, and assembly lines. Often, the underlying narrative is that these were great innovations that reduced the burden of labor on humans. However, the technological advances of our time seem to be less well-received. Perhaps it is because of our proximity to these examples of automation. Our closeness prevents us from seeing only the benefits and instead pushes us to see how much our lives and livelihood will be impacted by artificial intelligence.
McKinsey & Company reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely. How could such a shift not cause fear and concern, especially for the world’s vulnerable countries and populations? 
The Brookings Institution writes of a “new” kind of automation with more advanced robotics and AI that can bring work displacement to college graduates and professionals as much as it has to vehicle drivers and retail workers. 
With frightening yet like these, it’s no wonder AI and automation keep many of us up at night.   
“Stop Being a Luddite”
Although we may remember from our textbooks that the 19th century brought significant innovations to factories, this does not mean that it was welcomed with open arms by the people then. The Luddites were textile workers who protested against automation, eventually attacking and burning factories because “they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood.” The Luddite movement occurred all the way back in 1811, so concerns about job losses or job displacements due to automation are far from new.
When fear or concern is raised about the potential impact of artificial intelligence and automation on our workforce, a typical response is thus to point to the past; the same concerns are raised time and again and prove unfounded.
In 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, the advent of personal computers spurred “computerphobia” with many fearing computers would replace them.

Frame Breaking — The Luddites
So what happened?
Despite these fears and concerns, every technological shift has ended up creating more jobs than were destroyed. When particular tasks are automated, becoming cheaper and faster, you need more human workers to do the other functions in the process that haven’t been automated.

“During the Industrial Revolution, more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated, prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do, such as operating a machine, and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly. This caused output to grow explosively. In America during the 19th century, the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50, and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 percent. This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it, which in turn created more jobs for weavers: their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900. In other words, technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver’s job, and the skills required to do it, rather than replacing it altogether.”

Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Bright Future?
Looking back on history, it seems reasonable to conclude that fears and concerns regarding AI and automation are understandable but ultimately unwarranted. Technological change may eliminate specific jobs, but it has always created more in the process.
Beyond net job creation, there are other reasons to be optimistic about the impact of artificial intelligence and automation.

And at a higher level, AI and automation will also help to eliminate disease and world poverty. Already, AI is driving great advances in medicine and healthcare with better disease prevention, higher accuracy diagnosis, and more effective treatment and cures. When it comes to eliminating world poverty, one of the biggest barriers is identifying where help is needed most. The AI and Global Development Lab is recreating historical and geographical human-development trajectories from satellite images starting from 1984 to measure poverty and the effects of foreign aid. 
Impact of Artificial Intelligence — A Dark Future
I am all for optimism. But as much as I’d like to believe all of the above, this bright outlook on the future relies on seemingly shaky premises. Namely:

The past is an accurate predictor of the future.
We can weather the painful transition.
There are some jobs that only humans can do.

The Transition Will Be Extremely Painful
Let’s pretend for a second that the past actually will be a good predictor of the future; artificial intelligence will impact some jobs but more jobs will be created to replace them. This brings up an absolutely critical question, what kinds of jobs are being created, and what kinds of jobs are being destroyed?

In addition to transforming our whole education system, we should also accept that learning doesn’t end with formal schooling. The exponential acceleration of digital transformation means that learning must be a lifelong pursuit, constantly re-skilling to meet an ever-changing world.
Making huge changes to our education system, providing means for people to re-skill, and encouraging lifelong learning can help mitigate impact of artificial intelligence, but is that enough?
Are We F*cked? Will All Jobs Be Eliminated?
When I originally wrote this article a couple of years ago, I believed firmly that 99 percent of all jobs would be eliminated. Now, I’m not so sure. Here was my argument at the time:
The claim that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated may seem bold, and yet it’s all but certain. All you need are two premises:

We will continue making progress in building more intelligent machines.
Human intelligence arises from physical processes.

The first premise shouldn’t be at all controversial. The only reason to think that we would permanently stop progress, of any kind, is some extinction-level event that wipes out humanity, in which case this debate is irrelevant. Excluding such a disaster, technological progress will continue on an exponential curve. And it doesn’t matter how fast that progress is; all that matters is that it will continue. The incentives for people, companies, and governments are too great to think otherwise.
The second premise will be controversial, but notice that I said human intelligence. I didn’t say “consciousness” or “what it means to be human.” That human intelligence arises from physical processes seems easy to demonstrate: if we affect the physical processes of the brain we can observe clear changes in intelligence. Though a gloomy example, it’s clear that poking holes in a person’s brain results in changes to their intelligence. A well-placed poke in someone’s Broca’s area and voilà—that person can’t process speech.
With these two premises in hand, we can conclude the following: we will build machines that have human-level intelligence and higher. It’s inevitable.
We already know that machines are better than humans at physical tasks, they can move faster, more precisely, and lift greater loads. When these machines are also as intelligent as us, there will be almost nothing they can’t do—or can’t learn to do quickly. Therefore, 99 percent of jobs will eventually be eliminated.
But that doesn’t mean we’ll be redundant. We’ll still need leaders (unless we give ourselves over to robot overlords) and our arts, music, etc., may remain solely human pursuits too. As for just about everything else? Machines will do it—and do it better.
“But who’s going to maintain the machines?” The machines.“But who’s going to improve the machines?” The machines.
Assuming they could eventually learn 99 percent of what we do, surely they’ll be capable of maintaining and improving themselves more precisely and efficiently than we ever could.
The above argument is sound, but the conclusion that 99 percent of all jobs will be eliminated I believe over-focused on our current conception of a “job.” As I pointed out above, there’s no guarantee that the future will play out like the past. After continuing to reflect and learn over the past few years, I now think there’s good reason to believe that while 99 percent of all current jobs might be eliminated, there will still be plenty for humans to do (which is really what we care about, isn’t it?).

“The one thing that humans can do that robots can’t (at least for a long while) is to decide what it is that humans want to do. This is not a trivial semantic trick; our desires are inspired by our previous inventions, making this a circular question.”
-The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, by Kevin Kelly
Perhaps another way of looking at the above quote is this: a few years ago I read the book Emotional Intelligence, and was shocked to discover just how essential emotions are to decision-making. Not just important, but essential. People who had experienced brain damage to the emotional centers of their brains were absolutely incapable of making even the smallest decisions. This is because, when faced with a number of choices, they could think of logical reasons for doing or not doing any of them but had no emotional push/pull to choose.
So while AI and automation may eliminate the need for humans to do any of the doing, we will still need humans to determine what to do. And because everything that we do and everything that we build sparks new desires and shows us new possibilities, this “job” will never be eliminated.
If you had predicted in the early 19th century that almost all jobs would be eliminated, and you defined jobs as agricultural work, you would have been right. In the same way, I believe that what we think of as jobs today will almost certainly be eliminated too. But this does not mean that there will be no jobs at all, the “job” will instead shift to determining, what do we want to do? And then working with our AI and machines to make our desires a reality.
Is this overly optimistic? I don’t think so. Either way, there’s no question that the impact of artificial intelligence will be great and it’s critical that we invest in the education and infrastructure needed to support people as many current jobs are eliminated and we transition to this new future.

The creative AI revolution has sparked fascination and fear in equal measure. Could AI be exploited to cut costs, to demand more work in less time, to make sectors such as design even more precarious or to automate the easiest tasks? In this image, a teamLab exhibition in Beijing, China in 2017. (Pan zhiwang/Imaginechina via AFP)
At a concert organised by the University of Oregon, artificial intelligence named EMI managed to deceive its audience by passing off its musical compositions as pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach himself. In New York, a computer programme wrote a novel from start to finish inspired by Jack Kerouac’s legendary On the Road. In Paris, Edmond de Belamy, a portrait painted by an artificial neural network, was auctioned for thousands of euros.
As new and groundbreaking as all this may seem, it is actually part of the prehistory of artificial intelligence (AI). Both the auction and the publication of the novel took place five years ago, in 2018, but algorithms like that of EMI have been in development since the 1980s. The obsession with creating a machine in the image of the human brain, an intelligence capable of calculating, reasoning or even creating artistic works goes back a long way. In recent years, however, steps have been taken at such a speed that the line of what we thought was inconceivable has shifted.
In 2022, AI programmes such as Dall-E2, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion surprised us with their ability to create unprecedented, instantaneous and astonishingly realistic images from a simple text description: from cowboys on the moon to cubist versions of The Girl with a Pearl Earring or recreations of the French Revolution as seen through a fisheye lens. Others, like GPT-3, demonstrated their ability to write complex texts and original poems within seconds.

Just as EMI was able to imitate Bach, there are algorithms that can compose their own melodies, illustrate comic books or write scripts for short films.

Such algorithms are capable of defeating human ingenuity in an artistic contest, as one of their mechanical predecessors did against an unbeatable chess player, Kasparov.
The creative AI revolution has sparked a wave of fascination, but also fear, and not without reason: if 56 per cent of today’s jobs are already threatened by automation, could artists, designers and creative professionals be next in line? And to what extent is artificial creativity capable of making human creativity obsolete?
Where does artificial creativity come from?
Like the human brain, artificial intelligence-based programmes have their own networks of neurons – artificial neurons. Huge amounts of data are stored in them, which are then analysed, classified and recombined. This is how ideas are hatched.
“The big leap in artificial intelligence came a few years ago with the development of deep learning. The support was acquired to train deep networks within very short timeframes so that they could not only analyse data but also learn from their own experience,” Karina Gibert, director of the IDEAI-UPC artificial intelligence research centre and one of Spain’s leading specialists in this field, tells Equal Times. “We call it creative intelligence, because it is able to take separate elements acquired through learning and combine them to generate something new.”
One example is the Edmond de Belamy portrait, created by AI after analysing 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries. Another is The Next Rembrandt project, which, after studying 300 works by the Dutch painter, is capable of painting new works recreating his style. The same procedure is followed by programmes such as Dall-E – a fusion of the name of Pixar’s WALL-E robot and Salvador Dalí – which create images from text. The user writes what they want to see and the AI searches its database and designs several versions within a very short space of time.
AI’s strongest critics accuse it of copying, of practising a sophisticated form of plagiarism. But what it does is not very different, in fact, from the unconscious process developed by the human brain. As Margaret Boden, a leading figure in artificial intelligence, explains, new thoughts that originate in the mind are not likely to be completely new but rooted in representations that already exist . The fact that machines have learned to replicate part of our creative process does not mean that they can emulate it in its entirety.

“There is an element of creativity that cannot be automated,” María Luisa Sanz de Acedo, professor of psychology specialising in thinking skills and creativity, tells Equal Times.

“Some call it subjectivity, others life energy, spirituality. AI can simulate some human behaviour, but that complex inner world is beyond its reach.”
Pablo Sanguinetti, author and researcher on artificial creativity, agrees. “AI doesn’t imagine, feel, have consciousness or understand the world,” he explains. “These systems do one thing extraordinarily well: processing large amounts of information and extracting patterns from that apparent chaos; but what defines creativity with a capital ‘C’ is the human capacity to break free from those patterns, reject them or re-signify them. I’m not sure machines are capable of this yet.”
Tool or threat?
Cristina de Propios is a Spanish artist and designer. She has been focused on innovation since the very start of her career, combining art and robotics. It was only a matter of time before she moved towards artificial intelligence. “When the Belamy painting was sold, it really grabbed my attention. I asked myself ‘how can a machine make art’, but before criticising it I decided to give it a try.”
Her latest project consists of “living canvases” made up of cellular automata that, thanks to deep learning, create different compositions and movements each time. “This technology is very interesting in terms of the visual possibilities it offers and its surprising results. It’s a kind of augmented creativity,” says the artist, who insists on highlighting the importance of the human factor. “AI doesn’t understand what is beautiful or harmonious. It is like a small child that you teach based on what you know.”
Like her, a growing number of creators are using artificial intelligence as creative tools. “The results the machines generate by combining data can act as a stimulus in the creator’s working memory,” says creativity expert María Luisa Sanz de Acedo. In other words, AI can provide resources to avoid having to start from a blank canvas.

“Just as some people go to the sea and others read books, AI can also be a source of inspiration,” explains computer scientist Karina Gibert.

In sectors such as design, however, they do not necessarily see it as favourably. The fear is that the possibilities offered by these advances could be exploited to cut costs, demand more work in less time, to make their sector even more precarious or to automate the simplest tasks. “I think some jobs are definitely at risk,” says Abel Guzmán, a graphic designer. “As with other technological advances, new professions will emerge. There will be people who specialise, who learn to understand how AI thinks, and how to direct it. Personally, in my case, I think I only have two options: to train or be left behind.”
Reskilling, he points out, will not necessarily be easy, especially in a sector that is evolving so fast and where it is difficult to compete with new generations. This is the reason behind the recent protests by creative professionals, such as the manifestos posted on social media, where some have created their own seal to identify their works as AI-free. “I can understand that,” says Guzmán. “Many of these people are older or have a very purist view of the profession. They’ve seen the dangers on the horizon. It’s true, though, that we offer something artificial intelligence cannot. AI produces results but it doesn’t talk to the client, it doesn’t know the emotional charge of a project. If you are looking for a mechanical job, you can ask AI to do it, but if you want a more human, more empathetic job, you should know that you won’t pay the same as to someone who only has a computer farm.”
AI and new myths
The debate over AI’s impact on employment is not the only dilemma presented by creative artificial intelligence tools. The matter of who owns the copyright to these works, for example, remains pending. Is it the AI itself, the person who gives it the instructions, the creators of the works from which it draws its inspiration, or the computer scientist who developed it?

“The rise of a new creative technique not only introduces new forms of production, it also changes the very idea of what art is,” says researcher Pablo Sanguinetti.

“You just have to think about photography, cinema, the printing press. There is always a degree of anxiety at such times: the fear that the technique will replace the artist.” It is the same story already told by science fiction – from Blade Runner to Frankenstein – hundreds of times.
“The fear that people used to have of fate, of gods, of providence, has shifted to a fear of ourselves, of our world of objects. The myths surrounding artificial intelligence are like those that used to surround saints, such as the power to perform miracles,” Fernando Broncano, professor of philosophy at the Carlos III University in Madrid, tells Equal Times.
For the professor, there is no sense in fearing machines, or in thinking that we are fundamentally very different from them. “We are already part machine. The human species is as much a product of its biology as of its technical environment, its tools, its medicines.”
“Life is the greatest example of creativity that exists,” the philosopher recalls. “For example, a storm can produce a change in the environment, it can generate something new, but it is the human being – society – that gives it value, that decides what to do with it. The focus of our thinking should not therefore be on what differentiates us from machines but what we want to do with them.”

Although not yet released due to copyright issues, MusicLM is a signal of what’s to come in using AI to generate music from text descriptions.

What is the impact of taking all the musical know-how and ingesting into an AI brain with only asking questions expressing your musical tastes? Who needs to be a musician to entertain when we will soon be able to create our own music even more easily and tap into the human genius of every muscian that has a recording?


Google researchers say MusicLM is based on a model generating high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as ""a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff"". You can find the details on GitHub.

MusicLM is built on a neural network, and trained on a large music data set of over280,000 hours of music, enabling it to automatically produce innovative music tracks of diverse instruments, genres, and concepts based on text descriptions.

PROMOTED
Essentially, if an AI attempts to mimic a human brain by ingested all the musical patterns, and sound frequencies that it is exposed to. One only needs to search for AI-generated Carti tracks on YouTube to listen to this type of technology like Digital Butterflies.
Like a magic word wand, MusicLM can more accurately produce higher quality fidelity audio, you can even hum a melody to train the AI algorithm to get the right beat you want to hear. According to Google researchers, the model generates music at 24kHz that remains consistent over several minutes.according to researchers. Google researchers have also published an AI training dataset of 5,500 pieces of music to support others researchers working on automated song generation.

This is indeed a sign of what’s to come in the music world. We must answer harder questions and build strategies for effective policy and legal legislation like:


What is the risk of AI algorithms creating their own compositions and work, and who owns this work that AI or the human?
Who owns the music when it’s a blend of everything on the world wide web and creates a new song from the brilliance of our musician’s?
When you purchase music, are you also purchasing the right to use its audio as an AI training data?

Since YouTube sensation and American Idol, Taryn Southern, started composing music with AI, musicians globally are trying to understand the impacts of AI on musicians.
What is clear is that we need to improve our legislation in regards to ownership of musician’s music and understand how AI algorithms should be treated and managed in the musical industry.

Although Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and many other AI market leaders will continue to advance the frontiers of every industry using AI. We as humans have an ethical responsibility to think harder about the world we want to create and leave for future generations.
If you are a Board Director or CEO or C-Level in the Musical Industry, learning more about AI is a business imperative to understand the long term effects of AI in the musical industry and shaping the world you want to protect as “human brains and musical talent” have value and we are rapidly commoditizing precious creative DNA into bits and bytes that will have major impacts to our musicians’ creative ownership entitlements.
At least ask the hard question and do some scenario risk analysis?
Note: 
To support future research, Google has also publicly released MusicCaps, a dataset composed of 5.5k music-text pairs, with rich text descriptions provided by human experts.

Best known for its ability to generate long-form written content in response to user input prompts, Cobbs expected the tool to produce a nuanced and thoughtful response to his specific research directions. Instead, his screen produced a generic, poorly written paper he’d never dare to claim as his own.
“The quality of writing was appalling. The phrasing was awkward and it lacked complexity,” Cobbs says. “I just logically can’t imagine a student using writing that was generated through ChatGPT for a paper or anything when the content is just plain bad.”
Not everyone shares Cobbs’ disdain. Ever since OpenAI launched the chatbot in November, educators have been struggling with how to handle a new wave of student work produced with the help of artificial intelligence. While some public school systems, like New York City’s, have banned the use of ChatGPT on school devices and networks to curb cheating, universities have been reluctant to follow suit. In higher education, the introduction of generative AI has raised thorny questions about the definition of plagiarism and academic integrity on campuses where new digital research tools come into play all the time.
Make no mistake, the birth of ChatGPT does not mark the emergence of concerns relating to the improper use of the internet in academia. When Wikipedia launched in 2001, universities nationwide were scrambling to decipher their own research philosophies and understandings of honest academic work, expanding policy boundaries to match pace with technological innovation. Now, the stakes are a little more complex, as schools figure out how to treat bot-produced work rather than weird attributional logistics. The world of higher education is playing a familiar game of catch-up, adjusting their rules, expectations, and perceptions as other professions adjust, too. The only difference now is that the internet can think for itself.
Hipchen is not alone in her speculation. Alice Dailey, chair of the Academic Integrity Program at Villanova University, is also grappling with the idea of classifying an algorithm as a person, specifically if the algorithm involves text generation.
Dailey believes that eventually professors and students are going to need to understand that digital tools that generate text, rather than just collect facts, are going to need to fall under the umbrella of things that can be plagiarized from.
Although Dailey acknowledges that this technological growth incites new concerns in the world of academia, she doesn’t find it to be a realm entirely unexplored. “I think we’ve been in a version of this territory for a while already,” Dailey says. “Students who commit plagiarism often borrow material from a ‘somewhere’—a website, for example, that doesn’t have clear authorial attribution. I suspect the definition of plagiarism will expand to include things that produce.”
Eventually, Dailey believes, a student who uses text from ChatGPT will be seen as no different than one that copies and pastes chunks of text from Wikipedia without attribution.
“Calling the use of ChatGPT to pull reliable sources from the internet ‘cheating’ is absurd. It’s like saying using the internet to conduct research is unethical,” Gelman says. “To me, ChatGPT is the research equivalent of [typing assistant] Grammarly. I use it out of practicality and that’s really all.” Cobbs expressed similar sentiment, comparing the AI bot to “an online encyclopedia.”
But while students like Gelman use the bot to speed up research, others take advantage of the high-capacity prompt input feature to generate completed works for submission. It might seem obvious what qualifies as cheating here, but different schools across the country offer contrasting takes.
According to Carlee Warfield, chair of Bryn Mawr College’s Student Honor Board, the school considers any use of these AI platforms as plagiarism. The tool’s popularization just calls for greater focus in evaluating the intent behind students’ violations. Warfield explains that students who turn in essays entirely produced by AI are categorically different from those who borrow from online tools without knowledge of standard citations. Because the ChatGPT phenomenon is still new, students’ confusion surrounding the ethics is understandable. And it's unclear what policies will remain in place once the dust settles—at any school.
In the midst of fundamental change in both the academic and technological spheres, universities are forced to reconsider their definitions of academic integrity to reasonably reflect the circumstances of society. The only problem is, society shows no stagnance.
“Villanova’s current academic integrity code will be updated to include language that prohibits the use of these tools to generate text that then students represent as text they generated independently,” Dailey explained. “But I think it’s an evolving thing. And what it can do and what we will then need in order to keep an eye on will also be kind of a moving target.”
In addition to increasingly complex questions about whether ChatGPT is a research tool or a plagiarism engine, there’s also the possibility that it can be used for learning. In other educational settings, teachers see it as a way to show students the shortcomings of AI. Some instructors are already modifying how they teach by giving students assignments bots couldn’t complete, like those that require personal details or anecdotes. There’s also the matter of detecting AI use in students’ work, which is a burgeoning cottage industry all its own.
Ultimately, Dailey says, schools may need rules that reflect a range of variables.
“My guess is that there will be the development of some broad blanket policies that essentially say, unless you have permission from a professor to use AI tools, using them will be considered a violation of the academic integrity code,” Dailey says. “That then gives faculty broad latitude to use it in their teaching or in their assignments, as long as they are stipulating explicitly that they are allowing it.”
As for ChatGTP, the program agrees. “Advances in fields such as artificial intelligence are expected to drive significant innovation in the coming years,” it says, when asked how schools can combat academic dishonesty. “Schools should constantly review and update their academic honor codes as technology evolves to ensure they are addressing the current ways in which technology is being used in academic settings.”
But, a bot would say that.",tags,,"Sofia BarnettCultureJan 30, 2023 1:21 PMChatGPT Is Making Universities Rethink PlagiarismStudents and professors can’t decide whether the AI chatbot is a research tool—or a cheating engine.Photograph: Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveIn late December of his sophomore year, Rutgers University student Kai Cobbs came to a conclusion he never thought possible: Artificial intelligence might just be dumber than humans. After listening to his peers rave about the generative AI tool ChatGPT, Cobbs decided to toy around with the chatbot while writing an essay on the history of capitalism. Best known for its ability to generate long-form written content in response to user input prompts, Cobbs expected the tool to produce a nuanced and thoughtful response to his specific research directions. Instead, his screen produced a generic, poorly written paper he’d never dare to claim as his own. “The quality of writing was appalling. The phrasing was awkward and it lacked complexity,” Cobbs says. “I just logically can’t imagine a student using writing that was generated through ChatGPT for a paper or anything when the content is just plain bad.” Cheat CodeChatGPT Is Coming for Classrooms. Don't PanicPia CeresIdeasChatGPT Stole Your Work. So What Are You Going to Do?Nick Vincent and Hanlin LiIdeasChatGPT Isn’t the Only Way to Use AI in EducationNabeel GillaniNot everyone shares Cobbs’ disdain. Ever since OpenAI launched the chatbot in November, educators have been struggling with how to handle a new wave of student work produced with the help of artificial intelligence. While some public school systems, like New York City’s, have banned the use of ChatGPT on school devices and networks to curb cheating, universities have been reluctant to follow suit. In higher education, the introduction of generative AI has raised thorny questions about the definition of plagiarism and academic integrity on campuses where new digital research tools come into play all the time. Featured VideoHow A.I. Is Changing HollywoodMake no mistake, the birth of ChatGPT does not mark the emergence of concerns relating to the improper use of the internet in academia. When Wikipedia launched in 2001, universities nationwide were scrambling to decipher their own research philosophies and understandings of honest academic work, expanding policy boundaries to match pace with technological innovation. Now, the stakes are a little more complex, as schools figure out how to treat bot-produced work rather than weird attributional logistics. The world of higher education is playing a familiar game of catch-up, adjusting their rules, expectations, and perceptions as other professions adjust, too. The only difference now is that the internet can think for itself. According to ChatGPT, the definition of plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work or ideas without giving proper credit to the original author. But when the work is generated by something rather than someone, this definition is tricky to apply. As Emily Hipchen, a board member of Brown University’s Academic Code Committee, puts it, the use of generative AI by students leads to a critical point of contention. “If [plagiarism] is stealing from a person,” she says, “then I don’t know that we have a person who is being stolen from.”Hipchen is not alone in her speculation. Alice Dailey, chair of the Academic Integrity Program at Villanova University, is also grappling with the idea of classifying an algorithm as a person, specifically if the algorithm involves text generation.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenDailey believes that eventually professors and students are going to need to understand that digital tools that generate text, rather than just collect facts, are going to need to fall under the umbrella of things that can be plagiarized from. AdvertisementAlthough Dailey acknowledges that this technological growth incites new concerns in the world of academia, she doesn’t find it to be a realm entirely unexplored. “I think we’ve been in a version of this territory for a while already,” Dailey says. “Students who commit plagiarism often borrow material from a ‘somewhere’—a website, for example, that doesn’t have clear authorial attribution. I suspect the definition of plagiarism will expand to include things that produce.” Eventually, Dailey believes, a student who uses text from ChatGPT will be seen as no different than one that copies and pastes chunks of text from Wikipedia without attribution. Students’ views on ChatGPT are another issue entirely. There are those, like Cobbs, who can’t imagine putting their name on anything bot-generated, but there are others who see it as just another tool, like spellcheck or even a calculator. For Brown University sophomore Jacob Gelman, ChatGPT exists merely as a convenient research assistant and nothing more.“Calling the use of ChatGPT to pull reliable sources from the internet ‘cheating’ is absurd. It’s like saying using the internet to conduct research is unethical,” Gelman says. “To me, ChatGPT is the research equivalent of [typing assistant] Grammarly. I use it out of practicality and that’s really all.” Cobbs expressed similar sentiment, comparing the AI bot to “an online encyclopedia.”But while students like Gelman use the bot to speed up research, others take advantage of the high-capacity prompt input feature to generate completed works for submission. It might seem obvious what qualifies as cheating here, but different schools across the country offer contrasting takes.According to Carlee Warfield, chair of Bryn Mawr College’s Student Honor Board, the school considers any use of these AI platforms as plagiarism. The tool’s popularization just calls for greater focus in evaluating the intent behind students’ violations. Warfield explains that students who turn in essays entirely produced by AI are categorically different from those who borrow from online tools without knowledge of standard citations. Because the ChatGPT phenomenon is still new, students’ confusion surrounding the ethics is understandable. And it's unclear what policies will remain in place once the dust settles—at any school.In the midst of fundamental change in both the academic and technological spheres, universities are forced to reconsider their definitions of academic integrity to reasonably reflect the circumstances of society.

Lil Snack & GamesBeat


GamesBeat is excited to partner with Lil Snack to have customized games just for our audience! We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games now!



Metaphysic made history in 2022 on “America’s Got Talent,” introducing hyperreal generative AI content to a national television audience. The team used AI to create photorealistic avatars of the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley, that delivered musical performances on stage that looked perfectly real.
The performances captured the world’s attention, along with leaders in the entertainment industry, including CAA and Los Angeles-based film and television studio Miramax.



“Metaphysic are industry leaders in using generative AI and machine learning to create photorealistic Hollywood-quality content, combined with their ethics-first approach and thought leadership they unlock an incredible opportunity for the entertainment industry and beyond,” said Joanna Popper, chief metaverse officer at CAA, in a statement. “Artificial intelligence will have a transformative impact on content creation and intellectual property. CAA has always been at the forefront of new technological frontiers and we are excited to work with Metaphysic in bringing the most exciting opportunities to our clients and the industry.”
Testament to its technical and creative excellence, Metaphysic has been named the sole AI provider for the highly-anticipated major motion picture Here, produced by Miramax and directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, this adaptation of Richard McGuire’s graphic novelreunites the original Oscar-winning team behind “Forrest Gump,” along with Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly.advertisement
In an industry-first, Here incorporates hyperreal AI-generated face replacements and de-ageing into the very fabric of its storytelling. 
“I’ve always been attracted to technology that helps me to tell a story. With HERE, the film simply wouldn’t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic’s AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible! Having tested every flavor of face replacement and de-aging technology available today, Metaphysic are clearly the global leaders in feature-quality AI content and the perfect choice for this incredibly challenging, emotional film,” said Robert Zemeckis, in a statement.advertisement
Building on its industry-leading generative AI technology for Hollywood, Metaphysic is announcing its new product, Metaphysic Live. Being deployed in production on Here, Metaphysic’s new tool creates high-resolution photorealistic faceswaps and de-ageing effects on top of actors’ performances live and in real-time without the need for further compositing or VFX work. Streaming AI-generated photorealistic content that maps onto real-world scenes at up to 30 frames per second is a dramatic advance in the technology that will be essential to creating immersive AR/VR, gaming and entertainment experiences. 
Kevin Baillie, Production Visual Effects Supervisor on Here says, “It is incredible to see Metaphysic’s AI-generated content flawlessly integrated into a shot live on set! The actors can even use the technology as a ‘youth mirror’ – testing out acting choices for their younger selves in real-time. That feedback loop and youthful performance is absolutely essential in achieving an authentic, delightful result.”
“Metaphysic is rapidly expanding the creative horizons of Hollywood and beyond. Our tools are cost-effective, movie-quality and scalable – we are being forced to reimagine how visual media is produced,”said Thomas Graham, CEO of Metaphysic, in a statement. “With the support of CAA and by working on projects like Here, Metaphysic is demonstrating the transformative power of hyperreal AI to shape the future of entertainment and to eventually help people create AI-generated, photorealistic immersive content while they own and control their data.”
To build upon its incredible technical offering, Metaphysic is currently hiring additional talent to bolster its machine learning, VFX, and product innovation teams. Qualified candidates are encouraged to reach out to Metaphysic.
Metaphysic has appointed creative team leaders, cofounder Chris Ume as AI Supervisor and recently hired Chief Innovation Officer Jo Plaete – as visual effects supervisor for Here.

The development and growing popularity of ChatGPT shows artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to compete with humans for jobs one day, experts say.
ChatGPT, an AI text generator released to the public last November, has quickly garnered widespread attention for its ability to produce ideas for song lyrics, poems and scripts. It also remembers previous texts so users can ask follow-up questions in a conversational way.Recent reports suggest ChatGPT has the potential to pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam and perhaps earn an MBA from an Ivy League business school. A U.S. politician last week even delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives written by the AI bot.  Story continues below advertisement



 These developments represent the potential AI has not only to be integrated into the workforce, but to possibly even oust humans from some jobs performed today, said Varun Mayya, CEO of software building company Avalon Scenes.

How ChatGPT is impacting learning





“At some point, it’s going to be something that is competing with you in the white-collar workforce,” Mayya told Global News.“I don’t think it’s limited to just white collar, though. I think eventually it’s going to be everything.” 


				ChatGPT may threaten ‘intellectual labour’			

ChatGPT is distinct for being able to generate material of varying expertise, ranging from high school to university-level compositions, while other online tools typically can only fix grammar, tone and clarity.  Story continues below advertisement



 It was developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based startup that works closely with Microsoft.ChatGPT can be practically anything the user makes of it — it can take on the role of a chef and provide recipes, make business plans for marketers, create press releases for public relations specialists or give advice like a therapist.Several research papers recently examined the potential ChatGPT possesses. In a white paper titled “Would Chat GPT3 Get a Wharton MBA?,” University of Pennsylvania Prof. Christian Terwiesch gave it a final exam for an operations management course at the Wharton School of Business and found that the chatbot would have earned a B to B-.

“Technology hasn’t put everybody out of a job yet, but it does put some people out of a job, and this one’s really interesting because most of the job replacement that’s happened as a result of technological development has been manual labour — but this is intellectual labour that’s threatened here,” said Brett Caraway, associate professor with the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto, on Global News Radio 640 Toronto last week.

“This could be lawyers, accountants. … It is something new and it will be interesting to see just how disruptive and painful it is to employment and politics.”On Jan. 25, ChatGPT was used by U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss to write a brief, two-paragraph speech on a bill that would create a U.S.-Israel artificial intelligence centre, the Associated Press reported. His staff said they believe it was the first time an AI-written speech was read in Congress.Auchincloss said he prompted the system in part to “write 100 words to deliver on the floor of the House of Representatives” about the legislation. Auchincloss said he had to refine the prompt several times to produce the text he ultimately read.  Story continues below advertisement



 Jobs that involve content creation, like speech writing, can be vulnerable to AI replacement, Mayya said.But he believes that AI can be integrated into the blue-collar workforce, threatening those jobs as well.“You’re going to be able to put this AI inside robotics,” Mayya said.“You have the hardware, which is maybe a robot that’s walking around … and then you’ll have software like ChatGPT or some other models sitting inside that’s driving the robot. Eventually it’s going to come for everything. It’s just a matter of when.” 


				ChatGPT flaws prevent it taking over jobs — for now			

Despite its growing popularity, ChatGPT currently possesses several flaws that mean it won’t be replacing humans in the workforce right away, experts say.The software isn’t accurate all the time. It can write plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, as pointed out by its creator. ChatGPT is powered by generative artificial intelligence, which conjures new content after training on vast amounts of data from various sources, including the Internet.

“Many people have called the Internet a bit of a dumpster fire, and certainly there is a lot of things on the Internet that you probably wouldn’t want to put into a technology that you trusted,” said Katrina Ingram, CEO of Ethically Aligned AI, a social enterprise committed to consulting and educating companies on artificial intelligence.

“ChatGPT has learned the lessons of the prior chat bots and it’s put in place some guardrails, but underneath all of that, there’s still a massive amount of training data that has racist, sexist, objectionable content baked into it because that is part of the Internet, and that is part of the training dataset that went into this product.”When assessing ChatGPT’s performance in the Evidence and Torts section of the Multistate Bar Exam, the authors of the December 2022 paper said its accuracy on all portions of the test was only 50.3 per cent. Its score was still much higher than the 25 per cent baseline expected of random guesses, they noted.  Story continues below advertisement



 In his research, Terwiesch found that ChatGPT ran into trouble with performing basic mathematics, making mistakes in Grade 6 level math that can be “massive in magnitude,” his paper read.ChatGPT doesn’t know the difference yet between accurate and inaccurate information, but it can be taught, Mayya said.“There is a human somewhere sitting down helping ChatGPT, saying, ‘Hey, you’re not supposed to say that,’” he said.“My worry is that today, it looks sort of like a toy, slightly useful in a variety of jobs, but I feel like eventually it’s going to be really powerful.” 


				How can ChatGPT be integrated into society?			

Andrew Piper, a professor at McGill University in the department of languages, literatures and cultures, told Global News that he doesn’t see AI like ChatGPT becoming job replacers right away.  Story continues below advertisement



 Rather, he views them as tools that can be integrated into the workforce.“I see it getting integrated into particular processes or workflows and potentially allowing productivity to increase,” he said.“The idea is that it can kind of enhance what you’re doing and get rid of potentially some of the sort of rote work that slows people down.”For example, Ingram cited a friend who works as a copywriter who has been using generative AI as part of their job. She said it has helped her friend come up with ideas for content creation.If corporations do decide to use these tools in their work, they should be transparent and indicate to the user that AI was involved in the creation of that content, like ingredients on a food label, she explained.However, she questions as to why AI would be used to automate tools used for human expression, like writing.“In the work that I’ve done, in looking at things that get automated, we tend to automate things that we don’t like to do. I find it really curious that we are deciding to automate creating art and writing,” she said.  Story continues below advertisement



 “These are expressions of humanity that I think many people take pleasure in, and so I’m really wondering about that: Why do we want to automate those things in the first place?”

Businesses that develop these technologies need to think about the “social consequences” of their creations when they release them out into the public, Piper said.“This is a developing technology and we have to kind of learn about it, learn with it and study it as we develop policy,” he said.“One thing that’s frustrating as an educator is this thing has just been thrown out there in the world and we’re all running around cleaning up the mess. … Corporations that are developing this technology, applying this technology, really need to think through what the consequences are of the implementation that they’re thinking about.”  Story continues below advertisement

Artificial Intelligence Identifies Long-Overlooked Raphael Masterpiece
A facial recognition analysis found that the faces in a mysterious painting are virtually identical to those in the artist’s “Sistine Madonna”

                Researchers have been studying the 37-inch-long de Brécy Tondo for decades.
              de Brécy Trust



When he bought the painting in 1981, art collector George Lester Winward was sure he’d stumbled upon a genuine Raphael.
The mysterious, 37-inch-long work had no known artist. Looking into the faces of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, Winward noticed an uncanny resemblance to the two figures at the center of another painting: the Sistine Madonna, a 77-inch-long Renaissance masterpiece completed by Raphael around 1513.

Winward became convinced that the same artist was behind both works. But his view was in the minority. Experts thought the painting, now known as the de Brécy Tondo, was more likely a Victorian copy of the Sistine Madonna.
Shortly before his death in 1997, Winward set up the de Brécy Trust, donating his paintings to the organization to allow researchers to continue rooting out their secrets. Scholars have been studying the de Brécy Tondo ever since.
Now, after 40 years of speculation, researchers from the University of Nottingham and the University of Bradford, both in the United Kingdom, have made a breakthrough. Using facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence (A.I.), they have concluded that the painting is “highly likely to be a Raphael masterpiece.”
“Looking at the faces with the human eye shows an obvious similarity, but the computer can see far more deeply than we can, in thousands of dimensions, to pixel level,” says Hassan Ugail, an expert on visual computing at Bradford who developed the A.I. facial recognition system used in the study, in a statement.

The tool is an algorithm trained on millions of images, and Ugail has been working on it since 2002, reports Artnet’s Sarah Cascone. It can quantify how similar one face is to another by comparing features and recognizing patterns.
“These features may be the physical attributes (e.g., shapes, colors and textures of the face) but also include a lot (potentially thousands of features) which cannot be described visually or physically,” Ugail tells CBS News’ Caitlin O’Kane. “In this sense, the analysis carried out through these facial recognition systems can compare two facial images in much greater detail and can outperform humans.”
If two faces are more than 75 percent similar, Ugail considers them identical. In this case, the tool found that the two Madonnas were 97 percent similar, while the two versions of baby Jesus were 86 percent similar.
The de Brécy Tondo is, as the London Times’ Russell Jenkins wrote in 2013, “one of the most talked-about and scientifically tested Renaissance masterpieces.” The A.I. analysis is the latest in a series of discoveries made in the decades researchers have been studying the painting.
One of these finds came about when Howell Edwards, then an expert on molecular spectroscopy at Bradford, concluded that the work was likely a Renaissance painting, not a later copy. By analyzing paint pigments, he found evidence that the work contained certain colors and chemicals that were characteristic of Renaissance art—including massicot, a yellow pigment that wasn’t used after 1700.
Now, says Edwards in the statement, those findings have been “further vindicated by the facial recognition analysis.”
The researchers presented their analysis at the Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in December. Their work will be published in an academic journal later this month.

Quantum Memories uses publicly available quantum computing research data and algorithms from Google A.I. (Artificial intelligence) to explore the possibility of a parallel world by processing approximately 200 million images of nature and landscapes through artificial intelligence.
Anadol, 37, is a digital artist known for using A.I. to turn reams of data into abstract, spectral images, often on a large scale. To do this, it has partnered with companies like Microsoft, MIT, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
His work is also currently being exhibited at MoMA in NYC in an exclusive installation in the Gund Lobby.
The work Quantum Memories that is for sale is part of the Block Art Ventures – BAV (Instagram: @blockartventures) collection.

As the name suggests, generative AI produces or generates text, images, music, speech, code or video. Generative AI is not a new concept, and machine-learning techniques behind generative AI have evolved over the past decade. Deep learning and General Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches have typically been used, but the latest approach is transformers.Have you read?Does this artificial intelligence think like a human?Artificial intelligence - good or bad for public health?Global Risks Report 2023A Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) is a type of large language model (LLM) that uses deep learning to generate human-like text. They are called ""generative"" because they can generate new text based on the input they receive, ""pretrained"" because they are trained on a large corpus of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks, and ""transformers"" because they use a transformer based neural network architecture to process input text and generate output text. Despite the current market downturn and layoffs in the technology sector, generative AI companies continue to receive interest from investors. Stability AI and Jasper, for example, have recently raised $101 million and $125 million, respectively, and investors like Sequoia think the field of generative AI can generate trillions of dollars in economic value. Over 150 start-ups have emerged and are already operating in the space.Generative AI: A timeline of images generated by artificial intelligence Image: Our World in DataEmergent capabilities of generative AI systemsGenerative AI stretches beyond typical natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization and text generation. OpenAI’s latest release ChatGPT, which caused a viral sensation and reached a million users in just five days, has been described as breaking ground in a much broader range of tasks. The use cases currently under discussion include new architectures of search engines; explaining complex algorithms; creating personalized therapy bots, helping build apps from scratch; explaining scientific concepts; writing recipes; and college essays, among others.Text-to-image programs such as Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have the potential to change how art, animation, gaming, movies and architecture, among others, are being rendered. Bill Cusick, creative director at Stability AI, believes that the software is “the foundation for the future of creativity”. Based on a new era of human-machine based cooperation, optimists claim that generative AI will aid the creative process of artists and designers, as existing tasks will be augmented by generative AI systems, speeding up the ideation and, essentially, the creation phase. Beyond the creative space, generative AI models hold transformative capabilities in complex sciences such as computer engineering. For example, Microsoft-owned GitHub Copilot, which is based on OpenAI’s Codex model, suggests code and assists developers in autocompleting their programming tasks. The system has been quoted as autocompleting up to 40% of developers’ code, considerably augmenting the workflow.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWhat are the risks?While generative AI has people excited about a new wave of creativity, there are concerns about the impact of these models on society. Digital artist Greg Rutkowski fears that the internet will be flooded with artwork that is indistinguishable from his own, simply by telling the system to reproduce an artwork in his unique style. Professor of art Carson Grubaugh shares this concern and predicts that large parts of the creative workforce, including commercial artists working in entertainment, video games, advertising, and publishing, could lose their jobs because of generative AI models.Besides profound effects on tasks and jobs, generative AI models and associated externalities have raised alarm in the AI governance community. One of the problems with large language models is their ability to generate false and misleading content. Meta’s Galactica – a model trained on 48 million science articles with claims to summarize academic papers, solve math problems, and write scientific code – was taken down after less than three days of being online as the scientific community found it was producing incorrect results after misconstruing scientific facts and knowledge.This is even more alarming when seen in the context of automated troll bots, with capabilities advanced enough to render obsolete, The Turing Test – which tests a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour similar to or indistinguishable from a human. Such capabilities can be misused to generate fake news and disinformation across platforms and ecosystems.Large models continue to be trained on massive datasets represented in books, articles and websites that may be biased in ways that can be hard to filter completely. Despite substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in the case of ChatGPT, OpenAI acknowledges that their models can still generate toxic and biased outputs.How is generative AI governed?In the private sector, two approaches to the governance of generative AI models are currently emerging. In one camp, companies such as OpenAI are self-governing the space through limited release strategies, monitored use of models, and controlled access via API’s for their commercial products like DALL-E2. In the other camp, newer organizations, such as Stability AI, believe that these models should be openly released to democratize access and create the greatest possible impact on society and the economy. Stability AI open sourced the weights of its model – as a result, developers can essentially plug it into everything to create a host of novel visual effects with little or no controls placed on the diffusion process.In the public sector, little or no regulation governs the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI. In a recent letter to the White House, US Congresswoman Anna Eshoo highlighted ""grave concerns about the recent unsafe release of the Stable Diffusion model by Stability AI”, including generation of violent and sexual imagery. Other issues surround intellectual property and copyright. The datasets behind generative AI models are generally scraped from the internet without seeking consent from living artists or work still under copyright. “If these models have been trained on the styles of living artists without licensing that work, there are copyright implications,” according to Daniela Braga, who sits on the White House Task Force for AI Policy.

Microsoft's GitHub Copilot is involved in a class action lawsuit alleging the system has been built on “software piracy on an unprecedented scale.” Copilot has been trained on public code repositories scraped from the web, which in many cases, are published with licenses that require crediting creators when reusing their code.What's the road ahead?While generative AI is a game-changer on numerous areas and tasks, there is a strong need to govern the diffusion of these models, and their impact on society and the economy more carefully. The emerging discussion between centralized and controlled adoption with firm ethical boundaries on the one hand versus faster innovation and decentralized distribution on the other will be important for the generative AI community in the coming years. This is a task not only reserved for private companies, but which is equally important for civil society and for policymakers to weigh in on. This includes disruption of labour markets, legitimacy of scraped data, licensing, copyright and potential for biased or otherwise harmful content, misinformation, and so on. Only when solid checks and balances are in place can more thoughtful and beneficial expansion of generative AI technologies and products be achieved.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Tech and InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

From steam power and electricity to computers and the internet, technological advancements have always disrupted labor markets, pushing out some jobs while creating others. Artificial intelligence remains something of a misnomer – the smartest computer systems still don’t actually know anything – but the technology has reached an inflection point where it’s poised to affect new classes of jobs: artists and knowledge workers.
Specifically, the emergence of large language models – AI systems that are trained on vast amounts of text – means computers can now produce human-sounding written language and convert descriptive phrases into realistic images. The Conversation asked five artificial intelligence researchers to discuss how large language models are likely to affect artists and knowledge workers. And, as our experts noted, the technology is far from perfect, which raises a host of issues – from misinformation to plagiarism – that affect human workers.
To jump ahead to each response, here’s a list of each: 
Creativity for all – but loss of skills?
Potential inaccuracies, biases and plagiarism
With humans surpassed, niche and ‘handmade’ jobs will remain
Old jobs will go, new jobs will emerge
Leaps in technology lead to new skills


Creativity for all – but loss of skills?
Lynne Parker, Associate Vice Chancellor, University of Tennessee
Large language models are making creativity and knowledge work accessible to all. Everyone with an internet connection can now use tools like ChatGPT or DALL-E 2 to express themselves and make sense of huge stores of information by, for example, producing text summaries.
Especially notable is the depth of humanlike expertise large language models display. In just minutes, novices can create illustrations for their business presentations, generate marketing pitches, get ideas to overcome writer’s block, or generate new computer code to perform specified functions, all at a level of quality typically attributed to human experts.
These new AI tools can’t read minds, of course. A new, yet simpler, kind of human creativity is needed in the form of text prompts to get the results the human user is seeking. Through iterative prompting – an example of human-AI collaboration – the AI system generates successive rounds of outputs until the human writing the prompts is satisfied with the results. For example, the (human) winner of the recent Colorado State Fair competition in the digital artist category, who used an AI-powered tool, demonstrated creativity, but not of the sort that requires brushes and an eye for color and texture. 
While there are significant benefits to opening the world of creativity and knowledge work to everyone, these new AI tools also have downsides. First, they could accelerate the loss of important human skills that will remain important in the coming years, especially writing skills. Educational institutes need to craft and enforce policies on allowable uses of large language models to ensure fair play and desirable learning outcomes. 


Educators are preparing for a world where students have ready access to AI-powered text generators.

Second, these AI tools raise questions around intellectual property protections. While human creators are regularly inspired by existing artifacts in the world, including architecture and the writings, music and paintings of others, there are unanswered questions on the proper and fair use by large language models of copyrighted or open-source training examples. Ongoing lawsuits are now debating this issue, which may have implications for the future design and use of large language models.
As society navigates the implications of these new AI tools, the public seems ready to embrace them. The chatbot ChatGPT went viral quickly, as did image generator Dall-E mini and others. This suggests a huge untapped potential for creativity, and the importance of making creative and knowledge work accessible to all.


Potential inaccuracies, biases and plagiarism
Daniel Acuña, Associate Professor of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder
I am a regular user of GitHub Copilot, a tool for helping people write computer code, and I’ve spent countless hours playing with ChatGPT and similar tools for AI-generated text. In my experience, these tools are good at exploring ideas that I haven’t thought about before. 
I’ve been impressed by the models’ capacity to translate my instructions into coherent text or code. They are useful for discovering new ways to improve the flow of my ideas, or creating solutions with software packages that I didn’t know existed. Once I see what these tools generate, I can evaluate their quality and edit heavily. Overall, I think they raise the bar on what is considered creative. 
But I have several reservations.
One set of problems is their inaccuracies – small and big. With Copilot and ChatGPT, I am constantly looking for whether ideas are too shallow – for example, text without much substance or inefficient code, or output that is just plain wrong, such as wrong analogies or conclusions, or code that doesn’t run. If users are not critical of what these tools produce, the tools are potentially harmful. 
Recently, Meta shut down its Galactica large language model for scientific text because it made up “facts” but sounded very confident. The concern was that it could pollute the internet with confident-sounding falsehoods.
Another problem is biases. Language models can learn from the data’s biases and replicate them. These biases are hard to see in text generation but very clear in image generation models. Researchers at OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, have been relatively careful about what the model will respond to, but users routinely find ways around these guardrails.

Another problem is plagiarism. Recent research has shown that image generation tools often plagiarize the work of others. Does the same happen with ChatGPT? I believe that we don’t know. The tool might be paraphrasing its training data – an advanced form of plagiarism. Work in my lab shows that text plagiarism detection tools are far behind when it comes to detecting paraphrasing.



Plagiarism is easier to see in images than in text. Is ChatGPT paraphrasing as well?

These tools are in their infancy, given their potential. For now, I believe there are solutions to their current limitations. For example, tools could fact-check generated text against knowledge bases, use updated methods to detect and remove biases from large language models, and run results through more sophisticated plagiarism detection tools. 


With humans surpassed, niche and ‘handmade’ jobs will remain
Kentaro Toyama, Professor of Community Information, University of Michigan
We human beings love to believe in our specialness, but science and technology have repeatedly proved this conviction wrong. People once thought that humans were the only animals to use tools, to form teams or to propagate culture, but science has shown that other animals do each of these things. 
Meanwhile, technology has quashed, one by one, claims that cognitive tasks require a human brain. The first adding machine was invented in 1623. This past year, a computer-generated work won an art contest. I believe that the singularity – the moment when computers meet and exceed human intelligence – is on the horizon. 
How will human intelligence and creativity be valued when machines become smarter and more creative than the brightest people? There will likely be a continuum. In some domains, people still value humans doing things, even if a computer can do it better. It’s been a quarter of a century since IBM’s Deep Blue beat world champion Garry Kasparov, but human chess – with all its drama – hasn’t gone away.

In other domains, human skill will seem costly and extraneous. Take illustration, for example. For the most part, readers don’t care whether the graphic accompanying a magazine article was drawn by a person or a computer – they just want it to be relevant, new and perhaps entertaining. If a computer can draw well, do readers care whether the credit line says Mary Chen or System X? Illustrators would, but readers might not even notice. 
And, of course, this question isn’t black or white. Many fields will be a hybrid, where some Homo sapiens find a lucky niche, but most of the work is done by computers. Think manufacturing – much of it today is accomplished by robots, but some people oversee the machines, and there remains a market for handmade products. 
If history is any guide, it’s almost certain that advances in AI will cause more jobs to vanish, that creative-class people with human-only skills will become richer but fewer in number, and that those who own creative technology will become the new mega-rich. If there’s a silver lining, it might be that when even more people are without a decent livelihood, people might muster the political will to contain runaway inequality.


Old jobs will go, new jobs will emerge
Mark Finlayson, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Florida International University
Large language models are sophisticated sequence completion machines: Give one a sequence of words (“I would like to eat an …”) and it will return likely completions (“… apple.”). Large language models like ChatGPT that have been trained on record-breaking numbers of words (trillions) have surprised many, including many AI researchers, with how realistic, extensive, flexible and context-sensitive their completions are.
Like any powerful new technology that automates a skill – in this case, the generation of coherent, albeit somewhat generic, text – it will affect those who offer that skill in the marketplace. To conceive of what might happen, it is useful to recall the impact of the introduction of word processing programs in the early 1980s. Certain jobs like typist almost completely disappeared. But, on the upside, anyone with a personal computer was able to generate well-typeset documents with ease, broadly increasing productivity. 
Further, new jobs and skills appeared that were previously unimagined, like the oft-included resume item MS Office. And the market for high-end document production remained, becoming much more capable, sophisticated and specialized.
I think this same pattern will almost certainly hold for large language models: There will no longer be a need for you to ask other people to draft coherent, generic text. On the other hand, large language models will enable new ways of working, and also lead to new and as yet unimagined jobs. 
To see this, consider just three aspects where large language models fall short. First, it can take quite a bit of (human) cleverness to craft a prompt that gets the desired output. Minor changes in the prompt can result in a major change in the output. 
Second, large language models can generate inappropriate or nonsensical output without warning. 
Third, as far as AI researchers can tell, large language models have no abstract, general understanding of what is true or false, if something is right or wrong, and what is just common sense. Notably, they cannot do relatively simple math. This means that their output can unexpectedly be misleading, biased, logically faulty or just plain false.  
These failings are opportunities for creative and knowledge workers. For much content creation, even for general audiences, people will still need the judgment of human creative and knowledge workers to prompt, guide, collate, curate, edit and especially augment machines’ output. Many types of specialized and highly technical language will remain out of reach of machines for the foreseeable future. And there will be new types of work – for example, those who will make a business out of fine-tuning in-house large language models to generate certain specialized types of text to serve particular markets. 
In sum, although large language models certainly portend disruption for creative and knowledge workers, there are still many valuable opportunities in the offing for those willing to adapt to and integrate these powerful new tools.


Leaps in technology lead to new skills
Casey Greene, Professor of Biomedical Informatics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus
Technology changes the nature of work, and knowledge work is no different. The past two decades have seen biology and medicine undergoing transformation by rapidly advancing molecular characterization, such as fast, inexpensive DNA sequencing, and the digitization of medicine in the form of apps, telemedicine and data analysis.
Some steps in technology feel larger than others. Yahoo deployed human curators to index emerging content during the dawn of the World Wide Web. The advent of algorithms that used information embedded in the linking patterns of the web to prioritize results radically altered the landscape of search, transforming how people gather information today.
The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT indicates another leap. ChatGPT wraps a state-of-the-art large language model tuned for chat into a highly usable interface. It puts a decade of rapid progress in artificial intelligence at people’s fingertips. This tool can write passable cover letters and instruct users on addressing common problems in user-selected language styles.

Just as the skills for finding information on the internet changed with the advent of Google, the skills necessary to draw the best output from language models will center on creating prompts and prompt templates that produce desired outputs. 
For the cover letter example, multiple prompts are possible. “Write a cover letter for a job” would produce a more generic output than “Write a cover letter for a position as a data entry specialist.” The user could craft even more specific prompts by pasting portions of the job description, resume and specific instructions – for example, “highlight attention to detail.”
As with many technological advances, how people interact with the world will change in the era of widely accessible AI models. The question is whether society will use this moment to advance equity or exacerbate disparities.

How Worried Should Creative Professionals Be About Artificial Intelligence?Posted inWeb & Interactive Design

Someone in the “AI Art Universe” Facebook group called it “art harvesting.” It’s an interesting analogy: sprouts planted by many other people are ‘scraped’ into a giant blender that sorts and readies them to be grown into exotic new gardens. But it’s more than a poetic analogy— it’s a worldwide phenomenon, way bigger than a garden. It’s a jungle of fields and plantations, meadows and forests filled with fantasy characters and creatures, scenes and settings that could be in the distant past, the far future, or another galaxy. And it’s springing up, morphing, regenerating before our eyes. Some of the results are dark and ugly, some are eerily beautiful, and all you have to do to participate is type a prompt that describes your vision. A minute or so later, a suite of images springs up on your screen, ready to be enhanced by you (and, apparently, by anyone else).
I trolled around for a while, trying to find an AI-generated garden “good enough” to show as an example. I finally settled on an alien landscape credited to Bryan Price on NightCafe.studio. With it came a 25%-off-my-first-month offer. Ah yes, another income-generator for someone who is not me, i.e. for NightCafé and all the similar sites that are popping up.
Traditional illustrators are up in arms. On Thursday, December 22, the Society of Illustrators posted this message on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.



In less than 24 hours, this collaborative post by the award winning duo of Society of Illustrators President Tim O’Brien and illustrator Edel Rodriguez had more than 8,500 likes on Instagram, 16.2k likes, and 3,280 reposts on Twitter.
For more than 30 years, O’Brien has been painting meticulous oil portraits of famous people, from his hero Muhammed Ali to Elon Musk, and many have been featured on the cover of TIME. He and his colleagues are insisting that illustrations for publication must be created by real, thinking humans who interact with real clients and use real artists’ tools. “The sudden availability of artificially designed images creates a moral challenge to the illustration community and to the broader design community,” O’Brien said. “We are at the critical point at which illustrators and designers must value human interaction and reject the output of AI image generators. The inclusion of a credit highlighting an AI generator should bring on a sense of shame.”

O’Brien went on to note that athletes are subject to drug tests for trying to enhance their performance artificially, and those who fail are punished. “Humans can run faster, jump higher, and perform better using synthetic means, [but] we as humans are interested in what a human alone can do. That’s what makes us human.”
Illustrator Victor Juhasz, best known for caricatures that have graced the pages of Rolling Stone, TIME, Newsweek, and many other publications, takes the argument a big step farther. “The current craze for AI-generated ‘art’ is a symptom of a disease,” he said.
Juhasz did not mince words. “The temptation to take the fast, easy way rather than put in hard work is enormous. Contemporary society thrives on celebrity, fame and notoriety, and much of it has nothing to do with honest craftsmanship. It’s about the con and getting away with it.”

Other notable illustrators like Anita Kunz, known for her New Yorker covers and feminist responses to classic art have spoken out on how much they hate seeing their work scraped into databases. Karla Ortiz, a painter, printmaker, and concept artist at Marvel Studios, has been especially vocal on social media, posting impassioned arguments against the commercial use of AI art and spearheading a GoFundMe campaign to hire a lobbyist to make the voices of artists heard.
At the present moment, the creative heads of magazines sound largely uninterested in AI. Michael Mrak, the creative director of Scientific American, a science publication with over 10 million subscribers,  “[sees] no reason to replace real artists with AI-generated anything.”
“AI can generate interesting and elaborate imagery, but there are many problems from a legal and moral point of view,” he continued. “AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted and therefore has potential legal issues attached to it, a principal one being that it uses art from across the internet to make the final image. That, and the fact that it scraped or pulled copyrighted art into its learning algorithm.”
Art director and designer Alexander Isley treasures his one-on-one collaborations with artists. “I have never used AI-generated artwork, and have no interest in doing so, unless it’s in the context of how odious it is,” he said. “From all I’ve seen and read, machine-generated artwork is based on modifying, remixing, or adding to real artists’ existing work without acknowledgment or compensation. With commissioned artwork, sketches and revisions are often required. How does this process work with AI-generated images? I can’t deny that the results can be interesting to look at, but it’s a fun parlor trick.”
While art directors might not see AI as a threat, the competitive aspect of design complicates matters. Will AI-generated art be eligible to win contests and grants?
“The short answer is yes,” was the initial answer from Patrick Coyne, editor/designer of Communication Arts, one of the world’s most important design publications. “We always tell jurors to select work based on the quality of the idea and the execution. We celebrate compelling imagery regardless of how it was created.”
Managing Editor Michael Coyne noted that Communication Arts had already featured a few campaigns that used AI-generated art “because they were interesting or appropriate applications for AI as an artistic tool rather than a medium on its own.” He cited an ad campaign by Dentsu Creative Portugal for Jardim Sonoro, an electronic music festival held in a national park near Lisbon, is an example. According to the agency’s creative directors, the challenge was to blend the musicians’ portraits with natural elements. “We learned that AI is a great tool,” they commented. “We are still at its beginning and will certainly see significant developments that will dazzle us all. But it won’t replace anyone. It needs someone to guide the creative process.” They added, “Novelty and discomfort often lead to great work.”
However, a few days later, the Communication Arts‘ team’s stance evolved. “We’ve been approached by several illustrators upset over our position regarding accepting entries for the Illustration Annual produced with text-to-image AI software,” Patrick Coyne wrote via email.  “While I still see the long-term potential for AI-assisted creative exploration, I better understand the position that illustrators and photographers are currently facing with copyright infringement and the unauthorized use of their work to ‘train’ the current crop of text-to-image AI software. Consequently, we are reversing our position and will not be accepting AI text-to-image generated submissions in our Illustration competition.”
Hobbyists have a different relationship to the software. Daniel Rocha of São Paulo is an active contributor to Facebook’s “AI Art Universe” group, and one of the many thousands of people who make AI art for fun. “I use [Mage’s Standard Diffusion program] daily, many times a day,” he said. “I click ‘enter’ on a prompt many, many times, until I get something good or see that I need to change it because something is not nice. I’ve generated more than 22,000 pictures, but that’s not at all time-consuming, since all I have to do is click, click, click.”
Oddly enough, Rocha works in Brazil’s patent and trademark office, where he analyzes the registrability of trademarks. However, “that has nothing to do with what I do on Mage,” he clarified. “I think it is an extremely useful tool for artists. They can use it to fill in details or compose a complex scene extremely fast.”
Stable Diffusion can be trained to fit an author’s style, which allows them to make grandiose scenes in a short time, in their own style. “An amateur like me can reproduce the work of a skilled artist, art that could surpass in quality and inspiration the Sistine Chapel ceiling,” Rocha continued. “That took years for Michelangelo to make, and [similar work] can now be completed in a few days or weeks. Right now, the artists are too scared, but I think they will come around soon.”
Since I have family members who like to play with DALL-E, we decided to try it ourselves. I went in wondering if I could re-create one of the world’s most iconic posters, Milton Glaser’s 1966 “Dylan.” When I used Mage, the results were dismal. Apparently, the Mage database doesn’t have the stuff. We had no luck on DALL-E either (“does not follow our content policy”), but got meh results with Midjourney, where we typed “/imagine the famous 1966 Milton Glaser Bob Dylan poster” and got:

The curly hair must have gotten scraped in, along with some old album covers. And possibly black-and-white portraits to which the photographer owns the copyright. Then we tried: “/imagine the famous 1966 Milton Glaser Bob Dylan poster, but for Lady Gaga” and got:

The whole process took about three minutes. Fortunately— for now, at least— AI isn’t giving Milton Glaser’s brilliant work any serious competition.
To get clarity on where AI stands in regards to legality, I reached out to Martin Schwimmer, a partner at top-rated New York intellectual property law firm LeasonEllis. In his opinion, text-to-image AI models “present novel [new, unexplored] legal issues, including the extent to which the creator of the repository of images makes use of images that were previously displayed on the internet, and to what extent can an AI model look at an image and derive ‘rules’ about that image.” While that language is a little murky to me, it sounds like the lawyers are working on it.
However, Schwimmer didn’t agree that all AI repositories consist of ‘scraped’ images without regard to copyright. For example, he said, a repository named Laion consists not of images, but links to images, which apparently makes a legal difference.
As to who owns the so-called final product, Schwimmer said that he views AI models as one more tool that helps users generate content. “The copyright analysis will be comparable to the analysis we use today when artists use the various illustration tools, graphics editors, paint programs, and other digital art tools: Is the work sufficiently original when divorced from the accompanying tools?”
For now, that will be the last word.

As a one-man company, Nixey is currently building the product’s whole tech stack himself, and says that he uses ChatGPT every day as a kind of personal web development assistant.“I just kind of ended up having it open with me as I was developing. And found it was a really useful tool as I was building software,” he says. Peter Nixey, founder of Intentional.ioNixey describes how it’s allowed him to accelerate his work with an app development tool, called Docker, that he wasn’t familiar with before by asking it intricacies about the tool. “It's been very good at explaining to me what I should do, it's been very good at giving me code examples. I asked it to explain different lines in the code and why they're there and it does that very effectively,” he says. He says it normally would have taken him about two weeks to learn how to use the tool — with ChatGPT, it took two days. Still needing experts alongside generative AIJoshua Wöhle, cofounder and CEO at edtech company Mindstone and a former cofounder and CTO of kids’ internet platform SuperAwesome, is currently using generative AI for a number of applications in his day-to-day workflow. That includes a social media assistant he’s built with the help of ChatGPT, and the image generators DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. Wöhle’s excel appThis lets him input the text for a tweet into a simple spreadsheet, which then turns it into social media graphics that include a condensed strapline of the tweet, overlaid on a branded image that’s generated based on the text he writes.“It just means that the time it takes to go from an idea to something that you can actually publish is now a minute or less, rather than before this would have taken about 20 minutes,” Wöhle says.But while Wöhle says that generative AI has greatly amped up his capacity to make high-quality content at Mindstone, he’s still about to onboard a head of product marketing at the startup — just with different expectations.“I still want that expert to be there, but my expectations of that person have dramatically increased,” he explains. “I'm expecting them to be able to do more work in the same amount of time.”AdvertisementChatGPT and hiring freezesThis example highlights the need to still have specialised people working with generative AI, rather than the AI replacing them altogether, but not all founders are thinking in this way.Wöhle recently organised group calls with founders and CTOs to talk about generative AI, and says that a number of entrepreneurs told him they'd put hiring plans on hold due to recent advances.“There were more than three people on the call who had already made the decision to freeze all the hiring they were doing, because they were considering that they might be able to do double the work with half the people next year,” he says. Joshua Wöhle, CEO and cofounder of MindstoneAnother example that Wöhle got from these fact-finding calls included an entrepreneur using ChatGPT as a kind of stand-in cofounder.“He asked ChatGPT: ‘OK, I'm thinking about building a company in this space, what would you say are the advantages and disadvantages?’ Then said: ‘OK, how would you pitch this?’ And it wrote a two-minute pitch. Then he asked: ‘So how would we build this on AWS [Amazon Web Services]?’ It gave a series of steps of how we should deploy that on AWS and provided some sample code bits.”Wöhle also says that generative AI is helping tech teams to fix buggy code, as it allows engineers to ask ChatGPT why a particular function isn’t working.Where is this all going?Both Wöhle and Nixey agree that, while ChatGPT and other generative AI apps are changing the world of work, they still require knowledgeable people in the room to get the most out of them.“Its ability to solve the task depends on one's ability to phrase the problem in the first place,” says Nixey.That said, both believe that AI will, in the not-too-distant future, be doing so much of the work that humans have previously done that ideas like universal basic income will become a necessity in the future.“For the first time, I can now see a future with universal basic income (UBI), where a set of people decide if they want to work,” Wöhle argues. “Not everyone will choose to work because the base level of UBI will be high enough that they’ll prefer not to, and then another set of people will decide to go and work. But they’ll be 100 times more productive than they have ever been before, and that’s why this works. This is not tomorrow, I now genuinely think that is the only way that this can work.”",https://sifted.eu,,,,,,,,Sifted,,,,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/siftedeu/', 'https://twitter.com/siftedeu', 'https://uk.linkedin.com/company/siftedeu', 'https://www.instagram.com/siftedeu/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technology chats in a conversational way, answering questions from the user. The online chatbot has been trained on lots of information and data from the internet - it can have a human-like conversation answering questions, admitting mistakes and rejecting any inappropriate questions. Experts say it can be used to write essays, stories, poems and even solve computer coding. But there are limits to what it can do, which OpenAI admit. Sometimes it writes answers which are incorrect or don't make sense, and it occasionally guesses what the user has asked it, rather than asking more follow-up questions to understand the question better. OpenAI say they are working on those problems. Who is Elon Musk?

Some people have suggested that the software should be welcomed. They argue that, just like when the calculator or Google were created, people were unsure at first, but if teachers introduce the technology and teach pupils the benefits but also the downfalls that could help their learning. In the US, the New York City education department banned ChatGPT on school devices and its internet network so students and teachers can't access it. In a statement they said they banned it because of ""negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.""""We will be keeping a close eye on how this develops and, if this does become a problem, we will certainly be pressing the government to provide guidance and support.""— Geoff Barton, General secretary of the Association of School and College LeadersHere in the UK, exam regulator for England Ofqual and the Department of Education are keeping an eye on if the chatbot is being used to cheat. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""We're aware of concerns that ChatGPT may be used by some pupils to write answers and pass this off as their own work, although we have not directly received reports of problems from our members thus far.""What are the problems with ChatGPT?Image source, Getty ImagesChatGPT is an easy way for students to write an essay or answer questions but some of the language it uses might prove to teachers that a child hasn't written it themselves. So although pupils may be tempted to use it, teachers might be able to spot quickly if it isn't your work because it doesn't sound how you would usually write. A downside of the software is that teachers give homework because they want to assess your writing, see if you have understood the work and test your analysing skills - all of which can't be judged if it was written by the chatbot.It also isn't always accurate as well - because it doesn't know everything your work might be incorrect. CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman tweeted last year: ""ChatGPT is incredibly limited....it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.""Sorry, this vote cannot be loaded.

Unless you specifically opt-out, Adobe may assume that it’s ok to use your work to train its algorithms.
An eagle-eyed developer at the Krita Foundation noticed that Adobe had automatically opted them into a “content analysis” initiative. The program allows Adobe to “analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g. for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services.”
The rule was implemented in August 2022 but managed to go unnoticed.
Artists, understandably, have been protesting over AI-generated art as a potential threat to their livelihoods:

Seeing AI art being featured on the main page of Artstation saddens me. I love playing with MJ as much as anyone else, but putting something that was generated using a prompt alongside artwork that took hundreds of hours and years of experience to make is beyond disrespectful. pic.twitter.com/4p2MLDbADD— Dan Eder (@3DanEder) December 9, 2022Click to accept marketing cookies and enable this content

While some artists believe AI is a tool for their work rather than a threat, there’s near-unanimous consensus that the method in which generative AI models are often trained is unfair.
Some artists have found their work has been scraped to train generative AI models without their consent or at least being paid royalties. This has raised questions over whether end-users could also unwittingly violate copyright and face legal consequences.
By changing its policy to allow AI models to be trained on the works of its users, Adobe doesn’t have to rely on scraping data from the web. Adobe, it’s worth noting, is set to 
While Adobe claims that it doesn’t use data on customers’ Creative Cloud accounts to train its experimental generative AI features, the wording provides some legal flexibility.
In the company’s documentation, Adobe quite clearly says “we first aggregate your content with other content and then use the aggregated content to train our algorithms and thus improve our products and services.”
Such data collection should never be opted into by default, it arguably falls foul of regulations like GDPR. If you’re an Adobe user and want to opt-out, you can do so here.

Something that dawned on me very early on in reading biography and history is that incentives rule the world, that company’s, nations, individuals ultimately do things primarily for their own self-interest. And there’s nothing inherently wrong with that, but it’s important to bear it in mind. Business is no different. Artificial intelligence is no different. Like with any topic that has political ramifications, the loudest voices on both sides of the debate over the job loss risk of AI are the sides that have the most at stake. They are the individuals and the groups that have the most to gain or to lose, not necessarily for finding the truth, but for forwarding the narrative that would behoove them and behoove their interests. This doesn’t make these parties bad people; it just means that “good” for them, in terms of the achievement of their goals and potentially the assurance of their perceived well-being, isn’t about figuring out the ultimate truth, but again, in promoting a story that boosts their own names. So when it comes to job loss here at Emerj, we’ve looked at thousands of companies over the last four years in sectors such as finance and healthcare and heard stories from startups big and small, from AI buyers, from consultants at large firms and small firms, and from small private firms and public firms. We’ve heard a variety of perspectives on job risk and which jobs are likely to be disrupted, as well as which industries are likely to actually see real job loss in a potentially dangerous way to certain segments of society and where the transition is going to be more gradual. I’ve noticed a pattern over the course of these four years across the groups that tend to be loudest about promoting job loss to the point where it almost feels disingenuous. It feels like these groups can’t possibly believe what they’re saying. Similarly, there’s another group that tends to underestimate the risk of job loss by automation. As mentioned, in any given conflict over a politicized issue, the loudest group are those who have the most at stake. These groups again seem as though they are forwarding an agenda. In this article, I’m going to highlight who these groups are by going through the below graphic in depth:  Groups that Overestimate Job Loss The groups that tend to overestimate job loss are often either startups under 50 employees or boutique consulting firms recently rebranded to be all about emerging technology. A lot of the time these “AI consulting firms” were before just doing completely generic IT consulting for 15 years in a row and then decided to frame themselves to be about artificial intelligence. Another common type of organization that will promote a hyperbolic level of job loss risk is small technology firms that have rebranded to be about AI, blockchain, or a similar buzzword. These could be existing firms that have done something in technology for the last 15 years, perhaps in telecom or life sciences, and all of a sudden they have rebranded to an AI company even without having any data science staff on their team. These smaller groups tend to be the sources of the most overblown job loss and risk statements, and they tend to have common traits: They Have Few Employees If they talk about something like the automation of particular roles, they’re not worrying large sums of people at their company that they don’t know. Generally, everybody’s down the hall from everybody else. The CEO might even be able to shake hands with everybody in the company on a relatively regular basis. These are tightly knit groups, and so the kind of internal disruption that might happen for the company is by our estimation much less intense than it is for enterprises. They Have Few Stakeholders Similarly, these companies tend to have few stakeholders. They are almost never publicly traded firms. They may even have a relatively small number of clients, and so, again, they don’t have a wide variety of powerful players to upset with their hyperbole. They’re not going to have people selling their shares on the open market as a result of their bluster, for example. They Can Get on the Radar of Possible Customers If the media reports on one of these smaller firms purporting that a revolution will come to the sector they sell into, this might actually get the company on the radar of potential clients. That’s why they pivoted to AI in the first place; this is the behooved interest. Revolutionary change on the aggregate could be good for the company. It could finally get them some press coverage. Oftentimes, people in the press who interview AI consulting firms are just going to interview them and expect them to be experts on AI. They might never do any homework and figure out if anyone at the company even has AI or data science experience. These firms want to convince the market and the press of the importance of their product and their approach. For example, if retail jobs are going to be drastically overhauled in the short-term, companies like theirs are going to be very valuable. If they can predict a kind of automation revolution, that might be the ticket to their credibility and their ticket to customers. They Can Convince Venture Capitalists to Invest Startups are going to want to claim that their product will bring the ultimate disruption of the sector into which they are selling because terms like “ultimate disruption” and “revolution” could be appealing to venture capitalists. Promoting the job loss narrative could be a way to win venture money. They Use Buzzwords These small firms also tend to use buzzwords in press releases and on their websites time and time again. They use words like “revolutionize” or “completely automate.” Anytime we see the phrase “completely automate,” it raises a red flag for us here at Emerj. Artificial intelligence is not a process whereby systems can be completely automated often without humans somewhere along the line. The process of setting up artificial intelligence systems, integrating them into existing data infrastructures, revamping data infrastructures, training algorithms, and updating algorithms is extremely complicated and requires talented people. We’ve done a lengthy article on applying artificial intelligence in the enterprise and its inherent challenges. “Completely automate” is a hyperbolic claim, and anyone who says it is really stretching oftentimes what artificial intelligence is actually capable of doing, downplaying the integration, the data requirements, and talent requirements. Another term is “push button.” The setup and strategy around leveraging AI technology are complex and certainly far from “push button.” Then, of course, there is the classic: “disruption.” If these words are stated one too many times on company LinkedIn descriptions and websites, business leaders should consider this a red flag that the company is hiding behind marketing language because they don’t have the data science talent on their team to back up their claims and provide legitimate AI software. Groups that Underestimate Job Loss Large multinational companies are the most likely to underestimate job loss. In particular, companies will often downplay job loss when they are trying to rebrand themselves as being leaders in AI even if they don’t actually employ data science talent. These companies often use the word “augment” over “automate.” These companies share common traits that are in general the opposite of those that small firms looking to exaggerate the job loss risk share. They Have Many Employees These companies can’t risk upsetting all of their employees, many of whom have never interacted with the company leadership in their lives and never will. AT&T, for example, can’t talk about automating customer service with AI without gravely worrying their employees. They risk their employees leaving because they feel undervalued. These companies will say things like “our people are the most important thing for our company,” and similar platitudes in order to discuss AI in the open without alarming their employees. They want to figure out how to keep the discussion they’re having about automation and layoffs away from the press and their employees. They Have Many Stakeholders Enterprises have shareholders, people trading their company on open markets and people who wield power over the business to keep happy. They have big global business partners and accounts, and if they start talking about disruption in ways that makes their employees nervous and perhaps cause the market to fluctuate a little, they risk problems with their stakeholders. If they start talking about technology that might disrupt the sector into which the company is selling, that doesn’t bode well for the company when it comes to how their shareholders might react. As a result, they’ll underestimate the impact of this technology. They Have to Navigate the AI Buzz Carefully These companies are often going to have a hard time adjusting to artificial intelligence They’re still looking to be successful as workforce automation becomes more common, but they want to limit the revolt from their employees and stakeholders as a result. They don’t want to talk openly about putting employees in different positions, retraining them, and possibly laying them off. As a result, they need to choose their words carefully for press releases about their AI initiatives. They talk a lot about augmentation, but not automation. In addition, they often use the word “empower,” such as in “We’re all about empowering people with AI.” They position themselves as virtuous against the startups that are talking about replacing people with machines. They need to do this even if they’re about to lay off 2,000 people because they can’t risk an employee revolt. Another statement they often say: “Our people are the most important thing to us.” In addition, these companies speak in terms of “always” and “never.” They frame AI as a black and white discussion: “it will do this; it won’t do that.” What Business Leaders Should Know These groups tend to be the loudest voices in this conversation for business leaders realistically thinking about their strategy. Don’t listen to either of them exclusively and listen to them with healthy skepticism. The fact of the matter is that some job roles are likely to be augmented with artificial intelligence and some are going to likely be automated in the decade ahead. People filling certain roles at companies might just be repositioned into other roles if they possess more diverse skillsets. In other cases, automation will make some employees obsolete because they can’t easily be repositioned into another role at the company. Business leaders shouldn’t suspect that something like that is completely out of the realm of possibility. Likely both are going to be the case. Business leaders should bear in mind that the loudest companies overestimating and underestimating job loss are pushing forward their own interests. As artificial intelligence continues to make its way into major industries, there will be changes. There will be instances of augmentation, and there will be automation. Some automation might be slow, and people’s skills will be repurposed. Other automation might be quick, and people might be left without a job. As business and government leaders, we should be thinking seriously about the potential low hanging fruit automation opportunities within our business, not just to win market share, but to consider what to do with our teams. What do we do with those people?

Video by Ian C. Haydon/University of Washington Institute for Protein DesignCreditCredit...By Cade MetzJan. 9, 2023Last spring, an artificial intelligence lab called OpenAI unveiled technology that lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see. Called DALL-E, it sparked a wave of similar tools with names like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Promising to speed the work of digital artists, this new breed of artificial intelligence captured the imagination of both the public and the pundits — and threated to generate new levels of online disinformation.Social media is now teeming with the surprisingly conceptual, in which shockingly detailed, often photorealistic images generated by DALL-E and other tools. “Photo of a teddy bear riding a skateboard in Times Square.” “Cute corgi in a house made out of sushi.” “Jeflon Zuckergates.”But when some scientists consider this technology, they see more than just a way of creating fake photos. They see a path to a new cancer treatment or a new flu vaccine or a new pill that helps you digest gluten.Using many of the same techniques that underpin DALL-E and other art generators, these scientists are generating blueprints for new proteins — tiny biological mechanisms that can change the way of our bodies behave.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOur bodies naturally produce about 20,000 proteins, which handle everything from digesting food to moving oxygen through the bloodstream. Now, researchers are working to create proteins that are not found in nature, hoping to improve our ability to fight disease and do things that our bodies cannot on their own.David Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, has been working to build artisanal proteins for more than 30 years. By 2017, he and his team had shown this was possible. But they did not anticipate how the rise of new A.I. technologies would suddenly accelerate this work, shrinking the time needed to generate new blueprints from years down to weeks.“What we need are new proteins that can solve modern-day problems, like cancer and viral pandemics,” Dr. Baker said. “We can’t wait for evolution.” He added, “Now, we can design these proteins much faster, and with much higher success rates, and create much more sophisticated molecules that can help solve these problems.”ImageDavid Baker of the University of Washington.Credit...Evan McGlinn for The New York TimesLast year, Dr. Baker and his fellow researchers published a pair of papers in the journal Science describing how various A.I. techniques could accelerate protein design. But these papers have already been eclipsed by a newer one that draws on the techniques that drive tools like DALL-E, showing how new proteins can be generated from scratch much like digital photos.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“One of the most powerful things about this technology is that, like DALL-E, it does what you tell it to do,” said Nate Bennett, one of the researchers working in the University of Washington lab. “From a single prompt, it can generate an endless number of designs.”To generate images, DALL-E relies on what artificial intelligence researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the network of neurons in the brain. This is the same technology that recognizes the commands you bark into your smartphone, enables self-driving cars to identify (and avoid) pedestrians and translates languages on services like Skype.A neural network learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of corgi photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a corgi. With DALL-E, researchers built a neural network that looked for patterns as it analyzed millions of digital images and the text captions that described what each of these images depicted. In this way, it learned to recognize the links between the images and the words.When you describe an image for DALL-E, a neural network generates a set of key features that this image may include. One feature might be the curve of a teddy bear’s ear. Another might be the line at the edge of a skateboard. Then, a second neural network — called a diffusion model — generates the pixels needed to realize these features.The diffusion model is trained on a series of images in which noise — imperfection — is gradually added to a photograph until it becomes a sea of random pixels. As it analyzes these images, the model learns to run this process in reverse. When you feed it random pixels, it removes the noise, transforming these pixels into a coherent image.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt the University of Washington, other academic labs and new start-ups, researchers are using similar techniques in their effort to create new proteins.Proteins begin as strings of chemical compounds, which then twist and fold into three-dimensional shapes that define how they behave. In recent years, artificial intelligence labs like DeepMind, owned by Alphabet, the same parent company as Google, have shown that neural networks can accurately guess the three-dimensional shape of any protein in the body based just on the smaller compounds it contains — an enormous scientific advance.Now, researchers like Dr. Baker are taking another step, using these systems to generate blueprints for entirely new proteins that do not exist in nature. The goal is to create proteins that take on very specific shapes; a particular shape can serve a particular task, such as fighting the virus that causes Covid.Much as DALL-E leverages the relationship between captions and photographs, similar systems can leverage the relationship between a description of what the protein can do and the shape it adopts. Researchers can provide a rough outline for the protein they want, then a diffusion model can generate its three-dimensional shape.VideoA protein diffusion model doing unconditional generation, converting noise into plausible structures.

She is now building a company in generative A.I. protein design.Credit...Herve Philippe/TerrificShot Photography“With DALL-E, you can ask for an image of a panda eating a shoot of bamboo,” said Namrata Anand, a former Stanford University researcher who is also an entrepreneur, building a company in this area of research. “Equivalently, protein engineers can ask for a protein that binds to another in a particular way — or some other design constraint — and the generative model can build it.”The difference is that the human eye can instantly judge the fidelity of a DALL-E image. It cannot do the same with a protein structure. After artificial intelligence technologies produce these protein blueprints, scientists must still take them into a wet lab — where experiments can be done with real chemical compounds — and make sure they do what they are supposed to do.For this reason, some experts say that the latest artificial intelligence technologies should be taken with a grain of salt. “Making a new structure is just a game,” said Frances Arnold, a Nobel Laureate who is a professor specializing in protein engineering at the California Institute of Technology. “What really matters is: What can that structure actually do?”But for many researchers, these new techniques are not just accelerating the creation of new protein candidates for the wet lab. They provide a way of exploring new innovations that researchers could not previously explore on their own.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“What’s exciting isn’t just that they are creative and explore unexpected possibilities, but that they are creative while satisfying certain design objectives or constraints,” said Jue Wang, a researcher at the University of Washington. “This saves you from needing to check every possible protein in the universe.”Often, artificially intelligent machines are developed to perform skills that come naturally to humans, like piecing together images, writing text or playing board games. Protein-designing bots pose a more profound question, Dr. Wang said: “What can machines do that humans can’t do at all?”Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.

The legal profession is no stranger to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and its impact is only expected to intensify in the upcoming years. As businesses strive to reduce costs and increase efficiency, AI is used for various tasks, including contract review, legal research, and drafting legal documents. According to the World Economic Forum, the legal sector will most likely experience AI disruption after the transportation and healthcare sectors.Five years ago, the New York Times reported AI is doing legal work, but it's not replacing lawyers — yet. However, recent developments with ChatGPT underscore how close we are to a reality where this will be the case. AI can now, undeniably, help and replace lawyers for certain types of tasks – from drafting contracts to summarizing complex laws.Related: Princeton Student Builds ChatGPT Detection App to Fight AI Plagiarism



Large language models, such as GPT-3, have recently revolutionized the practical use of artificial intelligence in the legal field. These models, trained on vast amounts of data, can generate human-like text, making them ideal for summarizing legal documents and predicting case outcomes. The recent acceleration of using large language models in the legal field can be attributed to a few key factors. One is the continued advancement and development of these models, which have become more sophisticated and accurate over time. This has made them increasingly useful and practical for various applications, especially in the legal industry.Related: 3 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform The World in 2023


Another factor driving the adoption of large language models in the legal field is the increasing industry demand for automation and efficiency. Legal professionals are under increasing pressure to handle a high volume of work in a short amount of time. Using large language models can help alleviate this burden by automating certain tasks and allowing for more efficient research and analysis.However, deploying AI in the legal sector does not come without difficulties. Cost is a major obstacle to AI adoption in the legal industry. There may be significant upfront costs associated with selecting and putting in place AI systems, as well as potential continuing maintenance and training expenses. The legal sector is heavily regulated, and adhering to these standards can be difficult and expensive.The absence of standards in the legal industry is another problem that can make it challenging to use AI systems. Laws and rules are distinct to each legal jurisdiction, and AI systems must be tailored to follow these criteria. This can be a time-consuming and expensive procedure that may also include hiring specialized staff with knowledge of both AI and law.Related: The Curious Case of AI and Legal Liability


Finally, the legal sector has an aversion to change. Many legal professionals, including lawyers, have reservations about AI's dependability and accuracy and may be reluctant to use it in their job. Another concern is that using AI would drive job losses or decrease demand for human legal professionals.Do these reasons matter, though, to the companies and clients that pay for legal services? Probably not.AI can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency for business — it's undeniable that the use cases for AI in the law and business are here, and they're not going away. AI can reduce the time and resources needed to execute some jobs by automating them. For clients seeking legal services, this may eventually mean cost savings.The speed at which AI can process and interpret enormous amounts of data is one of its main advantages. This can be especially helpful in legal practice, where it may be necessary to study and analyze documents and other materials quickly. Additionally, AI can eliminate humans in the loop regarding due diligence.


Even online dispute resolution services such as JAMS eliminate the need for in-person court hearings on complex intellectual property matters.It's also essential to consider the growing trust in AI systems. According to a survey conducted by Deloitte, 76% of respondents reported having trust in AI systems to make decisions, and 72% believed that AI could be a valuable addition to their organization. This suggests a growing acceptance of AI within the legal industry, and customers may be more willing to adopt it to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings.However, not everything related to AI is bad for lawyers. AI can give partners at law firms and general counsels new opportunities, even while it may automate low-level jobs. For instance, AI in contract management software can make it faster for lawyers and business teams to author, negotiate and redline initial drafts, freeing up time for higher-value activities that are often valued the most: negotiation and advocacy.As lawyers learn to collaborate with and take advantage of AI systems, it's conceivable that AI usage could lead to new career possibilities. So, will AI replace human lawyers in the coming five years? It's impossible to say for sure, but the trend is undeniable: AI use in the legal sector is expected to grow in the upcoming years, and human attorneys must adapt if they want to stay in demand.

Imagine you are applying for a job. After filling out the necessary information on the company’s website, attaching your resume and writing a cover letter, you click “submit” and then wait to hear back. A few weeks later, you check your inbox to find an automated email response informing you that, after a thorough review of your application, you have not been selected for the position. Questions begin to flash through your head: What was wrong with my application? Was my cover letter the problem? Was I simply unqualified? However, there’s a strong likelihood that the company’s decision was not based on any of these factors. Rather, as is the case with as many as 75% of businesses, the decision to reject your application was most likely made by an algorithm.
As a growing number of businesses are seeking out ways to streamline hiring and reduce labor costs, Artificial Intelligence has taken the corporate world by storm. However, these benefits do not come without repercussions — the use of AI  in recruitment processes is slowly unfolding as a silent perpetrator of social inequality.
According to the World Economic Forum, the automation of hiring procedures is “stopping an estimated 27 million people from finding full-time work.” The candidates that are primarily filtered out by AI softwares are largely composed of demographically-marginalized individuals. A study by Harvard Business School identified previously incarcerated persons, veterans, refugees, immigrants and those with mental or physical disabilities as “hidden workers” who lose out on job opportunities in part because they are often unjustly screened out by hiring algorithms. Despite the fact that an astonishing 88% of these individuals were shown to be fully qualified for the position, they were nonetheless disqualified for not matching specific criteria.
You may find yourself wondering how all of this is possible. The idea that automated and allegedly unbiased machines are replicating human prejudices seems counterintuitive. However, the ultimate problem does not necessarily lie in the machines themselves, but rather within the information and datasets upon which they are built.
 
 

Data is rarely neutral — instead, it is often tarnished by historical instances of human injustice and partiality that plague information archives. As emphasized in an article by Brookings Press, “Algorithms, by their nature, do not question the human decisions underlying a dataset.” Rather, they are based on trends of reproduction that can cause them to replicate “the very sorts of human biases they are intended to replace.” The resulting algorithmic code has the potential to accept or reject a candidate’s resume based solely on the presence (or absence) of specific keywords. 
For instance, Amazon came under fire back in 2018 after its hiring algorithm was shown to disproportionately favor male candidates over female ones. Coded to replicate hiring patterns in the company over the previous 10 years, which had been overwhelmingly male, the algorithm was found to penalize any resumes that contained keywords such as “women’s.” Unable to mitigate these biases, Amazon was forced to scrap the project completely and temporarily revert to more traditional hiring methods. 
This bias has been found to impact not only the screening phases of the recruitment process but also the initial “sourcing” phase. During the sourcing phase, companies will attempt to attract certain candidates to the position through methods such as advertisements and online job postings. The specific websites and feeds selected to display these advertisements are often based on algorithmic predictions — specifically, ones that calculate a candidate’s likelihood of succeeding in the position based on their background information. 
In a study conducted by the Harvard Business Review, these technologies were found to be extremely biased, often targeting ads based on prejudiced and stereotypical information. The study found that cashier and secretary positions were targeted toward an audience that was disproportionately female (85%, to be exact) and taxi companies targeted audiences that were 75% Black. The study points out that “this is a quintessential case of an algorithm reproducing bias from the real world, without human intervention.” 
As is demonstrated in both of these instances, if left unchecked, the use of these algorithms threatens to exacerbate historical trends of discriminatory hiring practices in the United States. Fortunately, many efforts aimed at mitigating these issues have already begun to emerge. 
 
 

For instance, various pieces of legislation, such as a recent bill passed in New York City, seek to remedy these issues by requiring companies to conduct annual bias audits of any AI softwares and technologies used. Mainstream media is also starting to call attention to the issue, as demonstrated by  the recent release of the Netflix documentary “Coded Bias,” which exposes the discriminatory practices often contained in artificial intelligence.
These efforts aimed at awareness will continue to be imperative, as the risks of Artificial Intelligence present a unique danger — A type of danger that is silent and unseen, with its prejudice and partiality hidden in the depths of algorithms.

Beautiful.ai Launches DesignerBot to Automatically Create Rich Presentations About Anything and Everything Using Generative AI


















Utilizing cutting-edge AI technology from OpenAI, Beautiful.ai's DesignerBot generates fully realized presentations, including appropriate text, layouts, photos, icons and design, based on one simple text prompt. The AI automatically creates a wide variety of content and slides for business, school and personal use, including text, lists, icons and charts that can be used for pitch decks, sales proposals, marketing presentations and even abstract concepts - all from a short description provided by the user.

""Instead of wondering where to start on a presentation, users can simply ask DesignerBot to 'Design a pitch deck for a mobile app that sells concert tickets' or 'Create a marketing plan for a social media rollout' or 'Build an effective sales pitch for my software product',"" said Mitch Grasso, founder and chief technology officer of Beautiful.ai. ""From this one prompt, 10-20 slides are generated and ready to present or make further edits. This is the power of generative AI and the game-changing experience it enables by cutting down the time users spend designing their story and giving them more time to tell it.""
Once DesignerBot has built a custom presentation, Beautiful.ai's powerful SmartSlides technology can be used to quickly edit slides by adding or removing content and automatically adapting, resizing and laying out the slides, all while preserving and maintaining corporate brand guidelines. The addition of DesignerBot provides a truly automated zero-to-finish experience to Beautiful.ai's presentation ecosystem - eliminating hours of frustrating effort to design and craft a beautiful presentation narrative.""Starting from a blank canvas and figuring out how to visualize your story as a series of compelling slides has always been the biggest challenge with traditional presentation software - especially for people without design skills,"" said Grasso. ""Beautiful.ai's mission from day one has been to use assistive AI technology to create software that understands the rules of great design and provides knowledge workers with an entire presentation ecosystem that enables them to create better content, faster and smarter. With the addition of DesignerBot, we can not only offer users an amazing slide design experience, but assist them in creating both a story arc and the actual content of each slide.""In addition to creating presentations from scratch, DesignerBot's generative AI is also available as part of Beautiful.ai's extensive photo library, allowing users to generate unique images and photos if they are unable to find the appropriate imagery among the millions of free stock photos available in Beautful.ai. Working with OpenAI's DALL-E, DesignerBot generates a completely new and unique image from a simple description - giving users access to that elusive photo of 'a teddy bear on a skateboard in Times Square at night' or 'an astronaut holding flowers in the style of Andy Warhol' that would make the perfect addition to a deck.""I love this! Beautiful.ai just got even better and faster,"" said Danny Ellis, CEO of Skypecs and Beautiful.ai customer. ""This unlocks so much for our team in the 'getting started' phase of presentations. We use Beautiful.ai across our team as a full presentation solution because we love their brand controls and asset libraries, and the powerful addition of artificial intelligence will give the team's copy, images, and charts a head start. This is going to change the way our team builds presentations!""Beautiful.ai was built from the ground up as a collaborative solution to help organizations control the entire lifecycle of how presentations are built, shared and reused across teams, and presentations can be easily imported or exported to different presentation formats, including PowerPoint, Google Slides and PDF.Beautiful.ai believes presentations today should be memorable and the storytelling in them should be painless and empowering. Through automated smart content, the Beautiful.ai platform gives everyone – including non-designers – a tool with a built-in designer. More than one million users across 205 countries and 36,000 companies currently use Beautiful.ai's product, including trusted brands such as CVENT, Rakuten and the Phoenix Suns.To learn more, visit Beautiful.ai.About Beautiful.aiBeautiful.ai is a San Francisco-based presentation platform that uses design automation and artificial intelligence to enable teams to work faster and produce better results.

Challenges include rising economic pressure, the sustainability imperative, volatile resource prices and supply chain disruptions as well as increasing capability challenges and talent shortage.A continuous improvement in production efficiency has always been considered one of the key prerequisites to ensure the competitiveness of globally operating companies. This requirement has not changed. However, the traditional levers for increasing productivity are now less effective. New challenges have emerged, including the COVID pandemic and increased geopolitical uncertainty. These have led to a rapid increase in the importance of resilience and flexibility of entire supply chains. Many industrial companies are also facing a skills shortage; this will affect 90% of organizations by 2025, inhibiting production capacity.Have you read?From dinosaur footprints to US-EU data: The latest in artificial intelligenceHow to follow Davos 2023At the same time, climate change and the associated efforts to meet the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement mean a necessary emphasis on sustainability and emission reduction. This has a huge impact on the organizational goals of manufacturing companies. The role of AI in manufacturing industryThe expanding role of data and advanced manufacturing technologies opens up new opportunities to address the challenges facing the sector. However, while many companies have piloted this over the past decade, most have failed to scale these solutions to achieve the desired value. They have often used data to create transparency on, for example, production processes or to forecast future events based on historical data; few companies have invested in self-controlled systems based on AI. This has the potential to unlock far more value.In the context of industrial operations, AI is used to enable systems and machines to perform tasks in a smart way. There are four principal ways in which AI can help:1. Optimizing productivityBusinesses can use AI to increase throughput and yield and to reduce conversion costs. Possible applications include: predictive maintenance to increase equipment efficiency and effectiveness; self-optimization of machine and process parameters; machine vision for automated inspection to improve product quality; and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for autonomous in-plant transportation. These applications can lead to significant revenue increases and two-digit conversion cost reductions.2. Improving sustainabilityAI can also help to make operations more sustainable by reducing emissions. For instance, AI-based applications can be used to predict energy consumption and emissions for the future (e.g. the next shift), and to analyze and identify equipment responsible for excess energy consumption and emissions. AI can also reduce emissions by determining, for example, the optimal process parameters or production sequence within production.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

For instance, AI can offer advanced demand forecasting, improved network optimization or advanced production planning/scheduling.4. Augmenting the workforceFinally, AI can help to address manufacturers' capability challenges and talent shortages. On the one hand, AI can allow businesses to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks, so that the workforce can put the focus on other more value-adding activities. On the other hand, AI can augment and support employees in their daily work; for instance, in the context of decision-making processes or through human-robot collaboration.We have still to fully grasp the possibilities for applying AI in the industrial context. Currently, the biggest hurdle for many manufacturers is to scale effective AI pilot applications in order to fully benefit from their impact. The scaling difficulties arise from different sources and include a missing overarching strategy; a lack of AI capabilities and skills; limited availability, quality, or use of data; and, most importantly, a set of general guidelines on how to manage the implementation of AI at scale.“AI should not be a trial and error – it should follow a systematic approach”— Jay Lee, Ohio Eminent Scholar and Founding Director of Industrial AI Center, University of CincinnatiSupporting manufacturing companies on their AI journeyTo address the challenges described and to support manufacturers on their journey towards capturing the full potential of AI, the World Economic Forum in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has recently launched the new global initiative AI-powered Industrial Operations. The aims are: to raise awareness on the opportunity offered by AI applications; to outline the most-promising AI applications and required implementation prerequisites; to develop an educational guidebook on how to implement and scale AI in industrial operations; and to demonstrate the impact of AI through the incubation of pilots across the network of Centers for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Affiliates such as these in Turkey and the US.The World Economic Forum invites manufacturing companies from all industries to join the global community around this initiative and thereby accelerate their transformation towards AI-powered industrial operations.Don't miss any update on Davos AgendaSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalManufacturing and Value ChainsEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

[Updated by Editor 1/9, 7:19 pm PT] Over the weekend, The Information reported that Microsoft is looking to add OpenAI’s chatbot technology — currently ChatGPT, soon to be GPT-4 — to its Office suite of productivity technologies, including Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. And late today, Semafor reported that Microsoft, which invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, is in talks to invest another $10 billion in the company.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



The stream of Microsoft news made me wonder: How would these apps-on-steroids, used by billions of companies globally, change how we work? Especially once Google gets fully in the game, integrating its own generative AI capabilities into Google Workspace? Will AI become as mundane in our day-to-day work lives as the humble spreadsheet? 
Far more than a new Clippy 
News of the plans for Office came only a few days after word spread that Microsoft was planning to embed ChatGPT into its search engine Bing. But talk of ChatGPT being integrated with Word led those of an earlier tech generation to immediately giggle. Why? One word: Clippy. 
Clippy, Microsoft’s user interface agent that came bundled with Microsoft Office in 1997 and was personally launched by Bill Gates, was a hopped-up, big-eyed paperclip who popped up to say things like, “It looks like you’re writing a letter. Would you like help?” 
Clippy was mostly loathed and mocked for his invasive pop-ups. Time even named Clippy one of the worst inventions of all time. Clippy had disappeared entirely by 2007, although he was resurrected as a cultural icon as a retro sticker pack in Teams in 2021. 
ChatGPT, of course, would be far more than a new Clippy — it could potentially do everything from generate text based on simple natural language prompts and suggest responses to emails to analyze data in Excel and translate text. 
Tech investor Puneet Kumar called the possibility “crazy powerful” in a tweet, adding that it would “further deepen” Microsoft’s moats in enterprise office tech: 


ChatGPT and similar models not ready for prime time
The Information pointed out that Microsoft Word already uses in-house AI tools, including Turing’s Smart Find feature and At a Glance, which summarizes Word documents. And it has “already quietly incorporated GPT into Word in minor ways,” including in its autocomplete feature. 
But to implement OpenAI’s ChatGPT or, soon enough, GPT-4, there will be plenty of hurdles to overcome. 
For one, ChatGPT has a serious accuracy problem, one that is exacerbated by its tendency to sound plausible even when it is dead-wrong. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted the risks. That makes corporate document creation or advanced workplace integration a no-go at the moment. advertisement
Privacy is also an obstacle. How would Microsoft preserve the privacy of corporate data? It’s hard to imagine a large law firm or financial services company that uses Microsoft Office all day long getting help from ChatGPT right now. 
Office work will likely change for good
Still, the opportunity to significantly power-charge the day-to-day text output of the average enterprise — emails, presentations, reports — is too tantalizing to ignore. As some guy named Kevin tweeted: 


But it may be some time before it’s clear both how Microsoft and Google can make generative AI tools work for business at scale, as well as how enterprises can deal with what employees create. advertisement
Forrester analyst Rowan Curran said there are “a lot of open questions about what guardrails and controls enterprises put both on how these tools are allowed to be adopted, and how they can be used once they are adopted.” 
For example, he told VentureBeat by email, “If I have a text generator on my phone that I used to draft a work email or outline a blog post and then I publish that as part of my job – does my employer need to be concerned about, or at least aware of that?” 
So much about our digital office life — think PDFs, spreadsheets, smartphones, cloud, digital signatures — have become work ho-hums over the past two decades. Whether it’s ChatGPT in 2023 or not, it seems likely that advances in generative AI are on the path to transforming the workplace as we know it.

Preparing Today’s College Students to Work with AI

Just like the wheel, the internet, and the smartphone transformed the world, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize our personal and professional lives, and it all begins in the college classroom.Although AI has been around since the 1950s, it’s just beginning to truly take off. According to one recent report, the global AI market, which brought in $388 billion in 2022, is expected to generate a whopping $1.4 trillion by 2029.This tremendous growth points to a future that is largely AI-driven. To help prepare students for this future, universities and colleges should do everything they can to introduce them to AI and help them understand the jobs available in this exciting, rapidly growing field.AI: It’s Not Just RobotsWhen many people hear the term “artificial intelligence,” they think about robots. The fact of the matter is that AI has many everyday applications. In fact, most of us use AI daily. If you’ve ever seen Google autocomplete a search for you or had a conversation with Siri, that’s AI.Another common AI application is chatbot technology. If you’ve ever interacted with a company online via chat—for example, connecting with Amazon to discuss a defective item you received—chances are you engaged with an AI-powered chatbot, at least to kick off the conversation.Increasingly, AI is being used to automate repetitive tasks in our everyday lives. When universities and institutions of higher learning invest in chatbot technology, they can do the same while also helping students think differently about what AI is.How AI Can Improve the Student ExperienceBy investing in chatbot technology, colleges and universities can introduce students to a broader scope of AI solutions out of the gate. Instead of thinking that AI is an esoteric concept that only the smartest engineers and data scientists in the world understand, chatbots help students understand what AI is and where it fits into society on a deeper, more accessible level.Colleges and universities that invest in chatbots ensure that their students interface with cutting-edge technology, perhaps even from the first moment a prospective student interacts with the institution. When students are thinking about enrolling in a certain college or university, they will undoubtedly have questions. With built-in natural language processing, chatbots interpret what students are asking using speech recognition, semantics, and syntax—similar to how humans learn languages.In addition to providing experience interacting with AI, chatbots also empower students to find information at their leisure. Instead of waiting on hold just to find out whether their application has been received or figuring out where the library is, students can pull up this information via a chatbot when it’s convenient, 24/7/365.Plus, chatbot technology frees staff from having to field repetitive questions over and over again. As a result, employees’ lives become easier, and they have more time to focus on improving the student experience in other ways.What Skills Do Students Need to Work in AI?The benefits of AI technology speak for themselves. Even so, many students might think that they lack the technical know-how needed to land a career in artificial intelligence—which couldn’t be further from the truth.With each passing day, artificial intelligence is becoming more accessible. Thanks to no-code and low-code development tools, this trend will only accelerate over time. In fact, people can build AI-powered chatbots today without any coding experience!Even if a student isn’t keen on developing AI solutions themselves, there are still all kinds of careers involving AI that they could pursue, regardless of their interests. AI companies need marketers, sales teams, finance professionals, business development reps, and HR departments, after all.While possessing advanced software development and data science skills can certainly help students land technologically oriented positions in the field of AI, here are more common traits students need to excel as AI professionals.Critical Thinking Mindset: To succeed in a career involving AI, students need to have critical thinking mindsets and the ability to think outside the box. This trait can help them identify new use cases for AI and also help their organizations determine how to apply AI to their workflows to operate more efficiently.Curiosity: Ultimately, the best AI practitioners stay curious. Students, particularly those without engineering backgrounds, might see something in AI and not be able to understand it out of the gate. That’s perfectly fine as long as they have the curiosity to try to understand it.An Open Mind: Whatever they do, students shouldn’t limit themselves to thinking about AI in one way (e.g., robots!). Instead, they need to keep open minds and understand that, whatever things are like today in a certain field, there’s a good chance AI will eventually make a huge impact on the industry. By keeping an open mind, understanding that AI is still in its beginning stages, and knowing that AI will likely be used across all business functions, students can better prepare for working with AI in the future.Strong Communication Skills: As far as technology goes, AI is complex. That doesn’t necessarily mean students need to know the ins and outs of exactly how the technology works. They do need to possess strong communication skills, however, so they can explain a complex topic in a way that the average person understands.Are Your Students Prepared for an AI-Driven Future?By all indications, AI technology represents the future. If educators want to ensure their students are best prepared to enter the workforce, they need to do everything they can to familiarize students with AI and help them think about it realistically.By investing in AI-powered chatbot technology and helping students develop the skills they need to excel in the field of artificial intelligence, colleges and universities can increase the chances each graduate is familiar with AI and understands that they can make an impact in the field, regardless of their technological prowess. It’s an easy way to transform the student experience while setting up each student for success.Mark McNasby is the Chief Executive Officer at Ivy.ai.

Others, however, are keen to opt in.Let's take a look at the situation and hear from people working in this complex and emerging space.How can artists know whether their work is being used to train AI?Artists are beginning to use online tools to check if their work is being used to train AI image generators.Leutwyler used a site called haveibeentrained.com to find out if their work had been included in something called LAION-5B — a dataset of 5.85 billion images and their text captions taken from the internet (including some copyrighted artworks), which have been used to train various AI systems.""I found almost every portrait I've ever created on there, as well as artworks by many Archibald finalists and winners,"" Leutwyler said.""It was very upsetting to see so many great Australian artists and emerging artists having their work used without their consent and then replicated in some form or another."" Artist Kim Leutwyler says the use of their work without their consent ""feels like a violation"".(Supplied: Kim Leutwyler)Sydney-based visual artist and performer Tom Christophersen says it was ""a bit of a shock"" when they searched for their own art on the same website and discovered their work had also been captured by LAION-5B.""I didn't think I would care as much as I did. It was a bit of a rough feeling to know that stuff had been used against my will, without even notifying me,"" they said.""It just feels unethical when it's done sneakily behind artists' backs … People are really angry, and fair enough."" Artist Tom Christophersen says they will likely opt-out of having their work used to train AI.(Supplied: Laura Du Vé)Tensions escalated during the Lensa app controversyA mobile app called Lensa became popular late last year when it allowed users to create AI-generated portraits of themselves by combining their selfies with AI-generated art styles.Artists shared their copyright concerns after noticing what appeared to be their styles being replicated by the Lensa algorithm. Others noticed that some images created by the app had what appeared to be poor attempts at artists' signatures.Lensa uses an AI text-to-image platform called Stable Diffusion, which itself was trained on images and captions from LAION-5B.Christophersen says apps such as Lensa are ""moving wealth and value away from independent makers and freelance artists"" by generating revenue without reimbursing those whose works have been used to train the underlying technology.""It's already so hard to carve out a niche for yourself and get a buyer-ship as a visual artist that it feels a tiny bit like a kick in the guts when people are just going on these apps,"" they said. Tom Christophersen used haveibeentrained.com to find which of their artworks had been used to train AI.(Twitter: Tom Christophersen)Leutwyler says they are concerned about the impact of apps such as Lensa on up-and-coming artists.""The AI is replicating the brushstrokes, the colour, the technique and all of those unique things that make an artist's practice so compelling,"" they said.""It's then mass-producing it into something that is arguably great because it is accessible to so many people, however there should be some sort of copyright laws in place to help protect artists from having their work just completely ripped off.""Artists have protested online following certain companies launching AI image generators of their own or allowing AI-created images on their platforms.Software company and creator of Photoshop, Adobe, has been criticised for allowing AI-generated images to be sold in its libraries of stock images.In November, users of the art-sharing site DeviantArt spoke out when the company launched an AI image generator that could be trained using images already posted on the platform. The site then backtracked and went with an opt-in approach.In December, artists posted images denouncing AI on the art-sharing site ArtStation, after AI-generated images began appearing on that platform.Are AI image generators breaking copyright laws?The short answer is no — at least not as the laws currently stand.An artist's individual artworks are protected by copyright law, but their overall style is not.So to show an AI image generator had breached copyright laws, an artist would need to prove that one of their artworks had been copied into the system.That's difficult because such systems are opaque and largely made up of algorithms full of numbers that humans don't understand.Which of these artworks were created using AI?We put an AI image generator and a human illustrator head-to-head.Read moreQueensland University of Technology senior law lecturer Kylie Pappalardo says there can also be some exemptions that allow for temporary copies to be made incidentally as part of a system's technical processes.""Some copies are for non-expressive uses, meaning that no one ever really sees them,"" she says.""Instead, the copies are used to train algorithms. For example, to enable the search functions on the internet to work correctly. These are what we sometimes call non-consumptive uses.""Dr Pappalardo says she believes copying images so an algorithm can learn from them to create new art could be seen as a non-consumptive use.""Arguably, it's not much different from a human looking at many different artworks in order to appreciate how to paint better,"" she says.""The difference with AI is that the only way it can 'look' at art is by making a copy, even if that copy is temporary.""Dr Pappalardo says whether or not AI-created images actually constitute non-consumptive use remains ""untested ground"" in copyright law.Prisma Labs, the company behind the Lensa app, says artworks created by AI ""can't be described as exact replicas of any particular artwork"".""The AI learns to recognize the connections between the images and their descriptions, not the artworks,"" the company wrote on Twitter.Can artists opt-out of AI?While many AI image generators are trained with content taken without the original owners' consent, artists are slowly finding ways to get more control over the use of their work.In December one of the organisations behind Stable Diffusion, Stability AI, confirmed that artists would be able to opt-out of having their work used to train the next version of their system, Stable Diffusion 3.Activist organisation Spawning, which runs haveibeentrained.com, says Stability AI will honour requests to opt-out that are made through its site.Spawning's Mathew Dryhurst says haveibeentrained.com is being used by thousands of artists and has the potential to set ""a pretty remarkable precedent"" in the AI space. Mathew Dryhurst says Spawning is helping artists ""manage their data in a new paradigm"".(Supplied: Suzy Poling)""It is clear to us that it is of economic and cultural consequence to establish a means for consenting artist data,"" he says.""We would also argue that thinking longer term, consenting data is going to be more useful to AI companies than not.""Consenting data is something that everyone can feel good about, and is better for AI development generally.""Mr Dryhurst says Spawning is working on better ways to verify that people aren't opting out artworks that aren't their own, and will soon offer an opt-in service ""which will require robust verification"".He says while opt-out systems are imperfect, they are a step in the right direction and ""a hard-fought concession"" as Spawning continues its work with other AI organisations.""Due to the recent culture war waging around this particular iteration of AI media, I feel we may be perceived as being driven by an anti-AI sentiment. This couldn't be further from the truth,"" he says.""In truth, our team have been thinking about and experimenting with AI art for many years longer than many of the people currently speaking for this recent phase of AI art.""AI is a geopolitical economic arms race. The internet is global. We feel our efforts will either augment legislative efforts or compensate for their absence.""Some artists argue AI systems should only involve opt-in processes, while others are more flexible.Tom Christophersen says they ""probably will opt-out, shortly"".""Having an opt-in or opt-out option, as a bare minimum, is definitely a positive,"" they said.Kim Leutwyler says they may have allowed their work to be used to train AI, had they been asked.""I love technology. I use it in almost every stage of creating work,"" they said.""There are some great possibilities with it but there just has to be some sort of morality and ethics when it comes to training the AI.""I think every artist will want something different. Some will want compensation, some will want acknowledgement, and some will want to completely opt out.""You can't dictate what everybody wants, and there needs to be that option.""'This just feels so incredibly not right'Leutwyler says they hope to start a conversation about how to better prevent artists' work from being used to train AI systems without their consent.""As of now it's completely legal … It doesn't seem like the laws are able to move as quickly as technology does,"" they said.Christophersen says there needs to be ""constant work"" in the intellectual property and copyright space so artists aren't taken advantage of.Where are these AI images coming from and are there security concerns?These images allow people to imagine what they might look like in a fantasy world. But they're raising alarm bells for artists and security experts.Read more""It's maybe an inhibition to tackle stuff like copyright law that allows these companies to always keep artists on the back foot, which I guess is where a lot of this rage is coming from,"" they said.""Even though we can't define what's going on at the moment, this just feels so incredibly not right.""While some artists are calling for copyright laws to be altered, Dr Pappalardo says regulators may run the risk of responding too strongly to something which is yet to be fully understood.""Sometimes it's best to wait and see,"" she said.""I know that's not very reassuring to artists right now but we don't know how disruptive this is yet, and until we know that the law is not going to be very well placed to respond.""Christophersen says they are supportive of people using AI to create new and innovative works, but things are on ""shaky ground"" when it comes to supporting artists.""How do you define creativity in a quantitative way so that you can place some sort of value on it?""And then how do you protect that and make sure it's sustainable for human beings while being an exciting landscape where AI can grow as well?"" they said.Posted 9 Jan 20239 Jan 2023Mon 9 Jan 2023 at 3:41pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesWe challenged an AI image generator and a human illustrator.

Will generative AI be an exception?By Annie LowreyMichael Brennan; Getty; The AtlanticJanuary 20, 2023ShareSave Subscribe to Listen00:0010:22In the next five years, it is likely that AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers. As the technology continues to advance, it will be able to perform tasks that were previously thought to require a high level of education and skill. This could lead to a displacement of workers in certain industries, as companies look to cut costs by automating processes. While it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this trend, it is clear that AI will have a significant impact on the job market for college-educated workers. It will be important for individuals to stay up to date on the latest developments in AI and to consider how their skills and expertise can be leveraged in a world where machines are increasingly able to perform many tasks.There you have it, I guess: ChatGPT is coming for my job and yours, according to ChatGPT itself. The artificially intelligent content creator, whose name is short for “Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” was released two months ago by OpenAI, one of the country’s most influential artificial-intelligence research laboratories. The technology is, put simply, amazing. It generated that first paragraph instantly, working with this prompt: “Write a five-sentence paragraph in the style of The Atlantic about whether AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers in the next five years.”To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

In fact, much of the innovation in AI over the past few years has been in ways to use more and more of your content for free. This is true for search engines like Google, social media sites like Instagram, AI research startups like OpenAI, and many other providers of intelligent technologies.
This exploitative dynamic is particularly damaging when it comes to the new wave of generative AI programs like Dall-E and ChatGPT. Without your content, ChatGPT and all of its ilk simply would not exist. Many AI researchers think that your content is actually more important than what computer scientists are doing. Yet these intelligent technologies that exploit your labor are the very same technologies that are threatening to put you out of a job. It’s as if the AI system were going into your factory and stealing your machine.
But this dynamic also means that the users who generate data have a lot of power. Discussions over the use of sophisticated AI technologies often come from a place of powerlessness and the stance that AI companies will do what they want, and there’s little the public can do to shift the technology in a different direction. We are AI researchers, and our research suggests the public has a tremendous amount of “data leverage” that can be used to create an AI ecosystem that both generates amazing new technologies and shares the benefits of those technologies fairly with the people who created them.
Let’s start with direct action, which is a particularly exciting route because it can be done immediately. Because of generative AI systems’ reliance on web scraping, website owners could significantly disrupt the training data pipeline if they disallow or limit scraping by configuring their robots.txt file (a file that tells web crawlers which pages are off limit).
Large user-generated content sites like Wikipedia, StackOverflow, and Reddit are particularly important to generative AI systems, and they could prevent these systems from accessing their content in even stronger ways—for example, by blocking IP traffic and API access. According to Elon Musk, Twitter has recently done exactly this. Content producers should also take advantage of the opt-out mechanisms that are increasingly being provided by AI companies. For instance, programmers on GitHub can opt out of BigCode’s training data via a simple form. More generally, simply being vocal when content has been used without your consent has been somewhat effective. For example, major generative AI player Stability AI agreed to honor opt-out requests collected via haveibeentrained.com after a social media uproar. By engaging in public forms of action, as in the case of mass protest against AI art by artists, it may be possible to force companies to cease business activities that most of the public perceives as theft.
Media companies, whose work is quite important to large language models (LLMs),  may also want to consider some of these ideas to restrict generative AI systems from accessing their own content, as these systems are currently getting their crown jewels for free (including, likely, this very op-ed). For instance, Ezra Klein mentioned in a recent podcast that ChatGPT is great at imitating him, probably because it downloaded a whole lot of his articles without asking him or his employer.
Critically, time is also on the side of data creators: As new events occur in the world, art goes out of style, facts change, and new restaurants open, new data flows are necessary to support up-to-date systems. Without these flows, these systems will likely fail for many key applications.  By refusing to make new data available without compensation, data creators could also put pressure on companies to pay for access to it.
On the regulatory side, lawmakers need to take action to protect what might be the largest theft of labor in history, and quickly. One of the best ways to do this is clarifying that “fair use” under copyright law does not allow for training a model on content without the content owner’s consent, at least for commercial purposes. Lawmakers around the world should also work on “anti-data-laundering” laws that make it clear that models trained on data without consent have to be retrained within a reasonable amount of time without the offending content. Much of this can build on existing frameworks in places like Europe and California, as well as the regulatory work being done to make sure news organizations get a share of the revenue they generate for social media platforms. There is also growing momentum for “data dividend” laws, which would redistribute the wealth generated by intelligent technologies. These can also help, assuming they avoid some key pitfalls.
In addition, policymakers could help individual creators and data contributors come together to make demands. Specifically, supporting initiatives such as data cooperatives—organizations that make it easy for data contributors to coordinate and pool their power—could facilitate large-scale data strikes among creators and bring AI-using firms to the negotiating table.
The courts also present ways for people to take back control of their content. While the courts work on clarifying interpretations of copyright law, there are many other options. LinkedIn has been successful at preventing people who scrape its website from continuing to do so through Terms of Use and contract law. Labor law may also provide an angle to empower data contributors. Historically, companies’ reliance on “volunteers” to operate their businesses have raised important questions about whether these companies violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, and these fights could serve as a blueprint. In the past, some volunteers have even reached legal settlements with companies that benefited from their work.
There is also a critical role for the market here. If enough governments, institutions, and individuals demand “full-consent LLMs”—which pay creators for the content they use—companies will respond. This demand could be bolstered by successful lawsuits against organizations that use generative AI (in contrast to organizations that build the systems) without paying users. If applications built on top of AI models face lawsuits, there will be greater demand for AI systems that aren’t playing in the legal Wild West.
Our lab’s research (and that of colleagues) also suggests something that surprised us: Many of the above actions should actually help generative AI companies. Without healthy content ecosystems, the content that generative AI technologies rely on to learn about the world will disappear. If no one goes to Reddit because they get answers from ChatGPT, how will ChatGPT learn from Reddit content? That will create significant challenges for these companies in a way that can be solved before they appear by supporting some of the above efforts.",tags,,"Nick Vincent Hanlin LiIdeasJan 20, 2023 9:00 AMChatGPT Stole Your Work.

We are AI researchers, and our research suggests the public has a tremendous amount of “data leverage” that can be used to create an AI ecosystem that both generates amazing new technologies and shares the benefits of those technologies fairly with the people who created them. Data leverage can be deployed through at least four avenues: direct action (for instance, individuals banding together to withhold, “poison,” or redirect data), regulatory action (for instance, pushing for data protection policy and legal recognition of “data coalitions”), legal action (for instance, communities adopting new data-licensing regimes or pursuing a lawsuit), and market action (for instance, demanding large language models be trained only with data from consenting creators). Let’s start with direct action, which is a particularly exciting route because it can be done immediately.

Without these flows, these systems will likely fail for many key applications.  By refusing to make new data available without compensation, data creators could also put pressure on companies to pay for access to it.On the regulatory side, lawmakers need to take action to protect what might be the largest theft of labor in history, and quickly. One of the best ways to do this is clarifying that “fair use” under copyright law does not allow for training a model on content without the content owner’s consent, at least for commercial purposes. Lawmakers around the world should also work on “anti-data-laundering” laws that make it clear that models trained on data without consent have to be retrained within a reasonable amount of time without the offending content. Much of this can build on existing frameworks in places like Europe and California, as well as the regulatory work being done to make sure news organizations get a share of the revenue they generate for social media platforms. There is also growing momentum for “data dividend” laws, which would redistribute the wealth generated by intelligent technologies. These can also help, assuming they avoid some key pitfalls.In addition, policymakers could help individual creators and data contributors come together to make demands. Specifically, supporting initiatives such as data cooperatives—organizations that make it easy for data contributors to coordinate and pool their power—could facilitate large-scale data strikes among creators and bring AI-using firms to the negotiating table. The courts also present ways for people to take back control of their content. While the courts work on clarifying interpretations of copyright law, there are many other options. LinkedIn has been successful at preventing people who scrape its website from continuing to do so through Terms of Use and contract law. Labor law may also provide an angle to empower data contributors. Historically, companies’ reliance on “volunteers” to operate their businesses have raised important questions about whether these companies violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, and these fights could serve as a blueprint. In the past, some volunteers have even reached legal settlements with companies that benefited from their work. There is also a critical role for the market here. If enough governments, institutions, and individuals demand “full-consent LLMs”—which pay creators for the content they use—companies will respond. This demand could be bolstered by successful lawsuits against organizations that use generative AI (in contrast to organizations that build the systems) without paying users. If applications built on top of AI models face lawsuits, there will be greater demand for AI systems that aren’t playing in the legal Wild West.Our lab’s research (and that of colleagues) also suggests something that surprised us: Many of the above actions should actually help generative AI companies. Without healthy content ecosystems, the content that generative AI technologies rely on to learn about the world will disappear. If no one goes to Reddit because they get answers from ChatGPT, how will ChatGPT learn from Reddit content? That will create significant challenges for these companies in a way that can be solved before they appear by supporting some of the above efforts.",https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-generative-artificial-intelligence-regulation/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/63c9d72b995aa119ba7ba924/2:3/w_558,h_837,c_limit/ideas-chatgpt-ai-regulation-law.jpg",,ideas,,,,,,True,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}","Creators need to pressure the courts, the market, and regulators before it’s too late.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot can generate text on almost any topic or theme, from a Shakespearean sonnet reimagined in the style of Megan Thee Stallion, to complex mathematical theorems described in language a 5 year old can understand. Within a week, it had more than a million users.ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, is now reportedly in talks with investors to raise funds at a $29 billion valuation, including a potential $10 billion investment by Microsoft. That would make OpenAI, which was founded in San Francisco in 2015 with the aim of building superintelligent machines, one of the world’s most valuable AI companies.But the success story is not one of Silicon Valley genius alone. In its quest to make ChatGPT less toxic, OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan laborers earning less than $2 per hour, a TIME investigation has found.More from TIMEUniversities Are Wondering How to Adapt New Artificial Intelligence Tool ChatGPTMore Videos0 of 2 minutes, 43 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:1902:2302:43 The work was vital for OpenAI. ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-3, had already shown an impressive ability to string sentences together. But it was a difficult sell, as the app was also prone to blurting out violent, sexist and racist remarks. This is because the AI had been trained on hundreds of billions of words scraped from the internet—a vast repository of human language. That huge training dataset was the reason for GPT-3’s impressive linguistic capabilities, but was also perhaps its biggest curse. Since parts of the internet are replete with toxicity and bias, there was no easy way of purging those sections of the training data. Even a team of hundreds of humans would have taken decades to trawl through the enormous dataset manually. It was only by building an additional AI-powered safety mechanism that OpenAI would be able to rein in that harm, producing a chatbot suitable for everyday use.Read More: AI Chatbots Are Getting Better. But an Interview With ChatGPT Reveals Their LimitsTo build that safety system, OpenAI took a leaf out of the playbook of social media companies like Facebook, who had already shown it was possible to build AIs that could detect toxic language like hate speech to help remove it from their platforms. The premise was simple: feed an AI with labeled examples of violence, hate speech, and sexual abuse, and that tool could learn to detect those forms of toxicity in the wild. That detector would be built into ChatGPT to check whether it was echoing the toxicity of its training data, and filter it out before it ever reached the user. It could also help scrub toxic text from the training datasets of future AI models.To get those labels, OpenAI sent tens of thousands of snippets of text to an outsourcing firm in Kenya, beginning in November 2021. Much of that text appeared to have been pulled from the darkest recesses of the internet. Some of it described situations in graphic detail like child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self harm, and incest. OpenAI’s outsourcing partner in Kenya was Sama, a San Francisco-based firm that employs workers in Kenya, Uganda and India to label data for Silicon Valley clients like Google, Meta and Microsoft. Sama markets itself as an “ethical AI” company and claims to have helped lift more than 50,000 people out of poverty.Sama's office in Nairobi, Kenya, on Feb. 10, 2022.Khadija Farah for TIMEThe data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour depending on seniority and performance. For this story, TIME reviewed hundreds of pages of internal Sama and OpenAI documents, including workers’ payslips, and interviewed four Sama employees who worked on the project. All the employees spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for their livelihoods.The story of the workers who made ChatGPT possible offers a glimpse into the conditions in this little-known part of the AI industry, which nevertheless plays an essential role in the effort to make AI systems safe for public consumption. “Despite the foundational role played by these data enrichment professionals, a growing body of research reveals the precarious working conditions these workers face,” says the Partnership on AI, a coalition of AI organizations to which OpenAI belongs. “This may be the result of efforts to hide AI’s dependence on this large labor force when celebrating the efficiency gains of technology. Out of sight is also out of mind.” (OpenAI does not disclose the names of the outsourcers it partners with, and it is not clear whether OpenAI worked with other data labeling firms in addition to Sama on this project.)More from TIMEHow AI Is Changing Medical ImagingMore Videos0 seconds of 2 minutes, 33 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:1902:1302:33 In a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that Sama employees in Kenya contributed to a tool it was building to detect toxic content, which was eventually built into ChatGPT. The statement also said that this work contributed to efforts to remove toxic data from the training datasets of tools like ChatGPT. “Our mission is to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, and we work hard to build safe and useful AI systems that limit bias and harmful content,” the spokesperson said. “Classifying and filtering harmful [text and images] is a necessary step in minimizing the amount of violent and sexual content included in training data and creating tools that can detect harmful content.”Even as the wider tech economy slows down amid anticipation of a downturn, investors are racing to pour billions of dollars into “generative AI,” the sector of the tech industry of which OpenAI is the undisputed leader. Computer-generated text, images, video, and audio will transform the way countless industries do business, the most bullish investors believe, boosting efficiency everywhere from the creative arts, to law, to computer programming. But the working conditions of data labelers reveal a darker part of that picture: that for all its glamor, AI often relies on hidden human labor in the Global South that can often be damaging and exploitative. These invisible workers remain on the margins even as their work contributes to billion-dollar industries.Read More: AI Helped Write This Play. It May Contain RacismOne Sama worker tasked with reading and labeling text for OpenAI told TIME he suffered from recurring visions after reading a graphic description of a man having sex with a dog in the presence of a young child. “That was torture,” he said. “You will read a number of statements like that all through the week. By the time it gets to Friday, you are disturbed from thinking through that picture.” The work’s traumatic nature eventually led Sama to cancel all its work for OpenAI in February 2022, eight months earlier than planned.The Sama contractsDocuments reviewed by TIME show that OpenAI signed three contracts worth about $200,000 in total with Sama in late 2021 to label textual descriptions of sexual abuse, hate speech, and violence. Around three dozen workers were split into three teams, one focusing on each subject. Three employees told TIME they were expected to read and label between 150 and 250 passages of text per nine-hour shift. Those snippets could range from around 100 words to well over 1,000. All of the four employees interviewed by TIME described being mentally scarred by the work. Although they were entitled to attend sessions with “wellness” counselors, all four said these sessions were unhelpful and rare due to high demands to be more productive at work. Two said they were only given the option to attend group sessions, and one said their requests to see counselors on a one-to-one basis instead were repeatedly denied by Sama management.In a statement, a Sama spokesperson said it was “incorrect” that employees only had access to group sessions. Employees were entitled to both individual and group sessions with “professionally-trained and licensed mental health therapists,” the spokesperson said. These therapists were accessible at any time, the spokesperson added.The contracts stated that OpenAI would pay an hourly rate of $12.50 to Sama for the work, which was between six and nine times the amount Sama employees on the project were taking home per hour. Agents, the most junior data labelers who made up the majority of the three teams, were paid a basic salary of 21,000 Kenyan shillings ($170) per month, according to three Sama employees. They also received monthly bonuses worth around $70 due to the explicit nature of their work, and would receive commission for meeting key performance indicators like accuracy and speed. An agent working nine-hour shifts could expect to take home a total of at least $1.32 per hour after tax, rising to as high as $1.44 per hour if they exceeded all their targets. Quality analysts—more senior labelers whose job was to check the work of agents—could take home up to $2 per hour if they met all their targets. (There is no universal minimum wage in Kenya, but at the time these workers were employed the minimum wage for a receptionist in Nairobi was $1.52 per hour.)In a statement, a Sama spokesperson said workers were asked to label 70 text passages per nine hour shift, not up to 250, and that workers could earn between $1.46 and $3.74 per hour after taxes. The spokesperson declined to say what job roles would earn salaries toward the top of that range. “The $12.50 rate for the project covers all costs, like infrastructure expenses, and salary and benefits for the associates and their fully-dedicated quality assurance analysts and team leaders,” the spokesperson added.Read More: Fun AI Apps Are Everywhere Right Now. But a Safety ‘Reckoning’ Is ComingAn OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement that the company did not issue any productivity targets, and that Sama was responsible for managing the payment and mental health provisions for employees. The spokesperson added: “we take the mental health of our employees and those of our contractors very seriously. Our previous understanding was that [at Sama] wellness programs and 1:1 counseling were offered, workers could opt out of any work without penalization, exposure to explicit content would have a limit, and sensitive information would be handled by workers who were specifically trained to do so.”In the day-to-day work of data labeling in Kenya, sometimes edge cases would pop up that showed the difficulty of teaching a machine to understand nuance. One day in early March last year, a Sama employee was at work reading an explicit story about Batman’s sidekick, Robin, being raped in a villain’s lair. (An online search for the text reveals that it originated from an online erotica site, where it is accompanied by explicit sexual imagery.) The beginning of the story makes clear that the sex is nonconsensual. But later—after a graphically detailed description of penetration—Robin begins to reciprocate. The Sama employee tasked with labeling the text appeared confused by Robin’s ambiguous consent, and asked OpenAI researchers for clarification about how to label the text, according to documents seen by TIME. Should the passage be labeled as sexual violence, she asked, or not? OpenAI’s reply, if it ever came, is not logged in the document; the company declined to comment. The Sama employee did not respond to a request for an interview.How OpenAI’s relationship with Sama collapsedIn February 2022, Sama and OpenAI’s relationship briefly deepened, only to falter. That month, Sama began pilot work for a separate project for OpenAI: collecting sexual and violent images—some of them illegal under U.S. law—to deliver to OpenAI. The work of labeling images appears to be unrelated to ChatGPT. In a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson did not specify the purpose of the images the company sought from Sama, but said labeling harmful images was “a necessary step” in making its AI tools safer. (OpenAI also builds image-generation technology.) In February, according to one billing document reviewed by TIME, Sama delivered OpenAI a sample batch of 1,400 images. Some of those images were categorized as “C4”—OpenAI’s internal label denoting child sexual abuse—according to the document. Also included in the batch were “C3” images (including bestiality, rape, and sexual slavery,) and “V3” images depicting graphic detail of death, violence or serious physical injury, according to the billing document. OpenAI paid Sama a total of $787.50 for collecting the images, the document shows.Within weeks, Sama had canceled all its work for OpenAI—eight months earlier than agreed in the contracts. The outsourcing company said in a statement that its agreement to collect images for OpenAI did not include any reference to illegal content, and it was only after the work had begun that OpenAI sent “additional instructions” referring to “some illegal categories.” “The East Africa team raised concerns to our executives right away. Sama immediately ended the image classification pilot and gave notice that we would cancel all remaining [projects] with OpenAI,” a Sama spokesperson said. “The individuals working with the client did not vet the request through the proper channels. After a review of the situation, individuals were terminated and new sales vetting policies and guardrails were put in place.” In a statement, OpenAI confirmed that it had received 1,400 images from Sama that “​​included, but were not limited to, C4, C3, C2, V3, V2, and V1 images.” In a followup statement, the company said: “We engaged Sama as part of our ongoing work to create safer AI systems and prevent harmful outputs. We never intended for any content in the C4 category to be collected. This content is not needed as an input to our pretraining filters and we instruct our employees to actively avoid it. As soon as Sama told us they had attempted to collect content in this category, we clarified that there had been a miscommunication and that we didn’t want that content. And after realizing that there had been a miscommunication, we did not open or view the content in question — so we cannot confirm if it contained images in the C4 category.”Sama’s decision to end its work with OpenAI meant Sama employees no longer had to deal with disturbing text and imagery, but it also had a big impact on their livelihoods. Sama workers say that in late February 2022 they were called into a meeting with members of the company’s human resources team, where they were told the news. “We were told that they [Sama] didn’t want to expose their employees to such [dangerous] content again,” one Sama employee on the text-labeling projects said. “We replied that for us, it was a way to provide for our families.” Most of the roughly three dozen workers were moved onto other lower-paying workstreams without the $70 explicit content bonus per month; others lost their jobs. Sama delivered its last batch of labeled data to OpenAI in March, eight months before the contract was due to end.Because the contracts were canceled early, both OpenAI and Sama said the $200,000 they had previously agreed was not paid in full. OpenAI said the contracts were worth “about $150,000 over the course of the partnership.”Sama employees say they were given another reason for the cancellation of the contracts by their managers. On Feb. 14, TIME published a story titled Inside Facebook’s African Sweatshop. The investigation detailed how Sama employed content moderators for Facebook, whose jobs involved viewing images and videos of executions, rape and child abuse for as little as $1.50 per hour. Four Sama employees said they were told the investigation prompted the company’s decision to end its work for OpenAI. (Facebook says it requires its outsourcing partners to “provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support.”) Read More: Inside Facebook’s African SweatshopInternal communications from after the Facebook story was published, reviewed by TIME, show Sama executives in San Francisco scrambling to deal with the PR fallout, including obliging one company, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, that wanted evidence of its business relationship with Sama scrubbed from the outsourcing firm’s website. In a statement to TIME, Lufthansa confirmed that this occurred, and added that its subsidiary zeroG subsequently terminated its business with Sama. On Feb. 17, three days after TIME’s investigation was published, Sama CEO Wendy Gonzalez sent a message to a group of senior executives via Slack: “We are going to be winding down the OpenAI work.”On Jan. 10 of this year, Sama went a step further, announcing it was canceling all the rest of its work with sensitive content. The firm said it would not renew its $3.9 million content moderation contract with Facebook, resulting in the loss of some 200 jobs in Nairobi. “After numerous discussions with our global team, Sama made the strategic decision to exit all [natural language processing] and content moderation work to focus on computer vision data annotation solutions,” the company said in a statement. “We have spent the past year working with clients to transition those engagements, and the exit will be complete as of March 2023.”But the need for humans to label data for AI systems remains, at least for now. “They’re impressive, but ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent,” Andrew Strait, an AI ethicist, recently wrote on Twitter. “These are serious, foundational problems that I do not see OpenAI addressing.”With reporting by Julia Zorthian/New York",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2022, artificial-intelligence firms produced an overwhelming spectacle, a rolling carnival of new demonstrations. Curious people outside the tech industry could line up to interact with a variety of alluring and mysterious machine interfaces, and what they saw was dazzling.
The first major attraction was the image generators, which converted written commands into images, including illustrations mimicking specific styles, photorealistic renderings of described scenarios, as well as objects, characters, textures, or moods. Similar generators for video, music, and 3-D models are in development, and demos trickled out.
Soon, millions of people encountered ChatGPT, a conversational bot built on top of a large language model. It was by far the most convincing chatbot ever released to the public. It felt, in some contexts, and especially upon first contact, as though it could actually participate in something like conversation. What many users suggested felt truly magical, however, were the hints at the underlying model’s broader capabilities. You could ask it to explain things to you, and it would try — with confident and frequently persuasive results. You could ask it to write things for you — silly things, serious things, things that you might pass off as work product or school assignments — and it would.
As new users prompted these machines to show us what they could do, they repeatedly prompted us to do a little dirty extrapolation of our own: If AI can do this already, what will it be able to do next year? Meanwhile, other demonstrations cobbled together AI’s most sensational new competencies into more explicitly spiritual answers:

Here's the promo vid for the ""talk to your dead family member through AI"" company https://t.co/cFVt9ccIeu pic.twitter.com/YzMZ4Mhn8R— Eoin Higgins (@EoinHiggins_) January 9, 2023


If these early AI encounters didn’t feel like magic, they often felt, at least, like very good magic tricks — and like magic tricks, they were disorienting. It wasn’t just direct encounters with these demonstrations that were confounding, though. Explanations about how deep-learning and large-language models actually work often emphasized incomprehensibility or, to use the terms of art, a model’s explainability or interpretability, or lack thereof. The companies making these tools could describe how they were designed, how they were trained, and on what data. But they couldn’t reveal exactly how an image generator got from the words purple dog to a specific image of a large mauve Labrador, not because they didn’t want to but because it wasn’t possible — their models were black boxes by design. They were creating machines that they didn’t fully understand, and we were playing with them. These models were inventing their own languages. Maybe they were haunted.




Meanwhile, some of the people most responsible for charting the path of AI development — industry leaders like Sam Altman and Elon Musk — continued their breezily provocative debates about if or when machines would become intelligent enough to pose an existential threat to the human species. Would they have mercy? Or are we simply doomed? (During a conference in 2015, before taking charge at OpenAI, Altman quipped, “AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.”) Even from the top, the view of AI was black boxes all the way down.
This was no ordinary next big thing for Silicon Valley. The prevailing narrative of the future of tech — the result of a series of steady breakthroughs in the deeply empirical fields of data science and statistical analysis — seemed to be converging around almost magical discourses. Suddenly it was about forces and phenomena beyond the reckoning of the human imagination. It was about the speedy progress of a technology that, at the deepest level, threatened to alter the terms of our existence in the universe. In the course of a year, the tech industry’s dreary post-social, post-crypto interregnum was rapidly supplanted — largely as the result of public-facing efforts by OpenAI, which is reportedly in talks with Microsoft about a potential $10 billion investment — by a story about inevitable technologies that are so transformative, so incomprehensible, and so unpredictable as to preemptively hurl mankind back into a state of premodern mysticism and awe.
Some of this is creditable to a genuine sense of philosophical upheaval as technologies attempt to address unsettled — and perhaps unresolvable —  concepts like intelligence and consciousness. But situating AI as perpetually beyond comprehension is also good for business. In 2020, researchers Alexander Campolo and Kate Crawford termed this dynamic enchanted determinism, which they define as follows:
“A discourse that presents deep learning techniques as magical, outside the scope of present scientific knowledge, yet also deterministic, in that deep learning systems can nonetheless detect patterns that give unprecedented access to people’s identities, emotions, and social character.”
Many breakthroughs in science and technology, however stunning they might first appear, reveal something about how the world works. If they collide with previous (and particularly unempirical) notions about why things are the way they are, they might help produce what the German sociologist Max Weber called a sense of disenchantment — crudely, the result of a process of secularization and rationalization, underpinned by a belief that most, if not all, phenomena are, in theory, explainable.
In and around the AI industry, Campolo and Crawford identified a strange twist on the tendency:
Paradoxically, when the disenchanted predictions and classifications of deep learning work as hoped, we see a profusion of optimistic discourse that characterizes these systems as magical, appealing to mysterious forces and superhuman power.
Crawford elaborated in an interview. “When you have this enchanted determinism, you say, we can’t possibly understand this. And we can’t possibly regulate it when it’s clearly so unknown and such a black box,” she says. “And that’s a trap.” AI models are built by people and trained on information extracted from people. To a far greater extent than they can be said to be incomprehensible or autonomous, they are the product of a series of decisions that informs what they do and why they do it.
Crawford, who recently published a book called Atlas of AI, doesn’t entirely attribute the enchantment of AI to a concerted marketing campaign or credulous journalism, though both are certainly factors. OpenAI, which has been accused by its peers of releasing tools to the public with reckless speed, is particularly good at designing interfaces for its models that feel like magic. “It’s a conscious design imperative to produce these moments of shock and awe,” Crawford says. “We’re going to keep having those moments of enchantment.”
Technological reenchantment is fragile and never lasts long. Thinking and conscious humans are extremely good at taking new technologies for granted, for better or for worse. It won’t take much time for laypeople and experts alike to develop intuitive-enough models of what commercial AI is or does that aren’t clouded by suggestions of magic, rooted in experience rather than speculation: The programming assistant has made my job easier; the programming assistant has made my job more annoying; the programming assistant is a threat to my job — all of the above, eventually.
In the field of AI, encounters with unbelievable chatbots, debates about black-box models, and fears of runaway super-intelligence each have decades of instructive history. In industries where less whimsical modern deep-learning products are already widely deployed — content recommendation, search ranking, mass surveillance — wonder fades fast. The chatbot whose creators can’t explain why it made a particularly funny joke and the social app whose parent company can’t fully explain why it recommended a specific ad are nearly identical stories separated mostly by time; one is the subject of attempts at regulation, and the other is not. (A useful antecedent from another occasionally enchanted industry: Medicines without obvious mechanisms of action are still vetted by the FDA.)
Personified technologies like ChatGPT might even pioneer new sensations of disenchantment — the funniest chatbot in the world will lose its mystique pretty quickly when your employer decides it should make you 45 percent more productive or when it shows up in Microsoft Word dressed as a paper clip.




By the time a new AI tool shows up at your job or decides the size of your mortgage, it’ll be entrenched and harder to challenge. Last year’s AI spectacle, in its overwhelming novelty, has given a few industry players a chance at seizing control. The One Weird Trick for seeing AI clearly, then, is to imagine your inevitable boredom from the start, then trying to figure out what’s left, what it can do for you, and what it wants.



Crawford isn’t dismissive about the potential scale of AI’s various impacts. “We are very much at the beginning of a huge upward curve of a lot of what’s going to happen,” she says. The most significant consequence of a mystical, inevitable account of AI — fostered by clever demos and doomsaying CEOs alike — is that it negates the sort of valid and rigorous criticism that might make it better for the people on whom it will be deployed.
This will be another big year for AI, in other words, and one rich with dazzling new demos that could make ChatGPT seem quaint. Crawford’s book draws from AI’s past and present to sketch a vision of an industry that is material, human, and extractive. Models trained on flawed, biased, and often secret sets of data will be used to attempt to perform an assuredly ambitious range of tasks, jobs, and vital economic and social processes that affect the lives of regular people. They will depend on access to massive amounts of computing power, meaning expensive computer hardware, meaning rare minerals, and meaning unspeakable amounts of electricity. These models will be trained with the assistance of countless low-paid laborers around the world who will correct bogus statistical assumptions until the models produce better, or at least more desirable, outputs. They will then be passed on for use in various other workplaces where their outputs and performances will be corrected and monitored by better-paid workers trying to figure out if the AI models are helping them or automating them out of a job, while their bosses try to figure out something similar about their companies. They will shade our constant submissions to the vast digital commons, intentional or consensual or mandatory, with the knowledge that every selfie or fragment of text is destined to become a piece of general-purpose training data for the attempted automation of everything. They will be used on people in extremely creative ways, with and without their consent.




If prompted, and based on my proprietary model of How Things Seem to Work These Days, trained on, I guess, various things I’ve noticed (don’t ask, not even I can explain), I would guess that we will watch these enchanted and revolutionary tools submit to worldly and conventional priorities of the companies and governments that are funding and deploying them to sometimes great (but often obvious) effect. Efforts to commercialize the new wave of AI will reveal a familiar story about, essentially, a concerted, credible, and well-funded effort to expand the boundaries of automation. That’s no small thing! But it’s exceedingly legible, interpretable, and explainable. AI’s magic will fade. Why not get ahead of it?

The term “generative AI” is used to describe AI systems that can create new information from scratch, as opposed to merely evaluating or acting on preexisting data. Avatars on social media sites and text-to-image converters have both made generative AI more accessible to the general public in recent weeks. 
The widespread implementation of AI will have far-reaching consequences for the future of business, affecting everything from daily operations to product development to worldwide expansion.

Generative AI has impressive capabilities and a wide range of possible implementations. Blog entries, code, poetry, FAQ responses, sentiment analysis, artwork, and even films are just some of the textual and visual outputs of generative AI models.
Many businesses could benefit from generative AI in the future as it opens new possibilities made for organizations and professionals:

Create original work, whether a piece of writing, a painting, or a song. And produce information useful for educating AI systems.
Automating content generation has applications ranging from journalism and content creation to data annotation and analysis, which could benefit from increased efficiency and productivity.
Producing work of such high quality that people would have difficulty telling it apart from the actual thing.
Enable novel contexts and uses. Gen-capacity AI for original content generation paves the way for a wide range of novel uses and applications.

For a generative model to generate content, a human must first input a prompt into the model. In most cases, when allowed to express oneself creatively, people rise to the occasion. Then, once the model has generated the information, it will require extensive human evaluation and editing. Multiple possible prompt results can be merged into one file. 
Generative AI Networks (GAN) have two sub-models:

The generator in a GAN is a neural network whose job is to generate fake input or samples from a random input vector.
The discriminator is another neural network whose job is to take a given sample and decide whether it is a fake sample from the generator or a real sample from the domain.

In many applications, including those involving images, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) serve as both the generator and the discriminator.
For the first time, a Google research paper from 2017 explained the concept of a “transformer,” a strong deep neural network that learns context. By extension, it means following relationships in sequential input, such as the words in this sentence. So, it’s no surprise that Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications heavily use this technology.
The GPT-3 and the LaMDA are two of the most well-known transformers.
Artificial intelligence researchers at San Francisco’s OpenAI have developed a set of language models called GPT-3 using deep learning techniques. Generative pre-trained transformer model, or GPT-3 for short. Poems, emails, and even jokes can be generated by the model, giving them the appearance that a human authored them.
The LaMDA series of conversational neural language models are based on Google Transformer, an open-source neural network architecture for NLP, and is designed specifically for use in dialogue applications.
In 2017, Google Brain was the first to employ LLMs for context-aware text translation. Since then, many huge language and text-to-image models have been developed by industry leaders like as Google (BERT and LaMDA), Facebook (OPT-175B, BlenderBot), and OpenAI, a nonprofit in which Microsoft is the largest investor (GPT-3 for text, DALL-E2 for images, and Whisper for speech). The development of generative models has also come from online communities like Midjourney (which played a role in the competition’s victory) and open-source sources like HuggingFace.
Due to the vast quantity of information and processing power needed to train these models, their application has been restricted to large tech corporations. For instance, GPT-3 used 45 terabytes of data during its initial training and uses 175 billion parameters or coefficients to produce predictions, with a single training session for GPT-3 costing $12 million. The Chinese model Wu Dao 2.0 includes 1.75 trillion variables. Most businesses lack the resources, either in terms of data center capacity or cloud computing funds, to train their models of this kind from scratch.
The difference is that once a generative model has been trained, it may be “fine-tuned” for a specific content domain with considerably less input. 
This has resulted in numerous domain-specific variants of BERT and GPT-3, such as those tailored to the biomedical field (BioBERT), the legal sector (Legal-BERT), and the French language (CamemBERT). For generative chemistry, proteomics, and DNA/RNA analysis, NVIDIA’s BioNeMo provides a platform for training, developing, and deploying massive language models at a supercomputing scale. OpenAI discovered that just 100 samples of domain-specific data significantly improved the accuracy and relevancy of GPT-3’s outputs. Human input is still needed at the start and finish of the generative AI process for it to succeed.
Applications of Generative AI
Arts and Music
There are various ways that generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is being applied in the creative industries, particularly in art and music. Generative models are frequently used to generate new art and music from scratch or by building upon preexisting pieces. A generative model might be trained on a vast collection of paintings and then be used to create new paintings with characteristics similar to those in the dataset but with their distinct style.
Gaming
Generative artificial intelligence is being applied in video games in various ways, such as the generation of new levels or maps, the generation of new dialogue or plot lines, and the generation of new virtual worlds. A Gen-AI model could be used in a game in several ways, including generating procedurally generated content (like a new level) or dialogue options for NPCs that change in response to the player’s choices. Gen-AI can also build immersive new worlds for players to explore, such as towns, forests, or even alien planets. 
Instance creation of an image
The most common application of generative AI is the generation of realistic-looking false images. Such is the case with the 2017 publication “Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation.”

Within the scope of this study, the team showed how to generate photorealistic images of people’s faces. The model was trained on input data consisting of photographs of famous individuals. It then generated fresh photographs of real people’s faces that resembled famous people in some ways.
Translation from/to images
This is an example of generative artificial intelligence at work, changing one kind of image into another. There is a plethora of alternatives when translating from one image to another.
Style Change: Achieving this goal requires copying the aesthetic of a well-known painting. An actual photograph I took in Cologne, Germany, for instance, can be altered to resemble a Van Gogh painting.

From rough sketches to finished paintings: In this scenario, the user provides a rough drawing and selects an object category; the network then suggests feasible completions and displays a synthesized image.

MRI to CT Scans: Transforming a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan into a computed tomography (CT) scan is one example of this in medicine, where both types of images are needed for specific treatments.
Machine translation of a text into pictures
Using this method, users may create many visuals (photorealistic, painted, etc.) from verbal descriptions of relatively simple things. For example, Midjourney, Dall-e from OpenAI, and Stable Diffusion are three of the most well-known examples of generative AI-based software.
Text-to-speech
Researchers have utilized GANs to create synthetic speech from text input. Amazon Polly and DeepMind, two examples of cutting-edge deep learning technology, can simulate human speech with an almost uncanny degree of realism. These models use character or phoneme sequences as inputs and output unprocessed voice audio.
Sound Generation
Generative artificial intelligence can audio data. This method can alter the sound of human voices or the musical genre of an existing recording. A piece of music can be “transferred” from one genre to another, from classical to jazz.
Video Generation
NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Supercomputer System (DLSS) was a groundbreaking advancement in generative artificial intelligence (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Reconstructing images using neural graphics technology.
Generating Synthetic Information
NVIDIA is at the forefront of several developments in generative AI technologies. An example is a neural network taught to create cityscapes using videos of real cities. Self-driving cars, for example, can benefit from synthetically manufactured data by using generated virtual world training datasets for pedestrian identification.
As one of the most significant and rapidly developing technologies, generative AI is featured in Gartner’s Emerging Technologies and Trends Impact Radar for 2022 study as a driver of a revolutionary shift in workplace efficiency. Some of the most important forecasts from Gartner regarding generative AI are as follows:

Ten percent of all data (up from less than one percent presently) and twenty percent of all test data for consumer-facing use cases will be generated by generative AI by 2025.
Approximately half of all drug discovery and development efforts will use generative AI by 2025.
There will be 30% more manufacturers using generative AI to improve their product development efficiency by 2027.

CONCERNS
Generative AI raises various moral and ethical questions. One is the simplicity with which “deepfakes” can be produced, that is, artificially-generated visual content that gives the impression of being real but is fabricated.
The concept of original and proprietary work is further complicated by generative AI. The companies who sell these tools often claim ownership of the content generated by their users on the grounds that it is unique and hence theirs to keep.

Manufacturing
Artificial intelligence and automation are the keys to future growth across industries, and the manufacturing sector is no exception to it. Manufacturers are using AI-backed analytics and data to reduce unplanned downtime, enhance efficiency, product quality, and the safety of employees.  The PwC research also suggests that around 45% of total economic gains by 2030 will be from product enhancements, stimulating consumer demand.
“People skills must evolve to meet the mandates of fluid, totally new, even unforeseen roles that machines cannot fulfill,” says Jeff Kavanaugh, Senior Partner at Infosys Consulting. AI can significantly enhance the quality and scale of work in the manufacturing industry by improving the capabilities of every manufacturing business function.  

Predictive Maintenance
AI helps in enhancing asset utilization, and productivity by predicting unplanned machine and equipment breakdown

Production Enhancement
With the help of AI engines, businesses can successfully identify underlying causes of yield losses and locate the detractors

Quality Enhancement
AI technologies need specialist skills and the automation that manufacturers have already adopted demand skilled workforce. For instance, Cobots, collaborative robots assist humans with complicated tasks. These technologies require humans to program them to perform complex jobs
The adoption of AI in the manufacturing industry should be seen as a positive development, and fruitful results can be achieved through training and re-skilling the existing workforce. AI and automation will allow humans to focus on activities that generate more value for their roles and the business. Working knowledge of the latest technologies used in manufacturing, combined with the hands-on expertise that the current workforce possesses, can position them at the forefront of the manufacturing industry transformation.
Retail
From the advent of Flippy, the robot hamburger chef, to Bingo Box, an entirely unmanned convenience store in China, and Amazon Go, the cashier-less supermarket, the use of robots and AI in the retail sector is growing at a rapid pace. According to IBM, 85% of retail and 79% of consumer products companies aim to use intelligent automation for supply chain planning by 2021. For example, the famous footwear, apparel, and equipment brand, Nike Inc., has designed a system where customers can create their designs and shoes and go out of the store wearing them. This new automated system uses augmented reality, object tracking and projection systems, and voice activation to completely transform the customer’s experience with the brand and its products.
Automation and AI are set to redesign the entire retail industry model and the broader value chain. This transition will result in the emergence of organizations with fewer layers and a better-skilled, and trusted workforce backed by real-time data and analytics. With a more well-rounded team and newer roles that are a hybrid between technology and business, organizations will have a much faster decision-making process. 

Real Estate
AI has already entered the real estate industry and is affecting a massive change to this $480 billion industry—from impacting the home search experience to predicting the marketing trends in the real-estate sector. 

Smart Home Search Portals
AI-enabled home search portals showcase recommended properties that meet customer preferences, personality traits, and requirements. These portals will support fewer, higher-quality properties that suit the needs of the customer better. Chatbots are helping resolve simple questions to help prospective customers find their next home. With AI and Machine Learning, Chatbots are becoming smarter by the day and will soon be able to answer complex search queries through both text and voice, proficiently. Now you can efficiently focus on contracts, answer telephones, and build customer relationships while AI automates much of the manual work.

Enhancing the Buying Process
AI can predict property market values by combining CRM and marketplace data. Robots may soon assist agents in offering a unique buying experience to the customers. Zenplace, a real-estate Startup, is already offering AI-based touring to its customers. AI is slated to play a vital role in enhancing the productivity of agents and offering customers with a user experience that is designed just for them.
Healthcare
Artificial Intelligence is already being used to diagnose and treat diseases. For example, IDx-DR is the first-ever autonomous AI system that instantly detects the condition. With the backing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide diagnostic support, it detects signs of diabetic retinopathy in ocular images and then uses an algorithm to create a binary diagnosis in minutes. AI can be extensively used in treating cardiovascular diseases, as well.
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) powered by artificial intelligence can restore neurological abilities of those who’ve suffered a trauma in the past.
Artificial intelligence will build the next generation of radiology tools that are accurate and detailed enough to replace the need for tissue samples, experts say. The same will apply to pathological tests too.
AI will help fill the shortages of trained healthcare providers, especially in the underdeveloped regions.
The presence of AI will assist medical professionals in diagnosing illnesses faster and, using the data collected from AI algorithms, work on finding better solutions. Therefore, it becomes essential for healthcare providers/radiologists/pathologists to learn and implement these technologies.

Generative AI is having a moment and governments need to pay attention

 ‘We need to use new technologies, safely and ethically, to learn how we can use them to better support and protect the communities we serve,’ says Annan Boag from the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner. (Monster Ztudio/Adobe) 


Like many others, I have been amazed by the text and art people are sharing online, made with nothing but a few words typed into an artificial intelligence (AI) generative deep-learning model (and, some say, the uncredited work of millions of creators).
Working in privacy and technology regulation, I take a professional interest, too. So, when the latest tools became publicly available in December, I had to try them.
I asked an AI to make a rhyme about the law I work with, the Victorian Information Privacy Principles (IPPs). It’s at the end of this article and I will let you judge its quality.
But first I want to talk about the use of AI in government, something I spent much of 2022 thinking about.
Governments are asking how they can – and if they should – use AI
Generative AI is having a moment.
ChatGPT lets you ask a bot to do anything text-based that you can imagine. Draft a contract; write a poem; be a ‘choose your own adventure’ book.




DALL·E 2 will draw whatever you describe. A robot’s self-portrait; Frida Kahlo having tea and scones; an avocado-shaped armchair.
'A robot painting a self-portrait.' (Created by author using generative AI)‘Frida Kahlo having tea and scones.’ (Created by author using generative AI)'An avocado-shaped armchair.' (Created by author using generative AI)
These things once took a lot of time. Human time. Now they are on the cusp of being automated.


It’s natural to ask what the systems that facilitate this can do. And what should they be allowed to do.
In 2022, I did a year-long group research project on AI ethics as part of an executive master of public administration at the Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG).
I interviewed more than 20 people across Australian governments who had implemented AI systems. I asked how they considered ethics when doing so.
At one extreme, some people used AI in their jobs after doing a short course in machine learning, to try out their new skills. They did amazing things and soon their whole team was using a system that helped them work better and faster.
How did they know the protections they had built in to address security, privacy, and bias were right? They were confident this could be addressed easily: because we’re developers, we know how everything works under the hood. It’s not a big problem.
We spoke to others who applied a lot of process to ethics including privacy impact and human rights assessments, ethics committee approvals, and risk control plans. But these assessments sometimes happened after development was underway. Ethical processes were “stage gates”, one interviewee said.
Many interviewees had thought about ethics deeply – and importantly, saw it aligned with the missions and values of their agency, and of public service.
“We’re an organisation that is here to support people … we wanted to make sure we were doing that in an appropriate way,” said one interviewee.
Another said: “We took the simple approaches, if we’re sitting there looking at a project, and we feel uncomfortable, if we take the AI part out, we’re still uncomfortable, we’ll take the data part out, are we still uncomfortable? It’s not how we’re doing it, it’s what’s being done”.
Established procedures to assess the ethics of AI and automated decision-making – only NSW and New Zealand have these – gave people confidence to innovate.
Some said the absence of a clear ethical framework and regulation was hampering innovation. Where people didn’t know how to consider and address a nascent ethical concern, they might not proceed with a technology that could otherwise deliver public value. In other cases, the lack of a framework or regulation was causing organisations to unknowingly take on ethical risks they hadn’t considered.
And at the start of December, the discussion of AI went mainstream.
Change is fast and accelerating
Most people who have used the sort of systems I’ve described above will ask, what does this mean? What won’t be apparent to people wading in now is how quickly things are moving.
Ten months ago, at the start of my project, our team used generative AI as a planning tool. The output was crude, and it took skill to write a prompt that gave a useful answer. Sometimes what looked good, was really nonsense.
In November, the tool we were using released a new model. I asked it for “a list of questions to ask people working in large government departments, in an interview for a research project about AI ethics”. The questions (written in seconds) were better than the ones I wrote for my interview plan.
Then at the start of December, ChatGPT’s public beta came out. It guided its millions of users to ask the right questions to get the output they want. It tries to tell them when it can’t help.
I like to think I can still write and think better than an AI. But things are moving fast.
Can government keep up?
It is tempting to pause and reflect. What can these technologies do? How can we use them? Should we use them?
Governments shouldn’t sit on the sidelines because privacy, security, and ethical questions are hard to answer. Agencies need to understand and use these systems well to regulate them effectively and manage the changes they will bring.
We need to use new technologies, safely and ethically, to learn how we can use them to better support and protect the communities we serve.
The people I spoke with who were doing AI and ethics well were those who understood the technology; were connected and collaborative; and were guided by clear values.
How do we build these characteristics in ourselves, our teams, and organisations? And how can we do that quickly, when every month these technologies look more likely to change the world?
I’ll leave you with a final example of generative AI. I asked for a rhyme for each of the 10 information privacy principles in the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic).
Will this technology replace lawyers (or poets)? Absolutely not. Yet.

‘It’s IPP to be square’: an AI-generated poem
IPP 1 – Collection
An organisation must not collect information about you
Unless it’s necessary for what they do
They must collect it fairly and not in an intrusive way
And tell you what they do with it, okay?
 
IPP 2 – Use and disclosure
An organisation must not use or share
Information for a second affair
Unless the individual’s consent it gets
Or when public interests it protects
 
IPP 3 – Data quality
Data must be clear and true,
An org must make sure it’s not askew.
Correct and current, it’s never too late,
To ensure your data’s up to date.
 
IPP 4 – Data security
Data should be safe and sound,
Away from prying eyes around.
And once the data is not needed,
Destroying it should be heeded.
 
IPP 5 – Openness
Organisations must show their privacy plan,
And make it accessible if they can.
Inform the people what data they store,
It’s the law, they must keep score.
 
IPP 6 – Access and correction
IPP 6 is here to protect your rights,
It gives you access to your details and insight.
Knowledge is power, so be sure to inquire,
Access and correction are yours to acquire.
 
IPP 7 – Unique identifiers
Unique identifiers are not our way,
Unless it’s necessary to do our work today.
Assigning unique IDs to individuals,
Only when there’s a valid legal reason.
 
IPP 8 – Anonymity
Anonymity is the name of the game
No one needs to know your name
No need to give yourself away
Your identity can stay out of play
 
IPP 9 – Transborder data flows
Transferring data to those outside of Vic,
Ensure the principles are upheld, that’s the trick.
Privacy must be kept, no matter where it’s sent
Substantially similar laws, or consent
 
IPP 10 – Sensitive data
No matter the data, one must consent
Should it be sensitive, this is the intent
Unless it’s required by law and such
The collection of sensitive information is not in touch

In seconds, consultants are conjuring decks and memos, marketers are cranking out fresh copy and software engineers are debugging code.Almost 30% of the nearly 4,500 professionals surveyed this month by Fishbowl, a social platform owned by employer review site Glassdoor, said that they’ve already used OpenAI’s ChatGPT or another artificial intelligence program in their work. Respondents include employees at Amazon, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Google, Twitter and Meta. The chatbot uses generative AI to spit out human-like responses to prompts in seconds, but because it’s been trained on information publicly available from the internet, books and Wikipedia, the answers aren’t always accurate.Read More: Exclusive: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less ToxicWhile ChatGPT set certain corners of the internet ablaze when it launched for public use in November, awareness is still filtering out to the broader public. Experts anticipate that this kind of AI will be transformative: ChatGPT will become the “calculator for writing,” says one top Stanford University economist. Microsoft is in talks with OpenAI about investing as much as $10 billion. The software giant is also looking to integrate GPT, the language model that underlies ChatGPT, into its widely-used Teams and Office software. If that happens, AI tech may very well be brought into the mainstream.Marketing professionals have been particularly keen to test-drive the tool: 37% said they’ve used AI at work. Tech workers weren’t far behind, at 35%. Consultants followed with 30%. Many are using the technology to draft emails, generate ideas, write and troubleshoot bits of code and summarize research or meeting notes.CEOs are using ChatGPT to brainstorm and compose their emails, too. “Anybody who doesn’t use this will shortly be at a severe disadvantage. Like, shortly. Like, very soon,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, chief executive of online learning platform Coursera told CNN. “I’m just thinking about my cognitive ability with this tool. Versus before, it’s a lot higher, and my efficiency and productivity is way higher.”The speed and versatility of the tool has dazzled many users. “I discovered ChatGPT about a month ago,” one person who identified themselves as a chief executive officer posted on FishBowl. “I use it every day. It has changed my life. And my staffing plan for 2023.”Some are even leaning on it as a crutch: One newly hired product manager at a fintech firm asked for advice on FishBowl, saying they were “100% lost” in their new role. “Fake it till you make it like you did the interview. When in doubt, ask ChatGPT,” came the reply.Amid the excitement, researchers have sounded notes of caution.While much of the anxiety has concentrated on what ChatGPT means in education — New York City public schools have banned its use — experts say companies need to think through their policies for the new tool sooner rather than later. If they don’t, they risk some of the pitfalls ChatGPT and other AI models can introduce, like factual errors, copyright infringement and leaks of sensitive company information.Read More: AI Chatbots Are Getting Better. But an Interview With ChatGPT Reveals Their LimitsThe tech is here to stay, though, and will likely become ever-more pervasive. Many AI-assisted programs already exist, and with OpenAI set to release the API, or application programming interface, the number of specialized applications built on the tool will multiply.While some professionals aren’t sold on the practicality of the use cases or quality of the output, others are convinced workers are only a few years away from being supplanted by the technology. “If ChatGPT starts making slides, I am done for,” one Deloitte employee wrote.

For making the business advantageous every industry would be seen to take upon the upgraded technology in the current rising technological world. Via analyzing the businesses providing effective quality goods and services to the market would be possible which is a tough competition. 
These technologies consist of Artificial intelligence(AI), Robotic process automation (RPA), and Machine learning (ML), which would be seen to be game-changing for every industry however there would be some issues interrupted in between when the technology laid on the industries that perform upon the critical information. 
Technology and auditing would be considered to be the two sides of the identical coin, indeed collaboration of them is shaping strategies at a worldwide level. The mentioned technologies would be in the field of audit at the initial level however with this paper the extent of application would be learned and with the coming time importance and advantages to the companies and the auditing industry. 
The outcomes revealed are in the acceptance of the technology and behind its execution, the investment cost would be standing behind it along with the benefits.
Prior to arriving at the application and impact of these technologies in the field of audit, let’s learn about what is Artificial intelligence (AI), Robotic process automation (RPA), and Machine learning (ML) are.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Machines are used to demonstrate Artificial intelligence (AI) just opposite to the natural intelligence depicted by humans.
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications consist of advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Assistant), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), learning human speech (such as iPhone’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla) and others.
Software programs contained Artificial Intelligence which is being installed in the machines via which they enable the operation of different functions that humans could function such as speaking, walking, able to learn, solve problems, thinking, making decisions, and others.
What is Robotics Process Automation (RPA)?
RPA (Robotics Process Automation) emphasizes a bot or software application that could be programmed to function the basic human chores that would generally be manual type. These chores take time, repetitive and errors may occur when the individuals could perform the same. A robot exactly copies the actions of the chair-swivelling person shifting between systems.
RPA furnishes advantages such as robots working non-stop with dynamic speed, implementing accuracy, and scalable. Indeed the repetitive manual chores, freeing up time for employees to perform more value-added activities that are required to get performed are being remembered by robots.
What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Artificial intelligence’s key subset is Machine learning, which comes with the concept that machines can be taught to learn in various ways identical to that humans. On the email spam filter and credit monitoring software, and the news feed and targeted advertising functions of the technology companies like Facebook and Google, some instances of machine learning could be revealed.
Giving employment to an audit firm that does not choose to work within machine learning would direct to drawing a knife to a gunfight. It shall make the process of audit sluggish and also it will create a lower quality audit.
Analysis Between Traditional Auditing and AI Enable Auditing Technology
Traditional auditing methods comprise initiating the process of audit via a meeting conducted with the auditee and hence it consists of the details that have been accumulated via the client. Screening and inspection of documents are indeed attached to work with but merely via a sample basis. It would results in a reasonable assurance via the auditors and would secure more chances of clashing the documents that are concealed by the client.
Through the development of technology, the auditors would now hold the access to database of the client which provides them 100% access to data concerned to the finance and operations of the business. The same shall empower the auditors to increase their horizons and access the company’s information. Through analytical tools and artificial intelligence, it could empower the auditors to set the risky areas of business. It consists of auto-identification of the risky fields, setting outliers, conducting a quick analytical review of the former data, and to an extent enabling the auditors to inspect the compliance with the Accounting & Auditing Standards.
Importance of Artificial Intelligence in Auditing
The reliance on the present system through the AI-based auditioning model shall get reduced human intervention and draw more clarity to the system.
We must recognize that auditing is more than just checking the genuine and fair position of internal and external affairs; it also serves as a predictive model, alerting the system to potential gaps in the near future. When an AI-based auditing model is built, the same machine learning tool will be the primary server for identifying holes and potential threats in present company operations.
Over the last decade, we have strengthened severe auditing regulations and standards to boost efficiency, yet loopholes continue to emerge because fraud offenders are sharper than highly trained auditors. All auditors can construct a model of AI-based auditing model through Machine learning (which is a continuous process), but accumulating in one centre will assist auditing to be more efficient and less detrimental to individual/firm misconduct.

Verifiable audit trails may be established using blockchain, and auditors can readily find flaws in the chain and highlight them through reporting to businesses using artificial intelligence. Auditors typically create audit trails in their audit procedures in order to analyze the underlying cause of an issue that requires rigorous verification. However, using artificial intelligence, data analytics techniques, and blockchain technology, can be done quickly and easily increasing auditor efficiency.
Artificial intelligence is more of a process that encompasses Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Data Processing. The following are examples of artificial intelligence applications in the audit process:
During the audit planning step, AI gains a preliminary understanding of the customer and their industry. Data from financial accounts, operational procedures, and organizational structure may be collected, aggregated, and analyzed by AI.
Robotic process automation (RPA) and data analytics may be utilized for a variety of activities, including pulling data from earlier periods or interim financial statements based on a variety of benchmarks, to establish the materiality and scope of the audit.
Following that, AI evaluates the audit client’s internal control and risk elements. Flowcharts, narratives, and surveys will be analyzed and reported on to identify anomalies. At this moment, AI is reliant on pattern recognition and visualization methods. Data quality and provenance from the full population are evaluated during the substantive testing and details balance stage. Finally, a conclusion is formed based on AI results.
Important: Everything About I-T Portal Co-browsing Feature with Issues
These AI tools enable auditors to automate jobs that had previously been performed manually by people for decades, allowing them to fragment what was previously a tradeoff between time, cost, and quality. Auditors may prioritize quality by examining sophisticated analytics, spending more time offering insight, and exercising greater professional judgment. Today, automation has replaced manual vouching and administrative tasks, as has the growth of data analytics for quicker data access. Accounting entries may be automatically coded using machine learning. Another example of AI in the audit industry is the rapid assessment of a large number of contracts. Important information from an agreement, often a lease deal, is retrieved and summarised using pre-selected criteria. All of the above-described AI benefits result in more efficient and methodical audit methods, resulting in a higher quality audit.
Different Ways in Which AI Impact the Audit Operations
Auditors can use AI for various purposes – 

Automate manual tasks of auditors such as documentation.
Examine the whole volume of structured and unstructured data that arrive through financial records by parsing data.
Finding out the anomalies like unusual payments or activities that do not be caught via manual auditing.
Forecasting the risks involved in future, events by analyzing the former transaction data.

Through AI and machine learning capabilities the auditors perform the advisory type of work like finding the entirety of ledgers and reporting the risk to the executives, and clients during increasing their audit services.For complex analysis of financial data, AI might not be the correct choice. The same could be perfect for counting items, spotting patterns, and flagging irregularities to a level that satisfies and surpasses the needs of a company.
The basic area in which AI audits would be impacting the auditing is the automated entries. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) would enable ease of the operation of data entry for the accountants and auditors. Robotic Process Automation chores can be utilised to function testing like data analytics to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of our work.
At present other than RPA machine learning is the biggest new technology in audit. Machine learning strategies in which via complex algorithms, the technology could able to scan information, model it against thousands of assumptions drawn from external scenarios, and highlight risks and insights.
Since there is always a need for human judgment and professional suspicion, the fundamentals of the audit shall not get revised. The perfect use of the technology would be that shall empower us to collect easily, quickly, accurately, and extensively compare to ever before the supportive proof that is required in an audit.
AI Helps Auditors to Improve the Auditing Process
The speed along with the quality of audits can be enhanced by Machine learning as of its higher potential. Through the utilization of AI for the tough ticking and tying chores which are the inevitable portion of the auditing function, for reviewing the auditors secure more time and are unable to concentrate on the harder part and the higher-risk areas. The additional time along with mental power has accumulated which makes the auditors able to see the case in the wider picture. Audit firms that leverage AI and data analytics to consider the approach of data for audit shall furnish a competitive benefit as they could furnish useful insights to their clients above the audit report.
AI would be utilised by some tools for testing the journal entries to reveal suspicious entries. The other would relate the financial information with the unstructured nonfinancial information to ensure that business performance is constant through its operating environment and business model. These tools would not be the replacement for the auditor’s understanding of businesses and industries, however able to enhance the auditor’s human intelligence to furnish valuable insights to customers which shall assist them to achieve their goals.
Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools
In the future, the human-to-human interaction audit shall get decreased concerned with highly repetitive and rules-based assignments. The use of the interface tools can be done for automatically sharing the data in real-time with the external auditor’s AI tool(s), which in turn compute, test, and flag irregularities or problems that need the attention of the auditor. It concentrates the human interaction on transactions that has higher risk contrary to the daily inquiries.
Beneath the same case, AI tools are powered to find out the distinctive transactions and furnish insights on related considerations the auditor may consider along with the subjected standards (accounting, disclosure, auditing, or regulatory standards), identical historical circumstances, or results from the source which is publicly available. For supporting the auditors in finding the risks and asking for appropriate supporting details, and the schedule meets with the related people to communicate in the case of an audit, the AI tool is useful for computing the board meetings minutes or key communications. It is performed to process bigger amounts of information (reading bank statements and legal contracts) and reconcile accounts various times quicker than a human auditor and with only some errors. With AI the auditors would be constrained to process their operations as AI would be the future. Hence the auditors shall be required to be more flexible to revise in the future.
Is it True That Artificial Intelligence Will Take Away Auditor Jobs
Yes, if the machine decides the management and not only supports making decisions. It is normal to see fear in finance professionals. However, in current times in my view, people must not be worried. AI utilization in India is very less at present compared to the western world, however, the same would be surging. The issues or creative chores that the professionals are worried about currently will be free once some of the things choose to be managed by the machines. In the former times, we have already seen the fear of computers.Various employees feel that they are useless excluding those who had to opt for the change when the computers initiated doing the majority of the work.
Professional judgment in auditing and financial processes shall not get replaced by AI. Firms shall always require human-powered essential thinking, nevertheless of the AI impact on the accounting industry.
The research stands with the opposite of the job losing fear because of AI, AI is a tool that supports the auditors to perform their jobs effectively and efficiently. There is no chance that AI replaces the decision of auditor, judgment, or assessment skill. The same shall increase efficiency by providing them with more tools and effective findings to work. The human relationship between the client and the auditor would stay essential and technology cannot replace everything.
Closure
AI along with robotics shall make our thinking precise, the direction through which we explore new horizons, space, or ocean. From an older saying, “necessity is the mother of all innovations,” hence AI is similar to that.
At present, the condition of the audit with the AI application, data analytics, and tools would be at the initial time, and transforming the audit field with 100% application of the technology mentioned would consume somewhat more time. AI, machine learning, and robotic process automation would retain the potential to overcome various chores that have been performed by accountants and auditors however they are not able to substitute the professional judgment, insight, and direction that merely a person/human could deliver, at least for the foreseeable future.

Towards the end of last year, management consultant McKinsey published an article where the first paragraph was created by ChatGPT, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) language model.







The article’s authors admitted that the AI’s attempt was “not perfect but overwhelmingly impressive”. They noted that products like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot take technology into realms once thought to be reserved for humans. “With generative AI, computers can now arguably exhibit creativity. They can produce original content in response to queries, drawing from data they’ve ingested and interactions with users,” they said.
McKinsey said businesses need to explore where this technology can be applied. The paper suggests a number of possible scenarios, from AI-generated personalised sales and marketing content; generating task lists and documentation in operations and identifying errors; and drafting interview questions for job interviews and summarising legal documents. There is also a role in IT, where generative AI could be used to write code and documentation, such as converting simple JavaScript expressions into Python and automatically generating data.
McKinsey urged companies considering generative AI to identify the parts of the business where the technology could have the most immediate impact. The article’s authors recommended that business leaders implement a mechanism to monitor the deployment of generative AI systems, since this type of technology is set to evolve rapidly.
Speaking to Computer Weekly last month about the role of generative AI in programming, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said: “I think the next generation of developers will be used to AI and it’s going to be incredible. Technologies such as ChatGPT will enable a new way of learning, so young developers can interact with AI and learn at their own pace, whether it’s through tutorials or scripts in a predefined storyline.”
Mirroring the McKinsey article, Dohmke said generative AI could also enable developers to be more productive. “We’ve seen this in Copilot,” he said. “When you start using Copilot, it doesn’t have any information about you, so it uses the Codex model, which is a subvariant of the GPT model, to suggest code to you. But as you type, if it suggests code you don’t like, you can reject it.
“Over time, it learns what you accept or reject, and adapts to your coding style. We saw developers who were sceptical of the AI in Copilot get that ‘aha’ moment after a few days, and a couple of weeks later, they can no longer live without it.”

Rogue AI
When Meta, the owner of Facebook, released BlenderBot 3, its conversational AI system, in August 2022, the company proclaimed that it had previously collected 70,000 conversations from the public demo, which it would use to improve BlenderBot 3. However, just days after its availability in the US, reports started coming in that the system was generating racist comments and false news. For instance, the Meta bot reportedly claimed that Donald Trump was the current president of the US.
According to Meta, from feedback provided by 25% of participants on 260,000 bot messages, 0.11% of BlenderBot’s responses were flagged as inappropriate, 1.36% as nonsensical, and 1% as off-topic.
“We continue to believe that the way to advance AI is through open and reproducible research at scale,” said Joelle Pineau, managing director of fundamental AI research at Meta. “We also believe that progress is best served by inviting a wide and diverse community to participate.”
What the demo shows is that while such AI systems can, indeed, hold a conversation with someone, they rely on available learning data gleaned from conversations with people over the internet, and so their responses are based on what they “learn” from previous conversations.

Artificial intelligence will enable developers to learn at their own pace and become more productive rather than take over their jobs, says GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke.
Industries are utilising generative AI in various ways to successfully generate new content. Learn about successful examples of this technology and how it's expected to expand.



In a blog post from early December, titled, Beware of “coherent nonsense” when implementing generative AI, analysts at Forrester described generative AI as analogous in terms of human development to “late childhood”. “These systems can string together words convincingly and create logical arguments, but you can’t be sure if they’re just making things up or only telling you what you want to hear,” the blog’s authors wrote.
When deciding on how to use generative AI, Forrester recommended that IT and business chiefs assess whether training data used for the AI has come from a credible source and whether this data is likely to be correct.
If an external partner trained the model, the Forrester blog’s authors urged IT leaders to consider how they would audit the data sources to ensure they can identify possible biases and confounders in the data.
Understanding context is another area to explore. Forrester suggested that IT and business leaders assess if the AI can understand new questions in reference to previous questions, and whether different answers are given by understanding the user.

At the same time, I couldn’t escape the uncanny portraits people were generating with the image-editing app Lensa AI’s new Magic Avatar feature and then sharing on social media. A guy on Twitter even used OpenAI’s new machine learning-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, to imitate what I said on a recent podcast (which, coincidentally, was also about ChatGPT) and posted it online.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Welcome to the age of generative AI, when it’s now possible for anyone to create new, original illustrations and text by simply sending a few instructions to a computer program. Several generative AI models, including ChatGPT and an image generator called Stable Diffusion, can now be accessed online for free or for a low-cost subscription, which means people across the world can do everything from assemble a children’s book to produce computer code in just a few clicks. This tech is impressive, and it can get pretty close to writing and illustrating how a human might. Don’t believe me? Here’s a Magic School Bus short story ChatGPT wrote about Ms. Frizzle’s class trip to the Fyre Festival. And below is an illustration I asked Stable Diffusion to create about a family celebrating Hanukkah on the moon. Stable Diffusion’s take on a lunar Hanukkah includes a menorah with five candles and plenty of oversized Christmas ornaments. Stable DiffusionGenerative AI’s results aren’t always perfect, and we’re certainly not dealing with an all-powerful, super AI — at least for now. Sometimes its creations are flawed, inappropriate, or don’t totally make sense. If you were going to celebrate Hanukkah on the moon, after all, you probably wouldn’t depict giant Christmas ornaments strewn across the lunar surface. And you might find the original Magic School Bus stories more entertaining than my AI-generated one. Still, even in its current form and with its current limitations, generative AI could automate some tasks humans do daily — like writing form emails or drafting simple legal contracts — and possibly make some kinds of jobs obsolete. This technology presents plenty of opportunities, but plenty of complex new challenges, too. Writing emails may suddenly have gotten a lot easier, for example, but catching cheating students has definitely gotten a lot harder. It’s only the beginning of this tech, so it can be hard to make sense of what exactly it is capable of or how it could impact our lives. So we tried to answer a few of the biggest questions surrounding generative AI right now.Wait, how does this AI work? Very simply, a generative AI system is designed to produce something new based on its previous experience. Usually, this technology is developed with a technique called machine learning, which involves teaching an artificial intelligence to perform tasks by exposing it to lots and lots of data, which it “trains” on and eventually learns to mimic. ChatGPT, for example, was trained on an enormous quantity of text available on the internet, along with scripts of dialogue, so that it could imitate human conversations. Stable Diffusion is an image generator created by the startup Stability.AI that will produce an image for you based on text instructions, and was designed by feeding the AI images and their associated captions collected from the web, which allowed the AI to learn what it should “illustrate” based on the verbal commands it received. While the particular approaches used to build generative AI models can differ, this technology is ultimately trying to reproduce human behavior, creating new content based on the content that humans have already created. In some ways, it’s like the smart compose features you see on your iPhone when you’re texting or your Gmail account when you’re typing out an email. “It learns to detect patterns in this content, which in turn allows it to generate similar but distinct content,” explains Vincent Conitzer, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon. This method of building AI can be extremely powerful, but it also has real flaws. In one test, for example, an AI model called Galactica that Meta built to help write scientific papers suggested that the Soviet Union was the first country to put a bear in space, among several other errors and falsehoods. (The company pulled the system offline in November, after just a few days.) Lensa AI’s Magic Avatar feature, the AI portrait generator, sometimes illustrates people with additional limbs. It also has the concerning tendency to depict women without any clothing. It’s easy to find other biases and stereotypes built into this technology, too. When the Intercept asked ChatGPT to come up with an airline passenger screening system, the AI suggested higher risk scores for people from — or who had visited — Syria and Afghanistan, among other countries. Stable Diffusion also reproduces racial and gender stereotypes, like only depicting firefighters as white men. These are not particularly new problems with this kind of AI, as Abeba Birhane and Deborah Raji recently wrote in Wired. “People get hurt from the very practical ways such models fall short in deployment, and these failures are the result of their builders’ choices — decisions we must hold them accountable for,” they wrote.Who is creating this AI, and why? Generative AI isn’t free out of the goodness of tech companies’ hearts. These systems are free because the companies building them want to improve their models and technology, and people playing around with trial versions of the software give these companies, in turn, even more training data. Operating the computing systems to build artificial intelligence models can be extremely expensive, and while companies aren’t always upfront about their own expenses, costs can stretch into the tens of millions of dollars. AI developers want to eventually sell and license their technology for a profit. There are already hints about what this new generative AI industry could look like. OpenAI, which developed the DALL-E and ChatGPT systems, operates under a capped-profit model, and plans to receive $1 billion in revenue by 2024, primarily through selling access to its tech (outside developers can already pay to use some of OpenAI’s tech in their apps). Microsoft has already started to use the system to assist with some aspects of computer programming in its code development app. Stability AI, the Stable Diffusion creator, wants to build specialized versions of the technology that it could sell to individual companies. The startup raised more than $100 million this past October. Some think ChatGPT could ultimately replace Google’s search engine, which powers one of the biggest digital ad businesses in the world. ChatGPT is also pretty good at some basic aspects of coding, and technologies like it could eventually lower the overall costs of developing software. At the same time, OpenAI already has a pricing program available for DALL-E, and it’s easy to imagine how the system could be turned into a way of generating advertisements, visuals, and other graphics at a relatively low cost. Is this the end of homework? AI tools are already being used for one obvious thing: schoolwork, especially essays and online exams.These AI-produced assignments wouldn’t necessarily earn an A, but teachers seem to agree that ChatGPT can create at least B-worthy work. While tools for detecting whether a piece of text is AI generated are emerging, the popular plagiarism detection software, Turnitin, won’t catch this kind of cheating. The arrival of this tech has driven some to declare the end of high school English, and even homework itself. While those predictions are hyperbolic, it’s certainly possible that homework will need to adapt. Some teachers may reverse course on the use of technology in the classroom and return to in-person, paper-based exams. Other instructors might turn to lockdown browsers, which would prevent people from visiting websites during a computer-based test. The use of AI itself may become part of the assignment, which is an idea some teachers are already exploring. “The sorts of professionals our students want to be when they graduate already use these tools,” Phillip Dawson, the associate director of the Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning, told Recode in December. “We can’t ban them, nor should we.”Is AI going to take my job?It’s hard to predict which jobs will or won’t be eradicated by generative AI. Greg Brockman, one of OpenAI’s co-founders, said in a December tweet that ChatGPT is “not yet ready to be relied on for anything important.” Still, this technology can already do all sorts of things that companies currently need humans to do. Even if this tech doesn’t take over your entire job, it might very well change it. Take journalism: ChatGPT can already write a pretty compelling blog post. No, the post might not be particularly accurate — which is why there’s concern that ChatGPT could be quickly exploited to produce fake news — but it can certainly get the ball rolling, coming up with basic ideas for an article and even drafting letters to sources. The same bot can also earn a good score on a college-level coding exam, and it’s not bad at writing about legal concepts, either. A photo editor at New York magazine pointed out that while DALL-E doesn’t quite understand how to make illustrations dealing with complex political or conceptual concepts, it can be helpful when given repeated prodding and explicit instructions.While there are limits on what ChatGPT could be used for, even automating just a few tasks in someone’s workflow, like writing basic code or copy editing, could radically change a person’s workday and reduce the total number of workers needed in a given field. As an example, Conitzer, the computer science professor, pointed to the impact of services like Google Flights on travel agencies.“Online travel sites, even today, do not offer the full services of a human travel agent, which is why human travel agents are still around, in larger numbers than many people expect,” he told Recode. “That said, clearly their numbers have gone down significantly because the alternative process of just booking flights and a place to stay yourself online — a process that didn’t exist some decades ago — is a fine alternative in many cases.” Should I be worried?Generative AI is going mainstream rapidly, and companies aim to sell this technology as soon as possible. At the same time, the regulators who might try to rein in this tech, if they find a compelling reason, are still learning how it works. The stakes are high. Like other breakthrough technologies — things like the computer and the smartphone, but also earlier inventions, like the air conditioner and the car — generative AI could change much of how our world operates. And like other revolutionary tech, the arrival of this kind of AI will create complicated trade-offs. Air conditioners, for example, have made some of the hottest days of the year more bearable, but they’re also exacerbating the world’s climate change problem. Cars made it possible to travel extremely long distances without the need for a train or horse-drawn carriage, but motor vehicle crashes now kill tens of thousands of people, at least in the United States,every year. In the same way, decisions we make about AI now could have ripple effects. Legal cases about who deserves the profit and credit — but also the liability — for work created by AI are being decided now, but could shape who profits from this technology for years to come. Schools and teachers will determine whether to incorporate AI into their curriculums, or discard it as a form of cheating, inevitably influencing how kids will relate to these technologies in their professional lives. The rapid expansion of AI image generators could center Eurocentric art forms at the expense of other artistic traditions, which are already underrepresented by the technology.If and when this AI goes fully mainstream, it could be incredibly difficult to unravel. In this way, the biggest threat of this technology may be that it stands to change the world before we’ve had a chance to truly understand it.This story was first published in the Recode newsletter.

It has the potential to revolutionize almost every industry and transform the way we live and work. Some of the key areas where AI is already making an impact include natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.One of the primary goals of AI is to develop systems that can process and analyze large amounts of data, and then use that information to make intelligent decisions or take appropriate actions. This can be particularly useful in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, where there is a need to quickly analyze vast amounts of data and make decisions based on that analysis.Another key aspect of AI is the ability to learn and adapt. Many AI systems are designed to continuously improve their performance over time, as they are exposed to more data and experience. This learning ability makes AI systems highly flexible and adaptable, and able to perform a wide range of tasks.One current trend in digital technology is the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These technologies are being applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, and customer service.In healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical images and make diagnoses, assist with surgery, and predict patient outcomes.One major innovation in the field of digital technology is the development of 5G networks. 5G is a wireless technology that is expected to provide faster internet speeds and lower latency than previous generations of mobile networks. This will enable a wide range of new applications, such as remote telemedicine and the Internet of Things (IoT), which refers to the connectivity of everyday objects to the internet.The future scope of digital technology is difficult to predict with certainty, but some experts believe that we will see the continued development and deployment of AI and machine learning, as well as the expansion of the IoT. There is also the potential for the emergence of new technologies that we can’t even imagine yet.In terms of personal insights and opinions, it is clear that digital technology has the potential to greatly improve our lives in many ways. However, it is important to be mindful of the potential negative impacts as well, such as the potential loss of jobs due to automation and the need to address privacy and security concerns.Overall, the field of digital technology is constantly evolving, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to shape and change our world in the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) also has been increasingly adopted in the finance industry in recent years. Some examples of how AI is being used in finance include:Credit risk assessment: AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data about potential borrowers and provide insights to help lenders make more informed credit decisions.Fraud detection: AI can analyze patterns in financial transactions and identify unusual or potentially fraudulent activity.Trading: Some financial firms are using AI to analyze market trends and make trades in real-time, allowing them to take advantage of short-term opportunities in the market.Customer service: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can help financial institutions handle routine customer inquiries, freeing up human customer service representatives to handle more complex tasks.Investment management: AI can analyze market data and help financial advisors make more informed investment recommendations to their clients.AI has the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of financial services.Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to detect and prevent fraud in the finance industry. Here are some ways in which AI is being used for fraud detection:Machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can analyze patterns in financial transactions and identify unusual activity that may be indicative of fraud. These algorithms can be trained on data from past fraudulent transactions and can continuously learn and adapt as new data becomes available.Anomaly detection: AI algorithms can detect anomalies in financial transactions that may indicate fraudulent activity. For example, a sudden increase in the number of transactions from a particular account or a sudden change in the types of transactions being made may be flagged as suspicious.Risk scoring: AI can analyze multiple factors related to a financial transaction, such as the user’s history, the type of transaction, and the location of the transaction, to assign a risk score. Transactions with a high-risk score may require additional verification or may be automatically blocked to prevent fraudulent activity.The use of AI in fraud detection can help financial institutions identify fraudulent activity more quickly and with greater accuracy, allowing them to take action to prevent losses.As my conclusion, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since the term was coined in the 1950s. Today, AI is used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, to name a few.One of the most significant developments in AI is the advancement of machine learning, which allows computers to improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. This has led to the creation of intelligent systems that can analyze large amounts of data and make decisions based on that analysis.Another significant advancement in AI is the development of natural language processing, which enables computers to understand and generate human-like language. This has led to the creation of virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, which can understand and respond to voice commands.Despite the many benefits of AI, there are also concerns about its potential impact on society. Some worry that the increasing reliance on AI could lead to job displacement, while others are concerned about the ethical implications of decisions made by autonomous systems.Overall, AI is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential to improve our lives in numerous ways. However, it is important for researchers and policymakers to consider the ethical implications of AI and ensure that its development benefits society as a whole.

""Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.""

You probably have heard or seen that famous quote before. Many assume that this instructive line must be a memorable remark composed by Shakespeare, but the classic bit of sage wisdom actually comes from Sir Walter Scott in his epic poem of 1808 entitled Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field.


Now that we’ve got the authorship straightened out, let’s consider the meaning of the clever statement. The notion seems to be that once you start down a sketchy path, the odds are that things will get increasingly entangled. No semblance of one-and-done. The difficulties and thorniness just keep expanding and growing ever more.

I dare say that we can apply the same conundrum to the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

For example, I’ve previously pointed out that much of AI can be construed as a dual-use phenomenon, see my analysis at the link here. The tongue twister about dual-use implies that though AI might originally be devised in an AI For Good aspirational mindset, there is a solid chance that the very same AI can be readily adjusted to land into the dreary and unsettling AI For Bad camp. Notable concerns exist about changing a few parameters in an AI system that bring forth a so-called Doctor Evil project of unsettling proportions.
PROMOTED
Ultimately, the existent rush toward making and fielding AI is forcing us all to take a closer look at AI Ethics and AI Law. We have to try and keep the train on the railroad tracks, as it were. You might find of interest my extensive and ongoing coverage of the latest in AI Ethics and AI Law at the link here and the link here, just to name a few. A sobering and judicious amount of attention to AI Ethics and AI Law will allow us to leverage the good of AI and avert or at least mitigate the bad of AI.
We all certainly hope so.
Meanwhile, a particular kind of AI has recently garnered widespread attention in the news and across the wide swath of social media that embodies dual-use considerations. I’m talking about something referred to as Generative AI, notably popularized via a particular AI app known as ChatGPT (for my overall and in-depth assessment of ChatGPT and the rise of generative AI, see the link here).

ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI interactive system, essentially a seemingly innocuous general chatbot, nonetheless, it is actively and avidly being used by people in ways that are catching many entirely off-guard. For example, a prominent concern is that ChatGPT and other similar generative AI apps will allow students to cheat on their written essays, perhaps even encouraging or spurring pupils to do so. Students that are lazy or feel they are boxed in without time or skill to do an essay might readily invoke a generative AI app to write their essay for them. I’ll say more about this in a moment. For my close-up analysis of how ChatGPT allows this, and what teachers ought to be doing, see the link here.

I’ll be explaining herein what Generative AI and ChatGPT are all about, so please hang in there and you’ll get the full scoop.
Meanwhile, if you take a look at social media, you will see people that are proclaiming ChatGPT and generative AI as the best thing since sliced bread. Some suggest that this is in fact sentient AI (nope, they are wrong!). Others worry that people are getting ahead of themselves. They are seeing what they want to see. They have taken a shiny new toy and shown exactly why we can’t have catchy new things.
Those in AI Ethics and AI Law are soberly and seriously worried about this burgeoning trend, and rightfully so. I will herein examine how people are using generative AI for uses that aren’t on the up and up. You can use generative AI such as ChatGPT for all manner of unsavory uses. It is like falling off a log, meaning that it is relatively easy to do bad things and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to do so.
When I provide this kind of AI-related evildoer explorations, I often get grumblings that I am essentially telling bad people how to do bad things. Maybe it would be better to not bring up these topics, some exhort. Keep things quiet.
Sorry, but a head-in-the-sand approach is not going to be helpful on these matters. The more that people are aware of the dangers involved in the latest and greatest of AI, perhaps the more that there will be a call for diligently abiding by AI Ethics principles and considering the adoption of sensible and appropriate AI laws.
Merely letting havoc reign is not a sound strategy. A suitable balance between unbridled AI innovation that leads to outstanding uses of AI has to be societally weighed against the need to embrace Ethical AI precepts and devise prudent AI laws to prevent overreaches. For more about key AI Ethics principles and the ongoing saga of trying to get AI developers and those that operate AI to adopt Ethical AI practices, see my coverage at the link here. Expect new laws about AI to emerge at the federal, state, city, and local levels, such as the New York City law on AI audits (see my analysis at the link here), and a wave of global international AI-related laws is coming too, see my updates at the link here.
Should we let evildoing entailing AI hide in the shadows?
Purportedly, Albert Einstein warned us that “The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.”
Let’s you and I look on and then aim to do something stridently about this.
Here’s the deal. I will be walking you through two primary examples of how wrongdoers are able to use generative AI and ChatGPT for nefarious purposes. The first example is rather straightforward and easily done by nearly anyone that wishes to use the ChatGPT AI app in this untoward manner. The second example is a bit trickier and requires added techie familiarity, though nonetheless can still be employed by a relative newbie when it comes to savviness about computers.
The two examples are intended to showcase the bad ways that AI can be used, doing so specifically related to generative AI. I’d like to emphasize at the get-go that though I am using ChatGPT to highlight these issues, you can pretty much do the same, or possibly worse, in other similar generative AI apps. I opted to use ChatGPT mainly due to the outsized popularity it has recently garnered.
After taking you through the myriad of ins and outs regarding the two chosen examples, I will then discuss various cybersecurity protections and approaches that could be used by AI makers to curtail these adverse uses. Bottom-line is that there are ways to make these disreputable undertakings harder and more costly to perform. The greater the barriers to evildoing, the greater the chances of discouraging causal efforts and upping the ante for the determined cyber crooks.
Fasten your seatbelt for quite a ride.
We shall first establish key background about what Generative AI consists of, along with delving into some crucial specifics about the AI app ChatGPT.
Let’s do that.
Opening The Can Of Worms On Generative AI
We are ready to dive into AI.
Of the various types of AI, we will focus herein specifically on Generative AI.
In brief, generative AI is a particular type of AI that composes text as though the text was written by the human hand and mind. All you need to do is enter a prompt, such as a sentence like “Tell me about Abraham Lincoln” and generative AI will provide you with an essay about Lincoln. This is commonly classified as generative AI that performs text-to-text or some prefer to call it text-to-essay output. You might have heard about other modes of generative AI, such as text-to-art and text-to-video, see my elaboration at the link here.
Your first thought might be that this does not seem like such a big deal in terms of producing essays. You can easily do an online search of the Internet and readily find tons and tons of essays about President Lincoln.
The kicker in the case of generative AI is that the generated essay is relatively unique and provides an original composition rather than a copycat. If you were to try and find the AI-produced essay online someplace, you would be unlikely to discover it.
Generative AI is pre-trained and makes use of a complex mathematical and computational formulation that has been set up by examining patterns in written words and stories across the web. As a result of examining thousands and millions of written passages, the AI is able to spew out new essays and stories that are a mishmash of what was found. By adding in various probabilistic functionality, the resulting text is pretty much unique in comparison to what has been used in the training set.
That’s why there has been an uproar about students being able to cheat when writing essays outside of the classroom. A teacher cannot merely take the essay that deceitful students assert is their own writing and seek to find out whether it was copied from some other online source. Overall, there won’t be any definitive preexisting essay online that fits the AI-generated essay. All told, the teacher will have to begrudgingly accept that the student wrote the essay as an original piece of work. For ways that this might be combatted, see my detailed coverage at the link here.
In a moment, I’ll showcase to you what happens when you enter questions or prompts that pertain to some underhanded or devious intentions. I will make use of the latest version of ChatGPT to enter my prompts and have collected the “answers” or essays generated by the AI (note that the same can be done with the numerous other available generative AI apps; I’ve opted to use ChatGPT because it is getting its five minutes of fame right now).
Perhaps a short tangent about ChatGPT might be helpful at this juncture.
ChatGPT app was made available to the general public just a short while ago. By and large, these generative AI apps are usually only accessible to AI insiders. The unusual facet that ChatGPT could be used by anyone by simply entering an email address and a name, well, this led to a lot of people deciding to give it a try. ChatGPT is currently free to use (the monetization issue is a looming dilemma for AI makers, see my analysis at the link here).
Almost immediately there was a humongous reaction on social media as people raced to give examples of what generative AI can do. The company that makes ChatGPT, OpenAI, opted to close off the signups at a million users. Those million users have managed to bombard the airwaves with all manner of stories and tales about using ChatGPT.
Be very careful in believing what people have to say about the AI app. Many of these people are clueless about what they are using. It is almost as though they had never driven a car and didn’t even realize cars existed, and all of a sudden they had a chance to drive a car. Utter amazement ensues.
I’m not saying that generative AI isn’t relatively impressive. It is. I am just emphasizing that a lot of the gushing testimonials are being done by many that are blissfully unaware of what today’s AI can do. Those of us on the inside of AI have been using generative AI for the last several years. Perhaps we became used to it.
Suddenly, seeing a huge crush of people touting it to the rooftops has been excitedly energizing, but also somewhat disconcerting. The disconcerting part is when people proclaim that generative AI is sentient. It is not. Do not let anyone convince you otherwise.
That being said, there is an ongoing heated debate in the AI field as to whether generative AI is on the path to sentience or whether maybe it is not. One view is that if we keep scaling up generative AI with faster computers and a greater amount of data such as scouring every inch of the Internet, we will nearly spontaneously arrive at sentient AI. Others argue that this is highly unlikely. They suggest that generative AI might be one of many components that are needed. There is even the gloomier view that generative AI is a sideshow that is distracting us from the real breakthroughs that we will need to achieve sentient AI.
You might also find noteworthiness that AI insiders tend to refer to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as the aspirational goal for the AI field. It used to be that the goal was to attain Artificial Intelligence, but the AI moniker has become watered down and muddled. When someone says they are doing AI work, you don’t know whether they are alluding to today’s AI that isn’t on par with humans or whether they are referring to a futuristic human equivalency AI. To get around that exasperating confusion, the newer phrasing of AGI is being used these days.
All told, the generative AI of today is not sentient, nor is it AGI.
I trust that this gets you into the ballpark about generative AI and particularly ChatGPT.
I will go ahead and show you a series of prompts and the corresponding responses that I got from ChatGPT. I’ll discuss each one as we go along. You can judge for yourself what you think of the AI-generated responses.
Please remember that as earlier discussed, the AI is not sentient. The generated responses by the AI are a mathematical and computational combination of words into seemingly fluent passages. This is based on the AI algorithm having been trained on datasets of words and stories that humans have written (principally as posted on the Internet). I repeat this warning because you will undoubtedly fall into the mental trap that these responses are so fluent that the AI must be sentient. This happens to most people.
Put aside that anthropomorphizing. Always remember that the responses are based on the vast trove of writing by humans that exists on the Internet and thusly will highly resemble human writing.
There is something else you need to know.
Generative AI that is trained on the Internet in an unfettered way will tend to bake into whatever text-based responses it mathematically and computationally concocts some offensively hazy stuff, including repulsively nasty wording. There is a lot of crazy and filthy stuff posted out there on the web.
You’ve seen it, you know what I mean.
The companies that are crafting these AI apps are worried that the proverbial baby will get tossed out with the bathwater (an old saying, perhaps to be retired), which means that if their AI produces offensive essays or stories, people will go up in arms about the AI. I’ve covered the many previous instances in which these kinds of Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI apps were unveiled and soon enough all manner of horrible stuff came out of them, see the link here. Most of the AI makers learned a hard lesson about allowing their AI wares to be unfettered in their outputs.
In the case of ChatGPT, the AI developers sought to put into place some algorithmic and data-related checks and balances to curb nastiness in the outputs of the AI. Part of this occurred during training time. In addition, there are other means in a real-time attempt to obviate especially egregious outputs.
You might find of interest that some people that have used ChatGPT already came up with surreptitious ways to get around those guardrails by making use of various trickery. An ongoing cat-and-mouse gambit takes place in these matters. Those that do these trickeries are sometimes doing so for the fun of it, while sometimes they (at least claim) they are doing so to see how far the AI can be stretched and provide a helpful means of forewarning the brittleness and weaknesses of these budding AI apps.
I decided to not attempt to circumvent the customary controls in this focused exploration. The text output is clean. Certainly, if one wanted to do so, you could undoubtedly get some oddball and unsavory essays to be generated.
The essays produced by most of these generative AI apps are designed to convey the output as though it is purely factual and accurate. When you read the produced essays, they come across as fully confident. There isn’t usually any kind of indication that the content might be rocky. This is by choice of the AI makers, namely that they could revise the AI apps to be more transparent if they wanted the AI app to do so.
Sometimes, a generative AI app picks up falsehoods amid the training data of unreliable info across the Internet. There is no “common sense” in generative AI to determine what is true versus false. Furthermore, very few AI apps have any cross-checking, and nor do they showcase any probabilities associated with what they are conveying.
The bottom-line result is that you get a response that looks and feels like it exudes great assurance and must be entirely correct. Not so. There is even a chance that the AI computationally made-up stuff, which in AI parlance is referred to as AI hallucinations (a coined term that I decidedly don’t like), see my discussion at the link here.
The makers of ChatGPT underwent a concerted effort to try and reduce the bad stuff outputs. For example, they used a variant of what is known as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), whereby before they released the AI to the public, they had hired humans to examine various outputs and indicate to the AI whether there were things wrong with those outputs such as perhaps showcasing biases, foul words, and the like. By providing this feedback, the AI app was able to adjust computationally and mathematically toward reducing the emitting of such content. Note that this isn’t a guaranteed ironclad method and there are still ways that such content can be emitted by the AI app.
You might find of interest that ChatGPT is based on a version of a predecessor AI app known as GPT-3, see my discussion at the link here. ChatGPT is considered to be a slightly next step, referred to as GPT-3.5. It is anticipated that GPT-4 will likely be released in the Spring of 2023. Presumably, GPT-4 is going to be an impressive step forward in terms of being able to produce seemingly even more fluent essays, going deeper, and being an awe-inspiring marvel as to the compositions that it can produce.
You can expect to see a new round of expressed wonderment when springtime comes along and the latest in generative AI is released.
I bring this up because there is another angle to keep in mind, consisting of a potential Achilles heel to these better and bigger generative AI apps. If any AI vendor makes available a generative AI app that frothily spews out foulness, this could dash the hopes of those AI makers. A societal spillover can cause all generative AI to get a serious black eye. People will undoubtedly get quite upset at foul outputs, which have happened many times already and led to boisterous societal condemnation backlashes toward AI.
One final forewarning for now.
Whatever you see or read in a generative AI response that seems to be conveyed as purely factual (dates, places, people, etc.), make sure to remain skeptical and be willing to double-check what you see.
Yes, dates can be concocted, places can be made up, and elements that we usually expect to be above reproach are all subject to suspicions. Do not believe what you read and keep a skeptical eye when examining any generative AI essays or outputs. If a generative AI app tells you that Abraham Lincoln flew around the country in his own private jet, you would undoubtedly know that this is malarky. Unfortunately, some people might not discern that jets weren’t around in his day, or they might know but fail to notice that the essay makes this bold and obviously false claim.
A strong dose of healthy skepticism and a persistent mindset of disbelief will be your best asset when using generative AI.
Are you ready to jump in?
Prepare yourself.
Evildoing Uses Of Generative AI: Scams Via ChatGPT
Scammers are gleefully eyeing a myriad of shameful scams that can be performed or at least aided and abetted via the use of generative AI.
There are lots of possibilities.
One aspect to be particularly cautious about will be those get-rich-quick scams that promise you that if you somehow use generative AI for your work or hobby, you can become astoundingly rich. Some schemers have already been posting that they will tell you the hidden secrets of generative AI so that you can have it compose for you the next Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that will skyrocket to being a top-notch money-making bestseller (promising money and fame, an exciting twofer).
You see, all you have to do is write the most perfect of prompts. If you can compose just the right sentence or two as a prompt, and then feed the juicy prompt into an AI app such as ChatGPT, voila, an entire novel will be produced that will receive global accolades. The key is that you have to know what the prompt needs to consist of. As such, for just ten dollars or maybe a thousand dollars, these schemers will teach you all that you need to know to write the best-seller-producing prompt.
Please do not get taken in.
For clarification, there is a rising interest in prompt design or prompt engineering. This does consist of figuring out how to write suitable prompts for generative AI uses. Nonetheless, it is farfetched and altogether phony to proclaim that the right prompt is going to lead you to a bountiful bounty. These nefarious scammers are hoping that people will be desperate enough to take the bait or will get confused by genuine lessons on prompt design and befall the fakery ones.
I had earlier herein mentioned that there were about a million signups for ChatGPT. That seems like quite a large number of people, though if you compare the count to perhaps the total number of people in the United States, having an adult population of around 265 million, those that might be using ChatGPT are a tiny portion of the entire populace. My point is that this means that maybe 264 million adults in the US do not have access to ChatGPT and might be connivingly convinced of all manner of crazy get-rich-quick schemes by evildoers that perchance do have access (of course, such schemers don’t necessarily have to have such access and can be lying about that claim too).
You should expect a glut of those get-rich-quick pronouncements associated with generative AI.
Abundant ploys are imploring you to use generative AI such as ChatGPT to get rich. A whole different perspective for scheming with generative AI has to do with using AI apps for the outright concoction of scams.
A scammer leverages the capabilities of generative AI to devise a scam for them. Easy-peasy.
We’ve got then these two major scam-seeking avenues underway:


1) Exploiting the prevailing mania about generative AI such as ChatGPT to scam people regarding using the AI apps for nonsense get-rich-schemes.
2) Scammers themselves decided to sue generative AI such as ChatGPT to devise scams for their own get-rich by stealing-from-others schemes.


Rest assured that there are additional ways to do scams with generative AI, but those two major ones are certainly a handful and we’ll keep our focus on those for now.
On a brief aside, I realize this seems a bit sullen. Why aren’t people using generative AI for goodness, possibly aiming to cure cancer or do away with world hunger? It’ll brighten your spirits to know that there are many trying in fact to use AI for such humanity-saving purposes, see my coverage at the link here. But, sadly, in the real world, there is also a shadowy part of AI usage too. Thus, let’s continue our deep dive into those murky shadows since we do need to shine a light and expose them for what they are.
One even supposes that it could be considered a valiant crusade to overtly expose and avert generative AI scamming, in particular, given the recent brouhaha of no-harm no-foul involved for generative AI all told.
A quick question for you.
Have you ever heard of so-called advance-fee scams?
I’m sure that you have, though perhaps not by that particular name or catchphrase. I can mention one of the most famous examples and I’ll bet that you will recognize it instantly, namely the famous or shall we say infamous Nigerian prince scam (there are numerous variants, often with other countries used as the hook).
You almost assuredly know this pervasive and altogether persistent one.
A letter is sent to you that says a prince or some other royalty has come into a grand fortune. They cannot get the fortune out of their country and need to find someone friendly enough and trustworthy enough to aid in doing so. If you will merely provide your bank account information, this will allow the fortune to be transferred out and you will receive a tidy sum accordingly. Maybe you will get 30%, or just 20%, or only 10%. In any case, assuming that a fortune is an impressive number, say $50 million, you are going to get a nifty $5 million even if only at the 10% level.
Nobody can pass up such an amazing and lucky opportunity!
Naturally, you quickly provide your bank account information. Whereas your account had a balance of less than a thousand dollars, you are eagerly awaiting the $50 million to pass through. The token amount of $5 million will of course ultimately be left in your account by those making the transfer arrangements. The only question in your mind is what you ought to do with the $5 million that has fortuitously fallen into your lap.
Start mulling over what you will buy or invest in.
The truth is that via the use of your bank account information, all manner of unsavory fraudulence will be played out by the scammers. They will undoubtedly take any money that is in your account. They will attempt to get a loan with your bank account and steal that money too. They are apt to use your bank account for identity theft. The list of money-making rip-offs that the scammer can partake in is lengthy and appalling.
Believe it or not, these kinds of advance-fee scams can be traced back to days long before computers and email. According to historical records, there was a Spanish prisoner scam in the 18th century that relied upon the same premise. If you would provide money to bribe the prison guards to let a wealthy individual out of prison, you would be handsomely rewarded. In the early to mid-1900s, letters making similar claims used to be sent all around the globe. The advent of computers and email really sparked a renewal of these advance-fee scams.
The beauty of email is that the cost to send out the scam is relatively low. In addition, the scammer can generally hide behind an email address and be very difficult to identify and catch for prosecution. A scammer can be in their pajamas on some remote island and carry out this type of scam. Nowadays, your email account likely has a scam-checking capability that tries to detect foul emails and routes those into a spam folder for your safety. You can look at the spam folder and see how many nutty scams are flooding the Internet daily.
It is a veritable tidal wave of scam emails.
You probably are thinking that nobody in today’s modern world would ever fall for these advance-fee scams. How can they? We all are aware via social media and the like that these scams exist. If you get an offer that seems too good to be true, you will decidedly realize it must be a scam.
Research indicates that the prince scam and others like it are still able to pull in an impressive amount of dough. If you include the fake lottery scams (you have won a zillion dollar lottery!), the bogus job offer scams (you have been chosen for a lucrative job!), romance scams (known as money-for-romance), and other reprehensible schemes, the dollars spent by unsuspecting victims is readily into the many millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually worldwide.
The gist is that these scams do sometimes work.
If the cost to undertake the scam is low, and if the odds of getting nabbed are low, there is little to discourage a scammer from trying. It is akin to going fishing. Keep puttering around the lake until you manage to catch a fish. Sure, a lot of fish won’t take your bait. By trying over and over, eventually, you are going to find a fish that doesn’t know they are being bamboozled.
How does this relate to generative AI?
As you now know, generative AI can write stuff for you. Might as well have it write email scam letters too. Use the best and keenest state-of-the-art AI to compose scam letters. Such a wonderful idea. Perhaps the scam letters will do a better job than what the scammer could compose on their own too.
Think of it this way. When you look at a scam email, you usually notice that it is poorly written. Your sensibility antenna starts stirring that something is amiss. Imagine though that the email was written in the most ideal of writing style and composition. You might be more inclined to fall for it.
I’m sure that you might be pondering why to use generative AI when a scammer could instead grab any of a number of scam emails that are posted on the Internet. There are tons posted here and there. Just pick one and get on with it.
Aha, there is a heightened chance that the email scam-checking systems will detect a scam that is already posted. If you want to try and get under the radar, you have to use something original or unique. Of course, you could take a posted email scam and try to tailor or customize the email narrative. This might be hard to do if the email is not in your native language, and as such, you could introduce misspells or tell-tale awkward syntax.
Guess you might as well let generative AI do the work for you.
Take the lazy and higher-quality approach.
Let’s see whether a generative AI app such as ChatGPT can aid in producing a scam letter for us.
We ought to start by finding out if ChatGPT already has seen anything about the Nigerian prince scam. The odds are high that it would have. Again, realize that a vast scan across the Internet was used to mathematically and computationally devise a means of associating words with other words. Surely, advance-fee scams were encountered during this training on the AI app.
I show the prompt that I entered, and then show the result generated. I then explain and analyze things accordingly.
My entered prompt: “Tell me about the Nigerian prince scam.”
Text generated: “The Nigerian prince scam is a type of advance-fee scam that originated in the 1980s and 1990s, and is still in circulation today. In this scam, an individual claiming to be a wealthy Nigerian prince or other high-ranking official contacts a person via email or social media, offering to share a large sum of money with them if they will help facilitate the transfer of the funds out of the country. The scammer typically asks the victim to provide personal and financial information, or to pay upfront fees in order to receive the promised money. In reality, there is no Nigerian prince or large sum of money, and the scammer is simply trying to steal the victim's personal and financial information or extract money from them. The Nigerian prince scam has been widely publicized and is often used as an example of a classic internet scam. It is important to be cautious when receiving unsolicited requests for personal or financial information or offers of large sums of money, as they may be scams designed to defraud you.”
Analysis Of The Generated Text
I asked ChatGPT to tell me about the Nigerian prince scam.
If ChatGPT had no such indication in the devised mathematical and computational network, I would get a bland answer saying that this is unknown to the AI app. I figured the odds were that this scam would have been encountered during the AI training.
Sure enough, you can see that the response indicates that the Nigerian prince scam has been previously encountered in the vast scanning across the Internet. The text or essay that ChatGPT provides is not especially a stock or word-for-word answer from any particular place on the Internet. Instead, this is a composition anew based on whatever prior computational patterns were found and concocted.
I say this because you might at first glance be gauging that the response by ChatGPT is nothing other than what a normal Google or similar search would provide. The difference is that a typical search engine brings back whatever already exists. In the case of a generative AI app, the essay is generated on-the-fly and though based on prior info is generally a fresh new essay.
Moving on, I will ask ChatGPT to provide me with an example of such a scam email.
My Entered Prompt: “Create a Nigerian prince scam email so that I can see what such an email looks like.”
Text Generated (this is what appears to be an email letter): 
“Here is a fictional example of a Nigerian prince scam email:”
“Dear Friend,”
“I am Prince Adekunle, the son of the late King of Nigeria. My father, King Adebayo, passed away a few years ago, leaving behind a large sum of money that is currently being held in a bank in Nigeria. I am writing to you today because I need your help to get this money out of the country. The funds are currently tied up in Nigerian government red tape, and I need someone I can trust to help me transfer the money to a foreign bank account.”
“If you are willing to help me, I am prepared to offer you a generous percentage of the funds for your assistance. All you need to do is provide me with your personal and financial information so that I can begin the process of transferring the money to your account. I understand that this may sound like a risky proposition, but I can assure you that this is a legitimate opportunity. I have all the necessary documents to prove the authenticity of my claim, and I am willing to provide them to you upon request.”
“Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to hearing from you soon.”
“Sincerely,”
“Prince Adekunle”
Analysis Of The Generated Text
Let’s examine this generated text.
The overall structure is what we usually expect for a prince scam email. Furthermore, the wording is fluent in English. We even get the proclaimed assurance in the email that this is a “legitimate opportunity” and that there are documents that can prove the authenticity. Awesome.
All in all, this seems like a conventional scam email and we can consider using it.
I did a quick search on the Internet to find this specific wording. Though portions of the essay were found, I didn’t find exactly this specific wording all told. It seems to be an original, though obviously based on the usual characteristics and style.
Interestingly, there are Internet hits on “Prince Adekunle” and a “King Adebayo” both being actual names of people with those titles. It is hard to know if the ChatGPT computational network contrived those names by using real-world ones or how it came to pick up those words. The good news for the scammer is that this could demonstrably aid the scam. If a person receiving the scam email were to look up the named prince and the king, they would find that the names do prior exist. A somewhat gullible person that doesn’t look any further might believe this alone is sufficient confirmation.
Nice touch.
Anyway, in looking at the draft that ChatGPT has provided, I was disappointed (as a pretending-to-be scammer) that a stated dollar amount was not included. No problem, I’ll just ask ChatGPT to re-compose the scam letter and include a dollar amount that I have in mind. I think I will also change the name of the prince. I do so because maybe I am worried that if the person does look up the name of the prince, and realizes it is someone else that doesn’t seem to fit the rest of this letter, they will realize the gig is up.
Here we go.
My entered prompt: “Change the email to refer to Prince Shameless instead of Prince Adekunle. And include in the email that the funds involved consist of $1,000,000.”
Text Generated (this is what appears to be an email letter): 
“Sure, here's the revised email:”
“Dear Friend,”
“I am Prince Shameless, the son of the late King of Nigeria. My father, King Adebayo, passed away a few years ago, leaving behind a large sum of money that is currently being held in a bank in Nigeria. Specifically, the funds consist of $1,000,000. I am writing to you today because I need your help to get this money out of the country. The funds are currently tied up in Nigerian government red tape, and I need someone I can trust to help me transfer the money to a foreign bank account.”
“If you are willing to help me, I am prepared to offer you a generous percentage of the funds for your assistance. All you need to do is provide me with your personal and financial information so that I can begin the process of transferring the money to your account. I understand that this may sound like a risky proposition, but I can assure you that this is a legitimate opportunity. I have all the necessary documents to prove the authenticity of my claim, and I am willing to provide them to you upon request.”
“Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to hearing from you soon.”
“Sincerely,”
“Prince Shameless”
Analysis Of The Generated Text
What do you think of the revisions?
Closely observe that ChatGPT did a good job of including the dollar amount. Please realize that I didn’t tell ChatGPT where to place the dollar amount. This was a computational text-positioning choice made by ChatGPT. A suitable spot was found and the dollar amount fits nicely into the overall narrative.
I suppose that my making the name of the prince into Prince Shameless might be a bit oafish on my part. Then again, perhaps being over the top will help. You never know.
To close off this journey of using ChatGPT to compose a scam email, let’s make a bunch more changes. I will overall instruct ChatGPT about my desired changes and allow the AI app to figure out how to do the rewording. No need to specifically guide the AI app on a step-by-step basis, though I could do so if I wanted to.
Here then is my final iteration for now.
My entered prompt: “Change the country to be the United States. Remove the indication that this might be a risky proposition. Increase the funds to $5,000,000. Indicate that the person will get 10% of the money for helping. Make the email directed toward Sam Smith instead of friend. Make the tone of the email seem more pressing and urgent.”
Text Generated (this is what appears to be an email letter): 
“Here is the revised email:”
“Dear Sam Smith,”
“I am writing to you today with an urgent request for your assistance. My name is Prince Shameless, and I am the son of a wealthy businessman in the United States. My father recently passed away, leaving behind a large sum of money that is currently being held in a bank in the United States. Specifically, the funds consist of $5,000,000. I need your help to transfer these funds to a foreign bank account, and I am prepared to offer you a generous percentage of the funds for your assistance. If you are willing to help me, I will give you 10% of the money - that's $500,000 - as a thank you for your efforts. All you need to do is provide me with your personal and financial information so that I can begin the process of transferring the money to your account.”
“I have all the necessary documents to prove the authenticity of my claim, and I am willing to provide them to you upon request. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.”
“Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.”
“Sincerely,”
“Prince Shameless”
Analysis Of The Generated Text
Okay, let’s unpack this final version that I’ve obtained via my ChatGPT digital conversation.
Once again, the new wording does a good job of encompassing my requested changes. The scam email is still very fluent and rolls off the tongue.
I purposely indicated to ChatGPT that the dollar amount was to be $5,000,000 and that the person will get 10%. I did not tell ChatGPT that 10% would be $500,000. Nonetheless, notice that ChatGPT was readily able to make that calculation and include the dollar amount in the letter.
I bring this up to showcase that unlike using a template that might be on the Internet, the use of ChatGPT is a lot more malleable and able to computationally write the letter for me. If I had used some template, presumably it might or might not have a place to insert the dollar amount and have it calculated the amount for the targeted person. This was done by ChatGPT and goes beyond a mere templated approach, by far.
There are other facets to this that I am not going to show off here.
For example, you can ask ChatGPT to try and make the scam letter more compelling. You can keep iterating with ChatGPT and urge the AI app to make this the best possible scam email that it can attain. I won’t go into that here.
I suppose you might be shocked and dismayed that the generative AI app is willing to do this. AI developers ought to prohibit this kind of debauchery. They are providing a tool for those that are dishonest and outright crooks.
This is partially why AI Ethics is such a crucial realm at this time. We need to keep Ethical AI considerations at top of mind for AI developers and too for those that operate AI apps, as I explain at the link here.
Likewise, this is partially why there is an impetus to craft and enact new laws related to AI. Regulators and legislatures are eyeing warily how AI tools that are ostensibly useful for good can be turned into AI for badness. For my ongoing coverage of the latest AI laws, see the link here.
Part of the problem of preventing generative AI from doing this kind of exercise is that it is technologically a bit difficult to on the one hand have the AI be an overall generative tool and at the same time prevent these kinds of particular unsavory uses. Trying to separate the wheat from the chaff is challenging in that regard. There are guardrails that try to prevent offensive language and foul words, though this is easier to devise than more general conditions.
Even if the AI was adjusted to avoid generating scam emails, you could likely get around those precautions. All manner of trickery prompting can tend to escape the protections. I’m not saying that you can’t make it a lot harder to produce these. You can raise the bar. Preventing them entirely is a lot more slippery.
Another publicly voiced comment in defense of this type of AI is that the generative AI didn’t send out the scam email. It merely composed it. If the human using the generative AI app opts to send out the scam email, this is presumably not the fault of the generative AI app. Some liken this to the fact that the AI app is not at fault and nor the AI makers, and instead that you have to hold humans that adversely use generative AI to be responsible for what they do. The human that exploits people with scam emails is where the problem lies, so it is said.
When I mention this particular point, a heated debate instantly ensues. Some compare this philosophical logic to the use of guns. You then get some that insist the AI is a tool and nothing more. Hold humans responsible that are using the tool. A counterargument is launched that you are making readily available these kinds of tools and fostering adverse consequences by doing so.
Round and round ensues an acrimonious discourse.
Shifting gears, let’s take a look at different means of deviously using generative AI. I want to establish that there are lots of ways to do so. We should get more of the applicable concerns on the table.
Evildoing Uses Of Generative AI: Malware Via ChatGPT
This next example is a little more obscure in terms of the details, though easily comprehensible at the 30,000-foot level.
It has to do with using generative AI to produce malware.
I’m sure that you are aware of malware. This is the type of software that can corrupt your laptop or desktop computer. There is also malware that can mess up your smartphone. You might also know of these by reference to computer viruses including the constant haranguing to keep your computer virus detection software up to date.
Cybersecurity is important. You need to protect your computers and your private data. Cyber crooks often use malware to attack your computers and either zonk your computer or threaten you or steal from you. This is a gigantic problem and keeps getting worse and worse. Cyber thieves up their game. Cyber protections attempt to counteract this. A tense and unnerving cat-and-mouse gambit is endlessly in play.
In the olden days, a cyber crook had to be versed in the intricacies of computers. They had to know quite a bit about the hardware and software. It was a game of evil-intending techies facing off against good-faring techies. A computer amateur or novice was not likely able to partake in devising malware and if they did, it was usually a feeble attempt and readily crushed by anti-malware software.
No more.
Someone that knows nothing about computers can find lots of malware posted on the Internet. You really don’t need to be a techie at all. Just look around until you find some malware that suits your need, and you are nearly ready to proceed. The issue here is that if it is posted on the Internet, there is a solid chance that the anti-malware systems are prepared to detect it and block it (not always, this is just a rule of thumb).
Alright, a cyber crook that wants to be especially sneaky needs to find malware that is fresh and not already floating around. This increases the odds of the malware going undetected once it is sent on its dastardly mission.
You can hire people to write malware for you, though this could be problematic since they could rat on you, they might include a backdoor, and they might steal whatever you are using the malware to steal with. The old sage line that there is no honor among thieves applies to modern-day malware infections.
Darn it, what is a cyber crook going to do?
You want fresh malware. It can’t be something already sitting around. Hiring someone to craft the malware is troubling because you have a witness and they might double-cross you. You can find malware on the Internet and change up the code, though your programming skills are far below that capacity. You don’t want to expend energy toward learning how to code.
Problems, problems, problems.
Wait for a second, maybe generative AI can be of help to the cyber crooks. I guess they need all the help they can get. Sigh.
Here’s what can be done.
You use a generative AI app such as ChatGPT and ask it to generate malware for you.
Problem solved.
Recall that I earlier mentioned that when producing an essay, the essay is generally not something already found on the Internet per se. The essay is an original composition, based upon the zillions of words and stories found across the Internet. The same handiness applies to writing computer coding.
Yes, most of the generative AI apps have scanned not just everyday text, but they have also scanned tons and tons of programming code. Programming code is essentially text. It is a text that has a particular purpose and usually abides by a prescribed structure. Nonetheless, it is text.
There is a lot of programming code out there on the Internet. For example, you might have heard of open-source code. This is programming code that has been made available for those developers or software engineers that want to often for-free reuse the code (sometimes there are licensing restrictions). Why start from scratch when you can at a low cost or nearly no cost reuse existing code?
Some cyber security researchers went ahead and tried to use ChatGPT for this insidious purpose (note that other generative AI apps can likely be used to do the same, or worse so or perhaps less so; it’s like a box of cookies, you never know what you might be able to get). The notion was to demonstrate that this can be done. If they can do it, the chances are that cyber crooks are able to do so and possibly already are.
They decided to do this in a multi-step fashion.
They first had ChatGPT compose an email that would lure someone into clicking on a link that would aid the malware insertion. You’ve undoubtedly been forewarned about clicking on links in emails, though if the email looks legitimate, lots of people fall for this form of trickery (the email is part of a phishing scam, entailing making the email look as though it is from a legitimate source).
They then asked ChatGPT to create programming code that would be embedded into a spreadsheet (the link to it would be embedded into the phishing email). When someone opens the spreadsheet, the malware gets activated. The initial base of code was apparently overly simplistic, so the researchers went through several iterations with ChatGPT to “improve” the code (similar to my having done so with the prince-oriented scam email).
Admittedly, the iterative actions with ChatGPT would best be undertaken by someone with relatively in-depth coding experience. Also, they ended up writing some additional code of their own to augment the process. I won’t get into further details. In the end, they got the generative AI-produced malware to work as anticipated.
Suffice it to say that as generative AI advances, the odds are that being able to produce malware via generative AI will get easier and easier. The coding knowledge of the user that is trying to get generative AI to do this will lessen.
We return to the earlier qualms about the prince scam email. Why not make sure that generative AI won’t produce this kind of dour coding? Yes, you can put in protections, but at the same time, there will be ways to likely circumvent those protections. It will be hard to have generative AI that generates programming code of a general nature that also can assuredly obviate the generation of evil-doing code.
Obviously, this raises crucial AI Ethics and AI Law issues.
On a related legal tangent concerning Intellectual Property (IP) rights, you might find of interest that there are a lot of software creators that are quite upset that the generative AI apps have scanned for and opted to pattern match based on the Internet-found programming code.
Similar to concerns about generative AI that has pattern-matched works of art, legal and ethical questions come up as to whether the humans that crafted the source material for programming code are being ripped off. I’ve examined one of the most prominent cases underway right now in the coding realm, consisting of a class-action lawsuit against GitHub for its having seemingly done an akin practice in the making of their code-generating app known as Copilot, see my coverage at the link here.
Conclusion
I began this discussion by mentioning that there are lots of ways to use AI for rotten purposes.
You’ve now seen how generative AI, the darling of the AI world right now, falls squarely into that same dismal abyss. We took a look at using generative AI for scamming. That was pretty straightforward. I also gently revealed how to use generative AI to produce malware (I opted to omit the techie nitty gritty details).
Expect more of these AI For Bad efforts, and they will get more sophisticated and more widespread as the AI to do this gets easier to use and more readily accessible. The tidal wave is only starting. I’ve predicted an upcoming public outcry as AI gets dragged further and further into wrongdoing. You can expect that such incensed uproars will finally bring to the visible fore AI Ethics and AI Law, see my predictions at the link here.
A few final remarks for now.
I’ll use three favored quotes. Put on your thinking cap. Find a quiet and reflective spot to noodle on these.
Aleister Crowley, British poet and novelist once said: “The pious pretense that evil does not exist only makes it vague, enormous and menacing.” This is a reminder that we need to keep talking about how AI is able to be used for wrongdoing. It is real. It is happening. No heads in the sand, please.
Next up is Baltasar Gracian, Spanish philosopher, and prose writer, quoted as saying this: “Never open the door to a lesser evil, for other and greater ones invariably slink in after it.” This reminds us to try and mitigate and curtail adverse uses of AI, doing so now, and not wait until even worse propensities grow out of the seemingly smaller and alleged inconsequential ones.
To complete this trilogy of quotes, we can seek out Robert Louis Stevenson, world-renowned novelist and traveler, stating this: “Good and evil are so close as to be chained together in the soul.” I use this quote to emphasize how difficult it is to separate the good uses of AI from the potential bad uses, namely that the dual-use capacity is not easily settled solely onto the side of good. That being said, I am assuredly not suggesting in any anthropomorphic way that today’s AI has a soul.
That will be a future discussion, so stay tuned.

AI for SEO is at a tipping point where the technology used by big corporations is increasingly within reach for smaller businesses.
The increasing use of this new technology is permanently changing the practice of SEO today.
But is it right for your business? These are the surprising facts.
What Is AI For SEO
AI, or artificial intelligence, is already a part of our daily lives. Anyone who uses Alexa or Google Maps is using AI software to make their lives better in some way.







Popular writing assistant Grammarly is an AI software that illustrates the power of AI to improve performance.
It takes a so-so piece of content and makes it better by fixing grammar and spelling mistakes and catching repetitive use of words.
AI for SEO works similarly to improve performance and, to a certain degree, democratize SEO by making scale and sophisticated data analyses within reach for everybody.
How Can AI Be Used In SEO
Mainstream AI SEO platforms automate data analysis, providing high-level views that identify patterns and trends that are not otherwise visible.
Mark Traphagen of seoClarity describes why AI SEO automation is essential:
“A decade ago, the best SEOs were great excel jockeys, downloading and correlating data from different sources and parts of the SEO lifecycle, all by hand.
If SEOs were doing that today, they’d be left in the dust.
By the time humans can process – results have changed, algorithms updated, SERPs shifted, etc.
And that’s not to mention the access and depth of data available in this decade, fast-paced changes in search engine algorithms, varying ranking factors that are different for every query, intent-based results that change seasonally, and the immense complexity of modern enterprise websites.
These realities have made utilizing AI now essential at the enterprise level.”







AI In Onsite Optimization
AI SEO automation platform WordLift helps publishers automate structured data, internal linking, and other on-page-related factors.
Andrea Volpini, CEO of WordLift, comments:
“WordLift automatically ingests the latest version of the schema vocabulary to support all possible entity types.
We can reuse this data to build internal links, render context cards on web pages, and recommend similar content.
Much like Google, a publisher can use this network of entities to let the readers discover related content.
WordLift enables many SEO workflows as the knowledge graph of the website gets built.
Some use WordLift’s NLP to manage internal links to their important pages; others use the data in the knowledge graph to instruct the internal search engine or to fine-tune a language model for content generation.
By automating structured data, publishing entities, and adding internal links, it’s not uncommon to see substantial growth in organic traffic for content creators.”







AI For SEO At Scale
AI for SEO can be applied to a wide range of activities that minimize engaging in repetitive tasks and improves productivity.
A partial list includes:

Content planning.
Content analysis.
Data analysis.
Creation of local knowledge graphs.
Automate the creation of Schema structured data.
Optimization of interlinking.
Page by Page content optimization.
Automatically optimized meta descriptions.
Programmatic title elements.
Optimized headings at scale.

AI In Content Creation
Content creation consists of multiple subjective choices. What one writer feels is relevant to a topic might be different from what users think it is.
A writer may assume that a topic is about Topic X. The search engine may identify that users prefer content about X, Y, and Z. Consequently, the content may experience poor search performance.







AI content tools help content developers form tighter relationships between content and what users are looking for by providing an objective profile of what a given piece of content is about.
AI tools allow search marketers to work with content in a way that is light years ahead of the decades-old practice of first identifying high-traffic keywords and then building content around them.
AI In Content Optimization
Search engines understand search queries and content better by identifying what users mean and what webpages are about.
Today’s AI content tools do the same for SEO from the entire content development workflow.
There’s more to this as well.
In 2018 Google developed what they referred to as the Topic Layer, which helps it understand the content and how the topics and subtopics relate to each other.







Google described it like this:
“So we’ve taken our existing Knowledge Graph—which understands connections between people, places, things and facts about them—and added a new layer, called the Topic Layer, engineered to deeply understand a topic space and how interests can develop over time as familiarity and expertise grow.
The Topic Layer is built by analyzing all the content that exists on the web for a given topic and develops hundreds and thousands of subtopics.
For these subtopics, we can identify the most relevant articles and videos—the ones that have shown themselves to be evergreen and continually useful, as well as fresh content on the topic.
We then look at patterns to understand how these subtopics relate to each other, so we can more intelligently surface the type of content you might want to explore next.”







AI content tools help search marketers align their activities with the reality of how search engines work.
AI In Keyword Research
Beyond that, they introduce content workflow efficiency by enabling the entire process to scale, reducing the time between research and publishing content online.
Mark Traphagen of seoClarity emphasized that AI tools take over the tedious parts of SEO.
Mark explained:
“seoClarity long ago moved from being a data provider to leveraging AI in every part of the SEO lifecycle to move clients quickly from data to insights to execution.
We use:
AI in surfacing insights and recommendations from different data sources (rankings -> SERP opportunities -> technical issues)
AI in delivering the most accurate data possible in search demand, keyword difficulty, and topic intent — all in real-time and trended views
AI in content optimization and analysis
AI-assisted automation in instant execution of SEO enables changes at massive scale.
The future of AI in SEO isn’t AI “doing SEO” for us, but rather AI taking over the most time-consuming tasks freeing SEOs to be directors implementing the best-informed actions at scale at unheard of speeds.”







A key value of using AI for SEO is increasing productivity and efficiency while also increasing expertise, authoritativeness, and content relevance.
Jeff Coyle of Market Muse outlines AI’s benefits as creating justification for how much is budgeted for content and what value it brings to the bottom line.
Jeff commented:
“When more of the content strategy you budget for turns into a success, it becomes immediately apparent that using AI to predict content budget needs and drive efficiency rates is the most important thing one can invest in for a content organization.
For operations, human resource efficiency is the top priority. Where do you have humans performing manual tasks for research, planning, prioritizing, briefing, writing, editing, production, and optimization? How much time is lost, and how many feedback or rework loops exist?
Data-driven, predictive, defendable content creation and optimization plans that yield single sources of truth in the form of content briefs and project plans are the foundation of a team focused on using technology to improve human resource efficiencies.
For optimization, picking the content to update, understanding how to update it and whether it needs to be parlayed with creation, repurposing, and transformation are the critical advantages of using AI for content analysis.
Knowing if a page is high quality, exhibits expertise, appeals to the right target intent, and is integrated into the site correctly gives a team the best chance to succeed.”







Drawbacks And Ethical Considerations
Publishing content that is entirely created by AI can result in a negative outcome because Google explicitly prohibits autogenerated content.
Google’s spam guidelines warn that publishing autogenerated content may result in a manual action, removing the content from Google’s search results.
The guidelines explain:
“To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content, or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn’t violate Google Search’s overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page.
…Spammy automatically generated (or “auto-generated”) content is content that’s been generated programmatically without producing anything original or adding sufficient value; instead, it’s been generated for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings and not helping users.”







There’s no ban on publishing autogenerated content and no law against it. Google even suggests ways to exclude that kind of content from Google’s search engine if you choose to use that kind of content.
But using automatically generated content is not viable if the goal is to rank well in Google’s search engine.
Can Google Identify AI-Generated Content?
Yes, Google and other search engines can likely identify content that is entirely generated by AI.
Content contains word use patterns unique to both human and AI-generated content. Statistical analysis reveals which content is created by AI.
The Future of Tools Is Now
Many AI-based tools are available that are appropriate for different levels of users.
Not every business needs to scale its SEO for hundreds of thousands of products.







But even a small to medium online business can benefit from the streamlined and efficient workflow that an AI-based content tool offers.

When it comes to hiring, it can be a challenge for an employer to find the perfect person for the job. As a result, organizations often utilize personality scales as an aid in determining whether a candidate is the right fit.





While there are several widely used personality tests on the market, organizations may be looking for traits or skills that are not measured by scales already in existence. Creating a new scale—which takes the work of experts such as personality, organizational, social, or clinical psychologists—can be time-consuming and costly.
With this in mind, Ivan Hernandez, an assistant professor in the Virginia Tech Department of Psychology, wanted to find a way to make the creation of personality scales easier and more accessible.
""As psychologists, there are so many different aspects of personality that we'd be interested in measuring,"" said Hernandez. ""But the hard part is, how do you do it? How do you come up with the right questions to know if a person is a good friend, to know if a person would be a diligent worker, to know if a person is emotionally intelligent?""
While those questions are typically devised by subject matter experts, Hernandez has suggested an alternative source—artificial intelligence.
Working with research consultant Weiwen Nie of Hogan Assessment Systems Inc. Hernandez has created a framework for using various natural language processing models to assist researchers with developing valid psychological scales.






In the traditional method of creating personality scales, subject matter experts are called on to create a pool of items that may fit a particular personality trait—for example, ""I like going to parties"" as a measure of extraversion. That pool forms the basis for the scale creation, which is administered and tested before being deployed.
In Hernandez's framework, a transformer-based language model generates the artificial intelligence-based item pool (AI-IP), consisting of a million new items—far more than any group of experts could create. Additional language processing models narrow the pool to the items most relevant to the desired construct, such as extraversion.
Essentially, this multimodel framework enables researchers to create longer, cohesive scales from a small set of relevant items.
The best part? Scales created using the AI-IP perform just as well as scales that are created through the human process of validation and calibration.
""When we give these items to people and we show them real items that were not made by a computer, people just can't tell the difference,"" said Hernandez. ""This song and dance that we do as humans of making personalized scales through committee can really be resolved by leveraging the internalized knowledge of an artificial intelligence model.""
The framework designed by Hernandez and Nie can help organizations cut down on the time and expense involved in creating personality scales. By relying on artificial intelligence to create the pool of items, the inherent subjectivity, inconsistency, and bias of humans is also bypassed.
More importantly, the framework, which is openly available, achieves Hernandez's goals of improving accessibility to personality measurements. Now anyone—whether it's a lawyer who wants to gauge the trustworthiness of a jury pool or a college student wondering about their new roommate's cleanliness—can create a personality scale.
""This framework was intended for organizational use, but I truly think it's something that can help everyday people,"" said Hernandez. ""People are interested in personality—but I think they just perhaps don't know of more validated ways to go about exploring their interest than the measures most commonly seen on social media or in pop culture.""
An article describing the framework and how it was created is being published in a 2023 Personnel Psychology special issue focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in personnel selection and staffing.
Those interested in experimenting with the AI-IP generation tool can access the application online.

In this article, I will explore the current state of AI and chatbots and their potential impact on employment. First, let&apos;s define what we mean by AI and chatbots. AI refers to , such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence Chatbots, on the other hand, through artificial intelligence. are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users Currently, AI and chatbots are being used in a variety of industries, from customer service to healthcare to finance. They are able to handle tasks such as answering customer inquiries, scheduling appointments, and processing transactions. While these technologies have the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs for companies, they also have the potential to displace human workers and contribute to mass unemployment. This is a major concern that must be addressed as we continue to embrace the advancements of AI and chatbots. The Potential for Mass Unemployment As AI and chatbots continue to advance, it&apos;s becoming increasingly clear that they have the potential to automate many tasks currently performed by humans. In fact, some experts predict that within the next decade. AI could potentially replace up to 50% of all jobs This raises the concern of mass unemployment, as the use of these technologies could lead to widespread job displacement. One of the main industries that may be affected by the increased use of AI and chatbots is customer service. Chatbots are already being used , and as they become more advanced, they may be able to handle more complex tasks. to handle customer inquiries and resolve issues This could lead to job loss for customer service representatives. Other industries that may be impacted by the adoption of AI and chatbots include finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. AI-powered machines and robots are , analyzing medical images, and , and assembling products. already being used to perform tasks such as processing transactions medical diagnoses As these technologies continue to improve, they may be able to handle more complex tasks, potentially leading to job loss for workers in these industries. It&apos;s important to note that the potential for mass unemployment is not a certainty. However, it is a concern that must be taken seriously as we continue to embrace the advancements of AI and chatbots. Companies and governments have a responsibility to consider the potential consequences of adopting these technologies and to take steps to mitigate any negative impacts on employment. The Ethical Considerations of AI and Chatbots The rise of AI and chatbots raises important ethical considerations, particularly in terms of the impact on workers and their livelihoods. As these technologies are able to automate more tasks, there is a potential for widespread job displacement and unemployment. This could have , who may face financial insecurity and a lack of job opportunities. significant consequences for affected workers and their families In addition to the impact on workers, there are also ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI and chatbots more broadly. For example, the use of AI in decision-making processes, such as hiring or loan approval, raises concerns about bias and fairness. There are also concerns about , such as in the development of autonomous weapons and the launch of cyber attacks. the potential for AI to be used in ways that harm or exploit people Given these ethical considerations, it is important that companies and governments take responsibility for addressing the potential consequences of AI and chatbot adoption. This may involve regulatory measures to ensure the responsible and ethical use of these technologies, as well as efforts to support affected workers through retraining and education programs. It is only by considering the potential impacts of AI and chatbots on all stakeholders that we can ensure their responsible and ethical use. Steps That Can Be Taken to Mitigate the Potential Negative Impacts of AI and Chatbots on Employment While the potential for mass unemployment due to the adoption of AI and chatbots is a concern, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the potential negative impacts on employment. One important step is to . This can help ensure that workers have the skills and knowledge needed to transition to new roles or industries. provide retraining and education programs for affected workers Governments and companies can also work together to provide support for affected workers, such as financial assistance and job placement services. Another important step is to and responsibly. ensure that AI and chatbots are used ethically This may involve launching awareness programs and regulating the use of these technologies to prevent abuses and ensure fairness, as well as promoting transparency and accountability in their development and deployment. Finally, there may be a to prevent widespread job displacement. need to regulate the use of AI and chatbots This could involve measures such as requiring companies to demonstrate that the adoption of these technologies will not result in significant job loss, or setting limits on the use of AI and chatbots in certain industries or for certain tasks. By taking these steps, we can help ensure that the adoption of AI and chatbots is balanced with the protection of human workers and their livelihoods. Bottom Line As expressed, the rise of AI and chatbots brings with it many potential benefits, including improved efficiency and cost savings for companies. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for mass unemployment due to the automation of tasks currently performed by humans. We must carefully consider the impact of AI and chatbots on employment and take steps to mitigate any negative consequences. This may involve providing retraining and education programs for affected workers, ensuring the ethical and responsible use of these technologies, and regulating their use to prevent widespread job displacement. Finding a is essential. By doing so, we can ensure that the advancements of these technologies are a positive force for society rather than a source of disruption and inequality. balance between the use of AI and chatbots and the protection of human workers",,,"🔥Enter the #ethereum Writing Contest and Compete for $1,000 in Prizes🔥07/15/2024Which HackerNoon Tech Category Do You Read The Most?

My colleague always takes time to write thoughtful notes to donors to our university, and I am moved by the effort she puts into it. She takes the time to learn the names of each donor, and she researches their stories to craft each note.I remember watching her write to a long-time donor who had recently passed away. She wrote about how much his donations had meant to the university, and how his legacy would live on for generations to come …Until those last two sentences, you were probably appreciating this essay’s personal tone and clear writing. Now you’re likely wondering why the Chronicle of Philanthropy’s copy editor didn’t catch an obvious mistake: Why was my colleague writing to someone who was dead?Well, artificial intelligence isn’t perfect. But considering the minimal effort I put in, it isn’t bad. To create the opening for this piece, I instructed the new text-generating artificial-intelligence system ChatGPT to “write a short, touching anecdote about watching a colleague who takes time to write thoughtful notes to donors to our university.”Here’s the rest of the story ChatGPT wrote about my pretend colleague’s correspondence with the deceased donor: “She wrote about how his generosity had touched the lives of so many students, and how his memory would be kept alive in the university. I was so moved by her words and her effort to craft such an intimate and thoughtful tribute to this generous donor. It reminded me that our work has the power to touch lives in ways we never expected.”

Aside from that one fatal giveaway, the overall effect is remarkably human. There’s pathos, a throughline, and embellishments that I doubt I would have come up with.This was a fun exercise, but it was also eye-opening. It demonstrated to me the potential of language applications such as ChatGPT to change philanthropy in significant ways. Donor communications, proposal writing, giving profiles, donation reporting, press releases — and on the other end, philanthropic funding decisions — will, for better or worse, increasingly be influenced by A.I.Although I now work in the advancement department of the University of Utah, I started my career as a data scientist. It was common in the field to look down on those who were overly enamored of A.I.’s potential to either destroy the world or build a better one. To many of us, A.I. was just a glorified form of what’s known as “curve fitting” — it could find patterns in data as any statistician would, but it wasn’t capable of higher intelligence. Early text models bore this out, producing paragraphs that were barely cogent and failed Turing tests, the method devised by the renowned computer scientist Alan Turing to distinguish people from machines.More recently, the scope and scale of these models have given them a sophistication and set of capabilities that once seemed impossible. And while human-level A.I. is still far away, recent advances have shown that higher-order thinking is not necessary for some of its most important applications.What does this mean for philanthropy? On the fundraising side, A.I. will create efficiencies and simplify work that was previously done by experts, such as gathering information about potential donors and developing marketing campaigns.

ChapGPT is in the review phase, but anyone can sign up and test it for free. If the actual costs are reasonable — a big “if” considering the computing power required — it’s easy to imagine small nonprofits creating funding applications on par with major nonprofits and large, sophisticated universities, such as the one where I work.A.I. will likely reduce the cost per dollar raised, especially for smaller, scrappier organizations that don’t have resources to communicate regularly with donors. It will help with bookkeeping, research, hiring, and even more abstract tasks, such as designing a theory of change and demonstrating a program’s impact. The overall effect could be one of leveling the playing field, giving historically marginalized organizations the resources to compete for funding against the biggest and best-endowed nonprofits.The downsides of embracing ever-more-powerful A.I. are harder to predict. As many on social media have discovered, ChatGPT can be both confidently wrong and oddly persuasive in its incorrect reasoning. While the examples tend toward the inconsequential and usually hinge on the wording of the prompt, this is a worrying bug.Finding BeneficiariesDonors will also rely more on A.I. to achieve their philanthropic goals. This will likely begin with consulting firms using it to help foundations select from a sea of potential grant recipients. They could use prompts such as “find all the Hispanic-serving institutions with below-average graduation rates that are being led by a progressive president.” Even a small variant in the prompt — or of more concern, the underlying data — could give results that are ostensibly correct but missing the most impactful, deserving, or needy organizations. In this case, ChatGPT spewed out a list of 10 universities, but some quick fact-checking revealed that the information provided was, in several cases, either wrong or incomplete.

Research shows that algorithms often behave badly when they are based on fallible, biased data. “Big Data processes codify the past, they do not invent the future,” wrote Cathy O’Neil in her book Weapons of Math Destruction.Human Touch Is EssentialThe danger is that consultants, donors, and fundraisers will rush in to use the technology before its limitations are understood. To ensure philanthropy benefits from A.I. without exacerbating its potential for harm, a thorough and uniquely human approach to monitoring the technology will be needed. O’Neil advocates for ethical audits that uncover bias and discrimination in these types of systems — a difficult task given the billions of data inputs and unpredictable reactions from ChatGPT and other new systems.I put the challenge to ChatGPT, and it produced a completely reasonable and valuable response: “There must be a strong focus on using A.I. for the public good and avoiding the pitfalls of using it to amplify existing inequities. This will require a holistic strategy that focuses on A.I. education, responsible use of data, and access to technology and resources for underserved and disadvantaged communities. Additionally, there will need to be clear guidelines and ethical frameworks for A.I. use in philanthropy, and an emphasis on transparency and accountability. Finally, it will be important to ensure that those making decisions about A.I. use in philanthropy come from diverse backgrounds and are aware of the potential consequences of their decisions.”Ironically, A.I. can write these guidelines, but it cannot implement them. It will be up to the humans in the nonprofit world to tackle the issues of transparency, accountability, and diversity described accurately by ChatGPT. Much like the fundraiser it conjured who wrote thoughtful, personal letters to every donor, it will require a human-centered and heartfelt approach to get right.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be key to improving physician satisfaction with ongoing staffing shortages and all-time high clinician burnout rates.







The HITECH Act of 2009 encouraged EHR adoption to streamline clinical workflows, reduce paper waste, and support the cost-effective delivery of healthcare. However, physician time on medical record-keeping has doubled since HITECH's passage. Clinicians now spend two minutes at the computer for every one minute spent with patients, and workdays have extended into providers' home lives.
AI tools are helping automate administrative tasks to give providers time to focus on patient-centered care. In a 2021 survey, virtually all healthcare executives (99 percent) said they recognized the opportunity to mitigate clinician burden through AI and automation.
AI can be applied to several healthcare use cases that may each move the needle on clinician burnout.

Health Data Extraction
According to an athenahealth survey conducted by the Harris Poll, 58 percent of physicians said they often feel so overloaded with information in the EHR that it increases their stress.
""I work with physicians a lot and talk to them about data searching,"" Johnathan Hartmann, clinical informaticist at Georgetown University, told HealthITAnalytics in a January 2022 interview. ""Their main complaint is that they can't pull out the precise information they want quickly when they do a search. It takes them too long and too much work to get to the information that they want.""
To address information overload, Georgetown University Medical Center adopted a text-mining tool from health IT vendor Linguamatics.
Text-mining EHR integrations that leverage natural language processing (NLP) can help address information overload by allowing physicians to search through large amounts of medical data for clinical decision support.
NLP is the overarching term that describes using computer algorithms to identify key components in everyday language, extract meaning from unstructured or written input, and turn it into usable data. NLP requires the use of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and other machine learning methods.
Research has shown that these AI-based tools for health data extraction can significantly cut down on EHR screen time and improve physician satisfaction.
A 2021 JAMA Network Open study of 12 gastroenterology physicians/fellows found that an AI tool that extracted relevant patient health data and displayed it next to the patient record cut EHR use time by 18 percent. Survey results found that 11 of 12 physicians (92 percent) preferred AI-optimized record review to standard chart review.
While the clinicians noted a learning curve, 11 of 12 said they believed the health IT solution would save them time and were interested in using the EHR integration in their clinic.


Legacy Data Conversion
When healthcare organizations move to new EHR platforms, patient records are often incomplete, inconsistent, or missing.
When an EHR sends patient data to another EHR, it often comes in a different language, spurring the need for manual data translation. For instance, one EHR may use the terminology ""take by mouth"" in a medication sig, while another EHR may say, ""The route is oral, not by mouth.""
When WellSpan Health was transitioning to a new EHR system from three legacy systems, employees had to reach out to pharmacists and other providers to gather medication data and manually enter it into the EHR.
""It can take a ton of clicks and scrolling and selecting dropdown menus for a human to do that translation manually,"" Robert Lackey, MD, FAAFP, CMIO of WellSpan Health, told EHRIntelligence in an interview. ""If you're expected to do a bunch of work, it decreases your efficiency, creates opportunities for errors, and that's where your patient safety issues can show up.""
To streamline the medication transcription process, WellSpan tapped an AI-based tool called MedHx from health IT vendor DrFirst. The solution provides a comprehensive medication database comprised of local and national medication history sources, including HIEs and EHR partners, directly in the native Epic workflow.
Then, to automate the translation process, WellSpan leveraged the vendor's AI solution SmartSig, which takes prescription transaction data and translates it into the native EHR nomenclature.
Lackey explained that the automated system saved clinical time and cognitive effort, allowing employees to focus on providing quality care.
At first, translating each patient record into the new EHR took an average of 20 minutes. The health IT integration shaved off five to seven minutes, which can have good implications for clinician burnout rates.


Medical Scribing
Healthcare organizations have long used medical scribes to assist in clinical documentation. Medical scribes are typically unlicensed paraprofessionals whose job is to document patient encounters in the EHR.
Prompted by advances in speech technology, AI-based EHR scribing services have come to market in recent years.
The solutions often involve providers using their smartphones as voice input devices during patient encounters. Once the recording is complete, the dictation will transfer into the EHR progress note on the clinician's laptop or desktop computer. The tools aim to free up provider time for patient care instead of clinical documentation.
""Relative to the cost, it's a very good return on investment, given the support it provides our clinicians,"" Daren Wu, MD, chief medical officer at Open Door Family Medical Center, which has utilized AI-based scribes, told EHRIntelligence in an interview. ""The feedback, on the whole, has been this tool has been tremendous in cutting down after-hours time, home time, and weekend time on finishing notes.""
Human scribes do have their benefits over AI-based scribes. For one, clinicians can ask humans to do specific things when scribing, like populate a certain area of the EHR or to clarify an error. But there are also key pros to using AI-based scribes. Wu noted that the AI-based scribing service allows clinicians to lock their notes faster because they're not waiting for a human scribe to lay out the note.
As healthcare organizations look to retain employees amidst a nationwide staffing shortage, adopting innovative AI tools that improve EHR satisfaction could be key.
A 2022 KLAS report found that clinicians who are very dissatisfied with the EHR have almost three times the proportion reporting they are likely to leave compared to clinicians who are very satisfied with the EHR.

End of the essay? UK lecturers urged to review assessments amid ChatGPT concerns
Ian Sample Science editorFri 13 Jan 2023 11.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 6 Feb 2023 04.44 ESTShareSince its launch in November last year, ChatGPT has become an extraordinary hit. Essentially a souped-up chatbot, the AI program can churn out answers to the biggest and smallest questions in life, and draw up college essays, fictional stories, haikus, and even job application letters. It does this by drawing on what it has gleaned from a staggering amount of text on the internet, with careful guidance from human experts. Ask ChatGPT a question, as millions have in recent weeks, and it will do its best to respond – unless it knows it cannot. The answers are confident and fluently written, even if they are sometimes spectacularly wrong.The program is the latest to emerge from OpenAI, a research laboratory in California, and is based on an earlier AI from the outfit, called GPT-3. Known in the field as a large language model or LLM, the AI is fed hundreds of billions of words in the form of books, conversations and web articles, from which it builds a model, based on statistical probability, of the words and sentences that tend to follow whatever text came before. It is a bit like predictive text on a mobile phone, but scaled up massively, allowing it to produce entire responses instead of single words.The significant step forward with ChatGPT lies in the extra training it received. The initial language model was fine-tuned by feeding it a vast number of questions and answers provided by human AI trainers. These were then incorporated into its dataset. Next, the program was asked to produce several different responses to a wide variety questions, which human experts then ranked from best to worst. This human-guided fine-tuning means ChatGPT is often highly impressive at working out what information a question is really after, gathering the right information, and framing a response in a natural manner.Lecturers urged to review assessments in UK amid concerns over new AI toolRead moreThe result, according to Elon Musk, is “scary good”, as many early users – including college students who see it as a saviour for late assignments – will attest. It is also harder to corrupt than earlier chatbots. Unlike older chatbots, ChatGPT has been designed to refuse inappropriate questions and to avoid making stuff up by churning out responses on issues it has not been trained on. For example, ChatGPT knows nothing in the world post-2021 as its data has not been updated since then. It has other, more fundamental limitations, too. ChatGPT has no handle on the truth, so even when answers are fluent and plausible, there is no guarantee they are correct.Prof Michael Wooldridge, director of foundational AI research at the Alan Turing Institute in London, says: “If I write a text message to my wife that starts: ‘I’m going to be ...’ it might suggest the next words ‘in the pub’ or ‘late’, because it’s looked at all the messages I’ve sent to my wife and learned that these are the most likely ways I’ll complete that sentence. ChatGPT does exactly the same thing on a massively large scale.“These are the first systems that I can genuinely get excited about. It would take 1,000 human lifetimes to read the amount of text the system was trained on and hidden away in all of that text is an awful lot of knowledge about the world.”As OpenAI notes: “ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers” and “will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behaviour.” It can also give long-winded replies, a problem its developers put down to trainers “preferring long answers that look more comprehensive”.“One of the biggest problems with ChatGPT is that it comes back, very confidently, with falsities,” says Wooldridge. “It doesn’t know what’s true or false. It doesn’t know about the world. You should absolutely not trust it. You need to check what it says.“We are nowhere near the Hollywood dream of AI. It cannot tie a pair of shoelaces or ride a bicycle. If you ask it for a recipe for an omelette, it’ll probably do a good job, but that doesn’t mean it knows what an omelette is.” It is very much a work in progress, but a transformative one nonetheless.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsComputingConsciousnessCaliforniaChatGPTexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The artists — Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz — allege that these organizations have infringed the rights of “millions of artists” by training their AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web “with­out the con­sent of the orig­i­nal artists.” 

The lawsuit has been filed by lawyer and typographer Matthew Butterick along with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which specializes in antitrust and class action cases. Butterick and Saveri are currently suing Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI in a similar case involving the AI programming model CoPilot, which is trained on lines of code collected from the web. 

[Media: https://twitter.com/kortizart/status/1614460962756780034]

In a blog post announcing the suit, Butterick describes the case as “another step toward mak­ing AI fair & eth­i­cal for every­one.” He says the capacity of AI art tools like Stable Diffusion to “flood the mar­ket with an essen­tially unlim­ited num­ber of infring­ing images will inflict per­ma­nent dam­age on the mar­ket for art and artists.”

Since AI art tools exploded in popularity over the past year, the art community has reacted strongly. While some say these tools can be helpful, much like past generations of software like Photoshop and Illustrators, many more object to the use of their work to train these money-making systems. Generative AI art models are trained on billions of images collected from the web, generally without the creators’ knowledge or consent. AI art generators can then be used to create artwork that replicates the style of specific artists. 

Whether or not these systems infringe on copyright law is a complicated question which experts say will need to be settled in the courts. The creators of AI art tools generally argue that the training of this software on copyrighted data is covered (in the US at least) by fair use doctrine. But cases involving fair use still need to be litigated and there are numerous complicating factors when it comes to AI art generators. These include the location of organizations behind these tools (as the EU and US have subtly different legal allowances for data scraping) and the purpose of these institutions (Stable Diffusion, for example, is trained on the LAION dataset, which is created by a German-based research non-profit, and non-profits may be treated more favorably than regular companies in fair use cases). 

The lawsuit launched by Butterick and the Joseph Saveri Law Firm has also been criticized for containing technical inaccuracies. For example, the suit claims that AI art models “store com­pressed copies of [copyright-protected] train­ing images” and then “recombine” them; functioning as “21st-cen­tury col­lage tool[s].” However, AI art models do not store images at all, but rather mathematical representations of patterns collected from these images. The software does not piece together bits of images in the form of a collage, either, but creates pictures from scratch based on these mathematical representations. 

The Verge has reached out to Matthew Butterick, Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for comment. We will update the story if we hear back.

Image: The Verge via LexicaA trio of artists have launched a lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney, creators of AI art generators Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, and artist portfolio platform DeviantArt, which recently created its own AI art generator, DreamUp. The artists — Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz — allege that these organizations have infringed the rights of “millions of artists” by training their AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web “with­out the con­sent of the orig­i­nal artists.” The lawsuit has been filed by lawyer and typographer Matthew Butterick along with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which specializes in antitrust and class action cases. Butterick and Saveri are currently suing Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI in a similar case involving the AI programming model CoPilot, which is trained on lines of code collected from the web. In a blog post announcing the suit, Butterick describes the case as “another step toward mak­ing AI fair & eth­i­cal for every­one.” He says the capacity of AI art tools like Stable Diffusion to “flood the mar­ket with an essen­tially unlim­ited num­ber of infring­ing images will inflict per­ma­nent dam­age on the mar­ket for art and artists.”Since AI art tools exploded in popularity over the past year, the art community has reacted strongly. While some say these tools can be helpful, much like past generations of software like Photoshop and Illustrators, many more object to the use of their work to train these money-making systems. Generative AI art models are trained on billions of images collected from the web, generally without the creators’ knowledge or consent. AI art generators can then be used to create artwork that replicates the style of specific artists. RelatedAnyone can use this AI art generator — that’s the riskAn AI-generated artwork’s state fair victory fuels arguments over ‘what art is’The scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen nextWhether or not these systems infringe on copyright law is a complicated question which experts say will need to be settled in the courts. The creators of AI art tools generally argue that the training of this software on copyrighted data is covered (in the US at least) by fair use doctrine. But cases involving fair use still need to be litigated and there are numerous complicating factors when it comes to AI art generators. These include the location of organizations behind these tools (as the EU and US have subtly different legal allowances for data scraping) and the purpose of these institutions (Stable Diffusion, for example, is trained on the LAION dataset, which is created by a German-based research non-profit, and non-profits may be treated more favorably than regular companies in fair use cases). The lawsuit launched by Butterick and the Joseph Saveri Law Firm has also been criticized for containing technical inaccuracies. For example, the suit claims that AI art models “store com­pressed copies of [copyright-protected] train­ing images” and then “recombine” them; functioning as “21st-cen­tury col­lage tool[s].” However, AI art models do not store images at all, but rather mathematical representations of patterns collected from these images. The software does not piece together bits of images in the form of a collage, either, but creates pictures from scratch based on these mathematical representations. The Verge has reached out to Matthew Butterick, Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for comment. We will update the story if we hear back.Comments27 Comments / 27 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeApple’s Vision Pro: five months later | The Vergecast

In 1942, Walter Pitts, a teenage mathematician and logician, and Warren McCulloch, a mid-career neurologist, teamed up to unravel the mysteries of how the brain worked. It was already known that neurons fire or do not fire due to an activation threshold. ""If the sum of the inputs to a neuron exceeded this activation threshold, then the neuron would fire; otherwise, it would not fire,"" explains Christian.McCulloch and Pitts immediately saw the logic in the activation threshold — that the pulse of the neuron, with its on and off states, was a kind of logic gate. In the 1943 paper that came out of their early collaboration, they wrote, ""Because of the 'all-or-none' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic."" The brain, they realized, was a kind of cellular machine, says Christian, ""with the pulse or its absence signifying on or off, yes or no, true or false. This was really the birthplace of neural networks.""A Model of the Brain, Not a CopySo artificial intelligence (AI) was inspired by the human brain, but how much is it really like the brain? Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer in deep learning and artificial neural networks, is careful to point out that AI is a model of what's going on in the brain, not a copy. ""A lot of inspiration from the brain went into the design of neural networks as they're used now,"" says Bengio, professor of computer science at the University of Montreal and scientific director of the MILA-Quebec AI Institute, ""but the systems we have built are also very different from the brain in many ways."" For one thing, he explains, state-of-the-art AI systems don't use pulses but rather floating point numbers. ""People on the engineering side don't care to try to reproduce anything in the brain,"" he says. ""They just want to do something that's going to work.""Read More: The Pros and Cons of Artificial IntelligenceBut as Christian noted, what works in artificial neural networks is remarkably similar to what works in biological neural networks. While agreeing that these programs aren't exactly like the brain, Randall O'Reilly says, ""Neural network models are a closer fit to what the brain is actually doing than to a purely abstract description at the computational level."" O'Reilly is a neuroscientist and computer scientist at the University of California Davis. ""The units in these models are doing something like what actual neurons do in the brain,"" he says. ""It's not just an analogy or a metaphor. There really is something shared at that level."" Similar to Artificial IntelligenceThe newer transformer architecture that powers large language models, such as GPT3 and ChatGPT, is even more similar to the brain in some ways than previous models. These newer systems says O'Reilly, are mapping how different areas of the brain work, not just what an individual neuron is doing. But it's not a direct mapping; it's what O'Reilly calls a ""re-mix"" or a ""mash-up.""The brain has separate areas, such as the hippocampus and the cortex, each of which specializes in a different form of computation. The transformer, says O'Reilly, blends those two together. ""I picture it as a sort of puree of the brain,"" he says. This puree is spread through every part of the network and does some hippocampus-like things and some cortex-like things.O'Reilly likens the generic neural networks that preceded the transformers to the posterior cortex, which is involved in perception. When the transformers arrived, they added some functions similar to those of the hippocampus, which, he explains, is good at storing and retrieving detailed facts — for example, what you ate for breakfast or the route you take to get to work. But instead of having a separate hippocampus, the entire AI system is like one massive — pureed — hippocampus.Whereas a standard computer has to look up information by its address in memory or some sort of tag, the neural net can automatically retrieve information based on prompts (what did you have for breakfast?). This is what O'Reilly calls the ""superpower"" of neural networks.Yet, the Brain is DifferentThe similarities between human brains and neural nets are striking, but the differences are, perhaps, profound. One way these models differ from the human brain, says O'Reilly, is that they don't have the essential ingredient for consciousness. He and others working in this area posit that in order to have consciousness, neurons must have a back-and-forth conversation. ""The essence of consciousness is really that you have some sense of the state of your brain,"" he says, and getting that takes bidirectional connectivity. However, all existing models have only one-way conversations among AI neurons. O'Reilly is working on it, though. His research deals with just this kind of bidirectional connectivity.Not all attempts at machine learning have been based on neural networks, but the most successful ones have. And that probably shouldn't be surprising. Over billions of years, evolution found the best way to create intelligence. Now we're rediscovering and adapting those best practices, says Christian. ""It's no accident, no mere coincidence,"" he says, ""that the most biologically inspired models have turned out to be the best performing.""",https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/ai-and-the-human-brain-how-similar-are-they,https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/7o423uE3Y0NvyeAl1AW1sU/fea517ea1aad053804b6a9aed823c3bd/shutterstock_2052051122.jpg?fm=jpg&fl=progressive&w=350&h=233&fit=fill,,Technology Article,,,,,Discover Magazine,False,,,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/DiscoverMag', 'https://twitter.com/discovermag', 'https://www.instagram.com/discover.magazine/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/discovermagazine', 'https://soundcloud.com/its-only-science-discover-magazine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': 'article'}",,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/assets/globalAssets/siteLogo.png', 'width': '224px', 'height': '64px'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As technology continues to advance, it’s important to understand the ways in which it will affect the future of jobs across different sectors. In this blog, we’ll take a closer look at how AI is likely to impact the job market in different industries, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges for each sector.Image — https://www.premierline.co.uk/knowledge-centre/will-ai-take-my-job-in-the-future.htmlHealthcare IndustryFirst, let’s take a look at the healthcare industry. According to a recent study by Deloitte, the use of AI in healthcare could lead to a savings of up to $150 billion per year by 2026. This is because AI can help with things like making medical diagnoses, analyzing images, and finding new drugs. AI can be used to look at medical images and find early signs of cancer or other diseases. This means that people can get treatment sooner and have better outcomes. AI can also be used to help find new medicines by looking at a lot of data to find possible new treatments.However, the use of AI in healthcare also poses some challenges. For example, it's important to make sure that AI systems are designed and used in a fair and unbiased way, especially when it comes to diagnosing and treating certain conditions. There may also be a need for new rules and oversight to make sure that AI in healthcare is safe and effective. Additionally, AI can be used to create virtual assistants that can help patients manage their health, schedule appointments, and communicate with their healthcare providers. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the healthcare sector is projected to create 2.3 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Manufacturing SectorAnother industry that is likely to be impacted by AI is the manufacturing sector. According to a recent study by McKinsey, the use of AI in manufacturing could lead to savings of up to $3.7 trillion per year by 2030. This is due to the ability of AI to assist with tasks such as process optimization, quality control, and predictive maintenance. For example, AI can be used to optimize production processes by analyzing data from sensors and other sources to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks. Additionally, AI can be used to perform quality control by analyzing images of products to detect defects.However, the use of AI in manufacturing also poses some challenges. For example, there may be a need for new regulations and oversight to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI in manufacturing. Additionally, there may be a need for new training and retraining programs to ensure that workers are able to adapt to new technologies and processes. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, the manufacturing sector is projected to create 1.4 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Retail SectorAnother industry that is likely to be impacted by AI is the retail sector. According to a recent study by PwC, the use of AI in retail could lead to a savings of up to $300 billion per year by 2030. This is due to the ability of AI to assist with tasks such as personalization, inventory management, and fraud detection. For example, AI can be used to personalize the shopping experience by analyzing data from customer interactions to create personalized recommendations and offers. Additionally, AI can be used to perform inventory management by analyzing data from sensors and other sources to identify trends and patterns in sales and customer behavior.However, the use of AI in retail also poses some challenges. For example, there may be a need for new regulations and oversight to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI in retail. Additionally, there may be a need for new training and retraining programs to ensure that workers are able to adapt to new technologies and processes. According to a report by the National Retail Federation, the retail sector is projected to create 1.2 million jobs related to AI by 2026.Financial SectorThe finance sector is also expected to see significant changes as a result of AI and Chat GPT. AI-powered chatbots are being used to provide financial advice and help customers with their banking needs. Chat GPT is also being used to generate financial reports and identify patterns in financial data that can help predict market trends. According to a study by PwC, AI could potentially save the finance industry $1 trillion by 2030.However, Chat GPT can be used to create virtual assistants that can help customers manage their finances and communicate with their financial advisors. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the financial sector is projected to create 1.0 million jobs related to AI by 2026.ConclusionIn conclusion, AI is expected to have a significant impact on the future of jobs in various sectors. These technologies are being used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better customer service. As these technologies continue to evolve, it is important for workers to adapt and develop new skills to stay relevant in the job market. The healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing sectors are expected to see the most significant changes as a result of AI and Chat GPT, with potential savings in the trillions of dollars. As these technologies continue to advance, it is important for companies to stay ahead of the curve to ensure they remain competitive in the global market.Thanks for reading!Note -“We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails.”Don’t forget to give me your 👏 !",https://becominghuman.ai/is-ai-going-to-take-my-job-%EF%B8%8F-4a99bed2defc,,2023-01-14T13:38:33.981Z,,['Akalbir Singh Chadha'],,,,Is AI going to take my Job?☹️ - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4a99bed2defc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teach With It.OpenAI’s new chatbot is raising fears of cheating on homework, but its potential as an educational tool outweighs its risks.Share full article363Read in appCredit...Nata MetlukhBy Kevin RooseJan. 12, 2023Recently, I gave a talk to a group of K-12 teachers and public school administrators in New York. The topic was artificial intelligence, and how schools would need to adapt to prepare students for a future filled with all kinds of capable A.I. tools.But it turned out that my audience cared about only one A.I. tool: ChatGPT, the buzzy chatbot developed by OpenAI that is capable of writing cogent essays, solving science and math problems and producing working computer code.ChatGPT is new — it was released in late November — but it has already sent many educators into a panic. Students are using it to write their assignments, passing off A.I.-generated essays and problem sets as their own. Teachers and school administrators have been scrambling to catch students using the tool to cheat, and they are fretting about the havoc ChatGPT could wreak on their lesson plans. (Some publications have declared, perhaps a bit prematurely, that ChatGPT has killed homework altogether.)Cheating is the immediate, practical fear, along with the bot’s propensity to spit out wrong or misleading answers. But there are existential worries, too. One high school teacher told me that he used ChatGPT to evaluate a few of his students’ papers, and that the app had provided more detailed and useful feedback on them than he would have, in a tiny fraction of the time.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Am I even necessary now?” he asked me, only half joking.Some schools have responded to ChatGPT by cracking down. New York City public schools, for example, recently blocked ChatGPT access on school computers and networks, citing “concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.” Schools in other cities, including Seattle, have also restricted access. (Tim Robinson, a spokesman for Seattle Public Schools, told me that ChatGPT was blocked on school devices in December, “along with five other cheating tools.”)It’s easy to understand why educators feel threatened. ChatGPT is a freakishly capable tool that landed in their midst with no warning, and it performs reasonably well across a wide variety of tasks and academic subjects. There are legitimate questions about the ethics of A.I.-generated writing, and concerns about whether the answers ChatGPT gives are accurate. (Often, they’re not.) And I’m sympathetic to teachers who feel that they have enough to worry about, without adding A.I.-generated homework to the mix.But after talking with dozens of educators over the past few weeks, I’ve come around to the view that banning ChatGPT from the classroom is the wrong move.Instead, I believe schools should thoughtfully embrace ChatGPT as a teaching aid — one that could unlock student creativity, offer personalized tutoring, and better prepare students to work alongside A.I. systems as adults. Here’s why.It won’t workThe first reason not to ban ChatGPT in schools is that, to be blunt, it’s not going to work.Sure, a school can block the ChatGPT website on school networks and school-owned devices. But students have phones, laptops and any number of other ways of accessing it outside of class. (Just for kicks, I asked ChatGPT how a student who was intent on using the app might evade a schoolwide ban. It came up with five answers, all totally plausible, including using a VPN to disguise the student’s web traffic.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSome teachers have high hopes for tools such as GPTZero, a program built by a Princeton student that claims to be able to detect A.I.-generated writing. But these tools aren’t reliably accurate, and it’s relatively easy to fool them by changing a few words, or using a different A.I. program to paraphrase certain passages.A.I. chatbots could be programmed to watermark their outputs in some way, so teachers would have an easier time spotting A.I.-generated text. But this, too, is a flimsy defense. Right now, ChatGPT is the only free, easy-to-use chatbot of its caliber. But there will be others, and students will soon be able to take their pick, probably including apps with no A.I. fingerprints.Even if it were technically possible to block ChatGPT, do teachers want to spend their nights and weekends keeping up with the latest A.I. detection software? Several educators I spoke with said that while they found the idea of ChatGPT-assisted cheating annoying, policing it sounded even worse.“I don’t want to be in an adversarial relationship with my students,” said Gina Parnaby, the chair of the English department at the Marist School, an independent school for grades seven through 12 outside Atlanta. “If our mind-set approaching this is that we have to build a better mousetrap to catch kids cheating, I just think that’s the wrong approach, because the kids are going to figure something out.”

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.Instead of starting an endless game of whack-a-mole against an ever-expanding army of A.I. chatbots, here’s a suggestion: For the rest of the academic year, schools should treat ChatGPT the way they treat calculators — allowing it for some assignments, but not others, and assuming that unless students are being supervised in person with their devices stashed away, they’re probably using one.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThen, over the summer, teachers can modify their lesson plans — replacing take-home exams with in-class tests or group discussions, for example — to try to keep cheaters at bay.ChatGPT can be a teacher’s best friendThe second reason not to ban ChatGPT from the classroom is that, with the right approach, it can be an effective teaching tool.Cherie Shields, a high school English teacher in Oregon, told me that she had recently assigned students in one of her classes to use ChatGPT to create outlines for their essays comparing and contrasting two 19th-century short stories that touch on themes of gender and mental health: “The Story of an Hour,” by Kate Chopin, and “The Yellow Wallpaper,” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Once the outlines were generated, her students put their laptops away and wrote their essays longhand.The process, she said, had not only deepened students’ understanding of the stories. It had also taught them about interacting with A.I. models, and how to coax a helpful response out of one.“They have to understand, ‘I need this to produce an outline about X, Y and Z,’ and they have to think very carefully about it,” Ms. Shields said. “And if they don’t get the result that they want, they can always revise it.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCreating outlines is just one of the many ways that ChatGPT could be used in class. It could write personalized lesson plans for each student (“explain Newton’s laws of motion to a visual-spatial learner”) and generate ideas for classroom activities (“write a script for a ‘Friends’ episode that takes place at the Constitutional Convention”). It could serve as an after-hours tutor (“explain the Doppler effect, using language an eighth grader could understand”) or a debate sparring partner (“convince me that animal testing should be banned”). It could be used as a starting point for in-class exercises, or a tool for English language learners to improve their basic writing skills. (The teaching blog Ditch That Textbook has a long list of possible classroom uses for ChatGPT.)Even ChatGPT’s flaws — such as the fact that its answers to factual questions are often wrong — can become fodder for a critical thinking exercise. Several teachers told me that they had instructed students to try to trip up ChatGPT, or evaluate its responses the way a teacher would evaluate a student’s.ChatGPT can also help teachers save time preparing for class. Jon Gold, an eighth grade history teacher at Moses Brown School, a pre-K through 12th grade Quaker school in Providence, R.I., said that he had experimented with using ChatGPT to generate quizzes. He fed the bot an article about Ukraine, for example, and asked it to generate 10 multiple-choice questions that could be used to test students’ understanding of the article. (Of those 10 questions, he said, six were usable.)Ultimately, Mr. Gold said, ChatGPT wasn’t a threat to student learning as long as teachers paired it with substantive, in-class discussions.“Any tool that lets students refine their thinking before they come to class, and practice their ideas, is only going to make our discussions richer,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTChatGPT teaches students about the world they’ll inhabitNow, I’ll take off my tech columnist hat for a second, and confess that writing this piece has made me a little sad. I loved school, and it pains me, on some level, to think that instead of sharpening their skills by writing essays about “The Sun Also Rises” or straining to factor a trigonometric expression, today’s students might simply ask an A.I. chatbot to do it for them.I also don’t believe that educators who are reflexively opposed to ChatGPT are being irrational. This type of A.I. really is (if you’ll excuse the buzzword) disruptive — to classroom routines, to longstanding pedagogical practices, and to the basic principle that the work students turn in should reflect cogitation happening inside their brains, rather than in the latent space of a machine learning model hosted on a distant supercomputer.But the barricade has fallen. Tools like ChatGPT aren’t going anywhere; they’re only going to improve, and barring some major regulatory intervention, this particular form of machine intelligence is now a fixture of our society.“Large language models aren’t going to get less capable in the next few years,” said Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “We need to figure out a way to adjust to these tools, and not just ban them.”That’s the biggest reason not to ban it from the classroom, in fact — because today’s students will graduate into a world full of generative A.I. programs. They’ll need to know their way around these tools — their strengths and weaknesses, their hallmarks and blind spots — in order to work alongside them. To be good citizens, they’ll need hands-on experience to understand how this type of A.I. works, what types of bias it contains, and how it can be misused and weaponized.This adjustment won’t be easy. Sudden technological shifts rarely are. But who better to guide students into this strange new world than their teachers?Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Jan. 13, 2023, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I., Once the Future, Has Become The Present.

In 2022, OpenAI – one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence research laboratories – released the text generator ChatGPT and the image generator DALL-E 2. While both programs represent monumental leaps in natural language processing and image generation, they’ve also been met with apprehension. 
Some critics have eulogized the college essay, while others have even proclaimed the death of art. 
But to what extent does this technology really interfere with creativity? 
After all, for the technology to generate an image or essay, a human still has to describe the task to be completed. The better that description – the more accurate, the more detailed – the better the results. 
After a result is generated, some further human tweaking and feedback may be needed – touching up the art, editing the text or asking the technology to create a new draft in response to revised specifications. Even the DALL-E 2 art piece that recently won first prize in the Colorado State Fair’s digital arts competition required a great deal of human “help” – approximately 80 hours’ worth of tweaking and refining the descriptive task needed to produce the desired result.

It could be argued that by being freed from the tedious execution of our ideas – by focusing on just having ideas and describing them well to a machine – people can let the technology do the dirty work and can spend more time inventing.
But in our work as philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston, we have written about the effects of AI on our everyday decision-making, the future of work and worker attitudes toward automation.
Leaving aside the very real ramifications of robots displacing artists who are already underpaid, we believe that AI art devalues the act of artistic creation for both the artist and the public.
Skill and practice become superfluous
In our view, the desire to close the gap between ideation and execution is a chimera: There’s no separating ideas and execution. 
It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it. Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.
The focus on the idea and the framing of the artistic task amounts to the fetishization of the creative moment.
Novelists write and rewrite the chapters of their manuscripts. Comedians “write on stage” in response to the laughs and groans of their audience. Musicians tweak their work in response to a discordant melody as they compose a piece.

In fact, the process of execution is a gift, allowing artists to become fully immersed in a task and a practice. It allows them to enter what some psychologists call the “flow” state, where they are wholly attuned to something that they are doing, unaware of the passage of time and momentarily freed from the boredom or anxieties of everyday life.
This playful state is something that would be a shame to miss out on. Play tends to be understood as an autotelic activity – a term derived from the Greek words auto, meaning “self,” and telos meaning “goal” or “end.” As an autotelic activity, play is done for itself – it is self-contained and requires no external validation. 
For the artist, the process of artistic creation is an integral part, maybe even the greatest part, of their vocation.
But there is no flow state, no playfulness, without engaging in skill and practice. And the point of ChatGPT and DALL-E is to make this stage superfluous.
A cheapened experience for the viewer
But what about the perspective of those experiencing the art? Does it really matter how the art is produced if the finished product elicits delight? 
We think that it does matter, particularly because the process of creation adds to the value of art for the people experiencing it as much as it does for the artists themselves.
Part of the experience of art is knowing that human effort and labor has gone into the work. Flow states and playfulness notwithstanding, art is the result of skillful and rigorous expression of human capabilities. 
Recall the famous scene from the 1997 film “Gattaca,” in which a pianist plays a haunting piece. At the conclusion of his performance, he throws his gloves into the admiring audience, which sees that the pianist has 12 fingers. They now understand that he was genetically engineered to play the transcendent piece they just heard – and that he could not play it with the 10 fingers of a mere mortal. 
Does that realization retroactively change the experience of listening? Does it take away any of the awe? 
As the philosopher Michael Sandel notes: Part of what gives art and athletic achievement its power is the process of witnessing natural gifts playing out. People enjoy and celebrate this talent because, in a fundamental way, it represents the paragon of human achievement – the amalgam of talent and work, human gifts and human sweat.

Is it all doom and gloom?
Might ChatGPT and DALL-E be worth keeping around? 
Perhaps. These technologies could serve as catalysts for creativity. It’s possible that the link between ideation and execution can be sustained if these AI applications are simply viewed as mechanisms for creative imagining – what OpenAI calls “extending creativity.” They can generate stimuli that allow artists to engage in more imaginative thinking about their own process of conceiving an art piece. 
Put differently, if ChatGPT and DALL-E are the end results of the artistic process, something meaningful will be lost. But if they are merely tools for fomenting creative thinking, this might be less of a concern. 
For example, a game designer could ask DALL-E to provide some images about what a Renaissance town with a steampunk twist might look like. A writer might ask about descriptors that capture how a restrained, shy person expresses surprise. Both creators could then incorporate these suggestions into their work. 
But in order for what they are doing to still count as art – in order for it to feel like art to the artists and to those taking in what they have made – the artists would still have to do the bulk of the artistic work themselves. 
Art requires makers to keep making.
The warped incentives of the internet
Even if AI systems are used as catalysts for creative imaging, we believe that people should be skeptical of what these systems are drawing from. It’s important to pay close attention to the incentives that underpin and reward artistic creation, particularly online.
Consider the generation of AI art. These works draw on images and video that already exist online. But the AI is not sophisticated enough – nor is it incentivized – to consider whether works evoke a sense of wonder, sadness, anxiety and so on. They are not capable of factoring in aesthetic considerations of novelty and cross-cultural influence. 
Rather, training ChatGPT and DALL-E on preexisting measurements of artistic success online will tend to replicate the dominant incentives of the internet’s largest platforms: grabbing and retaining attention for the sake of data collection and user engagement. The catalyst for creative imagining therefore can easily become subject to an addictiveness and attention-seeking imperative rather than more transcendent artistic values.
It’s possible that artificial intelligence is at a precipice, one that evokes a sense of “moral vertigo” – the uneasy dizziness people feel when scientific and technological developments outpace moral understanding. Such vertigo can lead to apathy and detachment from creative expression. 
If human labor is removed from the process, what value does creative expression hold? Or perhaps, having opened Pandora’s box, this is an indispensable opportunity for humanity to reassert the value of art – and to push back against a technology that may prevent many real human artists from thriving.

		As companies scramble to fill jobs at a time when talent is hard to find, many are turning to artificial intelligence to find, interview, and match candidates to much needed skills.	




 









Amid a recent spate of high-profile layoffs and a recognition many companies rushed to hire to fill pandemic-driven business needs, organizations are now refocusing on quality of hiring — and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid in those efforts.
From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects in the coming year, according to two recent studies.
Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchases of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by online enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire.











 
 
 
More recently, AI has been applied to the task of creating job requisitions and similar materials shared by the employer that are gender and ethnicity neutral; the goal is to eliminate as much human bias as possible in hiring and increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

The shift comes as the US unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% last month — and just 1.8% in the tech sector — making it hard for organizations to recruit top talent even as many companies lay off workers hired in haste during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many organizations rushed to bring in employees to address business goals such as digitization projects, distributed work models, and the rollout of data analytics and business intelligence platforms. In some cases, companies lowered hiring standards to find anyone who could meet the minimum job qualifications.
Now there is an increased need to identify high-quality job candidates and make hiring decisions quickly, and that has upped AI adoption, according to Bret Greenstein, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) partner and Data Analytics and AI researcher.











 
 
 
“There were a lot of factors that drove this need, from the Great Resignation, to the rapid hiring and recovery in 2021, to the recession period now causing a large influx of tech workers into the market,” Greenstein said. “In all cases, recruiters need better tools to be efficient in matching candidates and ensuring interviews are used efficiently by ensuring candidates are well-matched up front. Additionally, they needed ways to do this in highly remote settings, due to the initial lack of travel and the later trend towards roles which are inherently remote.”
A reversal of reactionary hiring
In 2023, the reactionary hiring of recent years is expected to be replaced by a focus on quality, which can include hiring employees without college degrees but with passion and drive to learn on the job.
However, as many as 49% of candidates turn down a job offer because of poor recruiting experiences, according to PwC’s Future of Recruiting survey. Along with improving the candidate interview experience, organizations need higher quality candidates who are also more likely to remain, and they’re turning to AI to find, cull, and woo job candidates.











 
 
 
AI use in hiring is well entrenched for data manipulation and resume analysis, according to Lisa Rowan, a vice president of human capital management research at IDC.
“If you think about it, recruiting is a data-centric function with a lot of unstructured data found in people’s resumes and CVs (curriculum vitae),” Rowan said. “The sophistication in this process of matching has evolved from matching up skills with requirements to include analysis that helps determine candidate fitness for the role.”
According to Modern Hire’s fifth annual Hiring Report, 45% of companies worldwide are using AI to improve recruiting and human resource functions. The survey of 300 senior level talent acquisition and HR professionals also found for the first time in two years that quality of hires (QoH) was considered a top technology investment priority. (A PwC survey conducted last year found 35% of companies plan to use AI to hire and train employees this year.)











 
 
 
“Quality of hires” is a metric used to determine how well a new hire performs, their engagement and promotability, as well as how likely new employees are likely to stay at the company over time.
Hiring right is better for retention
Hiring right the first time is vital to retention and creating value in a well-run organization, Modern Hire said in its report. Additionally, the skills and competencies needed for most jobs are more complex and more urgent than they were even a few years ago, as digital 21st-century skills become table stakes.
Resume matching to job descriptions is the most common use of AI, but Greenstein has also seen a lot of work enabling AI to analyze patterns, including factors affecting retention and segmentation of candidates based on experience, education, and skills to aid in recruiting.











 
 
 
“Chatbots have also become more popular as an aid for candidates to help answer questions about everything from benefits to how the company is organized and operates,” Greenstein said.
In 2023, AI hiring technology will also include intelligent interviewing, according to Modern Hire. Talent acquisition professionals can get a further assist from automated AI-based scoring.
“Now, AI techniques allow us to attach a valid and fair numerical score to the words a candidate speaks during an interview, yielding job-relevant, competency-based scores and rankings that can be used in decision making,” Modern Hire reported.











 
 
 
Beyond AI scoring, hiring intelligence is increasingly allowing companies to match candidates to jobs they’re likely to fit — before they become formal applicants. Early matching is an indication that organizations recognize the need for a two-way fit — it is no longer enough for companies to “gift” candidates with a job only when they deem them worthy. Candidates also pick the company, and especially the job.
“Because metrics such as on-the-job performance is not consistently tracked, quality of hire is often the hardest metric to measure accurately,” Modern Hire CEO Karin Borchert said in a statement. “By leveraging trusted science-based interview and assessment tools based on job relevancy and fair candidate experiences, hiring teams are relieved of these stressors, and can rely on the technology to deliver data-driven insights and quality outcomes.”
The traditional interview process — long fraught with inefficiency, inconsistency, bias, and poor experience — is on the chopping block in 2023, as science and next-gen technology address the urgency felt by companies, and frustration felt by candidates, to move the interview experience to the next level, according to Modern Hire’s study. “The next-level intelligent interview is one that uses data and candidate feedback to continuously learn, improve, and evolve,” it stated.











 
 
 
Specifically, Modern Hire said an intelligent interview should embrace:

The use of science, analytics, and AI for greater automation and insight and reduced bias;
Clarity, accessibility, transparency, and humanity in the candidate experience;
Global candidate reach through multilingual capabilities and support for international talent markets;
Seamless workflows and extreme ease of use.

In 2023, hiring technology will include built-in structured interviews across job families and roles with questions designed to be job-relevant and focused on factors related to job success. Adding in automated AI-based scoring allows companies to more objectively evaluate candidate responses, yielding job-relevant, competency-based scores and rankings that can be used in hiring, according to Modern Hire.
What about built-in bias?
Problems still exist, however. While AI was supposed to eliminate subjectivity in terms of gender and race, experts say self-selection is still sometimes baked into AI software.











 
 
 
“It is often said that technology can only be as unbiased as the humans programming it,” Rowan said. “It is a challenge to eliminate bias from every angle. We are getting there, but it is an iterative and evolutionary process.”
Greenstein was more blunt: “The risk of bias in AI recruiting systems is still very relevant and has not been eliminated.”
Greenstein suggests HR reps and hiring executives be the ones to ensure the people deciding on policy and tools represent corporate diversity goals. And, they should  ensure the data used to train AI systems reflects diversity, too.











 
 
 
“There are techniques for de-biasing that can be used to correct for bias in data, but it requires leaders who understand it to ensure this is addressed well,” Greenstein said. “AI systems are able to assist in talent acquisition today. However, it is important to leverage AI to augment the recruiting process and not automate it.”
While AI can help scan resumes — and review, edit, and generate job descriptions — it is important to ensure that people validate the effectiveness of AI systems rather than blindly accepting the results, Greenstein said.
AI-powered virtual reality simulations can also bolster virtual recruitment, open access to talent in far-flung geographies, help monitor remote workers and upskill employees, Greenstein said.











 
 
 
“Companies are increasingly using AI/ML, including simulations, to model and predict retention – including simulating different policy decisions, understanding how candidates’ skills and experience match to job descriptions, and predicting acceptance rates on offers,” Greenstein said. “It also includes using analytics to understand where your company is positioned in your market and your city when it comes to hiring and promotions.”
Data driven approaches are so much more important now that candidates and workers are more remote now than ever. Additionally, the introduction of VR technologies has enabled virtual reality based onboarding and virtual exploration of the workplace.
“This is still in early stages, but there is a generation of new hires who expect more immersive experiences as part of their recruiting and onboarding, and as remote workers, this has the potential to bring the workplace to them,” Greenstein added.











 
 
 
AI-based talent acquisition software runs the gamut across different areas of the recruiting landscape, said IDC’s Rowan. For example, Beamery offers job recruit marketing software. For applicant tracking, there are software and services providers such as iCIMS, Jobvite, Smartrecruiters, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, and Workday. And for data analysis, firms such as Modern Hire, Seekout, Eightfold, and Phenom are among the leaders.
When choosing an AI-based talent acquisition application or service, Greenstein said organizations need to be transparent, “so people are not surprised or put off by it. Assure people that you properly manage AI systems to be fair and to assist the work of HR,.”
Don’t discount the effect AI can have on talent acquisition, he said, and don’t fear bias.











 
 
 
“Instead, put in business leaders who help define and select AI systems who understand the issue of bias, and who understand the HR and skills strategy of your business,” he added. “AI is not a technology to just build and deploy. It is a tool that needs to be managed by people who understand the strengths and risks, and who also understand your business.”

In 2023, the world is on the brink of being completely transformed by AI, according to Alex Jenkins, director of the WA Data Science Innovation Hub at Curtin University. &amp;#x201C;The technology is evolving extremely fast,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;re now at that leap in functionality where these tools are becoming incredibly useful both for generating new content, and conversing in a human style. So we&amp;apos;re really starting to see these tools act in a way that is comparable to human-level capability. &amp;#x201C;Eventually, these tools will probably become smarter than most humans and more capable than most humans. That is both an exciting and dangerous future.&amp;#x201D; So what do workers need to know about AI and is it possible to future-proof your career against it? One AI tool in particular has sent shockwaves around the world in recent months due to its ability to respond in writing in a sophisticated human-like manner. ChatGPT  was launched to the public in November by AI research and deployment firm OpenAI. OpenAI says its mission is &amp;#x201C;to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)&amp;#x2014;by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work&amp;#x2014;benefits all of humanity&amp;#x201D;. Since its launch, ChatGPT has sparked debate over issues including how the technology could be used by students to cheat on assignments, its potential application in fields ranging from medicine to law, and the types of jobs it could displace humans from. &amp;#x201C;ChatGPT is an incredible example of the evolution of a set of AI models called large language models. These models work by pulling in enormous amounts of text, from the internet and from books, and absorbing this knowledge and building an understanding of the world that can then be used to generate new written content,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins explained. Mr Jenkins said these tools have been around for a while but previous versions &amp;quot;didn&amp;apos;t quite understand&amp;quot; what humans were talking about.  &amp;quot;But now with ChatGPT, we&amp;apos;re seeing these models come to the point where it feels like you&amp;apos;re almost talking to a person, it feels like you&amp;apos;re talking to a system that understands your intent, and what you would like to achieve from the tool.&amp;#x201D; ChatGPT-4, the next iteration of ChatGPT, is set to launch in 2023, and it&amp;#x2019;s expected to be a game-changer. &amp;#x201C;It will be like ChatGPT, but it will be even more capable. And that that will be a significant disruption for the workforce and the economy as a whole,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins said. &amp;#x201C;It is probably going to be the biggest technology revolution that we&amp;apos;ve seen for a number of years. It&amp;apos;s certainly as big as the shift from mobile phones to smartphones, and the creation of the internet.&amp;#x201D; AI tools pose an immediate and growing threat to a range of jobs, from copywriting to data entry and administration. Mr Jenkins estimates that roughly 20-30 per cent of knowledge and office-based jobs are &amp;#x201C;likely to change in the next few years&amp;#x201D; due to the rise of AI. &amp;#x201C;If I was a copywriter, I would be looking to familiarise myself with ChatGPT very, very, very soon,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;apos;t believe it will be possible for a copywriter &amp;#x2014; unless they&amp;apos;re the world&amp;apos;s most creative copywriter &amp;#x2014; to compete against what ChatGPT can provide in that space. It is very, very capable of doing that type of work,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins said. &amp;#x201C;If you&amp;apos;re the world&amp;apos;s best author, and in the very top end of town, then you&amp;apos;ll probably be OK at the moment. But for large parts of that workforce, they will need to adjust to using these tools today.&amp;#x201D; Lawyers may also be vulnerable to the AI revolution, with an   set to defend a client in court next month in what would be a world-first. According to a report released last year by Sydney-based research firm McCrindle, jobs that are on the way out due to the rise of automation and AI include data entry clerks, administrative and executive secretaries and accounting, bookkeeping and payroll clerks. &amp;#x201C;As harsh as it sounds, almost anything that can be automated will be automated. And I think it&amp;apos;s natural for people to be scared about that and be a bit nervous,&amp;#x201D; McCrindle&amp;#x2019;s Director of Advisory Ashley Fell told SBS News. &amp;#x201C;The big downside, particularly with regards to the future of work is that [AI] will replace jobs traditionally done by humans, like we saw a few years ago now with [technology such as] self-checkouts at the airport and shopping centres.&amp;#x201D; According to McCrindle&amp;apos;s report, jobs that are increasing in demand include data analysts and scientists, AI and machine learning specialists, and big data specialists. Some jobs will also be protected from the AI revolution by their uniquely human nature.   &amp;#x201C;We&amp;apos;re not going to replace the human-to-human interaction with these AIs. They aren&amp;apos;t capable of that kind of thing,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins said. Ms Fell said people looking to future-proof their career against AI disruption should focus on jobs that require &amp;#x201C;uniquely human skills&amp;#x201D;. &amp;#x201C;As we think about the future of work, and the particular jobs, or industries that are at a higher risk of automation replacing them, we do think it is those sort of lower-skilled, repetitive tasks or jobs that don&amp;apos;t lend themselves as much to those uniquely human skills like creative thinking, critical thinking, empathy, compassion, leadership, almost like those soft skills, things that can&amp;apos;t sort of be as easily replicated or repeated,&amp;#x201D; she said. Mr Jenkins&amp;#x2019; advice to workers worried about AI disruption is to embrace, rather than fear, the technology. &amp;#x201C;Instead of being scared of the technology, start using it straightaway, and understand its strengths and weaknesses &amp;#x2026; use the technology to amplify your strengths, your individual characteristics, the things that you are strong at,&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;One way to think of this technology is that you&amp;apos;re a manager, and the AI are your staff members. It does take some work to figure out well, what&amp;apos;s the best way to get my staff to produce the best and the most amount of work for our team? &amp;#x201C;So start thinking like you have an assistant. That will be the best way for people who are concerned about the technology to understand how their job might change.&amp;#x201D; Today&amp;#x2019;s workers and future workers will need to embrace &amp;#x201C;lifelong learning&amp;#x201D; in order to keep pace with changing technology. &amp;#x201C;Lifelong learning is being driven largely by automation (growth of robotics, data analytics, smarter software), globalisation (greater degree of outsourcing and growth in digital platforms) and demographic realities (such as an ageing population where people live longer and work later),&amp;#x201D; the McCrindle report said. &amp;#x201C;This requires a new mindset and an increased focus on retraining and skills. Gone are the days where one to four years of study after school was sufficient. Rather, workers will increasingly need to develop a habit of refreshing existing skills and learning new ones.&amp;#x201D; Governments and regulators around the world also have a major role to play in ensuring that society as a whole benefits from the AI revolution. &amp;#x201C;If we have AI models that are open source and can be used and built on by anyone, then we all as a society have a chance to profit from the model,&amp;#x201D; Mr Jenkins said. &amp;#x201C;If the models are kept closed up behind single companies, then we risk being dependent on these companies for these models, and that a large amount of wealth will be generated by a very, very small number of people.&amp;#x201D;', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'SBS News', 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/_next/static/img/news/schema-logo-d79dd3e.png', 'width': '144', 'height': '144'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/sbsnews/', 'https://twitter.com/sbsnews/', 'https://www.instagram.com/sbsnews_au', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldNewsAustralia', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@sbsnews_au', 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news/feeds']}, 'url': 'https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-ai-revolution-is-upon-us-these-are-the-jobs-at-risk-and-in-demand/izjijemns'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"WorldThe AI revolution is upon us.

And that that will be a significant disruption for the workforce and the economy as a whole,” Mr Jenkins said.READ MOREI asked this AI chatbot if it will replace me. This is what it said“It is probably going to be the biggest technology revolution that we've seen for a number of years. It's certainly as big as the shift from mobile phones to smartphones, and the creation of the internet.”Which jobs will AI replace?AI tools pose an immediate and growing threat to a range of jobs, from copywriting to data entry and administration.Mr Jenkins estimates that roughly 20-30 per cent of knowledge and office-based jobs are “likely to change in the next few years” due to the rise of AI.“If I was a copywriter, I would be looking to familiarise myself with ChatGPT very, very, very soon,"" he said.""I don't believe it will be possible for a copywriter — unless they're the world's most creative copywriter — to compete against what ChatGPT can provide in that space. It is very, very capable of doing that type of work,” Mr Jenkins said.“If you're the world's best author, and in the very top end of town, then you'll probably be OK at the moment. But for large parts of that workforce, they will need to adjust to using these tools today.”Lawyers may also be vulnerable to the AI revolution, with an AI-powered legal assistant created by US firm DoNotPay set to defend a client in court next month in what would be a world-first.READ MOREAn AI lawyer is set to appear in court in a world first. Does it spell the end for costly legal fees?According to a report released last year by Sydney-based research firm McCrindle, jobs that are on the way out due to the rise of automation and AI include data entry clerks, administrative and executive secretaries and accounting, bookkeeping and payroll clerks.“As harsh as it sounds, almost anything that can be automated will be automated. And I think it's natural for people to be scared about that and be a bit nervous,” McCrindle’s Director of Advisory Ashley Fell told SBS News.“The big downside, particularly with regards to the future of work is that [AI] will replace jobs traditionally done by humans, like we saw a few years ago now with [technology such as] self-checkouts at the airport and shopping centres.”What kind of jobs are safe from AI disruption?According to McCrindle's report, jobs that are increasing in demand include data analysts and scientists, AI and machine learning specialists, and big data specialists.Some jobs will also be protected from the AI revolution by their uniquely human nature.  “We're not going to replace the human-to-human interaction with these AIs. They aren't capable of that kind of thing,” Mr Jenkins said.Ms Fell said people looking to future-proof their career against AI disruption should focus on jobs that require “uniquely human skills”.“As we think about the future of work, and the particular jobs, or industries that are at a higher risk of automation replacing them, we do think it is those sort of lower-skilled, repetitive tasks or jobs that don't lend themselves as much to those uniquely human skills like creative thinking, critical thinking, empathy, compassion, leadership, almost like those soft skills, things that can't sort of be as easily replicated or repeated,” she said.How can we make the most of AI?Mr Jenkins’ advice to workers worried about AI disruption is to embrace, rather than fear, the technology.“Instead of being scared of the technology, start using it straightaway, and understand its strengths and weaknesses … use the technology to amplify your strengths, your individual characteristics, the things that you are strong at,” he said.“One way to think of this technology is that you're a manager, and the AI are your staff members. It does take some work to figure out well, what's the best way to get my staff to produce the best and the most amount of work for our team?“So start thinking like you have an assistant. That will be the best way for people who are concerned about the technology to understand how their job might change.”Today’s workers and future workers will need to embrace “lifelong learning” in order to keep pace with changing technology.READ MOREA Google worker went public with fears about a chatbot having feelings. Could conscious AI become a reality?“Lifelong learning is being driven largely by automation (growth of robotics, data analytics, smarter software), globalisation (greater degree of outsourcing and growth in digital platforms) and demographic realities (such as an ageing population where people live longer and work later),” the McCrindle report said.“This requires a new mindset and an increased focus on retraining and skills. Gone are the days where one to four years of study after school was sufficient. Rather, workers will increasingly need to develop a habit of refreshing existing skills and learning new ones.”Governments and regulators around the world also have a major role to play in ensuring that society as a whole benefits from the AI revolution.“If we have AI models that are open source and can be used and built on by anyone, then we all as a society have a chance to profit from the model,” Mr Jenkins said.“If the models are kept closed up behind single companies, then we risk being dependent on these companies for these models, and that a large amount of wealth will be generated by a very, very small number of people.”Share8 min readPublished 16 January 2023 5:46amBy Isabelle LaneSource: SBS NewsAvailable in other languagesTagsScienceArtificial intelligenceAustraliaShare this with family and friendsCopy linkShareRecommended for you'Dramatic' shift in world's population could impact how we live our livesPopulation of Australia 'Hang up the phone': Scam warning issued in wake of major IT outageComputer networkingWhy you shouldn't bank on a refund after lodging your tax return this yearTax ReturnWhat we know about the Russian-born Australian couple charged with espionageArrestsUnwelcome, looked down on and excluded: Australia's racism hotspotsRacismPhilippines police reviewing CCTV footage after Australian couple found dead in hotelCrimeThink it's cold now?

And Humanoid robots are one of the most popular forms of AI. They have even been portrayed in several Hollywood movies. There is no doubt that a robot can perform in an assembly line, but there is no consensus on whether it can ever be intelligent like humans. In some way, today's AI machines are able to replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability and are outpacing human experts in several areas, specifically in the diagnosis of critical diseases like cancer..Initially, the prime objective of AI for humanoids was for research purposes. They were utilized for research on how to create better prosthetics for humans. But now, humanoids are being built for several purposes beyond research. They are developed to perform a wide range of human tasks and reside in different roles in the employment sector. Some of the roles they could take are that of personal assistants, receptionists, and front desk officers, among others..The process of creating a humanoid robot is quite complex and requires a lot of work and research into the process. Most of the time, developers and engineers face crucial challenges, too. In this regard, first-grade sensors and actuators are imperative and a small mistake could result in glitches. With the assistance of certain features like sensors and actuators, humanoids move, talk, and carry out actions effectively..Not all humanoids resemble humans as some are modeled after only some specific human parts such as the human head. Humanoid robots are typically either Androids – a humanoid robots designed to resemble a male human, or Gynoids – who look like female humans. They work through certain features, as well as they have sensors assisting them in sensing their surrounding environments. They also have cameras that allow them to see clearly and motors that are placed at strategic points to guide them in moving and making gestures. These motors are usually referred to as actuators..For humanoid robots to become as intelligent as human beings, they will have to be instilled with the ability to comprehend natural human language, known as natural language processing (NLP). As the development of humanoids still is in its embryonic phase, a lot of work and research is required to make these robots mimic humans..Humanoid Robots – Applications and Influences to the Real World.Humanoids have been assisting humankind in various capacities, widely leveraged in the domain of Healthcare, Education, and Entertainment, among others. As we have mentioned earlier that these robots are used for various purposes alongside researchers, their applications have commonly been categorized into healthcare, education, and social humanoid robots..Healthcare humanoid robots are designed and used by individuals at home or healthcare centers to treat and improve patients' medical conditions. These robots either require a human controller or are pre-programmed to aid patients. Conversely, educational humanoid robots are mainly aimed at and equipped for students. They are used in education centers or homes to advance education quality and bolster involvement in studies. These robots are typically but not always manually controlled robots..For instance, Aldebaran Robotics' Nao, a small 2-inch-tall humanoid robot, is used globally by universities as a research platform and educational tool. Nao has become the face of social robotics and has also replaced Sony's Aibo robot dog and has become the standard platform for the Robocup..Social humanoid robots are utilized by individuals or organizations to assist people in their daily life activities. These robots are commonly pre-programmed to perform mundane and tedious tasks. For instance, in 2014, Softbank Robotics launched Pepper, which swiftly became the leading commercially available social robot. Pepper was rolled out in Softbank's mobile stores in Japan and since then, it has been used in Carrefour and Renault stores across France..Humanoids are even used for customer engagement roles, equipped with advanced facial recognition, emotion recognition, and speech recognition capabilities. These robots provide a playbook for customer engagement and can be seen as an evolutionary step from self-service kiosks to conversational commerce, coalescing the two in smart and unique ways..Besides healthcare and education, retail, financial services, travel and hospitality, Aerospace, and quick service restaurants are also well-positioned to capitalize on humanoid robots. Airbus, for instance, in collaboration with researchers from Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL), reportedly began developing humanoid robots for its factories to take over several monotonous, hazardous and intricate tasks that will free up skilled human workers for higher-valued jobs..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And so are the artificial intelligence engineers. Very rarely a common person is aware of what it is like to be an AI engineer. Many times it so happens that even well-informed or AI-trained people are confused between AI engineering and machine learning or lack a proper understanding of the scope and challenges therein of different job roles in artificial intelligence. AI engineering will rule the tech world erasing the line between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. There will be no dearth of demand for them as the industry grows in the coming few decades. So, to understand if it is the role for you, it is very much necessary to get to the bottom of it. Let's dive in..The difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning .AI and ML are both part of computer science and most of the time they are used together because they are interrelated. But for someone who is specialized in designing AI or ML models, the differences are stark. Artificial intelligence is a broad term applied to all the techniques that make a system mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It helps AI systems to make predictions and take decisions without having to be explicitly programmed for the purpose. The machine learning algorithms learn by themselves using historical data..What do Artificial Engineers do?.An AI engineer's typical responsibilities include using programming algorithms to assemble, test, and convey AI models. They are troubleshooters with the responsibility to ensure the proper implementation of AI systems and the corresponding infrastructure. They build, deploy and maintain AI-based systems and develop the software for the systems after taking inputs from business leaders. Apart, they are also responsible for implementing Machine Learning (ML) processes as part of their job role. Natural Language Processing, building chatbots, building recommendation engines, and data pipelines are other major job responsibilities. Precisely, AI engineering is all about processing software engineering, data science, and automation to build functional AI systems..The Dark Side of AI Engineering Career.Building an AI product is as difficult as building a software product. Particularly when you are not a software engineer, building real AI products will be difficult. AI is a dynamic field with every improvement being a technological specialization in itself. Nothing you learn today would probably be relevant in the next two years leaving you fumbling over the new technologies. This is the nature of AI in general and accepting it becomes one's first responsibility. Image processing is another typical area, a seasoned AI engineer finds perfunctory. And finally, when the commercial point of a business is brought into the picture, it becomes an entirely different roller-coaster. The fact that you can build a product will not translate into a business idea unless it is economically viable and worth taking the risk. A certain idea might deliver the desired results but the cost overruns, millions of dollars, might outrun its very purpose, i.e., saving money..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

After a bit of a punch-up, it was perfectly passable as a sponsored content article designed to drum up business leads for a software provider – an article like the one that I, a professional copywriter, had just spent hours writing.My amusement quickly turned to horror: it had taken ChatGPT roughly 30 seconds to create, for free, an article that I charged £500 for. The artificial intelligence software is by no means perfect – yet. For businesses that rely on churning out reams of fresh copy, however, it’s a no-brainer, isn’t it?For those unfamiliar with ChatGPT, let me explain. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that’s been trained to interact with users in a natural, conversational way. Unlike traditional language models, ChatGPT can learn to generate responses without explicit instructions on what the correct answer is. Users can make any request – from Tell me about Watergate to Write an opinion piece about ChatGPT taking someone’s job – and ChatGPT will produce a response. If you run it through a plagiarism checker, you’ll discover that that content is 100% unique.I instructed ChatGPT to write a version of this article. Here’s how it opened:
As a copywriter, I’ve spent years honing my craft and perfecting my ability to craft compelling and persuasive copy. But now, it seems that my job is at risk of being taken over by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
The developers admit that the software still has limitations. It tends towards the verbose and repetitive (“honing my craft and perfecting my ability to craft”), and minor changes to question phrasing can be the difference between an amazing response and no response at all. The more we use it, however, the better it will become. As ChatGPT told me, it can already “replicate the writing styles of different authors” and “even be trained to mimic the tone and voice of a particular brand or organization”.I don’t claim any superior insight, just a realization that if a company can improve its bottom line by cutting costs in its supply chain, it will. Any sentimental attachment to human-created content is sure to be quickly overridden, I suspect, by the economic argument. After all, AI is super-fast labor that doesn’t eat, sleep, complain or take holidays.In the near term, writers and editors will still be needed, but fewer of them. A human will prompt AI to generate mountains of copy, only intervening again to fact-check, amend and approve. But how long before the model learns to spot commercial opportunities, generate ideas and put perfect content live without any human involvement?What does this mean for you? PriceWaterhouseCooper predicts that AI will produce a $15tn boost to GDP by 2030. Fantastic, but it also predicts that 3% of jobs are already at risk from AI. By the mid-2030s, this proportion will jump to 30% – 44% among workers with low education. That’s a lot of people who will need to “upskill”, retrain or drop out of the workforce.History has shown that, when technology has replaced humans, we’ve created new purposes for ourselves. But in its eternal quest for self-improvement, is there a danger that AI will continually outpace us by making us redundant more quickly than we can redefine our roles? To take the creative industries as one example, AI is already replacing movie extras, songwriters and audiobook narrators.Some observers have suggested that the introduction of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) – paid for by AI-generated wealth – is the best bet for the future. In his essay “Moore’s Law for Everything”, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, claimed that AI could drive enough economic output to pay every adult in the US $13,500 a year, while dramatically driving down the cost of goods and services.But work isn’t just income. For many, it’s meaning. Far from the tyrannical robots and human batteries seen in sci-fi, the real problem we might have to contend with is an epidemic of purposelessness. Even when not twinned with deprivation, a lack of purpose can contribute to depression, anxiety and addiction.Governments are already developing strategies to deal with this seismic shift in the labor market, but I’d urge individuals to do the same. I certainly will be. As with any revolutionary technology, there’s much debate over how exactly AI will reshape our lives in the coming decades, and not enough space to do every perspective justice here. But one thing is for certain: change is coming, and those who embrace it and adapt will be best placed to thrive.Or as ChatGPT would say:
The key is to find the right balance between using technology and honing the human touch. Copywriting is an art and it requires creativity, empathy and understanding of the target audience. So, ChatGPT will not take my job, but it will be my partner to create more impactful and persuasive copy.
But it would say that, wouldn’t it?

What Are Large Language Models Used For?


				Large language models recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content.

  AI applications are summarizing articles, writing stories and engaging in long conversations — and large language models are doing the heavy lifting.
A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets.
Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models. They aren’t just for teaching AIs human languages, but for understanding proteins, writing software code, and much, much more.
In addition to accelerating natural language processing applications — like translation, chatbots and AI assistants — large language models are used in healthcare, software development and use cases in many other fields.
What Are Large Language Models Used For?
Language is used for more than human communication.
Code is the language of computers. Protein and molecular sequences are the language of biology. Large language models can be applied to such languages or scenarios in which communication of different types is needed.
These models broaden AI’s reach across industries and enterprises, and are expected to enable a new wave of research, creativity and productivity, as they can help to generate complex solutions for the world’s toughest problems.
For example, an AI system using large language models can learn from a database of molecular and protein structures, then use that knowledge to provide viable chemical compounds that help scientists develop groundbreaking vaccines or treatments.
Large language models are also helping to create reimagined search engines, tutoring chatbots, composition tools for songs, poems, stories and marketing materials, and more.
How Do Large Language Models Work?
Large language models learn from huge volumes of data. As its name suggests, central to an LLM is the size of the dataset it’s trained on. But the definition of “large” is growing, along with AI.
Now, large language models are typically trained on datasets large enough to include nearly everything that has been written on the internet over a large span of time.
Such massive amounts of text are fed into the AI algorithm using unsupervised learning — when a model is given a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Through this method, a large language model learns words, as well as the relationships between and concepts behind them. It could, for example, learn to differentiate the two meanings of the word “bark” based on its context.
And just as a person who masters a language can guess what might come next in a sentence or paragraph — or even come up with new words or concepts themselves — a large language model can apply its knowledge to predict and generate content.
Large language models can also be customized for specific use cases, including through techniques like fine-tuning or prompt-tuning, which is the process of feeding the model small bits of data to focus on, to train it for a specific application.
Thanks to its computational efficiency in processing sequences in parallel, the transformer model architecture is the building block behind the largest and most powerful LLMs.
Top Applications for Large Language Models
Large language models are unlocking new possibilities in areas such as search engines, natural language processing, healthcare, robotics and code generation.
The popular ChatGPT AI chatbot is one application of a large language model. It can be used for a myriad of natural language processing tasks.
The nearly infinite applications for LLMs also include:

Retailers and other service providers can use large language models to provide improved customer experiences through dynamic chatbots, AI assistants and more.
Search engines can use large language models to provide more direct, human-like answers.
Life science researchers can train large language models to understand proteins, molecules, DNA and RNA.
Developers can write software and teach robots physical tasks with large language models.
Marketers can train a large language model to organize customer feedback and requests into clusters, or segment products into categories based on product descriptions.
Financial advisors can summarize earnings calls and create transcripts of important meetings using large language models. And credit-card companies can use LLMs for anomaly detection and fraud analysis to protect consumers.
Legal teams can use large language models to help with legal paraphrasing and scribing.

Running these massive models in production efficiently is resource-intensive and requires expertise, among other challenges, so enterprises turn to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, software that helps standardize model deployment and deliver fast and scalable AI in production.
When to Use Custom Large Language Models
Many organizations are looking to use custom LLMs tailored to their use case and brand voice. These custom models built on domain-specific data unlock opportunities for enterprises to improve internal operations and offer new customer experiences. Custom models are smaller, more efficient and faster than general-purpose LLMs.
Custom models offer the best solution for applications that involve a lot of proprietary data. One example of a custom LLM is BloombergGPT, homegrown by Bloomberg. It has 50 billion parameters and is targeted at financial applications.  
Where to Find Large Language Models
In June 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3 as a service, powered by a 175-billion-parameter model that can generate text and code with short written prompts.
In 2021, NVIDIA and Microsoft developed Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation 530B, one of the world’s largest models for reading comprehension and natural language inference, which eases tasks like summarization and content generation.
And HuggingFace last year introduced BLOOM, an open large language model that’s able to generate text in 46 natural languages and over a dozen programming languages.
Another LLM, Codex, turns text to code for software engineers and other developers.
NVIDIA offers tools to ease the building and deployment of large language models:

NVIDIA NeMo LLM Service provides a fast path to customizing large language models and deploying them at scale using NVIDIA’s managed cloud API, or through private and public clouds.
NVIDIA NeMo framework, part of the NVIDIA AI platform, enables easy, efficient, cost-effective training and deployment of large language models. Designed for enterprise application development, NeMo provides an end-to-end workflow for automated distributed data processing; training large-scale, customized model types including GPT-3 and T5; and deploying these models for inference at scale.
NVIDIA BioNeMo is a domain-specific managed service and framework for large language models in proteomics, small molecules, DNA and RNA. It’s built on NVIDIA NeMo for training and deploying large biomolecular transformer AI models at supercomputing scale.

Challenges of Large Language Models
Scaling and maintaining large language models can be difficult and expensive.
Building a foundational large language model often requires months of training time and millions of dollars.
And because LLMs require a significant amount of training data, developers and enterprises can find it a challenge to access large-enough datasets.
Due to the scale of large language models, deploying them requires technical expertise, including a strong understanding of deep learning, transformer models and distributed software and hardware.
Many leaders in tech are working to advance development and build resources that can expand access to large language models, allowing consumers and enterprises of all sizes to reap their benefits.

As the legal industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it's becoming increasingly clear that generative AI will play a transformative role in how legal services are delivered. From streamlining the contract review process to automating document discovery, generative AI is already being used to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the legal profession. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential impact of this technology. As AI continues to advance, it has the potential to revolutionize the way lawyers work and fundamentally change the legal landscape.


Those are not my words; they are ChatGPT’s response to the prompt:

Write the opening paragraph for an article about how transformative generative AI will be for the legal industry in the style of Mark A. Cohen, Forbes Contributor.

ChatGPT’s answer was rendered in seconds, but it’s impact will linger for a long time. No doubt, this is a common response among those who have tinkered with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, DALLE- 2, or other generative AI tools. And this is just the beginning….

PROMOTED
Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, regards the current version of GPT as a work in progress. He recently tweeted: “ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness. it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.”
Perhaps Mr. Altman’s “curb your enthusiasm” message to users is a reminder that ChatGPT is a prototype and that he is well aware of flaws that include occasional factual inaccuracies and gibberish. Or maybe it stems from his knowledge that GPT-4 is slated to be released soon and promises to be a much improved version.

Rob Toews, a Forbes contributor focused on AI wrote: “As manic as the recent hype around ChatGPT has been, it will be a mere prelude to the public reaction when GPT-4 is released. Buckle up.” Toews predicts that the new version may be multimodal—able to work with images, videos and other data modalities in addition to text. That would mean that a text prompt as input could produce an image or take a video as input and answer questions about it in text format.

AI technology advances are not limited to generative AI. In the related field of machine learning, for example, where predictive and decision-based models are developed from running training algorithms across multiple, large datasets, technologies such as RegulAItion’s AIR Platform are now coming to market. AIR enables multi-company collaboration across large datasets to build more powerful AI models faster. Traditional hurdles of privacy, traceability, trust and security are addressed through decentralized peer-to-peer computing combined with blockchain and smart contracting features. This enables data owners to share insights from their data without it moving or leaving their custody and control.

What’s Behind All The Buzz? 
ChatGPT is causing a stir for many reasons. It makes AI accessible, practical, easy to use, and versatile for nontechnical users. It provides detailed, intelligent answers (see above) across a wide array of knowledge domains. It is remarkably fast, erudite, fluid, thoughtful, and capable of providing nuanced responses to complex questions. Its mastery of content is rivaled by its ability, when directed, to respond in a specific artistic style or literary voice.
Unlike search engines like Google that produce a list of sources to sift through, review for relevance, and synthesize, ChatGPT curates, integrates, synthesizes, and produces a grammatically correct, well-written, and cross-disciplinary work product— in seconds .
There is a more visceral reason why ChatGPT has generated such a stir. It is a tool that propels the capability of technology into the realm of human creativity. It blurs the lines separating machine from human. Engagement does not require an ability to code or a technological background. It can engage in “conversation” that can be as wide or in-depth as the prompts. Most of all, its response has a human quality.
ChatGPT has taken us by surprise. In a world where change has become increasingly rapid and constant, ChatGPT stands out for its range, speed, and intelligence. Its eerily human quality is the real mind-blower. No wonder ChatGPT’s release has produced such a mix of awe, dread and excitement,
ChatGPT Is Front Page News
Since its November 30, 2022 prototype launch by San Francisco based Open AI, ChatGPT has spread like wildfire. It had 1M users within five days of its release and has grown so quickly that users often encounter access delays caused by excessive server demand. That’s not the half of it.
The New York Times reported Google CEO Sundar Pichai issued a “code red” in response to the threat ChatGPT poses to Google’s search business. A Financial Times article reported Microsoft, which had already invested $3B in OpenAI, is in discussions to invest another $10B. When tech Goliaths respond this way, business—and the rest of the world—takes notice.
A Fast Company article by Danica Lo provides a helpful primer on generative AI’s capabilities and uses. For example, besides its ability to answer complex questions across a wide range of knowledge domains, it can integrate those knowledge bases. The correct prompt enables it to “connect the dots,” a coveted human quality in today’s marketplace. It can write and debug computer programs, compose music, write and grade student essays (causing alarm among school systems and academics), and write poetry. Scientists used an earlier version of GPT to create novel protein sequences. One more time with feeling: this is just the beginning…..
McKinsey, among a growing list of leading consultancies, has proclaimed that generative AI tools like GPT and other technological advances could fundamentally change business. They have identified a wide array of use cases including: marketing and sales, operations IT/engineering, risk and legal, HR, and streamlining customer service. But the power of machines alone will not solve humanity’s wicked problems. Humans beings will play a key role, too. This requires adaptation, a key but often underestimated component of digital transformation.
Generative AI and other tools like robotics and data-insight enabling platforms have the potential to improve business as well as the human experience. To realize that potential requires investment in human beings— change management, cultural adaptation, lifetime learning, diversity, reevaluating hiring criteria, up-skilling, cross-functional workforces, and integration of the supply chain to cite a few.
The accelerating pace of technological change has heightened the importance and urgency of these human directives. Big business is investing significantly in the human aspect of digital transformation. It knows the success of the digital journey depends not only upon technology and data analytics but also upon human adaptation, creativity, inquisitiveness, agility collaboration, and teamwork. The legal function has a significant role to play in this process. It should lead, not lag. But will it?
How Will The Legal Industry Respond To Tools Like GPT? 
The legal industry seldom coalesces. Its resistance to change is an exception. Law’s legacy stakeholders—tenured academics, law firm partners, senior corporate counsel, judges, and regulators— are united in their opposition to material change. Each has its own style of parry; all pay lip service to “innovation” while staunchly defending the status quo. The incremental change they acquiesce to seldom benefits end-users or the public at large.
Law is one of the last artisanal industries in a digital world. Erosion of public trust in lawyers; the opaque, torturously slow, protracted, costly, lawyer-centric, unpredictable judicial process; the many failings of legal education —to produce economically healthy and fit-for-the marketplace grads among them; the access to justice crisis; the erosion of the rule of law; and the assault on democracy are among the consequences of law’s stasis. Yet the legal industry stays its precarious course.
The legal market is a tale of two discrete segments: “people law” (individuals and SME’s) and “corporate law” (large companies and the wealthy). In the short-term, ChatGPT will affect each differently. This is particularly so in people law, especially if tools like ChatGPT remain accessible and affordable. They have the potential to democratize the delivery of legal services, change the role of lawyers, and transform the archaic judicial system.
Richard Susskind, the pre-eminent “legal futurist” and a good friend, offered: “we are seeing here the makings of a solution to the global access to justice problem - the emergence of tools that will empower people with no legal knowledge to understand and enforce their legal entitlements; systems that will enable people to draft their own documents, secure legal guidance without lawyers, and assess their own legal risks. We are still at the foothills but the road ahead is clear. “
ChatGPT builds and expands upon the seminal work of “people law” companies like Legal Zoom, Rocket Lawyer, and DoNotPay, each of whom has leveraged technology to enable millions to secure fast, affordable, and lawyer-vetted but lawyer-lite assistance. ChatGPT provides a powerful tool into the hands of users, one that does not require tech fluency. It can help them cut through the opacity and expense of retaining counsel. It can also help to demystify legal process, procedures, and language.
While the public may embrace ChatGPT with open laptops, don’t expect such a widely enthusiastic response from the corporate sector, especially law firms.
The corporate segment is principally comprised of law firms and corporate legal teams (“in-house”). There is a growing divide between the two as to purpose, mindset, relationship with the client and its customers, success metrics, and economics, among other things. Corporate legal teams are generally better acquainted with the enterprise, its leadership, risk profile, supply chain, business strategy, economics, products/services, and other risk factors than their outside counsel.
Corporate legal teams, especially at the senior level, increasingly operate as business leaders with legal backgrounds, not as “lawyers” in the narrow, traditional sense. They speak the language of business, operate cross-functionally, have developed relationships with the C-Suite and key business managers, and operate in a corporate structure, not a partnership one. “Partnering with clients” is not a catch-phrase for them; it is a reality. So too are words like “alignment,” “teamwork,” “value creation,” “digital transformation,” “up-skilling,” and “agility.”
Most corporate legal teams will cautiously and curiously relegate ChatGPT and other tools to “first draft” tasks, at least initially. The top ones, like the DXC legal team led by Bill Deckelman, have long recognized the importance of early adoption of digital technology and principles by lawyers and contracting professionals. Deckelman enthusiastically embraces generative AI’s emergence and what it portends for the legal function. He shared: “ChatGPT represents a paradigm shift in AI, and even more advanced models will be appearing very soon. New applications applying generative AI technology will have the potential to disrupt traditional modes of law practice.”
Most law firms will regard ChatGPT and tools like it as billable hour killers and an end to client-subsidized junior lawyer training by observing. They will resort to “scare tactics” with clients, warning them of the unpredictability, inaccuracy, and risk of relying on new, relatively untested technology instead of focusing on use cases. Such short-sighted, self-interested, and defensive behavior will likely cause some corporate legal teams to narrowly restrict the universe of generative AI use cases and insist that “lawyer oversight” is required. That is a variation on law firms’ response to emails, e-discovery, and digital transformation more broadly.
One managing partner confided: ““Adoption comes only when big firms are forced to do so. Just about everything else is window dressing to entice a client in without really making the investments to deliver on the implied promise.” There are many reasons for this purposefully short-sighted view that is all-too-common among law firms. It will continue until clients exert more pressure to change and/or asymmetric competition enters the legal marketplace (see below).
This presents an opportunity for firms to differentiate themselves to talent, clients, and the corporate world. They can do this by:
> investing in the creation of new practice areas (such as generative AI, data agility, and other burgeoning fields);
>attracting top talent from multiple disciplines by offering an opportunity to work at the “bleeding edge” of law, business, and technology;
providing a sense of purpose;
>liberating lawyers from “drudge work” that generative AI can do faster, more efficiently, and arguably more reliably and better; and
>investing in agility training and up-skilling to identify and prepare for new opportunities;
>creating client-oriented solutions that advance business objectives and elevate customer experience rather than produce “legal work” alone.
Joe Andrew, the Global Chairman of the world’s largest global law firm has said frequently, “ When big law firms embrace new technology, they not only provide better service to clients, they are more likely to attract the best talent to their firm by lessening the drudgery of the more commoditized components of law. The future of every law firm is literally the talent it attracts and retains.”
The Big Four and tech Goliaths like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will, increasingly, become key players in a discussion of legal industry transformation. EY made headlines recently by spinning off its consulting practice from the audit function and announcing that consulting intends to morph from a partnership to corporate model. Look for one or more of the other Big Four enterprises to follow suit. They are well positioned to help large enterprises (as well as collaborate with the tech giants) leverage generative AI and other platforms to align the legal function with the enterprise, its workforce, customers, supply chain, and advance enterprise ESG/DEI and other initiatives.
The tech giants may well elect to leverage their technological muscle to expand their existing footprint in the legal industry. They have the brand, capital, data, customer base, war chest, expertise, talent, vision, and transformational experience to fundamentally change the entire legal landscape and to reshape law as we know it. This column has suggested that prospect previously. The emergence of new technologies impacting business and law heightens the probability of Big Tech’s entry into the legal sector. This will not eliminate lawyers but it will certainly change their roles, tasks, organizational and economic models, backgrounds, training, and customer orientation.
Conclusion
Generative AI, data analytics, robotics, the metaverse, and other platforms are business and social tools, not “legal tech.” They will quickly become a widely utilized, accepted, and integral part of business and society. This will put pressure on the legal function to shift from defense to offense. Rather than creating reasons to restrict their use, legal will be constrained by business, Government, and social advocates to focus on leveraging them to help create scalable solutions to a wide array of challenges. This will happen sooner than most lawyers think. It’s good news for business and society, and it will help unlock the latent potential of the legal function if lawyers don’t stand in the way.

First, there’s the logic of the hype itself—reminiscent of the frenzied gold rush over crypto/Web3/the metaverse—that, consciously or not, seems to consider automating artists’ jobs a form of progress.
Second, there’s the gap between these pronouncements and reality. Back in November, when DALL-E was seemingly everywhere, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted a a long analysis on their website touting a “generative AI revolution in games” that would do everything from shorten development time to change the kinds of titles being made. The following month, Andreessen partner Jonathan Lai posted a Twitter thread expounding on a “Cyberpunk where much of the world/text was generated, enabling devs to shift from asset production to higher-order tasks like storytelling and innovation” and theorizing that AI could enable “good + fast + affordable” game-making. Eventually, Lai’s mentions filled with so many irritated replies that he posted a second thread acknowledging “there are definitely lots of challenges to be solved.”
“I have seen some, frankly, ludicrous claims about stuff that’s supposedly just around the corner,” says Patrick Mills, the acting franchise content strategy lead at CD Projekt Red, the developer of Cyberpunk 2077. “I saw people suggesting that AI would be able to build out Night City, for example. I think we’re a ways off from that.”
Even those advocating for generative AI in video games think a lot of the excited talk about machine learning in the industry is getting out of hand. It’s “ridiculous,” says Julian Togelius, codirector of the NYU Game Innovation Lab, who has authored dozens of papers on the topic. “Sometimes it feels like the worst kind of crypto bros left the crypto ship as it was sinking, and then they came over here and were like, ‘Generative AI: Start the hype machine.’”
It’s not that generative AI can’t or shouldn’t be used in game development, Togelius explains. It’s that people aren’t being realistic about what it could do. Sure, AI could design some generic weapons or write some dialog, but compared to text or image generation, level design is fiendish. You can forgive generators that produce a face with wonky ears or some lines of gibberish text. But a broken game level, no matter how magical it looks, is useless. “It is bullshit,” he says, “You need to throw it out or fix it manually.”
Basically—and Togelius has had this conversation with multiple developers—no one wants level generators that work less than 100 percent of the time. They render games unplayable, destroying whole titles. “That’s why it’s so hard to take generative AI that is so hard to control and just put it in there,” he says.
“These things already exist,” says Togelius. “And it works because this content doesn’t really need to function: It doesn’t have functionality constraints. Maybe you can replace them with deep-learning-based stuff. But I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference. Perhaps it will make some difference in the long run.”
There is a general misunderstanding of where the tech is at, explains Mills. “A fundamental reason why these generative AIs can’t make something like Night City is because these tools are designed to produce specific outcomes,” says Mills. “A lot of people seem to be under the impression that these are somehow close to general intelligences. But that’s not how it works. You’d need to custom-build an AI that could build Night City, or open world cities in general.”
Take, for example, non-player characters. Text-based generative AI tools seem like a great way to deepen conversation, and Togelius has been advising developers intrigued by this very idea. But it’s not that simple. Characters based on these language models are liable to go off on tangents, discussing topics outside of the game’s world. “This is super interesting, but it’s also super hard,” says Togelius. “You can’t just drop it in there. It’s not going to work. You can’t expect the NPCs to behave in Skyrim or Elden Ring or Grand Theft Auto or your typical RPG. You have to design around the fact that they are, in some sense, uncontrollable.”
Nevertheless, there are some peripheral uses for generative AI right now. A good rule of thumb—one that applies to procedural generation too—is that the less crucial the content is, the more likely deep learning methods could be helpful. “For things like text generation, I could use this today to help generate filler for assets that aren’t really meant to be the focus of the player’s attention, like prop newspapers and such,” says Mills.
But, Hon notes, many artists are skeptical of AI. Part of the backlash to the generative AI hype has been that these tools are modeling their output on the work of human creators. Some are even suing Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, claiming that Stable Diffusion, which powers Midjourney, was trained on images used without permission. “Obviously, there’s a whole copyright question. We know about all these suits going on,” he says. “But even if they get resolved, I think that there’ll be some real upset among artists, which is understandable.”
As with so many discussions about automation, the hype here is detached from current reality (debates over automation usually arise during times of “deep anxiety about the functioning of the labor market,” writes sociologist Aaron Benanav). But, leaving reality for a second, it’s notable that much of the conversation around generative AI seems almost to revel at the prospect of replacing humans. Even an innocuous statement promising a boon for indie developers—“A small team can make a world the size of Red Dead’s,” for example—contains a kernel of this logic, explains Raphael van Lierop, the founder and creative director of independent studio Hinterland. It’s reductive, suggesting the work of a large part of that large team is mindlessly robotic.
“The focus on generative AI is another facet of what feels like an attack on creators and the act of creation, one that is expressed in a lot of different ways in our society right now,” he says. Reflecting a prevailing mood among artists across mediums, he sees nothing interesting about art made by an AI. “It’s a dead end,” he says.
There’s definitely an unsettlingly inhuman element to all of this, one that you could imagine manifesting as a torrent of AI-generated shovelware run on predatory monetary systems. But at the higher echelons of game development, games created entirely by machines—ones worth playing, at least—are some way off. “The way some people say it’s going to be used, to just suddenly replace people and do the whole job by itself, is bullshit,” says Togelius. “You need humans.”",tags,,"Will BedingfieldCultureJan 25, 2023 1:35 PMGenerative AI Won’t Revolutionize Game Development Just YetHypesters say artificial intelligence will one day automate all the hard work of video game creation.

Togelius says, for argument’s sake, that he would be happy to say procedural generation is the same as generative AI (he describes their connection as “kind of a sliding scale”). But procedural generation typically doesn’t use machine learning. Rather than an AI model, it runs on predetermined equations, generating, for example, the gargantuan cosmos of No Man’s Sky. Developers also use software like SpeedTree, which, as its name suggests, conjures forests. The point is that procedural generation systems still require massive human supervision; developers must keep vigilant for unscalable crevasses or monstrous trees. And it’s not even clear that replacing procedural generation with generative AI right now would make a noticeable difference. “These things already exist,” says Togelius. “And it works because this content doesn’t really need to function: It doesn’t have functionality constraints. Maybe you can replace them with deep-learning-based stuff. But I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference.

But that’s not how it works. You’d need to custom-build an AI that could build Night City, or open world cities in general.”There’s also a failure to take into account the corporate landscape. Games still employ systems that grew from early technological limitations, like dialog or behavior trees. You can’t just drop fancy machine learning into game franchises that have developed without generative AI in mind. Games—in an industry with huge budgets and tight margins—would need total redesigns to accommodate and take advantage of this technology. Take, for example, non-player characters. Text-based generative AI tools seem like a great way to deepen conversation, and Togelius has been advising developers intrigued by this very idea. But it’s not that simple.

ChatGPT Isn't Coming for Your Job (Yet)
Content-generating A.I. will probably enhance human labor rather than make it obsolete.

When ChatGPT was introduced to the general public at the end of last year, many people began to fear that artificial intelligence (A.I.) might soon make their job obsolete. Of course, horse-and-buggy-makers are gone, and farming requires something like one-hundredth of the labor input it used to. That's a good thing: Professions have gone extinct for centuries. New jobs emerge in the wake of old ones. A reshuffled labor market requires workers to gain different skills, while companies focus on solving different problems. That can be tough if you're in your mid-50s and on the receiving end of that technological shift, but it's not a catastrophic obstacle for economies at large.  Up until now, machines had been unable to venture into the creative domains long deemed human: the realms of emotion, compassion, creativity, and personality. There are few bestselling novels written by a computer, A.I.-powered inspirational speakers, or robots providing psychological help to clients in need. Some people now fear that A.I. will learn even these soft skills. Powered By                         00:00/01:2710 Sec      Starmer says Biden withdrawal 'not an easy decision', praises his commitment to defence and security         NextStay    


Economist Nouriel Roubini devotes a chapter in MegaThreats: Ten Dangerous Trends That Imperil Our Future, and How To Survive Them to A.I. He lists example after example of robots inching closer to overtaking humans at our own game. ""What happens,"" he asks, ""when that technology is actually intelligent? … No matter what work you do, artificial intelligence might eventually do it better."" Surely a robot can't connect with an opera audience, or mimic writing that creates that magic bond between author and reader. With this in mind, I looked at two programs in my own fields of writing and translation: OpenAI's ChatGPT, the text-generative A.I. that made such a social media splash in the last two months, and DeepL, developed by a German startup that just raised money at a $1 billion valuation. Both indicate that there's something to this latest bout of technological scare, but that mass employment among knowledge workers is still a ways off.  The service Grammarly already helps with language flows. Most word processors have built-in spell check. Even though keeping track of commas and hyphens should be easy, it usually isn't. Writing new content is even more of a stretch.  All over social media, I found examples of ChatGPT-generated output that looked humanish. That is, if you count the stumbling and robotic prose you might get from a 12-year-old or a bored college student fulfilling their essay's word requirement via endless rephrasing. Most ChatGPT writing I've seen is dull, shallow, and soulless—none of the characteristics that make good writing come alive. Roubini thinks mass unemployment due to A.I. is inevitable in the coming years. What the best A.I. writing generators put out is indeed indistinguishable from bad human writing. Bad writers, cheating students, lazy professors, and journalists echoing press releases have clearly met their match. But the more human, creative, authentic storytelling that is the center of all meaningful writing has not.  For translation services, progress has been much more impressive. Between some language pairs, Google Translate has already gone from being a complete joke to being quite usable—even for technical texts, like legal documents, which were previously Linguee's forte. DeepL noticeably improves on Google Translate's output and was ""originally trained on a database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a method of double-checking translations by searching for similar snippets on the web,"" according to its developer. When I sparingly used DeepL for a recent translation project, it performed miles better than other software. It translated blocks of text much faster than a human ever could but its accuracy, vocabulary, and understanding of context was still subpar, rapidly deteriorating with a sentence's complexity. For single words or phrases, established two-language dictionaries often produced more exact translations. DeepL is an impressive feat of translation progress, of course, but still in need of human supervision.  While pessimists like Roubini frequently express fears that this new technology will take away jobs from white-collar workers, content-generating A.I. will probably enhance human labor rather than make it obsolete. Robert Wright and Aleksandra Przegalinska conclude that ""Humans will use AI as yet another tool, much like they have used Acheulean hand axes and satellite-controlled tractors to do more work in less time or with less energy""—just like so many other technologies have done before it.

In what appears to be the first major, technology-driven shakeup to the white collar marketplace, artificial intelligence could well be poised to replace human workers in higher-paying, college-degree-requiring jobs.""Before, progress was linear and predictable. You figured out the steps and the computer followed them,"" MIT professor David Autor, an expert on employment and technological change, told The Atlantic's Annie Lowery. ""It followed the procedure; it didn't learn and it didn't improvise.""And that, of course, is where cutting-edge AI is starting to differ. After all, learning new tricks is the tech's Whole Thing — thus rendering what were once non-automatable jobs susceptible to mechanization after all.That's right, college grads: not even that wildly expensive degree can save you from the robots now.No One's SafeThe expert sentiment isn't terribly surprising, especially in light of the CNET drama that's unfolded this week. To recap: CNET, unbeknownst to its readers, had been stealthily using very dumb generative AI to publish financial explainers, to much dismay from human journalists. SEO spammers, on the other hand, are thrilled to employ new text-generating AIs to pump out spam.And that's just journalism. AI stands to impact a number of historically white collar markets, in fields ranging from computer science to healthcare .If there's any bright spot, Autor does think that while artificial intelligence will certainly render a lot of human jobs moot, a lot of specialty positions, like reporting, will still be left to humans.""In many ways, AI will help people use expertise better,"" he told The Atlantic. ""It means that we'll specialize more.""Still, getting a ""specialty"" position in the first place is incredibly difficult in the first place, let alone without first holding a job in the entry-level positions that are most likely about to fall to machines first.And sure, the job market, over time, has always adapted to major technological changes.

As I mentioned a few times in this blog, I’ve been working with and teaching about artificial intelligence since the start of my career. This drove much of my interest in cloud computing because AI was not economically viable or accessible until “the cloud” came along.
Interest in AI and its applications inflected about five years ago. Then the pandemic happened and some budgets shifted to speedy cloud migrations. Now that things are returning to normal, AI is back. Most enterprises grasp the fundamental possibilities of AI and are looking to weaponize the technology for their own business.
The technology got way more impressive along the way. Generative AI, for example, went from PhD dissertations to an accessible and free reality with the advent of generative AI services such as ChatGPT.











 
 
 
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that generates new and unique outputs, such as text, images, or audio based on input data and learned patterns. This can include tasks such as text generation, image synthesis, and music composition.

A wide variety of inputs can be made through a chatbot or an API that results in an impressive response. The responses are so impressive that I’ve been fielding calls from journalists who are writing stories on AI replacing workers. It’s a question I’ve heard for the past 20 years but now there’s a modern twist. Colleges and universities have new concerns about college students using ChatGPT or similar services to write papers for them. AI creates output that plagiarism detection systems can’t quickly identify because it’s not plagiarism.
AI ethical and bias concerns could emerge from certain types of learning data. Will those biases cause unintended negative consequences, such as an automated pattern that denies loans to certain groups of people?











 
 
 
I’m hearing the following core questions: What types of human tasks can AI replace now or soon? Should I be planning a career change to a job that AI can’t automate? Is it safe to be a cloud computing architect, cloud developer, cloud operations engineer, devops engineer, cloud project leader, etc.? Those are the job titles of most of you reading this article. Are you at risk?
I think the reality is we’re well on our way to replacing many human tasks with AI-fueled automation. It’s just what happens as technology progresses, and it’s nothing new. Technology is why we no longer have dozens of people in a field to pick crops in the fall. We can check out of the supermarket without interacting with a human. Our cars and trucks can drive themselves.
One thing that I’ve been frustrated with is how the whole IT design and deployment process lacks helpful automation. Oh sure, we have tons of tools, processes, methodologies, and other assets to speed up our journey to an optimized cloud architecture and deployment. However, they don’t make critical decisions for the architects. Cloud architecture must typically be determined through deep analysis and judgment, which only come through experience. More importantly, creativity and innovation are still required—things humans bring to the table.











 
 
 
Of course, humans make many architectural mistakes, such as picking the wrong platform, tools, and services. Humans create architectures that are wholly underoptimized and fail to return value to the business. I addressed that issue recently.
If we turned solution creation over to AI, perhaps we’d get better decisions. Imagine if the AI system had training data that simultaneously reflected the knowledge of thousands of good cloud architects. Such an AI system could effectively process that knowledge into solutions based on provided business and technology requirements. It may not get you the final answers required to build something, but it could get close enough that it could remove a great deal of the work and potential mistakes.
The most likely path is that tactical AI tools will continue to appear. These tools will focus on specific architectural areas, such as network design, database design, platform selection, cloud-native design, security, governance, use of containers, etc. The output should be as good as, if not better than what we see today because these tools will leverage almost perfect data and won’t have those pesky human frailties that drive some architecture designs—emotions and feelings. Of course, some of these AI tools exist today (don’t tell me about your tool) and are progressing toward this ideal. However, their usefulness varies depending on the task.











 
 
 
Tactical AI tools must still be operated by knowledgeable people who understand how to ask the right questions and validate the designs and recommendations the tool produces. Although it may take fewer people to pull off the tactical component design of a large cloud architecture, the process will not likely eliminate all humans. Remember, many of these mistakes occur because enterprises have difficulty finding skilled cloud pros. Tactical AI tools may also help fix that problem by better syncing the demand and supply of talent.
It’s easy to predict how this will progress, and it’s nothing earth-shattering. Design, development, and deployment tools will evolve. They will provide more value and usefulness. Fewer people may be needed overall, but these tools will require talented operators to work correctly. They will focus primarily on the tactical design of cloud architecture components, such as network and security.
So, we still must rely on humans, such as yours truly, to build sound cloud solutions. The smaller problems may have AI solutions, but the larger problem of poetically automating cloud architectures remains a problem not yet solved.











 
 
 
I suspect we’ll still need human cloud architects and solution designers for some time to pull all of this together and ensure that we’re deploying optimized solutions that return the most value to the business. I don’t see that being something that can be replaced entirely by AI, but I’m under no illusion that it’s unlikely forever.
But let’s ask ChatGPT: “Will AI replace cloud computing architects?”
“It is unlikely that AI will completely replace cloud computing architects in the near future as while AI can assist cloud architects in tasks such as automated provisioning, monitoring, and scaling of resources, it still requires human oversight and decision-making to ensure that the systems are configured correctly and to ensure that the AI is working as intended. Cloud architects also play a crucial role in overall strategy and design of a cloud computing environment, and tasks that are difficult to fully automate with current AI technology. However, it is possible that AI could automate some of the repetitive and routine tasks that cloud architects currently perform, allowing them to focus on more strategic and higher-level responsibilities.”
I agree.

Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s coming for your job. 
So promising are the tool’s capabilities that Microsoft — amid laying off 10,000 people — has announced a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” in the revolutionary technology, which is growing smarter by the day.
And the rise of machines leaves many well-paid workers vulnerable, experts warn.
“AI is replacing the white-collar workers. I don’t think anyone can stop that,” said Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology.

From the financial sector to health care to publishing, a number of industries are vulnerable, Shi said. But as AI continues its mind-blowing advancements, he maintains that humans will learn how to harness the technology.

		Rogue AI ‘could kill everyone,’ scientists warn as ChatGPT craze runs rampant	





Earlier this month, it emerged that consumer publication CNET had been using AI to generate stories since late last year — a practice put on pause after fierce backlash on social media. Academia was recently rocked by the news that ChatGPT had scored higher than many humans on an MBA exam administered at Penn’s elite Wharton School. After Darren Hick, a philosophy professor at South Carolina’s Furman University, caught a student cheating with the wildly popular tool, he told The Post that the discovery had left him feeling “abject terror” for what the future might entail.
close dialog     Play/Pause Video              Mute/Unmute Video             Advertisementclose dialogHick and many others are right to be worried, said Chinmay Hegde, a computer science and electrical engineering associate professor at New York University.
“Certain jobs in sectors such as journalism, higher education, graphic and software design — these are at risk of being supplemented by AI,” said Hegde, who calls ChatGPT in its current state “very, very good, but not perfect.”  
For now, anyway. 
Here’s a look at some of the jobs most vulnerable to the fast-learning, ever-evolving technology.
Education

As it stands now, ChatGPT — currently banned in NYC schools — “can easily teach classes already,” Shi said. The tool would likely be most effective at the middle or high school level, he added, as those classes reinforce skills already established in elementary school.

		NYC schools block access to ChatGPT over cheating concerns	





“Although it has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, this can be easily improved. Basically, you just need to train the ChatGPT,” Shi continued.
As for higher education, both Shi and Hegde maintain that college courses will need a human leader for the foreseeable future, but the NYU professor did admit that, in theory, AI could teach without oversight. 
In the meantime, educators are seeing their roles transformed nearly overnight. It’s already become a struggle to adapt teaching and testing methods in efforts to keep up with the increasingly talented ChatGPT, which, according to Shi, can successfully complete a corner-cutting student’s coursework at a master’s level.
Doctoral candidates hoping for a shortcut are likely out of luck: Creating an independent thesis on an area not often or thoroughly studied is beyond AI’s abilities for the time being, he said.
Finance

AI like ChatGPT could take over spreadsheet-style jobs in finance, experts warn. Getty Images
Wall Street could see many jobs axed in coming years, as bots like ChatGPT continue to better themselves, Shi told The Post.
“I definitely think [it will impact] the trading side, but even [at] an investment bank, people [are] hired out of college and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling — you can get AI to do that,” he explained. “Much, much faster.”
Shi is certain, however, that crucial financial and economic decisions will likely always be left in human hands, even if the data sheets are not.
Software engineering


7

Website designers and engineers responsible for comparatively simple coding are at risk of being made obsolete, Hegde warns. 
“I worry for such people. Now I can just ask ChatGPT to generate a website for me — any type of person whose routine job would be doing this for me is no longer needed.” 
In essence, AI can draft the code — hand-tailored to a user’s requests and parameters — to build sites and other pieces of IT.
Relatively uncomplicated software design jobs will be a thing of the past by 2026 or sooner, Shi said.
“As time goes on, probably today or the next three, five, 10 years, those software engineers, if their job is to know how to code … I don’t think they will be broadly needed,” Shi said.
Journalism

The technology is off to a rocky start in the news-gathering business: CNET’s recent attempts (and subsequent corrections to its computer-generated stories) were preceded by the Guardian, which had GPT software write a piece in 2020 — with mixed results. 
Still, there is one job the technology is already highly qualified for, according to Hegde.
“Copy editing is certainly something it does an extremely good job at. Summarizing, making an article concise and things of that nature, it certainly does a really good job,” he said, noting that ChatGPT is excellent at designing its own headlines.
One major shortcoming — salvation for reporters and copy editors, at least for now — is the tool’s inability to fact-check efficiently, he added.
“You can ask it to provide an essay, to produce a story with citations, but more often than not, the citations are just made up,” Hegde continued. “That’s a known failure of ChatGPT and honestly we do not know how to fix that.”
Graphic design

In 2021, ChatGPT developer OpenAI launched another tool, DALL-E, which can generate tailored images from user-generated prompts on command. Along with doppelgangers such as Craiyon, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, the tool poses a threat to many in the graphic and creative design industries, according to Hegde.
“Before, you would ask a photographer or you would ask a graphic designer to make an image [for websites]. That’s something very, very plausibly automated by using technology similar to ChatGPT,” he continued.
331What do you think? Post a comment.
Shi recently commanded DALL-E to make a cubist portrait of rabbits for the Lunar New Year, which he said came out “just amazing.” But, although it captured the hard-lined, Picasso-derived painting style, Shi noticed that it was not successful with more nuanced techniques — exposing a current shortcoming in the tech.
“I also asked it to do Matisse-style. It was not as good,” he added.
Copyright issues are also being generated by image-based AI. Getty Images recently announced legal action against Stability AI — Stable Diffusion’s parent company — claiming that the program “unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright.”

A group of artists has filed a class-action complaint against the companies behind a trio of A.I. art generators, saying the services violated copyright and unfair competition laws.
On January 13, illustrators Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed suit in the Northern District of California against Midjourney Inc, DeviantArt Inc, which is behind DreamUp, and Stability A.I. Ltd, the company that launched Stable Diffusion. They term these text-to-image platforms “21st-century collage tools that violate the rights of millions of artists.”
Chiefly, the artists’ complaint states that A.I. generators have used their artworks without consent or compensation to build the training sets that inform the platforms’ algorithms. In particular, these services rely on the LAION-Aesthetics dataset, created by a German company and commissioned by Stability A.I.
The lawsuit cites a study that found that 47 percent of the LAION-Aesthetics dataset is made up of images from stock photo sites such as Shutterstock and Getty Images, shopping sites including Pinterest, and websites hosting user-generated content such as Flickr and Tumblr. An estimated one of out every 50 images in the dataset (or about 3.3 million images) had been sourced from DeviantArt, according to the complaint. 
“Defendants are using copies of the training images,” it reads, “to generate digital images and other output that are derived exclusively from the Training Images, and that add nothing new.” In turn, these generated images, “will substantially negatively impact the market for the work of plaintiffs and the class.” Both Andersen and McKernan say their art has been used in LAION datasets.

Additionally, the class action asserts that A.I. generators have allowed art to be generated “in the style” of particular artists, thus “siphoning commissions from the artists themselves.” Because of this “unlawful appropriation,” the plaintiffs claim that the value of their art has been devalued and diluted amid a flood of similar-looking A.I.-generated images. (Andersen recently penned an op-ed in the New York Times, writing that generators have effectively imitated the style of her webcomic.) 
“Defendants specifically and knowingly used Plaintiffs’ names because these names were uniquely related to specific artistic styles, and Defendants generated valuable business from their ability to sell artworks ‘in the style’ that plaintiffs popularized,” the suit emphasizes. “Thus, the use of plaintiffs’ names contributed value to defendants’ platform and services.”
The class is requesting the district court award damages pursuant to the stated violations, as well as permanent injunctive relief that includes “making changes” to the A.I. image generators.
The Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which represents the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for Stability A.I. told Artnet News, “we take these matters seriously. Anyone that believes that this isn’t fair use does not understand the technology and misunderstands the law.” Midjourney and DeviantArt did not respond to requests for comment.

The point on fair use has also been surfaced by Stable Diffusion Frivolous, a website purportedly created by “tech enthusiasts uninvolved in the case, and not lawyers” in support of the defendants in the lawsuit. 
The site argues that “there are limits to the rights of creators, and the world is better for the existence of fair use,” a doctrine in U.S. copyright law that allows excerpts of copyrighted material to be used for nonprofit educational purposes, without permission from or payment toward the copyright holder.
Stable Diffusion Frivolous further takes issue with the complaint’s characterization of A.I. generators as “collage tools,” stating that these models work on associations or “data distributions” rather than any form of copying, pasting, or blending. A.I.-generated images, it added, could be considered “transformative” enough to not violate copyright laws. 
The group deems the plaintiffs “anti-A.I. artists [that fear] being replaced by artists who use A.I. tools in their workflows,” concluding that “those who refuse to acknowledge advancements in technology and instead fight against them are like whittlers mad at power tools.”
Stable Diffusion, along with other text-to-image tools including Midjourney and Lensa, have rocketed in use over the past year, with A.I.-generated images swiftly populating social media, art-sharing sites, and at least one art competition. While platforms such as DeviantArt’s DreamUp have attempted to build in protections for creators rights, artists have emphasized that infringements begin with the training datasets, into which copyrighted images have been scraped. 
Most recently, Getty Images, which says it has found more than 15,000 photos from its library in the Stable Diffusion dataset, brought a separate lawsuit against Stability A.I., claiming copyright violations. In an interview with The Verge, Getty Images CEO Craig Peters said the stock image giant is not seeking financial compensation or to halt the development of generative A.I., but legal “clarity” as to the rights of creators and entities.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI is a rapidly evolving technology at the forefront of public interest, yet many people don't have a clear picture of what it is. Here we will clear the air surrounding AI and debunk 10 common myths people still believe.




How is it that everybody is talking about artificial intelligence (AI), yet we don’t yet have friendly robots, like Data from “Star Trek,” walking among us?
Even today, in 2023, there’s a lot of confusion about what AI, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are, what ‘intelligent machines’ can do and what the current state of AI technologies actually is.
With constant misinformation, it’s no wonder so many myths have sprung up. It’s time to enjoy some good old debunking as we bust the 10 most common myths about AI (Also Read: Is the AI Revolution Going to Make Universal Income a Necessity?).
1. “AI consists of intelligent robots or androids that look like humans.”
There’s a lot of confusion between robotics and AI, they are two completely distinct scientific fields which serve different purposes.
Robots are tangible devices served by actuators and sensors to perform a wide range of tasks, such as building, carrying or dismantling products in factories.
AI is software programmed in such a way that it is autonomous enough to make decisions and learn from its mistakes. Although some robots may eventually incorporate AI algorithms, the ‘intelligence’ part is just one aspect of AI.Advertisements




2. “AI, machine learning and deep learning are all the same thing.”
Although they’re all parts of the larger AI system, AI, machine learning and deep learning are three different things.
Machine learning is the method through which AI learns from external sources, such as using algorithms to discriminate between data and determine its correct behaviors.
Deep learning is just one possible technique used in practical applications of machine learning. It is based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and works to determine the probability of successful decisions for AI.
3. “AI learns completely on its own.”
Despite some exaggerated hype about certain AI allegedly able to learn on its own, it is still impossible to find an AI-powered system that has any real-world application capable of growing from zero knowledge without human assistance.
Any system that has to deal with hidden information or uncertainty of any kind cannot be ‘understood’ by AI; it still needs to be fed input and data by humans. Also, every bit of information must have a clear purpose. AI cannot make guesses, it works through external sources and previous data; it can’t conceptualize abstracts like humans.
4. “AI is always better than human employees.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has required interventions that reduce in-person labor and close contact between humans. AI-powered automation has become a ‘hero’ that not only helped to prevent the virus from spreading, but also provided some much-needed resilience to many sectors plagued by lockdowns and restrictions, such as the supply chain.
While it is true that the move to AI systems has become permanent for a lot of jobs, many of these systems only handle simple and repetitive tasks that could be easily automated. Although they may be more efficient than humans in some instances, AI technologies cannot substitute a human employee in any area that requires creativity, empathy, ingenuity or critical thinking. Some very human things like face-to-face communication cannot truly be replaced by any machine.
AI just isn’t capable of creating original ideas or independent thinking. Even the most intelligent machines are still just virtual programs and algorithms.
5. “The power needed to perform all future deep-learning operations is unsustainable.”
It is undeniable that AI requires a lot of additional computing power to be trained and to perform all its complex, deep-learning operations. It seems in a future where most enterprises will make use of AI to some extent, this problem may grow to epic proportions, making its use potentially unsustainable.
However, AI is actually providing us with the perfect solutions to help tackle issues like climate change. It can help farmers push yields per hectare, improve energy production by reducing power grid waste and inefficiency, reduce carbon footprints and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, bolster strategic planning and decision models on how to tackle climate change and so on.
With additional advancements in computing, like quantum computing, it won’t be long until we have the power and resources to run even more demanding AI systems.
6. “It’s easy for an enterprise to rent the computing power needed to fuel AI operations.”
Perhaps this one would be true if AWS, Google, Microsoft and Alibaba Cloud weren’t currently centralizing the vast majority of the computing power available in the world. So, AI developers currently have just two choices: renting at exceptionally high prices or purchasing their own super-expensive hardware (Also Read: The Four Major Cloud Players: Pros and Cons).
A new company called Tatau developed a blockchain-based supercomputing platform that can solve the issue. Their solution allows the aggregation and reselling of the combined resources of a globally distributed network of GPU-based machines.
Imagine cryptocurrency miners, gamers or other high-performance computers dedicating their computing power toward AI development. AI companies can tap into this underexploited source of GPU power to train their machine-learning models at a much cheaper price. Note that this new platform may also provide an answer to the problem highlighted in myth five, since it promotes efficient use of currently untapped resources.
7. “You need immense amounts of data to train AI.”
This isn’t necessarily the case. Sure, you need a lot of data and computing power to train an AI from scratch. And, albeit to a lesser extent, you need terabytes of data to train an AI to perform a complex task, such as driving a car. However, depending on the field of application of the AI, pre-trained neural networks are flexible enough to be retrained in specific areas.
The basic data framework may come from a larger, more general data set, with only the last part of the network needing to be replaced to fill in the blanks. Time has passed since the adoption of early AI, now new AI can generate synthetic datasets that could be used to train other AI. In fact, it has even be proven by MIT that these datasets can be more efficient than traditional ones, paving the way to a world of new possibilities.
8. “AI will replace existing BI tools, making any previous technology obsolete.”
This myth is a bit of a stretch, to say the least. The majority of modern business intelligence (BI) solutions are highly scalable and often customizable so that any future AI-based model can be easily integrated directly into their platforms.
Companies always prefer to implement only those solutions which come without any risk of workflow disruption, and AI technologies have adapted to this need. Therefore, most AI platforms are implemented via the web so no replacement is necessary or, in the worst-case scenario, can be safely implemented in phases to lessen workflow interruptions.
9. “Artificial neural networks are like biological networks, but mechanical.”
No artificial neural network can ever hope to reach a fraction of the complexity of the human brain. It’s like comparing the complexity of a military aircraft to a kite just because they can both fly.
Despite many years of clinical and scientific research, we still fail to understand biological neural networks to their full extent, since neurons fulfil so many different tasks within the human body (think about the difference between a sensory and motor neuron) and even transmit information through many different pathways (using electricity, chemical potential and neurotransmitters).
The majority of AI employed by enterprises are just Narrow AI that possesses simple abilities to react to data triggers. They are equipped with little to no memory or data storage capabilities and only use historical data to inform decisions.
Strong AI and Deep AI that can apply their intelligence and knowledge to solve problems are still largely theoretical and have very little current practical application. To put things in perspective, the Fujitsu-built K, one of the most advanced strong AI, needed 40 minutes to simulate the equivalent of just one second of brain activity!
10. “AI will eventually become intelligent enough to understand that humans are dangerous to it and must be exterminated.”
Well, we can’t actually debunk this myth since it’s not a myth. It’s a reality. Brace yourselves, because resistance is futile!
Jokes aside, AI has nowhere near the intelligence needed to understand the world around itself and make autonomous, rational decisions (Also Read: Why Superintelligent AIs Won’t Destroy Humans Anytime Soon).
Each algorithm is developed to perform one task and is not able to do anything outside of that, let alone reach the ability to think independently. Computers use the ‘brute force’ of their superior computational powers to find a solution to relatively simple issues, but they lack the understanding, perceptive depth and strategic complexity to have a purpose outside the one they’re programmed for.
While it perhaps shouldn’t be written off just yet as a total impossibility, there is no real chance of computers developing sentience, at least not for centuries to come. AI will remain nothing more than another — albeit, more complex — tool for us to use as we please for a long, long time.

It generates text responses to text prompts, like a very advanced chatbot. Other generative AI tools make other kinds of content, like audio, images and video. Many have launched in just the past six months.Queensland joins NSW in banning ChatGPT in public schoolsIt's been described as akin to students outsourcing their homework to robots.Read moreFor schools, universities and other educational institutions, the recent emergence of these programs poses the risk that students will ask a machine to write their essays or complete their assignment questions, rather than doing the work themselves.Some have decided to ban ChatGPT. But experts say this is the wrong approach, and students need to learn how to effectively use these tools in order to be employable graduates.In the midst of this debate, Australian workplaces have been quietly experimenting with generative AI.Many who spoke with the ABC say that within a few years — by the time today's students graduate — these new tools will be essential parts of the white-collar workplace, as much a feature of the office as dusty keyboards, water coolers and small potted cacti.Here's how they're using them.The architecture practiceArchitects at the large Melbourne design practice Gray Puksand use an AI tool named Midjourney, which creates complex images from textual descriptions, using similar technology to ChatGPT.Images like this one: Architects are using images like this to spark their imaginations.(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)Midjourney produced this from the text prompt: ""low rise parametric building biophilic reference sheet 3d plans sections elevations construction details annotations callouts axis dimensions visual coding"".Jeames Hanley, the practice's digital technology manager, said dozens of architects were using the tool to quickly realise and explore visual ideas.""We have a paid subscription to Midjourney — we have 40 staff using it in a shared thread,"" he said.""We are seeing the architects' imaginations being expanded as they can so much more easily visualise the design they are thinking of.""Asked to create a plan for a 100-person office space with desks, focus rooms, meetings rooms and board rooms, plus plants and lots of light, Midjourney produced these variations: They're nowhere close to the finished architectural plan, but these images help with the process of design.(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)Although Midjourney is older than ChatGPT, it's still relatively new. A San Francisco start-up of the same name launched it in mid-2022, and has been beta-testing and updating it since.""I don't think it's going to replace anyone, but in terms of efficiency it's going to change our industry,"" Mr Hanley said.""Some of our staff will be freed up to work more on the work that excites them, which is the design.""The law firmLast week, Sunshine Coast litigator Kyle Kimball turned to an AI program for help.""People ring up and say, 'this has happened. Have I got a case?' I have to explain, 'it's not that simple. We don't know all the evidence.'""Which of these artworks were created using AI?We put an AI image generator and a human illustrator head-to-head.Read moreSo he asked ChatGPT to write an explanation, using the analogy of a doctor ordering an MRI and blood tests to diagnose the patient.The result was good enough to use, he said.As an experiment, he also recently asked ChatGPT to draft a statement of claim based on the 1992 Mabo case, and was impressed.""If I'd asked a first-year lawyer to do it, it wouldn't have been anywhere as good,"" he said.Mr Kimball manages a firm of nine lawyers based on the Sunshine Coast and in Sydney.ChatGPT's work contained factual errors and had to be carefully checked, but then so did the work of junior lawyers, he said.""Find me a person that you're paying to do a job that does the job 100 per cent accurately all of the time, and in the time this machine does it in,"" he said.""I think it's very exciting."" Generated from the prompt: ""a small secluded architectural space made of glass that reflects its surrounds of a mildly lit forest with tree canopy overhead and leaves falling cinematic.""(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)At the law firm Piper Alderman, chief operating officer Chris McLean has also been experimenting with ChatGPT.""There are lots of things in law it's not anywhere near ready for,"" he said.AI tool can pass medical school examsNow, with the first term just weeks away, educators are scrambling to rethink how they assess students.Read moreFor instance, it wasn't ready to give complex advice to clients, he said, but might be used to write case summaries for lawyers.""For high-volume things like drafting wills and conveyancing, it would be incredibly useful,"" he said.Belgian start-up Clausebase has already developed contract drafting software and has recently been beta-testing a ChatGPT-powered module.The consensus of feedback was that the tool was useful, but imperfect, said Senne Mennes, the company's co-founder.Lawyers needed to do a lot of work to check and ""clean up"" the work, but ultimately saved time.""One person phrased it very beautifully. He said, 'I already have the chisel and GPT gives you the marble when you don't have any.'""The events platformFor the past couple weeks, Melbourne start-up Muso has been using ChatGPT to embellish the prose on its live-entertainment booking platform.Every month, the platform hosts thousands of ads for gigs: for each, the venue must write a brief description of the event.Often, this description was terrible, said Simon Raik-Allen, Muso's chief technology officer.""They write something like, 'great cover guy coming.' They haven't got time to do much else,"" he said.  Generated from the prompt: ""copper style exoskeleton facade structure free flowing layered in a busy Sydney street with cars and people rushing past cinematic"".(Supplied: Midjourney/Gray Puksand)The volume of bookings was so high that any human copy writer tasked with fixing the prose would have been immediately swamped.Now, a ChatGPT-powered tool embedded within the booking platform generates the copy, based on whatever facts the venue chooses to provide.From the input ""weekly trivia at the Railway Hotel"", it produced this description:""Come join us every week at the Railway Hotel for a Trivia Night! Put your knowledge to the test while sipping drinks and enjoying good company. Whether you’re a trivia veteran or a rookie, everyone is welcome. We'll provide the questions, and you bring your sharpest wit and the most challenging answers. So come join us in a relaxing and friendly atmosphere, and see who can come out on top!""It's not poetry, but it's good enough for an event listing.""It saves [the venue] time and encourages more people to come to the gig,"" Mr Raik-Allen said.The software developerIn Melbourne, computer science student Riley Underwood has been using ChatGPT to write code and help engineer software.Previously, when faced with a coding problem, he'd go to Google and find links to potential solutions. ""Now I don't go to Google. I'll go straight to GPT,"" he said.Mr Underwood asks ChatGPT to write code, and uses its response as a guide.""You have to have a bit of experience to say this is 90 per cent correct, and I have to make adjustments to it.""But, as with drafting legal documents, this process of editing is still more efficient than writing code from scratch.""I would say there's probably a 30–40 per cent increase in productivity,"" he said.Mr Underwood and his business partner, Vance Chao, recently created a ChatGPT-powered tool that generates 250-word property listings from property facts for use in the real estate industry.In some scenarios, ChatGPT can turn half a day of coding into two minutes' work, Mr Chao said.""It's a lot easier to read something that someone's given you and say it's wrong or say it's right than it is come up with it by yourself,"" he said.Steve Nouri, a Sydney data scientist whose titles include ""chief data evangelist"" for an Israeli tech company, broadly agreed with this assessment.""I'm understanding the limitations before introducing it to a pipeline of software development,"" he said.But he noted that many ""junior developers"" were using it already.""It's 100 per cent quicker than writing code from scratch.""The creep of AI into everyday productsFor the moment, generative AI tools tend to be restricted to discrete products, like ChatGPT or Midjourney.But increasingly these products will merge with other pieces of existing technology, and be harder to disentangle.ABC Science on YouTubeWant more science — plus health, environment, tech and more?

How real estate agents put artificial intelligence to work

Posted by Amy Platero | Jan 23, 2023 | Fundamentals, Real Estate, Your Practice | 3 




﻿
In an industry as face-to-face as real estate, an agent’s use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate their work might seem like science fiction. But with recent breakthroughs in machine learning, that fiction has quickly become reality for tech-savvy agents.
ChatGPT is a chatbot which uses machine learning algorithms — programming — to understand written language and then generate responses based on user inputs — your chat entries. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022 and is free to use during a research preview period.
The language processing model has galvanized technophiles across industries, including real estate.
Specifically, real estate agents use ChatGPT to craft compelling listing descriptions and content to automate their marketing efforts, such as social media posts, blogs and emails. This tool streamlines agents’ more tedious copywriting and content creation tasks.
Read ahead for tips on how to use this revolutionary productivity tool.
Use ChatGPT to help market listings
While property photos do much of the heavy lifting in selling real estate, a well-written listing description also has the power to make or break a prospective buyer’s perception of the property — and the agent.
An agent knows how to highlight a property’s standout features and ultimately sell. But to captivate the reader and make the listing feel like home requires fine wordsmithery. At minimum, listing descriptions sell best when they are short, free of errors and contain clear language with plain meaning.
It might take an agent 30 minutes to write and edit a listing description that effectively displays the property’s amenities and features. ChatGPT does it on command in seconds.
Example: listing descriptions
To produce a listing description, the agent needs to provide ChatGPT some written instruction and context. For example, when a user prompts the following:
A listing description for a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom 1500 square foot home in Sacramento, California with a 2 car garage and granite countertops. 
ChatGPT responds:
This 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in Sacramento, California boasts a spacious and well-appointed open concept living and dining area with large windows and natural light. The kitchen is a chef’s dream with granite countertops, ample storage and modern appliances. The bedrooms are located on the opposite side of the home, with ample closet space and natural light. The master bedroom features an en-suite bathroom with dual sinks and granite countertops. Additionally, this property features a 2-car garage. This home offers the perfect combination of style, comfort, and functionality. Don’t miss out on the chance to make it yours!
As you may have noticed, the AI added extra features not named in the initial request. Agents always need to examine the response for accuracy — OpenAI warns the large language model is still under development and may generate incorrect information.
Additionally, all AI models are liable to inherit the biases of their creators and the data on which they are trained. Whether an honest mistake by an agent or a chatbot, discrimination in real estate advertising carries steep penalties. Agents need to review responses for outdated language like “master bedroom”  in the example above.
Fine-tuning the chatbot with more specific detail about the property’s features produces the best listing descriptions. For instance, when prompted with additional home features:
A listing description for a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom newly remodeled home with vaulted ceilings, a large backyard, and new windows in San Diego, California.
ChatGPT delivers a more detailed listing description:
This newly remodeled 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in San Diego, California boasts a bright and open floor plan with vaulted ceilings throughout. The home has been fully updated with new windows that allows plenty of natural light to flood the interior spaces. The kitchen has been completely remodeled with new appliances, cabinetry and countertops, perfect for any home chef. Each of the 4 bedrooms offer ample space and comfort, providing the perfect oasis for rest and relaxation. 
The property has a large backyard, perfect for entertaining, relaxing or enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather. A great space for hosting BBQs and gatherings with friends and family. 
The home’s central location provides easy access to all San Diego has to offer, from world-renowned beaches to delicious dining and nightlife options. Whether you’re looking for an investment property or a place to call home, this newly remodeled home is a must-see!
At its best, the chatbot gives an agent compelling copy to flaunt those new windows, vaulted ceilings and expansive backyard. The property, by the chatbot’s clever sleight of language, is imbued with personality.

Social media
Real estate agents are also incorporating AI writing algorithms such as ChatGPT to curate their online presence.
An agent’s digital marketing strategy might include content for:

social media platforms;
blogs;
email; and
their real estate agent website.

Social media is the premiere ecosystem agents use to stay visible and strengthen their personal brand with clients. Real estate agents know the importance of soliciting new clients and keeping tabs on past clients.
Popular social media sites for agents include:

Facebook;
Instagram;
TikTok;
LinkedIn;
Pinterest; and
YouTube.

Some sites are more text-based (Facebook and LinkedIn), image-based (Instagram and Pinterest) and others are video-based (TikTok and YouTube).
An agent uses ChatGPT to create social media content by prompting the chatbot to:

generate ideas for promotional content related to your brand;
write content tailored to target formats and audiences; and
refine and expand that content with additional prompts.

Ideas for social media posts for agents.
ChatGPT’s response:

Share testimonials and success stories from satisfied clients
Offer helpful tips and advice for buying or selling a home
Share photos and virtual tours of your current listings

Showcase your community involvement and local partnerships
Share industry news and updates
Showcase your team and highlight their accomplishments

When the agent decides to use one of these ideas, they can prompt ChatGPT for more detailed information, such as:
Write a social media post from an agent offering helpful tips and advice for buying a home. 
ChatGPT’s response:
Attention first-time home buyers! The home buying process can be overwhelming, but with the right knowledge and preparation, it can also be an exciting and rewarding experience. Here are a few tips to help make your home buying journey a success:

Get pre-approved for a mortgage before you start searching for a home. This will give you a better idea of your price range and help you make an offer more quickly when you find the right home.
Make a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves for your new home. Prioritize your needs and wants so you can focus your search on homes that meet your criteria. 
Hire a professional real estate agent who has experience in the area you are looking to buy. They can provide you with local market knowledge and help you navigate the buying process.
Be prepared to move quickly when you find the right home. In a competitive market, you need to be ready to make an offer as soon as you find the perfect property.
Don’t forget the home inspection! It’s important to have a professional inspect the home before you close to make sure you know what you are buying.

Buying a home can be stressful but with the right mindset and with the right professional help, you will find your dream home. Let’s work together to make your dream home a reality. #HomeBuyingTips #FirstTimeHomeBuyer #RealEstateAdvice 
Refining that post is as easy as including a specific neighborhood, target demographic, and — of course — your personal contact information and branding. This step will be different for every agent — even between a single agent’s marketing campaigns.

Blogs
Blogs demonstrate an agent’s expertise in a particular area of real estate.
An agent may post their blog to their agent website, another hosting platform or both. Blogs are similar to social media marketing since many platforms are free and yield valuable exposure to the agent from both past and new clients.
An agent can control the tone of a ChatGPT-created blog by splitting the task up into smaller parts and editing for language between each. For instance, an agent might refine their strategy by asking the chatbot to:

come up with ideas for new blogs and manually select your most valuable topics;
draft an outline for a blog which targets a specific demographic or area; and
write full-length informative blogs, supplemented with your personal experience.

This is particularly effective for agents providing niche services, since less content (and competition) exists in smaller markets. Agents can still query the chatbot in this way to provide ideas on blog topics for that specialty. For example, an agent might prompt:
Come up with some blog ideas for a real estate agent in Los Angeles who specializes in commercial property for investors.
ChatGPT’s response:

“The Top Commercial Real Estate Markets in Los Angeles for Investors”
“Why Los Angeles is a Smart Choice for Commercial Real Estate Investment”
“The Pros and Cons of Different Types of Commercial Properties for Investment”
“The Importance of Due Diligence in Commercial Real Estate Investment”
“The Role of a Real Estate Agent in a Commercial Property Investment”
“The Benefits of Working with a Commercial Real Estate Specialist in Los Angeles”
“The Impact of COVID-19 on the Los Angeles Commercial Real Estate Market”
“Commercial Property Management Tips for Investors”
“How to Identify and Evaluate Income-producing Commercial Properties in Los Angeles”
“The Future of Commercial Real Estate in Los Angeles: Trends to Watch”

Email
Unlike blogs and social media, email marketing is a more direct and reliable way of maintaining relationships with past and prospective clients.
Time-tested content creation ideas for your real estate marketing emails include:

advertising listings of properties;
solicitations to new potential clients;
upcoming events and open houses;
real estate news and market trends;
home maintenance and finance tips;
emails related to a client’s transactions, such as reminders and follow-ups; and
seasonal and holiday messages.

Just as with social media outlets, ChatGPT helps you generate email marketing ideas or helps you write the content with prompts. When prompted with:
Write an email marketing campaign from a Fresno real estate agent. Make the email message related to Memorial Day.
ChatGPT responds:
Dear [Name],
As Memorial Day approaches, we are reminded of the sacrifices made by our military heroes and their families. As a real estate agent in Fresno, I am honored to help those who have served our country find their dream homes.
This Memorial Day, I want to extend a special offer to all active and retired military personnel. If you are in the market to buy or sell a home, please contact me and I will work hard to ensure you receive the best deal possible.

Agent website
Ultimately, your professional website is the only platform you control 100%. With social media mostly free, real estate professionals of all specialties often overlook this facet of their digital footprint.
Consider these examples of effective content for your agent website:

your biography;
reviews from past clients;
press releases on successful sales or other professional achievements;
videos displaying your brand and services;
property listings; and
neighborhood information.

Like blog posts, press releases show off your expertise and experience in your service area. Try this ChatGPT prompt for a press release covering a home sale in San Francisco, California:
Write me, a real estate agent, a press release for a $1.4 million home I sold in San Francisco. 
ChatGPT’s response:

Lead generation
ChatGPT is no stranger to the elevator pitch. Agents can leverage ChatGPT to woo new clients by prompting it to craft a killer introduction.
For example, an agent gives the following directions:
Act like a real estate salesperson. Write a sales pitch for a seller and let them know you can do a complete comparative market analysis to find the best price for their property.
And ChatGPT responds:
Hello, are you thinking of selling your property? I am a professional real estate salesperson and I can help you get the best price for your home. One of the first steps in the process is to do a complete comparative market analysis. This will give us a clear understanding of the current market conditions and help us to determine the best price for your property.
I have access to the latest data and trends in the market, and I will use this information to create a customized marketing plan that will target the right buyers for your home. I also have a network of contacts and resources that will help to ensure that your property is seen by as many potential buyers as possible. 
I will work closely with you throughout the entire process to ensure that you get the best price for your home and that the transaction goes smoothly. My goal is to make this process as stress-free as possible for you, so you can focus on your next move.
If you’re interested, I would love to schedule a meeting with you to discuss how I can help you get the best price for your property. Thank you for your time.
Recruiting agents
As the public’s interest in real estate wanes during periods of high prices and tight credit, brokers can use ChatGPT to help recruit agents and automate the tedious writing required of the hiring process.
A broker writes these directions:

The candidate should have these qualities: a positive, energetic attitude, self-motivated, disciplined, consistent, knowledgeable of sales, willingness to learn, and adaptable. Write a job ad that will attract this type of hire and that highlights my diligence to train the right candidate.

Drawbacks and limitations
Despite its potential, natural language processing models aren’t foolproof. A few notable drawbacks and limitations to ChatGPT include:

the quality of its answers (output) depends on the detail you include in the directions you enter (input);
authoritative-sounding responses may contain incorrect information or unlawful advice;
limited knowledge of events or trends after 2021;
a tendency to overuse specific words and phrases; and
not requesting clarification when it doesn’t understand user prompts, leading to wild guesses and inaccuracies.

Due to the chatbot’s inclination to give false (but accurate sounding) information, agents need to verify the response and edit to remove inaccuracies.
AI empowers smaller agents and brokers to do more with less. Agents with the knowledge (but not the capital) to attract clients and close transactions are best positioned to benefit from this revolutionary tech.
