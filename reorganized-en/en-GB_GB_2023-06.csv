We’ve been hearing for years the warning that a robot might take over our job. More recently, a report by Goldman Sachs suggested that artificial intelligence (AI) could replace a staggering 300 million full time jobs. Yet for many people, work has seemed to mostly chug along as normal.


Is it all just hype? Or are we finally hitting the inflection point with recent advances in AI? And will AI replace us, or actually make us better and faster at what we do?

I sat down with leading experts and investors to get their take on how AI will change the future of work. These soundbites paint a good picture of how they perceive AI affecting our jobs, and where they see the biggest opportunities ahead.

#1: Expect a role reversal: we'll soon be the ones assisting machines, not vice versa

“I believe we will see a paradigm shift from machines assisting humans to humans assisting machines in the next decade.”
PROMOTED
Joanne Chen, General Partner at Foundation Capital
#2: AI's impact will be as big as the Industrial Revolution, empowering one to do the work of many
“AI is a force multiplier for human intelligence and productivity. Like the Industrial Revolution brought with machines and factories, AI is a means of production that will empower one to do the work of many. It’s hard to imagine change on that scale, yet it’s likely bigger than what we anticipate. AI won’t just boost efficiency for coding, marketing, legal or healthcare admin work — but entirely evolve how businesses and organizations of all types are built and run.”

“As investors, we see the potential for AI to automate, personalize and fine-tune thousands of processes in industries as widespread as healthcare, education, infrastructure and professional services.”

#4: White collar job functions, from coding to financial services to legal, will become vastly more efficient
“Job functions are already starting to profoundly change with the adoption of AI. One million developers already use Github copilot to generate code, forever altering the code creation process. In areas like financial services and legal, the days of manual research are numbered as the collaboration between professionals and AI-native applications will streamline (and in some cases eliminate) job functions to create previously unimaginable efficiencies.”
Lars Albright, General Partner at Unusual Ventures
#5: AI is already reducing the number of junior and mid-level software developers needed to ship new products
""One immediate impact of large language models (LLMs) is that they are significantly reducing the number of software developers needed to build and ship new digital products. My own portfolio startups are replacing coders with co-pilots. Although they still very much rely on their generals (such as chief technology officers and heads of AI), they are finding they need fewer and fewer soldiers (such as coders and data scientists).""
John Spindler, General Partner at Twin Path Ventures
#6: As GenAI disrupts traditional roles, professionals will lean on AI-powered peer-to-peer channels to learn, up-skill and navigate new career paths.
""Generative AI will accelerate personalized and applied learning both inside and outside of the workplace. As courses and books become quickly outdated, so will linear career pathways, giving way to a surge in both machine-driven and peer-to-peer learning. Similar to how YouTube, Instagram and TikTok leveraged the rise of smartphones and allowed people to share their lives through stories, we think that learning and upskilling will evolve as a result of GenAI.
Dinika Mahtani, Principal at Cherry Ventures
#7: AI transforms the way organizations make critical decisions
“AI is radically changing the way in which organizations make critical decisions. It powers simulations that feed insights and proposals into commercial decisions like exploring pricing schemes, operational ones like optimizing routing and logistics and even those in more complex domains like finding design and engineering solutions to a detailed brief. Increasingly AI can fully make and automate these decisions, such as with autonomous commercial negotiations or closed-loop manufacturing optimization systems.
Longer term, I see an opportunity for complete digital representations of business with sophisticated AIs that can make decisions on these. Imagine being able to “hire” an AI COO — or even a fully “autonomous business” that generates profit without requiring any input at all.”
Ben Blume, Partner at Atomico
#8: The category-defining AI businesses will be the ones with defensibility and distribution
“Historically, we have seen that for software startups, ease of use or proprietary data alone are not enough to build a category-leading business. The same is true with AI. Founders must look for defensibility and distribution, in addition to the many avenues for value creation enabled by AI.
Defensibility in AI can be elusive when core models are not proprietary and open-source models haven’t sufficiently matured. Implementing features that incentivize user interaction and lead to data generation is one way to create data network effects.”
Parul Singh, Partner at Initialized Capital
#9: The infrastructure and research layer of generative AI is where the sustainable business models lie
""Generative AI is going to usher in massive productivity gains and improved cost structures for businesses of all types. Employees will be not only dramatically more effective and productive, but also freed to achieve new levels of creativity and innovation.
The question in my mind is how to help companies attain these benefits in a cost-effective manner, given the extraordinarily high costs involved in training and running today’s AI models. That’s why I’m focusing my energies on the infrastructure and research layer of generative AI. This area will be the key to shifting AI from hype to reality as it unlocks new, sustainable business models that positively transform the world of work for both employers and employees alike.""
Jill Chase, Partner at CapitalG
#10: AI is making it harder than ever to identify substance amidst all the noise
“Great innovation can be obtained by these disruptor trends (AI machine learning, automation, etc.). The newest generation of large language models have advanced so quickly, but as an investor, it will become increasingly important to navigate through the noise and identify substance. We are excited about tech solutions that introduce automation, but also hybrid solutions that can accelerate productivity globally for organizations to grow in a sustainable manner.”
Wilfred Fianko, General Partner at Cornerstone VC
#11: Large language models are not just hype
""It is apparent to everyone that large language models are a once-in-a-generation technology. Any startup or VC that believes they are just hype, and therefore can be ignored, has their head in the sand.""
John Spindler, General Partner at Twin Path Ventures
#12: AI will impact our day-to-day work, first gradually, and then suddenly
“In the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway coined a now-iconic term for how one goes bankrupt: first gradually, then suddenly. The same is true of how technology disrupts work. Jobs don't disappear overnight. First there's a slow culling, with intermediate steps like offshoring. Eventually technology reaches enough maturity, and business processes change sufficiently, resulting in a rapid decline. We've seen this transition with back-office work, and we're about to see it in even more unexpected areas like software development.”
Ramy Adeeb, Founder & General Partner at 1984 Ventures

Twelve hot-takes on AI that all point in the same direction. We may not all be out of a job tomorrow — or ever — but the entire world of work will evolve due to the current tipping point we’re experiencing, as well as future AI advancements, of which there are sure to be many.
Personally, I have yet to meet someone whose job has been replaced by AI. But almost everyone I speak with has been touched by it in some way recently. Particularly for knowledge workers, it’s time to embrace the potential inherent in AI.

Accounting professionals ‘cautiously optimistic’ about generative AI

Thomson Reuters has published new research on generative AI that gauged the sentiment of professionals across legal, tax, and accounting firms in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The research sought to better understand how the technology is perceived and applied within the professional services industry. The report uncovered a mix of optimism and caution in the adoption of generative AI. 
Commenting on this, Thomson Reuters president and CEO, Steve Hasker, said: “Generative AI has the capacity to disrupt and redefine the professional landscape, but it is clear from our findings that there is a trust gap with professionals.
“The future of professional work is set to be revolutionised by generative AI, and as an industry, we need to work together to find the right balance between the benefits of technology and any unintended consequences. We believe this will help our customers to first trust the transformative power of generative AI, and then harness the opportunity to shape the future of their professions.” 
Amongst the professionals surveyed, the potential of generative AI is undeniably recognised; 78% of respondents believe generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can enhance legal or accounting work, with the proportion slightly higher for legal (82%) than for tax (73%). Furthermore, about half (52%) of all respondents believe that generative AI should be used for legal and tax work.  
However, despite the research sharing strong feelings about generative AI’s potential utility, many within the legal and tax fields are still weighing their options before adopting the technology. Only 4% of respondents are currently using generative AI in their operations, with an additional 5% planning to do so. Interestingly, tax and accounting firms are more open to the idea, with a 15% adoption or planned adoption rate. 
Among those who have adopted or are planning to adopt generative AI technologies, research was the primary use case cited by respondents; about two-thirds of those in corporate legal and 80% of those in tax identified it as the most compelling use. Knowledge management, back-office functions, and question answering services were also cited as use cases of interest.

Risk perception seems to be the major stumbling block in the adoption of generative AI tools. A significant 69% of respondents expressed risk concerns, suggesting that fear may be holding back a more widespread adoption. While the potential of generative AI tools is recognised, there is an air of uncertainty, underlining the need for establishing trust, as well as furthering education and strategic planning in its implementation. 
Despite concerns around the risks to privacy, security, and accuracy, very few organisations are actively taking steps to limit the use of generative AI among employees. Twenty percent of respondents said their firm or company has warned employees against the unauthorised use of generative AI at work. Only 9% of all respondents, meanwhile, reported their organisation had banned the unauthorised use of generative AI.

As organizations increase their use of artificial intelligence technologies within their operations, they're reaping tangible benefits that are expected to deliver significant financial value.







Eighty-seven percent of organizations believe AI and machine learning will help them grow revenue, boost operational efficiency and improve customer experiences, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan's ""Global State of AI, 2022"" report.
Those are only a few of the benefits AI can deliver.
Here are 12 advantages the technology brings to organizations across various industry sectors.

1. Better decisions
Organizations increasingly use AI to gain insights into their data or, in the business lingo of today, to make ""data-driven decisions."" As they do that, they're finding they do indeed make better, more accurate decisions instead of ones based on individual instincts or intuition tainted by personal biases and preferences.
As an example, Kavita Ganesan, an AI adviser, strategist and founder of the consultancy Opinosis Analytics, pointed to one company that used AI to help it sort through the survey responses of its 42,000 employees. The technology analyzed narrative responses and presented summarized findings -- an approach that let company officials effectively understand what workers wanted most rather than offering them options to rank via check-the-box choices.

2. Efficiency and productivity gains
Efficiency and productivity gains are two other big benefits that organizations get from using AI, said Adnan Masood, chief AI architect at UST, a digital transformation solutions company.
Masood said AI lets organizations handle tasks at a volume and velocity that's simply not possible for humans to match -- whether they're using AI for search or to analyze data for insights, create software code or execute specific business processes.
AI not only works at a scale beyond human capacity, Masood noted, but it removes time-consuming manual tasks from workers -- a productivity gain that lets workers perform higher-level tasks that only humans can do. He pointed to the use of AI in software development as a case in point, highlighting the fact that AI can create test data to check code, freeing up developers to focus on more engaging work.
This lets organizations minimize the costs associated with performing mundane, repeatable tasks that can be performed by technology while maximizing the talent of their human capital.



Here are the key benefits AI brings to businesses.







3. Improved speed of business
As fast as business moves in this digital age, AI helps it move even faster, said Seth Earley, author of The AI-Powered Enterprise and CEO of Earley Information Science. ""It's all about speeding up the clock of the enterprise,"" he said. AI essentially enables shorter cycles and cuts the time it takes to move from one stage to the next -- such as from design to commercialization -- and that shortened timeline, in turn, delivers better and more immediate ROI.


4. New capabilities and business model expansion
Executives can use AI for business model expansion, experts said, noting that organizations are seeing new opportunities as they deploy data, analytics and intelligence into the enterprise.
For example, autonomous vehicle companies could use the reams of data they're collecting to identify new revenue streams related to insurance, while an insurance company could apply AI to its vast data stores to get into fleet management.


5. Personalized customer services and experiences
AI analyzes and learns from data to create highly personalized and customized experiences and services, said Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group.
He said the most visible examples of this come from the consumer world, as streaming services, such as Netflix, and retailers use intelligent systems to study buying patterns, individual consumer data and larger data sets to determine what each customer prefers at any given time to suit their personal style, interests and needs.
However, AI delivers that personalization in numerous other areas, such as in healthcare, where it customizes treatments, and in work environments to support an employee's individual requirements.








6. Improved services
AI creates interactions with technology that are easier, more intuitive, more accurate and, thus, better all around, said Mike Mason, chief AI officer with consultancy Thoughtworks.
He cited a real estate site that employs generative AI so users can refine their property listing searches through conversational queries rather than clicking through boxes.
""The AI understands an unstructured query, and it understands unstructured data,"" Mason explained. In other words, the technology can analyze a user's request even when it's given in plain, conversational language; analyze all the descriptive elements within each listing, including narrative notes added by real estate agents; and present the user with a finely tuned and highly accurate list of properties that meets their requirements.


7. Improved monitoring
AI's capacity to take in and process massive amounts of data in real time means organizations can implement near-instantaneous monitoring capabilities to alert them to issues, recommend actions and, in some cases, initiate a response, according to experts.
For example, AI can use information gathered by devices on factory equipment to identify problems and predict needed maintenance. This prevents disruptive breakdowns and costly maintenance work performed because it's needed rather than scheduled.
AI's monitoring capabilities can be effective in other areas, such as in enterprise cybersecurity operations where large amounts of data need to be analyzed and understood.


8. Better quality and reduction of human error
Organizations can expect a reduction of errors and stronger adherence to established standards when they add AI technologies to processes. Furthermore, when AI and machine learning are integrated with a technology such as robotic process automation, which automates repetitive, rules-based tasks, the combination not only speeds up processes and reduces errors, but can also be trained to improve upon itself and take on broader tasks.
As a result of that error reducing and higher quality, ""AI improves the value prop[osition],"" Earley said.
The use of AI in financial reconciliation, for example, delivers nearly always error-free results, whereas that same reconciliation when handled, even in part, by human employees is prone to mistakes.

9. Better talent management
Companies are using AI to improve many aspects of talent management, from streamlining the hiring process to rooting out bias in corporate communications. Moreover, AI-enabled processes not only save companies in hiring costs, but also can affect workforce productivity by successfully sourcing, screening and identifying top-tier candidates. As natural language processing tools have improved, companies are also using chatbots to provide job candidates with a personalized experience and to mentor employees. Additionally, AI tools can gauge employee sentiment, identify and retain high performers, determine equitable pay, and deliver more personalized and engaging workplace experiences with less requirements on boring, repetitive tasks.


10. More innovation
As workers at all levels become more comfortable and confident working with AI, experts said they're starting to use AI tools to help them be more creative and more innovative.
In her book, Ganesan described how a restaurant chain used the technology to power a mobile app that enables customers to craft their own cocktails based on their mood and food choices, with the tool concocting the recipe and then sending it to a human bartender to mix and serve.
Other industries use AI to support R&D activities, such as in the healthcare space for drug discovery work and the consumer product goods sector for new product creation.


11. Increased profitability
As they use AI in more areas of the enterprise -- from personalizing services to aiding in risk management to supporting innovation -- organizations will see improved productivity, reduced costs, higher efficiency and possibly new growth opportunities.
Taken together, that can deliver higher profitability, said Sreekar Krishna, U.S. leader of AI at professional services firm KPMG. ""On the revenue side, it's potential is exponential: You can keep growing as long as you're bringing value to customers.""


12. Industry-specific improvements
In addition to the benefits listed above, AI can fuel the following industry-specific improvements:

Retailers can use AI to better target their marketing efforts, develop a more efficient supply chain and better calculate pricing for optimal returns. At retail companies, AI helps predict customer requirements and appropriate staffing levels.
The pharmaceutical sector can use the technology to perform drug discovery data analysis and predictions that can't be done with conventional technologies.
The financial industry can use AI to strengthen its fraud detection efforts.

It's important to remember that, as companies find ways to use AI for competitive advantage, they're also grappling with challenges. Concerns include AI bias, government regulation of AI, management of the data required for machine learning projects and talent shortages. In addition, financial gains can be elusive if the talent and infrastructure for implementing AI aren't in place.

Some were East Asian, a few were Indian, and a few were women. But the vast majority were white men. More than 5,500 people attended the meeting, five years ago in Barcelona, Spain.Timnit Gebru, then a graduate student at Stanford University, remembers counting only six Black people other than herself, all of whom she knew, all of whom were men.The homogeneous crowd crystallized for her a glaring issue. The big thinkers of tech say A.I. is the future. It will underpin everything from search engines and email to the software that drives our cars, directs the policing of our streets and helps create our vaccines.But it is being built in a way that replicates the biases of the almost entirely male, predominantly white work force making it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn the nearly 10 years I’ve written about artificial intelligence, two things have remained a constant: The technology relentlessly improves in fits and sudden, great leaps forward. And bias is a thread that subtly weaves through that work in a way that tech companies are reluctant to acknowledge.On her first night home in Menlo Park, Calif., after the Barcelona conference, sitting cross-​legged on the couch with her laptop, Dr. Gebru described the A.I. work force conundrum in a Facebook post.“I’m not worried about machines taking over the world. I’m worried about groupthink, insularity and arrogance in the A.I. community — especially with the current hype and demand for people in the field,” she wrote. “The people creating the technology are a big part of the system. If many are actively excluded from its creation, this technology will benefit a few while harming a great many.”The A.I. community buzzed about the mini-manifesto. Soon after, Dr. Gebru helped create a new organization, Black in A.I. After finishing her Ph.D., she was hired by Google.She teamed with Margaret Mitchell, who was building a group inside Google dedicated to “ethical A.I.” Dr. Mitchell had previously worked in the research lab at Microsoft. She had grabbed attention when she told Bloomberg News in 2016 that A.I. suffered from a “sea of dudes” problem. She estimated that she had worked with hundreds of men over the previous five years and about 10 women.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTheir work was hailed as groundbreaking. The nascent A.I. industry, it had become clear, needed minders and people with different perspectives.About six years ago, A.I. in a Google online photo service organized photos of Black people into a folder called “gorillas.” Four years ago, a researcher at a New York start-up noticed that the A.I. system she was working on was egregiously biased against Black people. Not long after, a Black researcher in Boston discovered that an A.I. system couldn’t identify her face — until she put on a white mask.In 2018, when I told Google’s public relations staff that I was working on a book about artificial intelligence, it arranged a long talk with Dr. Mitchell to discuss her work. As she described how she built the company’s Ethical A.I. team — and brought Dr. Gebru into the fold — it was refreshing to hear from someone so closely focused on the bias problem.But nearly three years later, Dr. Gebru was pushed out of the company without a clear explanation. She said she had been fired after criticizing Google’s approach to minority hiring and, with a research paper, highlighting the harmful biases in the A.I. systems that underpin Google’s search engine and other services.“Your life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people,” Dr. Gebru said in an email before her firing. “You start making the other leaders upset.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs Dr. Mitchell defended Dr. Gebru, the company removed her, too. She had searched through her own Google email account for material that would support their position and forwarded emails to another account, which somehow got her into trouble. Google declined to comment for this article.Their departure became a point of contention for A.I. researchers and other tech workers. Some saw a giant company no longer willing to listen, too eager to get technology out the door without considering its implications. I saw an old problem — part technological and part sociological — finally breaking into the open.80 Mistagged PhotosImageArtificial intelligence technology will eventually find its way into almost everything Google does.Credit...Cody O'Loughlin for The New York TimesIt should have been a wake-up call.In June 2015, a friend sent Jacky Alciné, a 22-year-old software engineer living in Brooklyn, an internet link for snapshots the friend had posted to the new Google Photos service. Google Photos could analyze snapshots and automatically sort them into digital folders based on what was pictured. One folder might be “dogs,” another “birthday party.”When Mr. Alciné clicked on the link, he noticed one of the folders was labeled “gorillas.” That made no sense to him, so he opened the folder. He found more than 80 photos he had taken nearly a year earlier of a friend during a concert in nearby Prospect Park. That friend was Black.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe might have let it go if Google had mistakenly tagged just one photo. But 80? He posted a screenshot on Twitter. “Google Photos, y’all,” messed up, he wrote, using much saltier language. “My friend is not a gorilla.”Like facial recognition services, talking digital assistants and conversational “chatbots,” Google Photos relied on an A.I. system that learned its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital data.Called a “neural network,” this mathematical system could learn tasks that engineers could never code into a machine on their own. By analyzing thousands of photos of gorillas, it could learn to recognize a gorilla. It was also capable of egregious mistakes. The onus was on engineers to choose the right data when training these mathematical systems. (In this case, the easiest fix was to eliminate “gorilla” as a photo category.)As a software engineer, Mr. Alciné understood the problem. He compared it to making lasagna. “If you mess up the lasagna ingredients early, the whole thing is ruined,” he said. “It is the same thing with A.I. You have to be very intentional about what you put into it. Otherwise, it is very difficult to undo.”The Porn ProblemIn 2017, Deborah Raji, a 21-​year-​old Black woman from Ottawa, sat at a desk inside the New York offices of Clarifai, the start-up where she was working. The company built technology that could automatically recognize objects in digital images and planned to sell it to businesses, police departments and government agencies.She stared at a screen filled with faces — images the company used to train its facial recognition software.As she scrolled through page after page of these faces, she realized that most — more than 80 percent — were of white people. More than 70 percent of those white people were male. When Clarifai trained its system on this data, it might do a decent job of recognizing white people, Ms. Raji thought, but it would fail miserably with people of color, and probably women, too.ImageDeborah Raji realized that a company’s technology wasn’t getting the input it needed to properly recognize people of color.Credit...Jaime Hogge for The New York TimesClarifai was also building a “content moderation system,” a tool that could automatically identify and remove pornography from images people posted to social networks. The company trained this system on two sets of data: thousands of photos pulled from online pornography sites, and thousands of G‑rated images bought from stock photo services.The system was supposed to learn the difference between the pornographic and the anodyne. The problem was that the G‑rated images were dominated by white people, and the pornography was not. The system was learning to identify Black people as pornographic.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The data we use to train these systems matters,” Ms. Raji said. “We can’t just blindly pick our sources.”This was obvious to her, but to the rest of the company it was not. Because the people choosing the training data were mostly white men, they didn’t realize their data was biased.“The issue of bias in facial recognition technologies is an evolving and important topic,” Clarifai’s chief executive, Matt Zeiler, said in a statement. Measuring bias, he said, “is an important step.”‘Black Skin, White Masks’Before joining Google, Dr. Gebru collaborated on a study with a young computer scientist, Joy Buolamwini. A graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ms. Buolamwini, who is Black, came from a family of academics. Her grandfather specialized in medicinal chemistry, and so did her father.She gravitated toward facial recognition technology. Other researchers believed it was reaching maturity, but when she used it, she knew it wasn’t.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn October 2016, a friend invited her for a night out in Boston with several other women. “We’ll do masks,” the friend said. Her friend meant skin care masks at a spa, but Ms. Buolamwini assumed Halloween masks. So she carried a white plastic Halloween mask to her office that morning.It was still sitting on her desk a few days later as she struggled to finish a project for one of her classes. She was trying to get a detection system to track her face. No matter what she did, she couldn’t quite get it to work.In her frustration, she picked up the white mask from her desk and pulled it over her head. Before it was all the way on, the system recognized her face — or, at least, it recognized the mask.“Black Skin, White Masks,” she said in an interview, nodding to the 1952 critique of historical racism from the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon. “The metaphor becomes the truth. You have to fit a norm, and that norm is not you.”Ms. Buolamwini started exploring commercial services designed to analyze faces and identify characteristics like age and sex, including tools from Microsoft and IBM.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTShe found that when the services read photos of lighter-​skinned men, they misidentified sex about 1 percent of the time. But the darker the skin in the photo, the larger the error rate. It rose particularly high with images of women with dark skin. Microsoft’s error rate was about 21 percent. IBM’s was 35.Published in the winter of 2018, the study drove a backlash against facial recognition technology and, particularly, its use in law enforcement. Microsoft’s chief legal officer said the company had turned down sales to law enforcement when there was concern the technology could unreasonably infringe on people’s rights, and he made a public call for government regulation.Twelve months later, Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that would require notices to be posted in public places using facial recognition and ensure that government agencies obtained a court order when looking for specific people. The bill passed, and it takes effect later this year. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article, did not back other legislation that would have provided stronger protections.Ms. Buolamwini began to collaborate with Ms. Raji, who moved to M.I.T. They started testing facial recognition technology from a third American tech giant: Amazon. The company had started to market its technology to police departments and government agencies under the name Amazon Rekognition.Ms. Buolamwini and Ms. Raji published a study showing that an Amazon face service also had trouble identifying the sex of female and darker-​skinned faces. According to the study, the service mistook women for men 19 percent of the time and misidentified darker-​skinned women for men 31 percent of the time. For lighter-​skinned males, the error rate was zero.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmazon called for government regulation of facial recognition. It also attacked the researchers in private emails and public blog posts.“The answer to anxieties over new technology is not to run ‘tests’ inconsistent with how the service is designed to be used, and to amplify the test’s false and misleading conclusions through the news media,” an Amazon executive, Matt Wood, wrote in a blog post that disputed the study and a New York Times article that described it.In an open letter, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Gebru rejected Amazon’s argument and called on it to stop selling to law enforcement. The letter was signed by 25 artificial intelligence researchers from Google, Microsoft and academia.Last June, Amazon backed down. It announced that it would not let the police use its technology for at least a year, saying it wanted to give Congress time to create rules for the ethical use of the technology. Congress has yet to take up the issue. Amazon declined to comment for this article.The End at GoogleDr. Gebru and Dr. Mitchell had less success fighting for change inside their own company. Corporate gatekeepers at Google were heading them off with a new review system that had lawyers and even communications staff vetting research papers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Gebru’s dismissal in December stemmed, she said, from the company’s treatment of a research paper she wrote alongside six other researchers, including Dr. Mitchell and three others at Google. The paper discussed ways that a new type of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins its search engine, can show bias against women and people of color.After she submitted the paper to an academic conference, Dr. Gebru said, a Google manager demanded that she either retract the paper or remove the names of Google employees. She said she would resign if the company could not tell her why it wanted her to retract the paper and answer other concerns.The response: Her resignation was accepted immediately, and Google revoked her access to company email and other services. A month later, it removed Dr. Mitchell’s access after she searched through her own email in an effort to defend Dr. Gebru.In a Google staff meeting last month, just after the company fired Dr. Mitchell, the head of the Google A.I. lab, Jeff Dean, said the company would create strict rules meant to limit its review of sensitive research papers. He also defended the reviews. He declined to discuss the details of Dr. Mitchell’s dismissal but said she had violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies.One of Mr. Dean’s new lieutenants, Zoubin Ghahramani, said the company must be willing to tackle hard issues. There are “uncomfortable things that responsible A.I. will inevitably bring up,” he said. “We need to be comfortable with that discomfort.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut it will be difficult for Google to regain trust — both inside the company and out.“They think they can get away with firing these people and it will not hurt them in the end, but they are absolutely shooting themselves in the foot,” said Alex Hanna, a longtime part of Google’s 10-member Ethical A.I. team. “What they have done is incredibly myopic.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent at The Times and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and the World,” from which this article is adapted.Cade Metz is a technology reporter and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and The World.” He covers artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas.

BYOAI Is Here — Make The Right Moves To Benefit From Generative AI At Work 



John Brand, VP, Advisor                            

                                Anna Synakh                              


                        Jun 23 2023                      











 



Back in May, Samsung banned the use of generative AI platforms in the workplace after news of a security leak caused by misuse of ChatGPT. While employees did not revolt against the ban, chances are that many of the employees continued using AI. With generative AI solutions growing exponentially, it will be nearly impossible to limit employee usage — think back to the early days of mobile phones.
Over the past few years, many of you have been assessing generative AI at work and its potential in reducing company costs, enhancing efficiency, and improving overall performance. Most likely, you have adopted automated tools/AI to support your hiring process, like 99% of Fortune 500 companies. You are aware of the risks of implementing AI into your workspace but also see immense potential. What you may have missed while focusing on the big picture is the fact that your employees have desires to achieve the same goals at a personal level. They, too, strive to increase efficiency and to improve performance, and now they have (more) tools to do so.
An MIT study shows that using artificial intelligence can increase productivity by anywhere from 20% to 70%. And Forrester’s research shows that when employees see an opportunity to increase their own productivity, they will gladly take it, even if it goes against company procedures. The reality is simple: Your employees are using generative AI at work. They are using it in your corporate office. They are using it while working remotely. They are using it with or without your permission. BYOAI — or, “bring your own AI” — is already the reality, and it is now your job to help your company and employees optimize the value of AI while ensuring that it is being used safely and appropriately by putting guardrails, not stop signs, in place.
BYOAI has the potential to be one of your top opportunities this year, which is why Forrester is releasing two reports to help you navigate the issue. We released BYOAI: Policies And Guidelines Optimize AI Opportunities In The Enterprise today. This report will help you learn more about the challenges BYOAI may bring to your organization, how not to address them, and how to properly communicate new policies and procedures with your employees.
Also, look out for an upcoming report that will provide a deeper dive into the actual policies that you should consider implementing to maximize the benefits of BYOAI while minimizing the risks.
If you want to learn more, feel free to set up an analyst inquiry or guidance session.

Was that Pope Francis wearing a white puffer jacket inspired by luxury fashion brand Balenciaga? Did former President Donald Trump fall to the street while being arrested by police? The answer is no. Photos that appear to depict those events aren’t real; they are the product of generative artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, has existed for years. But generative AI, a subset of the field, recently has propelled the technology into public view. Generative AI has had the fastest acceptance and usage growth of any new technology, even surpassing the iPhone, said Tom Davenport, a Babson College information technology and management professor. Recent investment and advances in the technology have led to better-quality tools that can create realistic images from text prompts, or write a poem or essay on par with what humans can produce. Generative AI exploded onto the scene in late 2022 when OpenAI, a San Francisco-based tech company, released Dall-E, an image generator, and ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, that allowed anyone to use them to create art or text. Competitors responded in kind, flooding the market with similar products. The technology is likely to change the way we live and work, and it’s expected to transform a number of industries as companies incorporate it. Here’s what to know about generative AI and how it’s used. What is generative AI? Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on training computer systems to use a process or set of rules, called algorithms, to perform tasks normally performed by humans. We interact with the technology when using personal assistants like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, or when we see predictive text offered as we type a search query on Google. Generative AI  is a broad term that describes when computers create new content — such as text, photos, videos, music, code, audio and art — by identifying patterns in existing data. “It’s AI that creates new content based on past content. It predicts what is most likely to be next in a sequence of words or images or music or anything sequential using machine learning models,” Davenport said. How it works Several types of generative AI tools are in use today, including text-to-text generators such as ChatGPT, text-to-image generators such as Dall-E, and others used to generate code or audio. Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst in the Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies Initiative, said most generative AI tasks rely on deep learning. That’s a method of artificial intelligence where computers are trained to use neural networks — a set of algorithms designed to mimic neurons in the human brain — to generate complex associations between patterns to create text, images or other content. There are different types of deep learning models used to train generative AI tools, but the most widely used are transformers and generative adversarial networks, known as GANs. Transformers, first described in a 2017 paper by Google researchers, are networks designed to more naturally process language. ChatGPT was built using a transformer-based large language model, a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of data. GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Transformers are also used in other text creation software, including Google’s Bard. Davenport said transformers help AI better predict text in context, because they help identify the relationships between all the words in a sentence. For example, transformer-based models made it possible to distinguish between words that have more than one meaning, such as “bank,” based on the context in which they were used, he said. GANs, introduced in 2014, are mostly used for image and multimedia generation. They have two neural networks: a generator that creates an image based on data, and a discriminator that uses machine learning to predict whether the generated image is real or fake, said V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor. The first one or two generated images may not be good, but the discriminator can easily determine they are fake. Subrahmanian said that with each failure, the generator learns from its mistakes and produces better, more realistic images. “Generative adversarial networks turned the scales,” Subrahmanian said, because they generate new realistic looking images and videos.   What’s behind the recent surge in interest? Although generative AI had been around for a while before its recent ascendence, the technology was in its infancy and its use was limited, Subrahmanian said. “The rise of generative AI is due to a trifecta of factors,” he said, including advances in deep learning such as generative adversarial networks; much more available data available to train models; and more powerful graphics processing unit computers that help accelerate the training. As a result, models can “generate high-quality images much faster than would have been otherwise possible,” he said. When companies such as OpenAI made products available to the general public, it was transformative, experts said. In September 2022, OpenAI made Dall-E 2 available to anyone, after initially offering it only to users on a waiting list that had grown to more than 1 million people. Competitors launched similar products, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Interest spiked again in November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, allowing anyone to sign up for free to test it and provide feedback during a research preview. In April, the site had more than 206 million unique visitors, according to data analytics company Similarweb, which noted that growth had flattened since its initial launch. “It was really only when ChatGPT was announced in November that the rest of the world really woke up to it,” said Davenport. Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said ChatGPT was a more accessible and better-behaved chatbot than most users had experienced, explaining the massive surge in public use. Along with 2022 improvements in image generation capabilities, the release of OpenAI’s latest language model “sparked the current wave of public interest,” Toner said. ChatGPT, Midjourney and Dall-E are among the most popular generative AI platforms in use, Subrahmanian said. ChatGPT and Dall-E were both created by OpenAI, while Midjourney comes from a research lab bearing the same name. Their rapid adoption has spurred an arms race, with several new companies and products seeking to enter the space. Who is using it, and what is its potential? “Generative AI has the power to help ordinary people overcome their weaknesses, and excel in ways they had not previously imagined,” Subrahmanian said. He cited examples such as:  A non-native English speaker who needs to write a report in English, writes it in her own words and then asks ChatGPT to rephrase it; An injured cartoonist could use an image generator to produce work in his style; A widow could use the technology to hear her deceased husband’s voice say, “I love you,” again.  Toner said large language models can be used for tasks including summarization, translation and chat, Toner said. Image generators can be used for video game design, graphic design and animation. “We are still in the early stages of exploring where these systems can and cannot be useful,” she said. Wirtschafter, of the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said the scope of use for text generators such as ChatGPT is vast across education and the workplace. Students and teachers are embracing it, and professionals can use it “as a means of generating new ideas and speeding up work,” she said. She described text generators as acting like “Google on steroids.” “People use it for speeches, talking points, generating code output, identifying citations, summarizing documents, generating event and article titles, and so on,” she said. Businesses are also very interested in the technology, Davenport said. Kraft Heinz Co. in August released an AI-generated ketchup ad. Coca-Cola Co. in May released an ad that used generative AI, along with live action and other digital effects, to show a Coca-Cola bottle traveling through an art museum.  Other companies are using text generators to manage their internal knowledge, he said. He cited Morgan Stanley, which has been training GPT using 100,000 company documents to help address questions its financial advisors may have. Concerns about the technology Academic and industry leaders have expressed concern about AI’s potential downsides, including large-scale job loss, the rise of misinformation, the ensuing threat to democracy and the potential for AI to outsmart humans. Nearly three-quarters of companies plan to integrate current and future AI systems into their functioning, leading to valid concerns about the impacts of AI on job security across sectors. “Existing models are already capable of replacing or augmenting a decent portion of modern-day intellectual labor,” a spokesperson for the Center for AI Safety, a San Francisco-based research nonprofit, said. Future models “will likely be completely capable of doing various white-collar intellectual tasks.” Though AI threatens certain sectors, the World Economic Forum estimates that it will have a net positive impact on job growth, predicting several million new jobs in education, agriculture and digital commerce and trade, and will increase demand for AI specialists. “Generative AI is a double-edged sword,” Subrahmanian said. “If ChatGPT can perform a task currently performed by humans faster, better and cheaper, then those individuals’ jobs are at risk. But ChatGPT has already created new jobs such as ones based on prompt engineering. And it can enable people to overcome deficits and qualify for jobs that they did not qualify for before.” Generative AI could be detrimental because of its lack of accuracy, as PolitiFact found when it put ChatGPT to a fact-checking test. OpenAI recognizes that its technology “still is not fully reliable,” can be “confidently wrong in its predictions,” and may “hallucinate facts and make reasoning errors.” Not only can generative AI contribute to the proliferation of misinformation, but internal reports indicate that ChatGPT can also create it convincingly.   Some AI experts are also concerned about the dangers posed by future iterations of the technology — a superintelligent “rogue AI” that supersedes human control. Major tech executives and industry leaders such as Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson were among thousands of signatories on a March letter asking AI labs to pause development for six months on AI systems to improve safety and oversight of the technology. The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) also wrote an April open letter, highlighting AI technology’s social value, while recognizing several key concerns that need addressing through transparency, safety, and engagement in ethics discussions. But not all experts share these concerns. One of the “grandfathers” of AI, Yann LeCun, recently told BBC News that although AI will change certain aspects of the world, statements about AI threatening humanity are “preposterous.” At a Senate hearing in May, Sam Altman, the OpenAI’s CEO, urged legislators to regulate the industry. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that,” Altman said. “We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.” This fact check was originally published by PolitiFact, which is part of the Poynter Institute.

Corporate law and tax professionals as well as their outside firms believe generative AI tools like ChatGPT can and should be used for work; but the sectors differ in potential use cases and how they’re approaching risk mitigation policies

As generative AI tools such as ChatGPT continue to take hold in the public consciousness, those in the legal and tax professions are beginning to consider and plan for how these innovative technologies could be used in their own work and how to overcome the risks that generative AI presents.
A new report comparing legal and tax approaches to generative AI, as well as the difference between corporate and outside professionals, reveals how attitudes and adoption of generative AI are developing in the tool’s early days. Although there are some slight differences in the strength of their opinions — for example, more legal professionals than tax professionals believe generative AI can be applied to their work — respondents from all segments said they feel positively that the technology can apply to their daily work product.
The Future of Professionals: ChatGPT and Generative AI in
Legal, Corporate & Tax Markets report comes from a series of surveys conducted between March and May by the Thomson Reuters Institute of more than 1,800 legal and tax professionals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey was accompanied with assorted interviews conducted by the Institute, painting a picture of professional services industries that are still weighing their options for adopting the technology even as they eye potential use cases for when they feel the technology is ready.
Some segments are already moving: 15% of tax & accounting firm respondents and 10% of corporate law department respondents, for instance, report already adopting generative AI tools or having made clear plans to do so. Others are still waiting out the technology, however: respondents from 73% of corporate tax departments said they have no plans to adopt generative AI technologies at this time, 13 percentage points higher than any other segment.

Other important findings in the report include:
Most respondents said they feel these technologies can and should be used for work — More than three-quarters (78%) of respondents believe ChatGPT or generative AI can be used for legal or tax work, and about half (52%) of all respondents believe that it should be used. Corporate law and corporate tax departments answered affirmatively at a slightly higher rate — 3 to 4 percentage points higher — than their outside law firm and tax & accounting firm counterparts.
Many are still considering potential adoption — Despite strong feelings about the tools’ potential utility, many within the legal and tax professions are still weighing their options before actually adopting the technology. Just 4% of all respondents said they were already using generative AI or ChatGPT for firm or department operations, and 5% said they were actively making plans to do so. Those numbers were largely consistent across geographies and the type of practice, although tax & accounting firms in particular had a higher rate of adoption or planned adoption (15%) than other types of respondents.
A focus on risk — More than two-thirds (69%) of respondents said their organization has risk concerns around the use of generative AI or ChatGPT, while just 8% said their organization did not have risk concerns. Almost one-fourth (23%) said they did not know. Despite these warnings, however, very few organizations are taking active steps to limit generative AI or ChatGPT usage: Just 20% of respondents said their firm or company has warned employees against unauthorized generative AI or ChatGPT usage, and 9% of all respondents said their organization had banned the unauthorized use of generative AI or ChatGPT.
There is a distinct potential for this technology to change not only how legal and tax professionals work on a daily basis, but how corporate departments interact with their outside firms. As Wei Zhao, General Counsel of Segway, noted: “I think this technology has the potential to replace a lot of entry-level lawyers and allow far fewer lawyers to get the same amount of work done.”

Generative AI Could Add $4.4 Trillion a Year to the Global Economy, McKinsey Finds



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
June 22, 2023 







There’s been concern about artificial intelligence taking away jobs for years, and with the recent boom in generative AI, those fears have grown. The ability to generate realistic and accurate text, images, or audio based on a prompt could make plenty of jobs obsolete (including, ahem, journalism and writing). But a new study says the doomsday predictions are misguided, because generative AI is far more likely to do just the opposite of canceling out jobs.
Last week, McKinsey published a report called The Economic Potential of Generative AI: The Next Productivity Frontier. It’s the result of a study involving 850 different job roles and 2,100 tasks across occupations in 47 countries. Researchers considered what portion of each existing job or task can be taken over by generative AI, as well as new occupations and responsibilities likely to be created by the technology. Their conclusion? Generative AI has the potential to create up to $4.4 trillion worth of annual value in the global economy.
$4.4 trillion is the high end of a range, with the lower bound sitting at $2.6 trillion. Even if the value created were to fall on the low end, it would still approximate the GDP of the United Kingdom, which was $3.1 trillion in 2021.
How will that happen? Mostly by automating and accelerating work that’s currently done by humans, allowing humans to do more work in the same amount of time. That makes both us and AIs sound like nothing more than workhorses, but here’s an example.
A study released in April detailed how generative AI impacted the work of customer service agents at a software firm. The AI monitored agent interactions with customers in real time and gave them suggestions for what to say. The agents who used the AI resolved 13.8 percent more issues per hour than they’d been able to without it; they got through calls more quickly, resolved more complaints successfully, and could even handle multiple calls at once. The AI also cut down the time managers had to spend training new employees, enabling them to take on bigger teams—and ultimately allowing the company to hire more employees and do more business.
McKinsey’s study found that generative AI and other technologies could automate work activities that currently take up 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time. That’s a complicated projection, though; the report acknowledges that some significant reskilling will be needed, and companies and governments will have to invest in supporting worker transitions and managing the other risks that such a momentous shift will bring. “If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world,” the authors wrote. It’s a pretty big “if,” one deserving several equivalent reports of its own to contemplate exactly how it’s all going to work.
According to the report, generative AI’s value add will be mostly concentrated in four categories of jobs: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development. The customer service example above illustrates the first category; AI can assist with or completely take over customer interactions, and to some extent it’s already done so—when was the last time you got an actual human on the phone after calling a corporate customer service number?
For marketing and sales, AI can generate creative content (like the millions a day being generated by OpenAI’s DALL-E), including content that’s more personalized than what we see today. Software engineers are already using AI to write computer code based on natural-language prompts. In the research and development arena, AI is not only modeling proteins incredibly rapidly, it’s building protein complexes tailored to specific biological responses and helping design artificial protein drugs. It’s no surprise, then, that life sciences is one of the industries predicted to see the most revenue growth from generative AI (along with banking and high-tech).
It seems clear that generative AI is poised to revolutionize the way we work, and eventually even the way we live. But outside of generating economic value, will it generate well-being and a higher quality of life for the average person? Perhaps that’s the question we should really be focusing on.
AI will continue to proliferate and find new applications across various sectors of the economy. For now though, humans are still an essential piece of the equation to complete most tasks—including McKinsey’s generative AI report. While the data for it was retrieved and analyzed by AI, the report itself was written completely by humans.

theGist announced today an AI-powered hub for work applications, helping knowledge workers focus on what’s most important. This unified workspace aims to address two of the biggest challenges for employees at the office: constant context switching and not focusing on the most important, valuable and productive tasks.

The platform offered by theGist forms personalized knowledge graphs, connecting projects, people, and topics. This helps amplify focus and enhance the productivity of knowledge workers by delivering actionable insights and streamlined workflows.

PROMOTED
The announcement today follows the successful launch of theGist for Slack late last year, which currently serves thousands of companies and was one of the first products to demonstrate the need to incorporate AI tools in existing work apps and across apps. The new work hub offered by theGist covers the entire digital workspace of the specific employee, including related items, insights, tasks, daily focus, generative text, summaries, and actions.

Founded in 2022 with the mission of ”You can finally stop sifting through endless conversations and just get theGist of it,” the startup is developing a future-of-work platform that integrates all work applications into a single, cohesive workspace. “Our founding team believes in the popular Da Vinci quote ‘Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,’ says Itzik Ben-Bassat, co-founder and CEO of theGist. “As such, we called the company theGist because our goal is to create radical focus and extreme performance by allowing AI to sort out all the noise and laser focus you on what’s truly important.”

With all the distractions pervading and proliferating in the modern office, focusing on what’s truly important has become extremely difficult. A recent survey found that eight out of 10 workers are suffering from information overload, up from 60% of those surveyed 2 years before. To get the information they need to perform their job, 27% say they must access eleven or more accounts, resources, tools and apps on a daily basis, up from 15% in the previous survey. 47% of workers report that they spend more than one hour of every working day searching for files or specific data to be able to do their job and 42% say the information they need is hard to find as it is scattered across multiple sites, files and apps.

This chaotic information environment at work has a serious negative impact. 76% of respondents say that information overload contributes to their daily stress. Another 35% said this overload is having a detrimental effect on their work performance, with 30% reporting it is affecting their overall job satisfaction.

Without adequate technological solutions, information overload promises to significantly increase in the future, given the rapid growth of information. When IDC analysts reported for the first time the amount of information created and replicated annually, they estimated that 161 exabytes of data were created in 2006. Last year, IDC estimated that 101,000 exabytes were created and projected this amount will more than double in size to 221,000 exabytes in 2026.
In a reversal from past trends, it is enterprises, not consumers, that are now the major contributors to information growth—and information overload. ""The Enterprise DataSphere will grow more than twice as fast as the Consumer DataSphere over the next five years, putting even more pressure on enterprise organizations to manage and protect the world's data while creating opportunities to activate data for business and societal benefits,” said last year John Rydning, research vice president of IDC's Global DataSphere.
The scale of the information overload challenge and the opportunity to increase the usefulness and value of enterprise data has ignited a race to apply generative AI to office applications. In recent months, it has been primarily a competition between Microsoft and Google (otherwise known as the “Satya v. Sundar Show”), but other established players such as Salesforce have joined the fray, emphasizing “trust” as the main necessary ingredient in the success of enterprise-ready generative AI.
Startups such as theGist are also enterprise-ready: “What differentiates theGist and enables our AI models to be accurate is the focus on personalization, which eliminates the hallucination problem of LLMs,” says Ben-Bassat.

The use of artificial intelligence in business is now mainstream, with many organizations using AI as a standalone technology for specialized use cases or embedding it within common enterprise software systems that handle core business processes.







And recent surveys speak to the growing number of companies experimenting with AI. For example, an April 2023 pulse poll of 254 technology leaders by professional services firm EY found that 90% of respondents are exploring AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat. And 80% are planning to increase their investments in AI in the upcoming year.
Executives have indicated to EY researchers and others that they're looking at AI to increase efficiencies, boost productivity, lower costs, create competitive advantages and meet rapidly changing market expectations. They've also credited advances in AI tools for making the technology more accessible to organizations.
Enterprise leaders said data security, process automation and customer care are the top areas where their companies have been applying AI. Natural language processing (NLP) is at the forefront of AI adoption.

However, executives also said their use of AI is moving out from those early areas of adoption and into nearly every part of the enterprise.
Here are 15 top applications of artificial intelligence in the enterprise.

1. AI-enabled innovations, products and services
Although organizations are only beginning to harness the potential of artificial intelligence, some are already using the technology to fuel innovation and create new products and services.
Amazon Alexa and other similar virtual assistants are some of the most well-known examples, but experts said companies across industries are finding ways to incorporate AI into their wares or use AI to develop new offerings.

Seth Earley

As an example, Seth Earley, author of The AI-Powered Enterprise and founder and CEO of Earley Information Science, pointed to a company using AI to improve its telecommunications platform. The organization is also employing machine learning and other AI technologies to improve the quality of the speaker's voice and image and to keep the images of others participating from becoming distorted on screen.
Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, highlighted a retailer that's collaborating with artists to feature their designs on clothing, using AI to develop the art and manufacturing merchandise to order.


2. Automating routine cognitive work
Organizations for years have used AI to automate many manual tasks, such as data entry. Now they're using next-generation intelligence such as generative AI to handle cognitive tasks such as summarizing reports and drafting communications.
""AI is now tackling some of the grind work,"" said Nicholas Napp, a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, noting that this use of AI could affect many jobs. ""Much of our jobs is grind versus special experience, and AI is really good at that grind.""


3. AI for leveling up workers
Even when tasks can't be automated, experts said AI can still aid workers by offering advice and guidance that helps them level up their performance.
Kavita Ganesan, an AI adviser, strategist and founder of consultancy Opinosis Analytics, cited Grammarly and similar services that use AI to not only catch misspellings in text but to correct grammar and offer preferred phrasings to improve a user's writing.
Others noted that generative AI brings even more aid to workers, who with little or no experience can use the tool to write software code, design a logo or craft a marketing strategy.
Such AI applications ""help level up the skills of a more junior person in the company and help them perform at a more senior level, and it helps experts really shine,"" said Mike Mason, chief AI officer at consultancy Thoughtworks. ""It's an enabler that allows people to do things they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do.""


4. AI as a creative force
Artificial intelligence is now capable of creating compositions of all kinds, including visual art, music, poetry and prose, and computer code.
Some have questioned whether AI-generated works are derivative in either the legal or artist sense (or both), as the technology works by analyzing and learning from the data it's given for training. Regardless of the answer, AI is being used by organizations to create a range of works.
Napp, who is also co-founder of Xmark Labs, tested OpenAI with a Moby Dick-inspired query -- ""As Captain Ahab, can you pretend to be a teenage TikTok influencer and tell me about your quest for the whale?"" -- and received an original three-graph narrative in response.
Napp also said he and a math teacher used ChatGPT to create real-world examples of a mathematical concept in action to inspire students, and worked with one of his children to create an adventure for the fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons.



Here are 15 top applications of AI in business, plus industry-specific examples of AI use.







5. Accessing and organizing knowledge via AI
Accessing and organizing knowledge is another area where AI -- in particular, generative AI -- is demonstrating its potential to organizations and their workers.
The technology lets workers not only search through reams of information, such as institutional files or industry-specific data, to find relevant elements, it organizes and summarizes those elements.
Although this application of AI is potentially transformative, Earley warned that the technology isn't reliable enough to use without human oversight or review. AI systems, such as ChatGPT, don't always have all the data sets needed to reach accurate and complete conclusions, he explained, and they often make assumptions that aren't correct.
Case in point: Two lawyers in early 2023 submitted a court brief created using ChatGPT only to find the technology had fabricated some of the cases cited in the legal document.


6. AI for optimization
Optimization is another AI use case, and it's one that stretches across industries and business functions.
AI-based business applications can use algorithms and modeling to turn data into actionable insights on how organizations can optimize a range of functions and business processes -- from worker schedules to production product pricing. AI systems can use data, identify bottlenecks and offer optimized options to implement.
""Organizations can benefit using AI for the automation of repetitive tasks, which reduces manual efforts and increases accuracy,"" said Moe Asgharnia, CIO at accounting and consulting firm BPM.


7. Higher productivity and more efficient operations
Another top reason organizations are adopting AI is to boost productivity and generate more efficiencies, said Sreekar Krishna, U.S. leader of AI at professional services firm KPMG.
He said AI can be plugged into many processes that require human labor and then either fully or partially perform that process --- faster, more accurately and at a higher volume than any human could.


8. More effective learning and training through AI
Many organizations are using or exploring how to use intelligence software to improve how people learn.
Intelligent tools can be used to customize educational plans to each worker's learning needs and understanding levels based on their experience and knowledge. Asgharnia said that lets organizations implement more effective training programs.


9. AI as coach and monitor
In a related application, organizations are deploying AI-powered systems that coach employees as they work. The technology, experts explained, has the capability to monitor and analyze actions in near real time and provide feedback, thereby coaching or guiding workers through the process.
For example, many logistics and transportation companies use systems featuring cameras, eye-tracking technology and other AI algorithms to monitor for distracted driving, alerting workers to the problematic behavior and offering corrective actions.


10. Decision support
A similar application of AI in the enterprise is the use of an intelligent decision support system (DSS). These systems sort and analyze data and, based on that analysis, offer suggestions and guidance to humans as they make decisions.
Doctors, accountants and researchers are among the professionals who use such software, Asgharnia said. As an example, he pointed to a DSS that helps accountants wade through tax laws to identify the most beneficial tax strategies for their clients.


11. AI-enabled quality control and quality assurance
Manufacturers have been using machine vision, a form of AI, for decades. They're now advancing such uses by adding quality control software with deep learning capabilities to improve the speed and accuracy of their quality control functions while keeping costs in check.
These systems deliver a more precise, and ever-improving, quality assurance function, as deep learning models create their own rules to determine what defines quality.


12. AI for personalized customer services, experiences and support
Delivering personalized customer services and experiences is one of the most prevalent enterprise use cases for AI.
""It's using identifiers about customers and consolidating signals from multiple systems to understand who they are, what describes them, [and] what motivates them to create a personalized experience,"" Earley explained .
Although the use of AI for such a purpose is widespread, Earley said companies could be more effective. ""I think personalization isn't being done well today, or not at the level it can be,"" he said.


13. Safer operations
AI is being used by a multitude of industries to improve safety.
Construction companies, utilities, farms, mining interests and other entities working in outside locales or in spacious geographical areas are gathering data from endpoint devices such as cameras, thermometers, motion detectors and weather sensors. Organizations then feed that data into intelligent systems that identify problematic behaviors, dangerous conditions or business opportunities, and make recommendations or even take preventative or corrective actions.
Other industries are making similar use of AI-enabled software applications to monitor safety conditions. For example, manufacturers are using AI software and computer vision to monitor workers' behaviors to ensure they're following safety protocols.
Organizations of all kinds can use AI to process data gathered from on-site IoT ecosystems to monitor facilities or workers. In such cases, the intelligent systems watch for and alert companies to hazardous conditions such as distracted driving in delivery trucks.


14. AI for functional area improvements
The functional areas within the typical enterprise are also putting AI to good use for their own specific needs.

Customer service uses chatbots powered by machine learning algorithms and NLP to understand customer requests and respond both faster and cheaper than human workers can. AI also powers recommendation functions, which use customer data and analytics to suggest products customers are most likely to need or want and therefore buy. Intelligent systems can help employees better serve customers by drawing on analytics, like those used in chatbots and recommendation engines, to give workers suggestions as they tend to customers.
Marketing uses intelligent systems to understand users and their buying patterns, so they can create targeted marketing campaigns with a higher success rate than their generic counterparts. Some organizations are also combining intelligent technologies -- including facial recognition, geospatial software and analytics -- to identify in-store customers and promote products, services or sales that match their personal preferences.
The supply-chain function uses algorithms to forecast what will be needed when and the optimal time to move supplies. In this use case, AI helps business leaders create more efficient, cost-effective supply chains by minimizing and even possibly eliminating overstocking and the risk of running short of in-demand products.
The HR function uses AI-powered systems to help write more interesting and accurate job postings, identify and screen potential candidates, and create personalized training and development programs for employees.
Cybersecurity uses AI to more efficiently and effectively monitor the enterprise IT environment to detect anomalies that could indicate a cyberthreat.
IT can use AI systems to write and document code.
The C-suite and the board can use AI to identify, analyze and rate risk, helping them to create better risk management strategies.



15. AI for addressing industry-specific needs
Although many AI applications span industry sectors, other use cases are specific to individual industry needs. Here are some examples:

Healthcare. The healthcare industry employs artificial intelligence and machine learning products to analyze the vast troves of data collected over recent decades to uncover patterns and insights that humans aren't able to find on their own. Algorithms in diagnostic tools are helping clinicians make more accurate diagnoses earlier in a disease's progression. Other intelligent tools help clinicians develop more individualized treatment plans designed for maximum efficiency for each patient.
Financial services. The financial services sector uses AI and machine learning for fraud detection, digital and data security, and to analyze historical and real-time data to make near-instantaneous decisions about the legitimacy of individual transactions. Financial services firms also use AI for more niche applications, such as wealth management, loan approvals and trading decisions.
Industrial maintenance. The industrial sector uses AI for predictive machine maintenance to identify the most probable time equipment will need service and to optimize the scheduling of maintenance work. AI is also used in factories to increase efficiency.
Transportation. AI is enabling a growing fleet of self-driving vehicles that are becoming smarter as they gain navigation experience. AI is also being used for smarter traffic management operations and transportation logistics.

         — 
    


            Business executives keep talking about it. Teachers are struggling with what to do about it. And artists like Drake seem angry about it. 
    

            Love it or hate it, everyone is paying attention to artificial intelligence right now. Almost overnight, a new crop of AI tools has found its way into products used by billions of people, changing the way we work, shop, create and communicate with each other.
    

            AI advocates tout the technology’s potential to supercharge our productivity, creating a new era of better jobs, better education and better treatments for diseases. AI skeptics have raised concerns about the technology’s potential to disrupt jobs, mislead people and possibly bring about the end of humanity as we know it. Confusingly, some execs in Silicon Valley seem to hold both sets of views at once.

            What’s clear, however, is that AI is not going away, but it is changing very fast. Here’s everything you need to know to keep up.
    

        What is AI? 


            In the public consciousness, “artificial intelligence” may conjure up images of murderous machines eager to overtake humans, and capable of doing so. But in the tech industry, it’s a broad term that refers to different tools that are trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required some input from an actual person.

            If you use the internet, then you almost certainly use services that rely on AI to sort data, filter content and make suggestions, among other tasks. 
    

            It’s the technology that allows Netflix to recommend movies and that helps remove spam, hate speech and other inappropriate content from your social media feeds. It helps power everything from autocorrect features and Google Translate to facial recognition services, the last of which uses AI that, in Microsoft’s words, “mimics a human capability to recognize human faces.”
    

            AI can also be successful in developing techniques for solving a wide range of real world problems, such as adjusting traffic signals in real time to manage congestion issues or helping medical professionals analyze images to make a diagnosis. AI is also central to developing self-driving cars by processing tremendous amounts of visual data so the vehicles can understand their surroundings.
    

        So why is everyone talking about AI now? 


            The short answer: ChatGPT.
    

            For years, AI has largely operated in the background of services we use every day. That changed following the November launch of ChatGPT, a viral chatbot that put the power of AI front and center.
    

            People have already used ChatGPT, a tool created by OpenAI, to draft lawsuits, write song lyrics and create research paper abstracts so good they’ve even fooled some scientists. The tool has even passed standardized exams. And ChatGPT has sparked an intense competition among tech companies to develop and deploy similar tools.

            Microsoft and Google have each introduced features powered by generative AI, the technology underpinning ChatGPT, into their most widely used productivity tools. Meta, Amazon and Alibaba have said they’re working on generative AI tools, too. And numerous other businesses also want in on the action.

            It’s rare to see a cutting-edge technology become so ubiquitous almost overnight. Now businesses, educators and lawmakers are all racing to adapt.
    

        How exactly does generative AI work? 


            Generative AI enables tools to create written work, images and even audio in response to prompts from users.
    

            To get those responses, several Big Tech companies have developed their own large language models trained on vast amounts of online data. The scope and purpose of these data sets can vary. For example, the version of ChatGPT that went public last year was only trained on data up until 2021 (it’s now more up to date). 
    

            These models work through a method called deep learning, which learns patterns and relationships between words, so it can make predictive responses and generate relevant outputs to user prompts.
    

        How is generative AI different from AGI?


            As impressive as some generative AI services may seem, they essentially just do pattern matching. These tools can mimic the writing of others or make predictions about what words might be relevant in their responses based on all the data they’ve previously been trained on.
    

            AGI, on the other hand, promises something more ambitious — and scary.
    

            AGI — short for artificial general intelligence — refers to technology that can perform intelligent tasks such as learning, reasoning and adapting to new situations in the way that humans do. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has teased the possibility of a superintelligent AGI that could go on to change the world or perhaps backfire and end humanity.
    

            For the moment, however, AGI remains purely a hypothetical, so don’t worry too much about it.
    

        How much of the AI gold rush is just hype?


            Anytime there’s an excess of buzz around a technology, it’s good to be skeptical — and there is certainly a lot of that here. Investor fascination with AI has helped push Wall Street back into a bull market, despite lingering economic uncertainty. 
    

            Not all AI tools are equally useful and many companies will certainly tout AI features and strategies simply to tap into the current hype cycle. But even in just the past six months, AI has already shown potential to change how people do numerous everyday tasks.
    

            One of the biggest selling points around AI chatbots, for example, is their ability to make people more productive. Earlier this year, some real estate agents told CNN that ChatGPT saved them hours of work not only by writing listings for homes for sale but also looking up the permitted uses for certain land and calculating what mortgage payments or the return on investment might be for a client, which typically involve formulas and mortgage calculators.
    

            Artificial intelligence is also much broader than ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. Even if you think AI chatbots are annoying or might be a fad, the underlying technology will continue to power meaningful advances in products and services for years to come.
    

        Will it steal my job? 


            The fear is AI will eliminate millions of jobs. The hope is it will help improve how millions do their jobs. The current reality is somewhere in between.
    

            Companies will likely need new workers to help them implement and manage AI tools. Employment of data analysts and scientists, machine learning specialists and cybersecurity experts is forecast to grow 30% on average by 2027, according to one recent estimate from the World Economic Forum.
    

            But the proliferation of AI will also likely put many roles at risk eventually. There could be 26 million fewer record-keeping and administrative jobs by 2027, the WEF predicted. Data entry clerks and executive secretaries are expected to see the steepest losses.
    

            For now, there are clearly limits to how well AI can do the job of a human on its own. After media outlet CNET experimented with using AI to write articles, tech website Futurism uncovered factual errors and in some cases, plagiarism, in various pieces. Likewise, a lawyer in May made headlines for citing false court cases to a judge provided to him by ChatGPT. In an affidavit, the lawyer said he had never used ChatGPT as a legal research tool before and “was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false.”

        Is AI dangerous?


            Top AI executives have warned that AI could potentially bring about human extinction. But these same executives are also racing to deploy the technology into their products. 
    

            Some experts say that focusing on far-off doomsday scenarios may distract from the more immediate harms that AI can cause, such as spreading misinformation, perpetuating biases that exist in training data, and enabling discrimination.
    

            For example, generative AI could be used to create deepfakes to spread propaganda during an election or enable a frightening new era of scams. Some AI models have also been criticized for what the industry calls “hallucinations,” or making up information. 
    

            Even before the rise of ChatGPT, there were concerns about AI acting as a gatekeeper that can determine who does and does not move forward in a hiring process, for example. AI-powered facial recognition systems have also resulted in some wrongful arrests, and research has shown these systems are drastically more prone to error when trying to match the faces of darker skinned people.
    

            The more AI tools are incorporated into core parts of society, the more potential there is for unintended consequences.
    

        Where does AI go from here?


            Regulators in the United States and Europe are pushing for legislation to help put guardrails in place for AI, which could ultimately impact how the technology develops. But it’s unclear if lawmakers can keep pace with the rapid advances in AI. 
    

            Experts believe in the months ahead, generative AI will go on to create even more realistic images, videos, and audio that could further disrupt media, entertainment, tech and other industries. The technology will likely become increasingly conversational and personalized.
    

            In March, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4, the next-generation version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. According to the company and early tests, GPT-4 is able to provide more detailed and accurate written responses, pass academic tests with high marks and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch. (Altman has previously said OpenAI is not yet training GPT-5.) 


            AI will almost certainly be infused into many more products and services in the coming months. That means we’ll all have to learn how to live with it.
    

            As ChatGPT put it in response to a prompt from CNN, “AI has the potential to transform our lives … but it’s crucial for companies and individuals to be mindful of the accompanying risks and responsibly address concerns.”

         — 
    


            More prime working age women are employed in the United States now than ever before. 
    

            The labor force participation rate for women between 25 and 54 years old set a record high in April and then again in May, rebounding from the pandemic “she-cession” and returning to its pre-pandemic form of making progressively historic labor market gains. 
    

            That could all change with AI.

Generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to transform the labor market, exposing the majority of the nation’s jobs to automation, Goldman Sachs economists have projected. The technology can create new content — such as text, images, audio, video, and code — from training data that includes examples of that desired output. 
    

            However, recent research shows that although outnumbered by men in the US workforce, women could be disproportionately affected by businesses’ adoption of generative AI: One recent analysis estimates that 79% of working women (nearly 59 million) are in occupations susceptible to disruption and automation. That’s compared to 58% of working men, according to research from the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School.
    

            Estimates that nearly eight out of 10 women workers could be affected “are just staggering,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. “That said, and I think intuitively many of us appreciate that, it’ll be easier to automate some of these office jobs than it will be to automate carpenter jobs and electrician jobs and pest removal jobs — many of these manual services and production jobs that are far more male-heavy.”

            She added: “I think there are legitimate reasons to be worried that some of the gains that women made could be eroded, at least temporarily.” However, she also noted that “these technologies will also surely create many, many opportunities.”
    

            A higher percentage of working women are employed in white-collar jobs, whereas for men it’s more of a 50-50 split between white- and blue-collar occupations, said Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the AI research. Some of the most AI-exposed occupations with a majority-female employee base are office and administrative support; healthcare practitioners and technical; education, training and library; health care support; and community and social services, according to the UNC Kenan-Flagler research. 
    

            “It’s not always going to relate to ‘I’m losing my job,’” McNeilly told CNN. “I think it’s really a matter of if there’s something that the person can do to add value.”
    

        Pre-pandemic runup


            In the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, women’s labor force participation rates were rising faster than that of their male counterparts, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. 
    

            A confluence of several factors were behind those gains, Pollak said. Notably: Female-dominated industries, such as health care and caregiving, were among the fastest-growing industries; educational attainment for women rose substantially; and women also made greater inroads into traditionally male-dominated fields such as construction, agriculture, and repair and maintenance.

            By February of 2020, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women was 77% — just shy of the record 77.3% set during the dot-com era, BLS data shows.
    

            But by April 2020, that rate plummeted to 73.5% as the pandemic froze the US economy, forcing more than 20 million people out of their jobs. As the nation recovered in the coming months, however, women didn’t return at the same levels as men. 
    

            The pandemic walloped the leisure and hospitality and education and health services sectors, where women make up the majority of the workforce. Additionally, job losses and a lackluster employment recovery in the child care sector hampered workers’ ability to return to the labor market; and since caregiving responsibilities often fall to women, they were held back more as school became home-based.
    

            The tide eventually turned.
    

        A historic bounce back


            Three key drivers for women entering the workforce are access to child care, market wage and flexibility, said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research and membership organization.
    

            And the pandemic recovery kicked those catalysts into hyperdrive.
    

            Jobs, by and large, became less rigid: Telecommuting grew more commonplace, and home-based work allowed for more flexibility in hours. That helped improve access to child care with schedules that allowed for easier drop-offs and pick-ups as well as companies that offered on-site child care. And labor shortages — largely related to the acceleration of ongoing demographic trends of Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, long Covid and health-related concerns — help to lift wages, especially for low-paying jobs. 
    

            “Some of these things are becoming more prevalent, and that’s supportive of more women in the labor market,” she said. 
    

            Additionally, women-centric sectors, such as health care and leisure and hospitality, are continuing to see some of the most robust job gains during the past two years.
    

            “That’s where a lot of the hiring is happening, and that’s also where a lot of the wage increases are happening,” Peterson said. “So, if you have more job openings and higher wages and these are areas that women tend to predominate, then it makes sense that women are going to gravitate toward those sectors and be more willing to work.”
    

            Last month, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-old women set a fresh high of 77.6%, ticking up from the previous record of 77.5% set the month before, according to BLS data.
    

        Along comes AI


            Revelio Labs, which specializes in the collection and analysis of publicly available workforce data, recently identified the most AI-exposed occupations and the gender and ethnicity distributions among them. Revelio’s analysis showed that the AI-exposed positions with the highest percentage of women included bill and account collectors (82.9%), payroll and timekeeping clerks (79.7%), executive secretaries (74.3%), word processors and typists (65.4%) and bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks (65%).
    

            In the most AI-exposed occupations, women make up 71% of employees, said Ben Zweig, Revelio’s chief executive officer.
    

            “Sometimes in the AI conversation, we take a perspective, which I think is a false perspective, that the task composition of a job is static — that a job is a job and it has fixed responsibilities,” said Ben Zweig, chief executive  “But that’s not really the case. Jobs transform all the time.”
    

            AI represents an opportunity and a threat all at once, and it really depends on the industry, Peterson said.

            Generative AI might not have the capacity now to turn a patient over or insert an IV, but it could prove helpful in poring through billions of pieces of imaging data to diagnose a condition. 
    

            On the other hand, AI could prove harmful and threatening for any role that is highly “automatable,” Peterson said. 
    

            “The thing about AI is that it’s not perfect; it’s generating new content from existing content,” she said. “It still needs a human to create some existing content for it to pull from. And whatever it’s generating, it doesn’t mean it’s right — you still need someone to look at it and see if it makes sense.”
    

            For businesses, there are legitimate risks, including ensuring that the applications are used responsibly and potential concerns around bias and ethics are fully understood and addressed, she noted. 
    

            “Over time, it will replace some jobs, but as with every other type of technological advancement that we’ve had, people have always figured out something else to do,” she said. “Yes, it may destroy jobs in the short run, but it also creates new jobs and different opportunities. It helps people to become more productive in their existing jobs.”
    

        ‘Cannot be replaced by a machine’


            At Montana State University, Dr. Sara Mannheimer, who received her Ph.D. in library and information science, is working under a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and leading a team of researchers to explore how AI could be used ethically in libraries and archives. 
    

            “Librarians think a lot about evaluating information and thinking about sources and trustworthy sources,” she said, noting that the data often feeding into AI is from the internet. “ChatGPT uses Reddit data and Wikipedia data and who knows what else, and [those are] known to be predominantly used by, edited by and participated in by men, and mostly white men. So the information that is coming out of [these technologies] is biased, and it’s not always accurate.”

            While the AI project doesn’t specifically address labor market implications, especially for library workers, Mannheimer is cognizant of what this technology could mean for her and others in her field.
    

            “The library cannot be replaced by a machine, there will always be work that a human needs to do,” she said, adding that if AI could handle rote tasks, “I think there’s plenty of work for librarians and library staff to do that requires critical thinking.”
    

            Meredith Nudo, a freelance writer and voice actress based in Houston, is staying sharply aware of the potential disruption from AI to her jobs, specifically the voiceover work.
    

            Voice actors such as Nudo are pushing back on attempts to have AI-created voices replace them. Organizations like the National Association of Voice Actors has developed guidelines and a campaign to educate the industry and supporters around the topic.    
    

            Nudo has a clause in her standard voice work contract stating that her work cannot be used to train AI and is starting to include a similar clause for her writing, especially after being recruited with job opportunities to teach AI to write or edit more effectively.
    

            “It was a really strange, surreal experience to be asked to train what was basically my replacement, and it was like saying you’re not good enough to hire [for] the job that you have experience in and trained for,” she said.
    

            Nudo said she sees the opportunities in working with AI for certain duties, such as note-taking and transcription, which could free up time and space for other tasks that require more legwork, creativity and critical thinking.
    

            “If we didn’t have to worry about meeting our own basic needs, I think we would probably see a lot more people be amenable to the technology,” she said.

The labor force participation rate for women between 25 and 54 years old set a record high in April and then again in May, rebounding from the pandemic “she-cession” and returning to its pre-pandemic form of making progressively historic labor market gains.  That could all change with AI. Generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to transform the labor market, exposing the majority of the nation’s jobs to automation, Goldman Sachs economists have projected. The technology can create new content — such as text, images, audio, video, and code — from training data that includes examples of that desired output.  However, recent research shows that although outnumbered by men in the US workforce, women could be disproportionately affected by businesses’ adoption of generative AI: One recent analysis estimates that 79% of working women (nearly 59 million) are in occupations susceptible to disruption and automation. That’s compared to 58% of working men, according to research from the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. Estimates that nearly eight out of 10 women workers could be affected “are just staggering,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. “That said, and I think intuitively many of us appreciate that, it’ll be easier to automate some of these office jobs than it will be to automate carpenter jobs and electrician jobs and pest removal jobs — many of these manual services and production jobs that are far more male-heavy.”  She added: “I think there are legitimate reasons to be worried that some of the gains that women made could be eroded, at least temporarily.” However, she also noted that “these technologies will also surely create many, many opportunities.” A higher percentage of working women are employed in white-collar jobs, whereas for men it’s more of a 50-50 split between white- and blue-collar occupations, said Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the AI research. Some of the most AI-exposed occupations with a majority-female employee base are office and administrative support; healthcare practitioners and technical; education, training and library; health care support; and community and social services, according to the UNC Kenan-Flagler research.  “It’s not always going to relate to ‘I’m losing my job,’” McNeilly told CNN. “I think it’s really a matter of if there’s something that the person can do to add value.” Pre-pandemic runup In the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, women’s labor force participation rates were rising faster than that of their male counterparts, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.  A confluence of several factors were behind those gains, Pollak said. Notably: Female-dominated industries, such as health care and caregiving, were among the fastest-growing industries; educational attainment for women rose substantially; and women also made greater inroads into traditionally male-dominated fields such as construction, agriculture, and repair and maintenance. By February of 2020, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women was 77% — just shy of the record 77.3% set during the dot-com era, BLS data shows. But by April 2020, that rate plummeted to 73.5% as the pandemic froze the US economy, forcing more than 20 million people out of their jobs. As the nation recovered in the coming months, however, women didn’t return at the same levels as men.  The pandemic walloped the leisure and hospitality and education and health services sectors, where women make up the majority of the workforce. Additionally, job losses and a lackluster employment recovery in the child care sector hampered workers’ ability to return to the labor market; and since caregiving responsibilities often fall to women, they were held back more as school became home-based. The tide eventually turned. A historic bounce back Three key drivers for women entering the workforce are access to child care, market wage and flexibility, said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research and membership organization. And the pandemic recovery kicked those catalysts into hyperdrive. Jobs, by and large, became less rigid: Telecommuting grew more commonplace, and home-based work allowed for more flexibility in hours. That helped improve access to child care with schedules that allowed for easier drop-offs and pick-ups as well as companies that offered on-site child care. And labor shortages — largely related to the acceleration of ongoing demographic trends of Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, long Covid and health-related concerns — help to lift wages, especially for low-paying jobs.  “Some of these things are becoming more prevalent, and that’s supportive of more women in the labor market,” she said.  Additionally, women-centric sectors, such as health care and leisure and hospitality, are continuing to see some of the most robust job gains during the past two years. “That’s where a lot of the hiring is happening, and that’s also where a lot of the wage increases are happening,” Peterson said. “So, if you have more job openings and higher wages and these are areas that women tend to predominate, then it makes sense that women are going to gravitate toward those sectors and be more willing to work.” Last month, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-old women set a fresh high of 77.6%, ticking up from the previous record of 77.5% set the month before, according to BLS data.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is introducing a public working group that seeks to address the challenges and opportunities related to artificial intelligence that can generate text, images, code, videos and other content.
The Public Working Group on Generative AI will help NIST come up with guidance to assist organizations in addressing the risks associated with the technology, the Department of Commerce said Thursday.
“The recently released NIST AI Risk Management Framework can help minimize the potential for harm from generative AI technologies,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
“Building on the framework, this new Public Working Group will help provide essential guidance for those organizations that are developing, deploying, and using generative AI, and who have a responsibility to ensure its trustworthiness,” Raimondo added.
The team will support NIST’s testing and evaluation work related to generative AI, help create the generative AI profile for the NIST AI Risk Management Profile and explore opportunities to ensure that generative AI technologies could be used productively to address challenges related to health, climate change and the environment, among other areas.
Interested stakeholders have until July 9 to sign up for the public working group.

As the co-founder and CEO of Propel PRM, a public relations management (PRM) platform, I have had firsthand the transformative impact of AI-driven technology on the PR industry. Indeed, one of the most exciting developments in the past few months has been the rise of generative AI platforms enabling PR professionals to work more efficiently and more effectively.People in communications are quickly adapting to the use of generative AI, and the technology seems to portend a major shift in how corporate communications will be done going forward.Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?



What does it do?At its core, generative AI enables machine learning algorithms to generate new content based on existing data sets. In PR, this means that AI is used to create first drafts of press releases and pitches and importantly for people in communications, media list building. This is because media list building requires in-depth knowledge of the journalistic landscape to understand who to pitch to, but it also takes up the vast majority of a person in PR's day.Generative AI trained on large language models (LLMs) can automate these core communications tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data and information from across the internet within seconds, identifying patterns and trends that human comms professionals might miss. By being able to tell people in PR, with near pin-point accuracy, how they will be able to create the most impact for their organizations, using these generative AI tools ultimately leads to more effective and targeted PR campaigns.


How is it used today?The datasets being leveraged to enable generative AI to alleviate the work of PR pros varies depending on the needs of the PR campaign. For example, AI might analyze social media data to identify trending topics and create tailored content, look through previous articles to understand what a journalist is most likely to write about and whether they would be a good fit for a particular media list, find similar journalists who would be interested in receiving a particular pitch or press release, or simply look at data from successful pitches to understand the most effective way to structure a pitch for maximum effect.Of course, as with any new technology, there are concerns about how these algorithms will change the PR industry. One is that AI-generated content might lack the creativity and nuance of content created by humans, make mistakes, or create inappropriate or offensive content. While these are valid concerns, they can be mitigated by ensuring that AI models are trained adequately on good datasets and, most importantly, that the results are curated and edited by living, breathing human PR professionals.Related: How to Leverage Artificial Intelligence in Public RelationsPeople have the powerOne of the best ways to work with AI and ensure that the communications professional gets the best results is by treating any created outputs as a first draft. Anyone using this technology must understand the risks of using it and therefore needs to edit any output they receive from an AI-powered generator. And yet, despite this need for editing, I've found that AI can still get 70% of the legwork done when it comes to creating content. However, that remaining human-driven 30% really turns a good first draft into a strong, compelling final product.


Another worry is that AI might replace human PR professionals altogether. While it's true that technology can automate many of the more mundane tasks in communications, humans will always be required for the strategic work and relationship-building inherent to the job. Therefore, I believe that human expertise and intuition will always be essential in the PR industry, but AI will enable PR professionals to work more efficiently and effectively.Of course, AI models will become more sophisticated and better at analyzing complex data sets as development continues, and they will be able to generate more targeted, nuanced and effective content in achieving PR goals. At the same time, human PR professionals will continue to play the critical role of crafting the messaging and strategy, building relationships and providing strategic guidance.Ultimately, the successful integration of generative AI into the average PR professional's workflow will depend heavily on the collaboration and partnership between human communications professionals and AI algorithms. Only by working together can PR people leverage AI's power to achieve their goals while ensuring that the content they create is ethical, practical, and aligned with their values and objectives. I'm excited about the opportunities that generative AI presents, and I believe that by embracing this technology, we can create more successful PR campaigns that benefit our clients and society.

AI and the Workplace: Employment Considerations

June 2023

Skadden Insights – June 2023

David E. Schwartz
Annie Villanueva Jeffers
Emily D. Safko
























Key Points

As employers and employees are increasingly using AI in the workplace, government regulation is playing catch-up. 
Existing EEO laws place some guardrails on an employer’s use of AI for traditional human resources tasks, and Illinois and New York City have enacted laws specifically regulating the use of AI in employment decisions. 
Employers should monitor for updates and mitigate risks when using AI systems. That may entail training HR and other staff and, in some cases, commissioning audits of the impact of the systems.




The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is growing exponentially. Companies are looking to harness AI to improve productivity and efficiency as AI’s capabilities continue to expand. In doing so, employers should be mindful of the evolving legal landscape surrounding the use of AI, including existing employment-related laws. 


Artificial Intelligence

AI generally refers to a computer performing tasks historically done by a human. Generative AI refers to AI algorithms that create new content based on existing data. AI generally draws on existing data and practices that are used to train the technology. (See our Spring 2023 The Informed Board article “What Is Generative AI and How Does It Work?”)

In the workplace, AI can be used for many functions, including recruiting and hiring. It can streamline these processes by, for example, preparing job descriptions and analyzing internal employer data to best predict which applicants would be most successful at the company. AI systems can be used to analyze productivity, measure individual performance and select candidates for promotion. 

AI proponents argue that AI reduces or eliminates human bias in screening and evaluating applicants and employees. However, because AI technologies generally draw on existing data and practices, some argue that use of AI for these functions may perpetuate any existing discriminatory practices. 

In addition to human resources functions, employees are also using chatbots to augment their work. For example, employees can outsource time-consuming tasks such as drafting an email, writing code or doing research to an AI chatbot. AI proponents believe it will revolutionize the workforce and reduce — if not eliminate — the need for humans to perform certain tasks. But information provided by chatbots may be incorrect or outdated because chatbots survey and pull from troves of publicly available information, which may themselves be incorrect or outdated. 

Chatbots also “hallucinate” or make things up. There are also privacy concerns associated with use of AI, as information (which may include confidential or proprietary information) entered into a company’s AI system might be inadvertently disclosed in the output given to a third party or, if such information is submitted in a query to a chatbot, it might be incorporated into the chatbot’s database and revealed in a subsequent response to an unrelated party’s query. 


Existing Guardrails

An employer’s use of AI must comply with existing employment laws, including the following that prohibit discrimination: 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) — on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. 
Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) — against individuals with disabilities. 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act — against applicants and employees who are 40 years of age or older. 
Similar state and local laws. 


Both federal and state laws prohibit disparate treatment discrimination in the workplace (i.e., intentional discrimination of members of a protected class) and disparate impact discrimination (i.e., facially neutral practices or policies that may disproportionately affect members of a protected class). 

To the extent an employer uses AI in connection with recruitment, hiring and promotion, there is a risk that the employer may run afoul of applicable anti-discrimination laws. For example, if the AI model bases hiring decisions on criteria such as ratings, pay and titles that skew in favor of white or male applicants, the AI system may screen for applicants meeting those characteristics. 

There is also a risk that AI may make inferences based on an applicant’s religion, age, sexuality, genetic information or disability status learned from either the internet, social media or the applicant’s resume or interview. Though AI may not intentionally screen out or favor certain protected classes, AI’s choice could cause a discriminatory impact. 

In the event that use of AI results in employee layoffs, employers should also ensure that they are mindful of anti-discrimination laws when selecting those who will be separated from employment. They must also pay close attention to the requirements of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification and equivalent state and local laws, which govern notice obligations in connection with plant closings and mass layoffs. 

Additionally, to the extent employers use AI in robotic systems or other machinery, they should be sure to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act and equivalent state laws and regulations, which require that employers provide a workplace free from recognized hazards. 


New AI Legislation and Guidance

Increasingly, federal, state and local governments have considered legislation to supplement existing employment laws and taken other steps in response to the rapid increase in use of AI in connection with employment. 


Federal Laws and Action

Although no comprehensive federal legislation has passed, there are several bills in Congress addressing different aspects of AI. For example, the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022 bill directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to require entities to conduct impact assessments for bias, effectiveness and other factors when using automated decision systems to make critical decisions. 

Additionally, the White House has released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and an AI Risk Management Framework, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order related to bias and discrimination with respect to the use of AI. (For more on the AI Risk Management Framework, see our May 18, 2023, client alert.) 

On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued technical guidance addressing the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under the ADA. The guidance outlines several ways that utilizing AI tools can violate the ADA, including, for example, using AI to evaluate video interviews without providing notice and the opportunity for applicants to request a reasonable accommodation, in light of the potential for AI to negatively evaluate a candidate with a speech disorder. 

On May 18, 2023, the EEOC issued technical guidance addressing the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under Title VII. The guidance outlines how an employer’s use of AI tools can violate Title VII under a disparate impact analysis. It recommends that employers consider, among other things, whether the software has been evaluated to ensure it does not result in substantially lower selection rates for individuals with protected characteristics. 


State and Local Laws

At the state level, Illinois enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2022, which imposes certain requirements on employers that analyze video interviews with AI. Many other states, including California, New Jersey, New York, Vermont and Washington, D.C., have proposed or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate AI use in hiring and promotion. 

At the local level, New York City Local Law 144, which sets forth limitations and requirements for employers using automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to screen candidates for hire or promotion, will be enforceable as of July 5, 2023. 

The law prohibits use of AEDTs unless the tool has been the subject of an independent bias audit within the past year. Employers and employment agencies are also required to make public on their websites the date and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit and the AEDT’s distribution date. 
In addition, employers and employment agencies must provide a notice of the use of AEDTs to employees and candidates for employment who reside in New York City. The notice must include instructions for requesting an alternative selection process or reasonable accommodation under other laws. 


Employers in violation will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $500 for a first-time violation and between $500 and $1,500 for successive violations. 


Best Practices

Against this backdrop, employers should consider implementing policies and procedures governing employees’ use of AI at work. When using AI technologies for hiring, screening and promotion, employers should consider auditing the technology to ensure selection rates do not violate anti-discrimination laws, to the extent employers are not otherwise required by applicable law to conduct audits. 

Employers should also consider clearly informing applicants about the type of technology that will be used and the information it is measuring. Training staff regarding their use of — and potential discriminatory issues associated with — AI tools and the need to verify the accuracy of any AI-generated content is also advisable.

A recent  Goldman Sachs  report showed that the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in the US and Europe being at risk of automation because of the disruptive technology. However, the impact on jobs may not be at all equal. As some jobs are more easily automated than others, and taking into consideration gender distribution in the job market, women may bear the biggest losses due to generative AI, according to new  research . “You\'ve got in the men\'s part, this 50-50 split between white collar and blue collar jobs. But in the women\'s part, you\'ve got 70 per cent are in white collar, 30 per cent in blue collar,” Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the research, told Euronews Next. “And so, just from that simple fact that there\'s more women in this space that\'s affected - which is cognitive jobs - then more women are impacted,” he added. Despite men outnumbering women in the workforce, the research shows that generative AI is expected to put more women at risk of losing their jobs than men. This is because 79 per cent of working women are employed in occupations susceptible to AI disruption and automation. ""It\'s nothing inherent necessarily in generative AI; it also tends to be a function of the types of jobs that women might be in,"" McNeilly told Euronews Next. ""But there\'s a lot of office positions that might be significantly impacted as well. Those are generally across a lot of different industries. So, office administrative support occupations, about 70 per cent of those are filled by women. That\'s going to be one that\'s going to be hit pretty significantly and it\'s also a sizeable population of jobs,"" he added. Other industries where jobs are occupied mostly by women that are expected to be impacted by the adoption of AI include healthcare (76 per cent) and education (73 per cent) and community and social services (67 per cent). How to adapt to the emergence of AI in the job market While generative AI has the potential to suppress or partially automate various jobs, it also offers huge opportunities for job creation. Historically, when machines were used to replace human workers for higher productivity and less cost, there was an emergence of new jobs that didn’t exist before. Moreover, AI can also be helpful in industries thanks to the technology’s ability to automate boring repetitive tasks of different jobs that are not susceptible to displacement and full automation. ""If you take healthcare professionals, for example, which, as we talked about, over 70 per cent of the people in there are women. You might have generative AI where it can answer questions from patients, it can help give advice to healthcare professionals on diagnoses and in prescriptive approaches,"" McNeilly said. ""By doing that and helping the patient answer questions on their own, it might free up more time for that healthcare professional to spend more time with that patient"". ""And we have a shortage of healthcare professionals. And so those folks should actually see perhaps more meaning in their jobs and would not be, you know, laid off or lose value in their jobs"". In the era of AI, effectively navigating the job market demands a shift in mindset regarding the essential skills required for task completion. Using all the knowledge acquired by being exposed to AI, workers should strive to ""pick it up, adopt it, learn how to use it well, and then set themselves apart,"" McNeilly argues.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds much promise for Japan, with the Japanese Government’s AI Strategic Council recognising the country’s high degree of affinity with generative AI, partly due to its high levels of research and technology, and the potential that generative AI holds to address issues such as the decline in the working age population and need for digitalisation. Recently, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) released its AI White Paper recognising the need to formulate a new national strategy for AI which acknowledges this growing evolution and social implementation of large-scale language AI models where a new era of AI is envisioned.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock JPY 148.7 trillion (USD 1.1 trillion) of productive capacity in Japan, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022.2 Japan has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

The real risk of generative AI is a crisis of knowledge
Universities are often focusing on new technologies’ impact on assessment, but for Joshua Thorpe there are more fundamental questions about how these tools will affect students’ identities as learners

I’m a little worried about how artificial intelligence might affect students’ motivation, sense of identity, and intuition around knowledge production and consumption.
A lot of us in higher education are thinking about using AI tools creatively, perhaps even embracing them. This is ultimately probably the right thing to do. But it’s going to be difficult to do right, especially if we rush.
The problem of fewer problems
Students already have access to tools that can write for them, improve their writing, perform literature searches, summarise arguments, provide basic critical analysis, create slide decks, and take the role of a tutor. With the right subscription, you can even get a bot to go online to try to accomplish long lists of automated tasks to achieve all manner of projects.
So these tools suddenly make it really easy to do all kinds of things, very quickly, that used to be hard and slow. Many of these things used to be essential to the intrinsic value of university work – planning, decision-making, struggling, searching, assessing sources, grappling with difficult texts, and learning to accept the discomfort of uncertainty.
AI tools remove problems. But some of the problems they remove are useful to have and to solve as a human. Students will find it really difficult to distinguish between what problems are good to solve quickly with AI, and which problems are more valuable to solve themselves.
And society is entering a whirlwind of new possibilities regarding what is and is not legitimate knowledge or legitimate knowledge work. Students will, for some time, I think, be very confused about what’s okay, what’s worth doing, and what their individual role is within the nuanced ecosystem of consuming and producing knowledge. What’s my role in this education thing anyway? Where’s the intrinsic value of learning? What am I aiming for, and will that be the same in two years?
Students have already been trained by our system to think instrumentally or extrinsically about the outcomes of their work. Many focus on getting the essay done, achieving the passing grade, obtaining the piece of paper. It often seems more difficult for students to see the intrinsic value, the self-transformative value that comes from wrestling with difficult tasks and processes. AI tools will exacerbate this conflict. We may, for a time, lose any clarity at all around what’s exciting and what’s important in university. A kind of built-in nihilism of knowledge work.
Through a scanner, darkly
In the broader information environment, there will be a steep rise of deepfakes, scams, pranks, political mischief and spammy internet content. It will become, in the next couple of years, quite difficult to know what’s real and what’s not. Especially in the absence of regulation.
Students, both in their private lives and in their university work, will find it increasingly difficult to know what to trust and what not to. Assessing and reassessing information could become a nearly constant activity. In this environment there’s a risk of exhaustion.
With all of these forces at work, then, it’s important to recognise that student energy, motivation, even identity could be at risk. Again: why am I doing this? What’s important in all this? What is my role?
So before we in higher education rush to integrate AI tools into the classroom, rush to have fun with ChatGPT and all the rest, and risk inadvertently accelerating or elevating these harms, can we resolve to proceed with caution?
Criticality and caution
Universities, at a governance, planning, and policy level, can aim to redouble values and aims for humane and people-centric cultures. This will mean a deep and serious reconsideration of budgets, allocation of resources, spaces, and teaching philosophy. Now more than ever it will be important to increase the ratio of teachers to students.
We must be crystal clear on what’s allowed. That needs to come from the university, but we can also do that in faculties and in individual courses and modules. What is the code of conduct? This will probably have to be reassessed frequently.
We should be crystal clear on what’s assessed. So, whereas a year ago we might have assessed clarity and correctness of language, for example, it no longer seems that that would be fair. It would benefit students using AI tools at the expense of those not using such tools.
We should also resist the urge to require the use of AI tools and we should try not to advantage those who do. Students who cannot afford to, or who do not wish to, use these tools should not be discriminated against. It will be quite difficult to design assessments so as not to create inequities of accessibility, but this is the right aim to have.
Perhaps most importantly, we should teach criticality and caution around AI, and acknowledge the complexity of the present moment. Talk with students about the confusion, the ethics, and the potential harms.
And finally, we should reintroduce humanity and physicality into learning and teaching wherever possible. Devise ways to let students unplug and interact with the real world, with the physical environment and with each other. Design digital interactions to minimise clicks and tabs and constant surfing and non-stop switching from platform to platform and app to app.
In other words, let’s leverage the embedded criticality in our higher education culture to promote a more humane world, even in the flood of new technologies that challenge equality, humanity, identity, knowledge, and the future of learning.

Probably the best thing I have read so far about AI in HE; an extremely valuable perspective. That an argument for refocussing on the human purposes of education feels like such a novelty is quite an indictment of the direction things have been taking for some time.

As many colleagues in HE are, I am struggling to make sense of AI and how we need to move forward. I agree with Sarah: this is the best article I have read on the subject for a while – it eloquently echoes my discomfort around the numerous communications, webinars, etc in HE which seem to be advocating ’embracing’ AI instead of pausing, remembering our values and offering students an alternative to the fast and often superficial world of technology – a space to think, explore, compare, create.
I have often felt over the years that in education, some technology has been adopted without a great deal of thought. Of course, some tools do help and we all use them, but this recent development is in a different league and requires careful consideration.

Surely universities should be providing AI tools to students as they do other learning resources to avoid issues of who has access and who does not.

Thank you, Joshua.
This really struck a chord with me (does that mean I like what you say because you write what I think I might have been already thinking….?). Anyhow – this is the bit that stood out to me: “AI tools remove problems. But some of the problems they remove are useful to have and to solve as a human.” I also like that you open with “I’m a little worried”. I’m a learning developer, too, and I’m often a little worried. I worry that learning development is often asked to simplify, boil down, make swallowable that which is hard, thorny, unpindownable….
I see my role as revealing and celebrating complexity. It’s about making space and taking time. It’s about process as well as product. For me, learning is about being human and being authentic. Computer-generated and artificial worry me. Fast and simple worries me.

Please try again later.(Simoul Alva for The Washington Post)By  Danielle AbrilJune 28, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDTIt’s not a hallucination. The youngest generation entering the workforce may be the most prepared to champion and use generative artificial intelligence at work.For months, many of these up-and-comers have been exploring the technology’s capabilities, sharpening their skills and learning how to best apply it to their tasks. And while some are cautious about AI’s potential harms, many are more fascinated with than worried about the technology.“I’m really excited about AI and what it can do,” said Naomi Davis, a May graduate of business administration from Georgia Institute of Technology, who uses AI to help her clearly express her ideas in writing. “I used it every week [of my last semester], or at least played around with it.”Generative AI is making a big splash as it gets integrated into such workplace tools as email providers, graphics editors, productivity tools and coding programs. Despite some industry leaders, including AI creators, warning about doomsday scenarios in which the tech takes over humanity, hundreds of thousands of Gen Z students — those born between 1997 and 2012 — have experimented with it, and in some cases, even been encouraged by their schools to explore it. Now as new hires, Gen Z is bringing its AI chops to work, expediting more usage in the future. And young adults are more likely to use AI compared with older counterparts at work, a recent Pew Research Center survey suggests.Tell us what's happening at your workplace.Gen Z made up more than 13 percent of the civilian labor force last year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that number is only expected to grow as the youngest of Gen Z, also known as Zoomers, are still several years from joining the workforce.Since they were tykes, Zoomers have been exposed to digital devices and services — the oldest of the bunch were about a year old when Google launched. As a result, they tend to be open to exploring new technologies, said Shaun Pichler, professor of management at the College of Business and Economics at California State University at Fullerton.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“They’re the first digital-native generation,” he said, adding that many of the students grew up communicating digitally through text and social media. “They’re used to using tech day in and day out.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowZoomers have relied on the chatbot ChatGPT, from OpenAI, to help write cover letters, edit essays, formulate or clarify ideas, check code and even help with their finances. And some universities make generative AI part of their curriculum rather than banning it because of a fear of cheating.That was the case for students who took Kyle Jensen’s writing class at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University last semester. Jensen, also the director of writing programs, said he had been exploring generative AI before ChatGPT debuted in November. For his class, Jenson wanted to educate his students and learn how they feel about and might use the tech.Skip to end of carouselWork: ReimaginedWith attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.Read more.End of carousel“I thought this was an opportunity to teach AI literacy,” he said. “Let’s use this opportunity to think about different ways of applying AI and where it might be headed in the future.”The course, which 14 students took over 16 weeks, covered the history of artificial intelligence and gave students access to generative AI tools. Jensen then wanted students to discuss how they used the tools as well as their benefits and limits.Ximena Vasquez Bueno, a 22-year-old writing major, said she used generative AI to edit some of her essays. The AI sometimes misinterpreted a long-winded sentence, which helped her realize where she could’ve been clearer and more concise. It corrected tense errors she missed, as Spanish is her first language, and showed her what she brings to the table.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It helped me identify my voice as a writer better and how it differs from the AI,” said Vasquez Bueno, a former computer science major who is considering a user-experience writing career when she graduates next year. “I feel more comfortable using it for future projects.”AI is also serving as a research resource for Zoomers. Cortez Hill, a business and theater major who expects to graduate from the University of Michigan next year, said he used generative AI to understand complex investment concepts by asking for terms a 5-year-old would understand and finding sources he could use for a paper.“It is scary how it’s evolving into our world, but I’m open to leaning into that discomfort,” he said. “Our world is just shifting.”But the tech isn’t just helping Zoomers with writing prose. Daniel Osorno Villamil, a May computer science graduate from Georgia Tech, said he has used ChatGPT to double-check his math and review code. He once fed it 300 lines of code and asked it to find the problem, which it did. Generative AI also has helped him with his finances, finding areas in which to reduce costs, he said. He said he’s excited to see how he can leverage it at his new software engineering job at Microsoft in the fall.“Having something like that to do the boilerplate code and give me time to figure out actual problems — the prospect of that is exciting,” he said. “I’ve always really loved technology, so it’s more exciting than it is concerning.”While some coders have worried about being replaced by AI, Edith Llontop, who graduated in May with a degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley, said she expects to work alongside it rather than be displaced by it.“The coding can be left to generative models, but a lot of the creative process that is a part of a software developer’s job likely won’t,” she said. “We don’t code blindly … it’s about what can you bring to the table to advance the science.”Davis, the Georgia Tech graduate, says her experience shows that the tech is only as good as the human driving it. The 21-year-old, who will join Google in August, has used it for idea generation and fleshing out and clarifying her thoughts. But even then, she has to check or edit everything. She once had a chatbot write code but realized after reviewing it that the result was pretty basic.“I really calmed down after that,” she said. “I realized you still need to put in your brain power to make it look good.”But the explosion of AI has changed some young people’s paths. Rona Wang, who recently graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in math and computer science, turned down a tech job she thinks could be subject to automation. Instead, she opted to pursue a master’s degree in programming that is closer to the hardware.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Absolutely it’s about staying ahead of the curve,” she said. “A good rule of thumb is looking for jobs and skills that require [judgment] or research in some way.”Zoomers aren’t ignoring possible harms, despite their excitement. Some say they are worried about the implications of AI, including its ability to spread misinformation, make people lazy to learn, raise the bar for entry-level jobs and become a way for employers to cut costs — even if it means lowering the quality of work.Andrew Otchere, who got his acting degree from the University of Michigan, said the writers strike in Hollywood made him feel conflicted. He sees value in using AI for character development research but also worries that companies could use it for production or creative writing and other areas he’s hoping to pursue.“I just really am worried we may fall into the habit of becoming too reliant on AI, valuing profits over people,” he said. “That’s really scary because [creativity is] one of my strongest assets.”But AI’s artistic abilities aren’t that impressive yet, at least not in music, said Michigan arts graduate Nolan Ehlers, who just completed his master’s in percussion and chamber music. He has watched some of his peers experiment with how it can be used to generate music. But having used it himself for cover letters, he says, it might be more suited for administrative tasks.“Whether you like it or not, it’s here,” he said. “So you might as well learn how to use it now and get all the benefits. It won’t do us much good to nervously avoid it.”For many Zoomers, AI is mostly seen a new technology to help save time and build new skills.“I don’t feel like this is a phase,” said Mashal Imtiaz, a Berkeley graduate and new Microsoft software engineer, adding that she’s comfortable with the tech but hasn’t yet used it at work. “This is one of those things that will be used and only more and more … and it’s just going to become part of our daily lives.”Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already long impacted our lives, but recent developments in the technology have created a frenzy around its possibilities and risks. While some are excited about saving time and money with new AI technologies, others are sceptical and would much rather proceed with caution.
 
The most common ways AI is used in 2023 are to respond to people via text or email, answer financial questions, plan a travel itinerary, craft an email, prepare for a job interview, write a social media post, and summarise complex or lengthy copy. We want to know how charity professionals think these, and other, uses will impact upon the crucial work of charities.
 
In this episode, Charity Digital Content Writer Laura Stanley (she/her) speaks to CEO Jonathan Chevallier (he/him),  Transformation Manager Kiki Tetley (they/them), and Content Editor Ioan Marc Jones (he/him) to learn more about the different perspectives of AI in the charity sector, how it’s already impacting the ways we are working, and how it could impact charity work in the future.

Generative artificial intelligence may be able to pass the bar exam or help CEOs write speeches. But those results have been generated in a controlled setting, and with relatively little at stake.
In the real world, enterprises face the age-old question of technology innovation: How will generative AI affect workers, particularly those with limited experience?

According to a new paper by MIT Sloan associate professor Danielle Li, MIT Sloan PhD candidate Lindsey Raymond, and Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson, PhD ’91, inexperienced workers actually stand to benefit the most from generative AI.
The co-authors found that contact center agents with access to a conversational assistant saw a 14% boost in productivity, with the largest gains impacting new or low-skilled workers. In other words, the workers were upskilled, not replaced, thanks to the technology.
“Generative AI seems to be able to decrease inequality in productivity, helping lower-skilled workers significantly but with little effect on high-skilled workers,” Li said. “Without access to an AI tool, less-experienced workers would slowly get better at their jobs. Now they can get better faster.”
A different kind of disruption
Generative AI is the latest in a line of technologies to disrupt the workplace. Computers that can complete data entry, bookkeeping, and basic assembly-line tasks have been replacing or augmenting workers for decades. More recently, computerization has streamlined research and analysis, helping workers do more in less time.
Many of these technologies work when provided with explicit instructions, Li said: If you provide the right input, the computer will give you the right output. The subset of generative AI known as large language models is different, though, as it can infer the relationships between the inputs and outputs. (“Language” is a bit of a misnomer, as models can also analyze audio and visual files, computer code, protein sequences, and many other data sources.)
“If you give a large language model enough pictures of your mother and pictures of women who aren’t your mother, it will be able to figure out whether a single picture is your mother,” Li said. “What’s the impact of a technology that can do that?”
Room for improvement in the contact center
To study the impact of large language models, the researchers looked at a customer contact center at a Fortune 500 company that sells software to small businesses in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of the agents were based outside the U.S.





14%


Share
























Contact center agents with access to an AI assistant were 14% more productive, with low-skilled workers improving the most. 
Average contact centers have much room for improvement, the researchers write. Supervisors can spend up to 20 hours each week training low performers. Improvement comes from experience, which often means dealing with stressed-out customers. This can lead to employee burnout and extraordinarily high turnover; annually, up to 60% of contact center workers leave, and companies spend as much as $20,000 to replace each employee.
“Highly skilled workers are good at reading customers’ frustration — and that can take getting yelled at for six months,” Li said.
An abundance of data is another reason contact centers are a good testing ground for generative AI. As anyone who has called a helpline knows, conversations between agents and customers are routinely recorded for quality assurance purposes.
That gives generative AI models access to a large training data set, which can be used to provide agents with recommended responses to common customer questions or links to relevant product documentation.
Li and her co-authors emphasized that the generative AI model was meant to augment and not outright replace the contact center employees. The model offered recommendations only if it was “sufficiently confident” in its answers, which reduced the number of incorrect responses. In addition, workers weren’t required to use the recommendations. They followed them 38% of the time, which is consistent with the industry average for generative AI tools, Li said.
Gains in efficiency and customer sentiment
Workers using the generative AI model increased the number of customer chats resolved per hour by 13.8%, the researchers found. Within two months, they were resolving 2.5 chats per hour, compared with 1.7 for colleagues not using the model, who needed eight months to hit the higher threshold. In addition, workers using the AI model spent an average of 35 minutes on each chat, compared with 40 minutes for their colleagues who lacked a model. (These figures also account for the fact that workers often manage more than one chat at once.)
As noted, productivity gains were highest among workers with the least experience, who resolved 35% more chats per hour when they used the generative model. Productivity was essentially flat for workers with the most skills and experience.
Using the generative AI model also led to improved customer sentiment. Requests to speak to a manager declined by 25%, and transfers to other departments tended to happen earlier in the conversation, which suggests that the AI model was able to help workers better match a customer’s problem to the right business unit for a solution.
“The large effects on the lower-skilled workers tell us a lot about how we’re changing what workers are saying,” Li said. “It’s not just a recommendation that they always follow. It’s not just auto-complete. It seems that the model was changing [how they responded], leaving the customer thinking the situation has been resolved.”
Important findings, uncertain implications 
The paper’s findings show a clear benefit to using generative AI in the context of the contact center. They also raise a lot of questions, Li said.

The hidden work created by artificial intelligence programs


First, it isn’t clear who benefits from the productivity gains. Are contact center agents paid more when their performance improves, or do the developers of the AI model get a bonus? If workers can resolve more chats per hour, does a company hire fewer agents? Will contact center volumes increase as customers begin to realize the experience is better than it used to be?
It’s also worth exploring whether workers are learning from the AI model’s recommendations or simply following instructions. Are they becoming what Li described as a “small business owner whisperer,” learning how to diagnose customers’ specific problems? Or are they more like programmers copying code snippets from GitHub or drivers getting to their destination faster using Waze — using the provided recommendations to augment their work without thinking about how to solve the larger problem.
“If you’re just typing the recommendations, then you may not necessarily be learning. You’re more productive, but the source of your productivity resides in the technology,” Li said.
On the other hand, if companies take the time to teach workers how the technology can augment what they do, “workers start to learn faster, “ Li said. “And being faster at learning is going to make a big difference.”

AI continues to dominate thinking in 2023 and is often – as is the way of the world these days – couched in apocalyptic terms. At the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity last week, discussion of AI was everywhere – featuring in numerous talks on the official programme for delegates, but also in ‘fringe’ events taking place across the city. The backdrop to all this was a sinister-sounding new report from Forrester that dropped the week before and prophesied that “advertising agencies in the US will automate 7.5% of jobs by 2030”.
The prospect of so many jobs being replaced by machines undoubtedly conjures up fear, alongside a sense of inadequacy and worthlessness. But in the wider discussions and debates, some more optimistic and nuanced positions emerged, along with the prospect that AI might improve rather than decimate our creative lives.
This was expressed in two very different talks – one on the main stage at the festival, which saw OpenAI’s COO Brad Lightcap in conversation with Margaret Johnson, CCO and partner at ad agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners; the other in a storefront in the city hosted by Wieden+Kennedy ad agency, which saw a much smaller crowd take in the thoughts of Nilesh Ashra, CEO of OK Tomorrow. Here’s what they had to say.

Automation fears have long haunted the future of work. Generative AI is now the latest technology to inspire fear and optimism.
AI will augment jobs in the future. But the argument could be made that job augmentation for some means job replacement for others. For example, if a worker's job is made 10 times easier, the positions created to support that job might become unnecessary.







A June 2023 McKinsey report stated that generative AI (GenAI) would automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads.
AI is already replacing jobs, responsible for nearly 4,000 cuts made in May 2023, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. OpenAI -- the company that created ChatGPT -- estimated 80% of the U.S. workforce would have at least 10% of their jobs affected by large language models (LLMs).

Examples of AI job replacement
One recent case of AI job replacement came when a writer at a tech startup was let go without explanation, but later found references to her as ""Olivia/ChatGPT"" on the work Slack channel. She also found communications from her managers about how ChatGPT was cheaper than using a writer. So, while there was no official explanation for the job loss, the signs pointed to AI.
The Writers Guild of America also went on strike, saying they wanted more regulation of AI in addition to higher wages and more residuals from streaming platforms.

GenAI might also disproportionately affect the jobs of women, according to a recent study from the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. Approximately 79% of working women have positions that are susceptible to automation versus 58% of working men.
In past automation-fueled labor fears, machines would automate tedious, repetitive work. GenAI is different in that it automates creative tasks such as writing, coding and even music making. For example, musician Paul McCartney used AI to partially generate his late bandmate John Lennon's voice to create a posthumous Beatles song. In this case, mimicking a voice worked to the musician's benefit, but that might not always be the case.


Other ways AI could affect jobs
Job replacement isn't the only effect AI could have on work. The positive angle is human-machine cooperation. AI will help people improve their work experience by automating rote, repetitive tasks. The technology will maximize the ""goods"" of work while minimizing the ""bads."" This may contribute to a surge in AI jobs and increased demand for AI skills.
AI needs a lot of human feedback. For example, LLMs train using a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback where people fine tune models by repeatedly ranking outputs from best to worst. A May 2023 paper also describes the phenomenon of model collapse, which states that LLMs malfunction without a connection to human-produced data sets.
There's also a another angle -- that workers will collaborate with AI, but it will stunt their productivity. For example, a generative AI chatbot might create an overabundance of low-quality content. Editors would then need to write additional content to flesh out the articles, pushing the search for unique sources of information lower on their list of priorities.


Jobs most affected by AI
Writing is just one example of a job being automated by the latest AI systems, but there are many job types that could be affected in various ways, including the following:
Administrative
GenAI tools can help office administrators and assistants with tasks such as basic email correspondence, identifying data trends, finding mutually available meeting times across time zones and other summary/synthesis exercises.
For example, Microsoft 365 Copilot -- a collection of AI-powered tools integrated into Microsoft's productivity suite -- could radically increase office workers' productivity.
Coding
Programs such as ChatGPT can write fluent, syntactically correct code faster than most humans, so coders who are primarily valued for producing high volumes of low-quality code quickly might be concerned. Coders who produce a quality product might have nothing to fear, however, and use AI to improve their workflow instead.
Customer service
The customer service sector offers many opportunities for automation. AI-powered chatbots can provide speedy, personalized responses to customer questions, reducing the need for human workers. There are many examples of AI in customer service pre-ChatGPT, including the following:

Robotic process automation.
Customer self-service.
Chatbots.
Sentiment analysis.

It's likely customer service departments will continue to integrate the newest AI technologies.
Currently, ChatGPT can't automate an entire contact center, but there are many ways it could lighten the workload, such as translating or summarizing customer inquiries.
Legal
There is significant evidence indicating AI will affect legal jobs.
AI will eventually perform many of the tasks paralegals and legal assistants typically handle, according to one study by authors from Princeton University, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. A March 2023 study from Goldman Sachs said AI could perform 44% of the tasks that U.S. and European legal assistants typically handle. GPT-4, OpenAI's latest and greatest language model, passed the Uniform Bar Examination in the 90th percentile.
AI could help automate routine law tasks such as the following:

Document review.
Contract analysis.
Legal research.
Searches for relevant case law.

Teachers
Teachers could be affected by AI in several ways. The immediate concern is that they will have a harder time detecting plagiarism or students cheating on assignments. But AI could help teachers by doing the following:

Acting as productivity tools.
Drafting lesson plans.
Generating quiz questions and mock tests.

Teacher sentiments range from being worried about the technology replacing them to insisting that the in-person classroom connection is essential to education.
Some people draw an analogy between ChatGPT and when students weren't allowed to use calculators in the classroom. Now, most people have a calculator app on their smartphone. There might also be a time when it becomes accepted for students to use ChatGPT to aid with schoolwork.
Finance
AI is also making an impact on finance and banking. GenAI could be used to monitor transactions and give detailed financial advice on how to save and spend efficiently. For example, Morgan Stanley uses AI-powered chatbots to organize its database.



AI has several use cases in banking.





Graphic designers
Adobe Photoshop's new Generative Fill feature is one example of the way generative AI can augment the graphic design profession. The feature lets people with no photo editing experience make photorealistic edits using a text prompt. Other tools -- such as Dall-E and Midjourney -- also create realistic looking images and detailed artistic renderings from a text prompt.
Engineering
Generative design uses AI to expedite the computer-aided design process. Generative design helps with ideation, generating all computationally possible solutions to a problem within a given set of parameters -- even when the design is completely novel and a radical change from anything that has come before.
Even though generative design affects the field of mechanical design, it is unlikely to replace human engineers.
Human resources
The hype around AI and the fear of job losses has created a difficult dynamic for HR departments to manage in the interim.
""[Generative AI] will infiltrate every aspect of HR,"" said Patrick Thibodeau, a senior news writer at TechTarget, in a podcast. However, AI-powered recruiting tools could be used to do the following:

Source qualified candidates.
Review resumes.
Automate recruiter tasks.




AI in recruiting has its positives and negatives.





AI chatbots could also be used internally to help employees access their benefits and perform other self-service tasks.


What AI legislation is there?
In recent months, leaders in the AI industry have been actively seeking legislation, but there is no comprehensive federal approach to AI in the United States. Still, there have been state- and city-level rules passed. Several states -- including California, Illinois, Texas and Colorado -- have introduced or passed laws focused on protecting consumers from harms caused by AI.
New York City passed a bill, Local Law 144, regulating the use of AI in recruiting effective July 5, 2023. The law requires independent audits of AI hiring tools and publication of findings.
Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic launched the Frontier Model Forum on July 26, 2023. The forum aims to advance AI safety research, identify best practices for AI development and collaborate with policymakers to develop applications that help solve societal challenges. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic and Inflection also pledged to subject AI systems to third-party testing before releasing systems to the government, and to clearly label generated content.
The European Union has the AI Act, which will be the world's first AI legislation and is expected to take shape late this year. The U.S. Congress is not likely to pass comprehensive regulations similar to the EU legislation in the immediate future. On June 21st, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer formally unveiled an open-ended plan for AI regulation, explaining that it could take months to reach a consensus on a comprehensive proposal. Schumer emphasized that the regulations should focus on protecting workers, national security, copyright issues and protection from doomsday scenarios.



AI regulation of some form is not a question of if, but when.





On Oct. 30, 2023, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on artificial intelligence. The order, though not a law, is a binding government action. The executive order aims to protect consumer privacy, create educational resources, create new AI government jobs, advance equity and civil rights in AI in the justice system and support workers in response to AI's effects on the workforce.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are rapidly gaining traction, allowing the technology to be used throughout the enterprise to automate a variety of manual tasks performed by workers today, leading to what’s expected to be a major shift in the global job market.
In the US and Europe, as many as 300 million jobs could be threatened by some form of AI, according to a March research note by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Fully two-thirds of US jobs could be partially automated through AI, and up to one in four current work tasks could be completely automated by AI in the US and Europe, according to Goldman Sachs.
In particular, roles that require repetitive data entry, legal administration, careers that involve mathematical skills – even healthcare jobs – will all be impacted by AI’s adoption.











 
 
 
 Goldman Sachs
As much as 29% of computer-related job tasks could be automated by AI, as well as 28% of work by healthcare practitioners and technical tasks in that field, Goldman Sachs projected.

Career fields with the highest exposure to AI automation are administrative positions (46%) and tasks in legal (44%) professions. Not surprisingly, jobs less likely to be affected tend to be in physically intensive areas such as construction (6%) and maintenance (4%).
While automation through AI is expected to disrupt an array of career fields, including IT, not all jobs in those areas will be affected equally. For example, in the legal sector, paralegal jobs are likely endangered than attorneys — that’s one reason the legal sector’s score is so high, according to Goldman Sachs.











 
 
 
Officials at ManpowerGroup are seeing many of the same trends. “A majority of what we’re seeing now are [effects on] jobs that are more information based,” said Rebecca Croucher, head of North America marketing at the global staffing firm. “So, math, law, doctors —  more of a day-to-day diagnosis [of patients].”
Data processing tasks such as data entry are also “going away,” especially in banking, according to Croucher.
 Goldman Sachs
“No longer does someone have to sit there and enter invoices or accounts receivables. Any data coming in like that is now being automated,” she said.











 
 
 
With AI taking on so many tasks in so many fields, organizations will be pressed to upskill or reskill their existing workforce. In fact, half of IT employers are upskilling workers to address staffing challenges, according to a June 8 report from ManpowerGroup. The report claims that emerging technologies such as AI and virtual reality could even help hire and train new employees.
Croucher said the need to retrain employees as AI takes on tasks will hit companies “hard and fast.” “I think there is the cirriculum available, but I don’t think the rubber has hit the road yet. In the US, you’re starting to hear more about apprenticeship programs in areas like cybersecurity,” Croucher said. “The need will happen. And when it hits, it will be a big wave.
Knowledge worker jobs are also threatened by AI.











 
 
 


 


Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer for HR software and service provider ADP, said companies are now taking longer to hire knowledge workers. For the most part, Berkowitz said, ADP’s data shows major dislocations for workers in three areas: digital marketing, digital advertising, and digital sales.
“…That’s because the previous generation of technology in e-commerce and marketing required people to click buttons to manage the search engine optimization,” he said. “Now, the tools are automating that. So, it’s the modern job that’s getting disrupted.”
Automating yourself out of a job
Berkowitz noted that in his current role, where he is helping to develop AI and machine learning tools to eliminate manual data analytics tasks, he may well be automating himself out of a job. But he calls the technology “amazing” and is sanguine about his future after 30 years working in product development for ADP.











 
 
 
For more than two years, the company has been using various large language models (LLMs), including GPT 4 and Google Bard, to improve the efficiency of ADPs’ skills graph. That application, among other things, maps in-demand skills to what people should be paid for them and the capabilities of the workforce.
“All the job numbers you see [from ADP] about who’s doing what and in what professions, that’s all actually run by machine learning and AI that we developed two or three years ago. So, all of the job numbers — everything that we publish — has machine learning behind it today,” Berkowitz said. “The technology is amazing.
“These large language models turn out to be really good at summarizing data. So, do I need someone to spend 100 hours building a dashboard for me, or will the new tools allow me to do it almost dynamically?” he said. “There are research assistants, associates; there are people who configure business rules around companies. Well, here’s our policy and now we’re going to configure and put those policies into action by either configuring software or training people on processes.











 
 
 
“These systems are really good at reading a policy document and taking action as a result of that,” Berkowitz said.
The good news: worker displacement from automation in the past has usually been offset by new job creation. That trend accounts for the vast majority of long-term employment growth.
Even as ADP automated digital tasks once done by workers, it didn’t reduce headcount as a result. In fact, Berkowitz said, the company ended up paying those data analysts more because those employees could develop new skills and advance up the career ladder.











 
 
 
“So, we literally changed the jobs for 10 or 12 people internally. I think eventually, my job might go away. I think if we do a good enough job, it will. But that’s OK. What’s wrong if I put myself out of work? That means I’ve done something meaningful and contributed,” Berkowitz said. “I’ve done my job. I’m sure they’d find something else for me to do.”
And, he noted, AI is not perfect. For at least the foreseeable future, it will continue to be more of a co-pilot than pilot in charge; people will still be needed to ensure the work produced by generative AI tools is accurate.
A coming productivity boom?
The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that could boost economic growth substantially, “although the timing of such a boom is hard to predict,” Goldman Sach said.











 
 
 
A study released this week by Upwork, a freelance staffing platform provider, underlines that possibility; it indicates companies plan to hire more people even with the rise of generative AI.
Contrary to the assumption that AI will replace millions of jobs, Upwork’s survey of 1,400 US business leaders across various industries found 64% of C-suite executives plan to hire more professionals of all types due to generative AI. And 49% of all respondents, which included senior managers through C-suite level, plan to hire more freelancers and full-time employees.
Remote-first enterprises are more likely to embrace generative AI, with 68% of full-time remote companies saying they’re actively doing so, compared to 53% of companies that are full-time in the office.











 
 
 
Almost six in 10 (59%) business leaders also said they’re personally embracing generative AI tools.
The survey, however, found a disconnect between leaders and their teams. Seventy-three percent of C-suite executives think their company is actively using AI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, but just 53% of vice presidents, directors and senior managers say that’s the case. Kelly Monahan, managing director of Upwork Research Institute, said some teams are reticent to rollout AI due to a lack of understanding and training around the technology.
“Businesses that want to bridge this gap should roll out a change management strategy that includes communicating the expected outcomes for their workforce in relation to generative AI adoption, and clear policies,” Monahan said in a statement. “It’s important that leaders address fear and uncertainty, and, perhaps most critically, encourage their teams to adopt a learning orientation.”











 
 
 
The arrival of the ‘AI age’
Just as the industrial revolution ushered in the industrial age and the computer revolution launched the information age, the AI revolution heralds the coming AI age, according to Anant Agarwal, founder of online education provider edX. Not surprisingly, Agarwal sees the AI age as an opportunity to upskill workers for jobs that will be created through automation.
“With a billion jobs worldwide projected to undergo a dramatic evolution within the next decade due to AI, the demand for rapidly-growing skills, such as AI/machine learning, cloud computing, cybersecurity, product management, project management, and digital social media, is soaring, Agarwal said. Those skill sets, which opened up over five million job opportunities in 2022 alone, “represent a seismic shift in the job market.
“AI will become an augmentation skill that everyone will nee,d no matter what their job. For example, call center specialist to ChatGPT-augmented call center specialist,” Agarwal said.











 
 
 
AI itself will need to be tailored for specific tasks, managed and monitored. For example, prompt engineers will be needed to craft and optimize text prompts for LLMs to achieve desired outcomes. “[It] helps LLMs for rapid iteration in product prototyping and exploration, as it tailors the LLM to better align with the task definition quickly and easily,” said Marshall Choy, senior vice president of product at SambaNova Systems, a Silicon Valley startup that makes semiconductors for AI.
AI systems will also have to be monitored to ensure their output is accurate and useful; that will be the job of an AI auditor.  
Overall, AI competence will be prized by employers, with AI skills, from coding to working alongside AI, understanding its implications, and integrating it into existing structures, necessary in coming months.











 
 
 
“The future belongs to those who are ready to embrace the AI wave,” Agarwal said. “Remember, AI may not take away your job, but could be something that can help you do it more effectively.”

The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 found three-quarters of companies expect to adopt AI and half thought it would create jobs.But what do workers think about the transformation and how ready are they to embrace it?PwC’s latest Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey, presented at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, finds ""sizeable pockets"" of the global workforce are eager to learn new skills, embrace AI and tackle new challenges.Have you used generative AI to help you tick off your to-do list today? Since the launch of ChatGPT-4 in March, more and more companies have been trialling and adopting the latest artificial intelligence tools in search of productivity gains.Almost 75% of companies surveyed by the World Economic Forum for the Future of Jobs Report 2023 are expected to adopt generative AI – with high churn anticipated as a result. Around half of these organizations expect AI to create job growth, while 25% expect it to result in job losses.Around half of companies surveyed expect AI to drive job growth. Image: Future of Jobs ReportA huge reskilling effort is underway to harness the potential of AI – and guard against its pitfalls. Employers estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years.Training workers to use AI and big data ranked third among company skills-training priorities in the next five years, according to the Future of Jobs Report – and will be prioritized say 42% of surveyed companies.But that's just one side of the conversation – what do workers think about AI disruption and how ready and willing are they to upskill? Have you read?These are the jobs most likely to be lost – and created – because of AI The future of jobs in the age of AI, sustainability and deglobalizationAMNC23: How to close the skills gap to enable future growthReady player one?The central challenge facing business leaders today, according to PwC's Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey 2023, is getting buy-in from everyone in the organization to make its reinvention a success.At the Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China, PwC presented the results of its survey in a session called The Global Workforce.""What the workers tell us is they are wanting to embrace the opportunity to upskill, to develop themselves, to be relevant, to be able to be more productive and to contribute to that reinvention of their organizations,"" said Peter Brown, PwC Global People and Organization Leader.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesPwC surveyed more than 54,000 workers in 46 countries and territories and found workers are largely positive about AI despite the job churn it represents.""They see it as something that enables them to be more productive, to remove some of the mundane in their day-to-day work, an opportunity to develop new skills and, ultimately, an opportunity to create new job opportunities,"" added Brown.In the survey, more than 50% of workers chose at least one positive statement about the impact of AI on their careers, from increasing productivity to helping them gain new skills. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said: ""AI will help me increase my productivity/efficiency at work.""The majority of workers are positive about the impact of AI on their careers. Image: PwCWhen it comes to the shifting skills landscape, only a third (36%) of respondents strongly or moderately agree that the skills needed to succeed in their job will change significantly over the next five years.This contrasts with the 44% of employers who told the Forum skills would be disrupted in the next five years, showing the mindset gap around urgency between leaders and employees.Only a third of workers think the skills required for their job will change in the next five years. Image: PwCMinding the 'specialization gap'Digging deeper into worker perceptions around skilling needs, PwC identified a ""specialization gap"" – and it's growing, said Brown. ""We are seeing the emergence and the widening gap between those that have specialist skills and those that don't. Fifty-three percent of workers say they require specialist skills in order to do their job. That cohort of the workforce will broadly be more demanding of pay increases or promotions and seeking out opportunities to apply their skills and experiences. ""They will also be the people within an organization that are more likely to get opportunities to develop themselves and for upskilling.""Half of those whose jobs require specialist training said the skills needed to do their jobs would change significantly, compared to only 15% of those whose jobs don't require specialist training.PwC said this meant those workers who lack specialized training could be ""particularly vulnerable to job losses as skills continue to evolve, and as companies augment (or replace) jobs with automation, AI, or both"".The specialization gap affects how employees view skills. Image: PwCCrucially, workers without specialist training were less likely to say that the more human, soft skills, such as adaptability, critical thinking and collaboration, would be important to their role in the future.In another session at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, on New Skills for Fast-Moving Industries, Brown said those with specialist skills were more likely to have access to upskilling opportunities from their employer and are ""much more aware of the impact of technology disruptions and the importance of human skills"".""We need the whole workforce to be engaged and motivated and empowered to deliver this innovation.""Those who don't see their job will require new skills in the next five years don't get easy access to upskilling opportunities in their organizations. There is a great danger and unless we respond to that, we will have a whole society that is disadvantaged. We must work together as business leaders, as policymakers, as governments to solve that.""Bringing everyone along on the upskilling journeyGrowing skills gaps could further increase economic inequality and also slow down attempts to innovate for companies.PwC put the responsibility squarely on leaders for bringing everyone along and engaging employees in upskilling – but also to create a culture where it's OK to experiment and fail.Brown said: ""If we want to innovate and transform, innovation by its very nature requires valuing making mistakes, stretching boundaries.

In a new study, researchers from IBM, Oxford University and Diamond Light Source show that IBM's AI Model, MoLFormer, can generate antiviral molecules for multiple target virus proteins, including SARS-CoV-2, that can accelerate the drug discovery process and bolster our response to future pandemics.





The results are laid out in a new paper published in Science Advances, and at the time of the paper's submission, the antiviral properties of eleven molecules were successfully validated by Oxford researchers. This breakthrough has the potential to get drugs to people faster in the next crisis and bring treatments for urgent, life-threatening illnesses within reach.
Early in the pandemic, a group of computer scientists at IBM wanted to explore if generative AI could be used to design never-before seen molecules to block SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. David Stuart, Head of the Division of Structural Biology in the Department of Clinical Medicine at the University of Oxford and Life Sciences Director at Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron who is an authority on pathogens HIV, SARS, and Ebola, among other viruses explains he was initially skeptical. ""The idea that you could take a protein sequence and, with AI, pluck out of thin air chemicals that would bind to a 3D site on the virus seemed very unlikely,"" he said.
However, he and Martin Walsh also an expert structural biologist and Life Sciences Deputy director at Diamond joined up with the IBM team and over the course of three years, demonstrated that generative AI could, ""pluck viable starting points for antivirals out of thin air,"" in collaboration with Enamine Ltd., a chemical supplier in Ukraine, and other researchers at Oxford.






Because the generative model was also a foundation model, pre-trained on massive amounts of raw data, it was versatile enough to create new inhibitors for multiple protein targets without extra training or any knowledge of its 3D structure.
The Stuart and Walsh groups had commenced working on two essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely the spike protein and the main protease. Using these targets, the team hit on four potential COVID-19 antivirals in a fraction of the time it would have taken using conventional methods. The work then exploited Diamond's high-throughput macromolecular crystallography beamlines to visualize how a subset of the AI generated compounds bound to the main protease.
Their work is showcased in their new paper in Science Advances and IBM has released a web-based interface for interacting with the model and chemical foundation models like it in IBM Cloud.
The team stated that the validated molecules have many more hurdles to clear, including clinical trials, before companies could potentially turn them into drugs. But even if the AI-generated ""hits"" never materialize into actual drugs, the work provides confirmation that generative AI has an important role to play in the future of drug development, especially in a time of crisis.
""It took time to develop and validate these methods, but now that we have a working pipeline in place, we can generate results much faster,"" said study co-senior author, Payel Das, a researcher at IBM Research. ""When the next virus emerges, generative AI could be pivotal in the search for new treatments.""
""Generating initial compounds that bind with high affinity to a drug target of interest accelerates the structure-based drug discovery pipeline and underpins our efforts to be better prepared for future pandemics,"" said, Martin Walsh, who was co-senior author at Diamond
The researchers built their model, Controlled Generation of Molecules (or CogMol), on a generative AI architecture known as variational autoencoders, or VAEs. VAEs encode raw data into a compressed representation, and then decode, or translate, it back into a statistical variation on the original sample. Their model was trained on a large dataset of molecules represented as strings of text, along with general information about proteins and their binding properties. But they deliberately left out information about SARS-CoV-2's 3D structure or molecules known to bind to it. Their goal was to give their generative foundation model a broad base of knowledge so that it could be more easily deployed for molecular design tasks it has never seen before.
Their goal was to find drug-like molecules that would bind with two COVID protein targets: the spike, which transmits the virus to the host cell, and the main protease, which helps to spread it. Though the 3D structures of both proteins had been discovered by that time, the IBM researchers chose to use only their amino acid sequences, derived from their DNA. By limiting themselves in this way, they hoped that the model could learn to generate molecules without knowing the shape of their target.






The researchers input only the amino acid sequence for each protein target into CogMol, which generated 875,000 candidate molecules in three days. To narrow the pool, the researchers ran the candidates through a retrosynthesis platform, IBM RXN for Chemistry, to understand what ingredients would be needed to synthesize the compounds. Based on the platform's predicted recipes, they selected 100 molecules for each target. Chemists at Enamine further pared the list to four molecules for each target, selecting those deemed easiest to manufacture.
After synthesizing the eight novel molecules, Enamine shipped them to Oxford for testing their ability to disrupt the functions of the two protein targets in the labs of Prof Chris Schofield and PRof Gavin Screaton. . The intense X-ray beam generated from Diamond which are 10 billion times brighter than the sun were used to visualize how the compounds interacted with proteins to inactivate their function. The novel compounds were further tested in target inhibition and live virus neutralization tests. Two of the validated antivirals target the main protease; the other two not only targeted the spike protein but proved capable of neutralizing all six major COVID variants. ""You get a map that shows exactly where things bind, and bang! you've got a confirmation,"" said Stuart.

CogMol is one of several chemical foundation models that IBM has since developed. The largest, MoLFormer-XL, was trained on a database of more than 1.1 billion molecules and is currently being used by Moderna to design mRNA medicines. ""We created valid starting points for accelerated development of antivirals using a generative foundation model that knew relatively little about its protein targets,"" said the study's co-senior author, Jason Crain, a researcher at IBM Research and professor at Oxford. ""I'm hopeful that these methods will allow us to create antivirals and other urgently needed compounds much faster and more inexpensively in the future.""
Though the researchers focused on validating antivirals for COVID, they argue that these methods can be extended to existing viruses that continue to mutate, like the flu, or viruses that have yet to surface. ""If you want to be prepared for the next pandemic, you want drugs that act on different sites of the protein,"" concluded Stuart. ""It becomes much harder for the virus to escape.""

Increasingly, artificial intelligence is playing key roles in driving business value, boosting efficiency while reducing costs. This trend is driving up demand for tech talent capable of building and maintaining AI models, which calls for a mix of evolving software coding capabilities and soft skills. We spoke to five leading artificial intelligence experts, to gauge how best to gain entry into a career in the space.






Highest-earning software salaries ranked — A deep dive into the highest-earning salaries that are being offered across the software market.

The AI job market
With so many areas of artificial intelligence being developed today, it makes sense that job creation in the space is bound to continue evolving with the space. 
Szymon Idziniak, machine learning engineer at STX Next, suggests splitting the AI job market into a few key roles:

Machine learning engineer – Someone who has a strong IT/engineering background, and the ability to write whole software by themselves. “They should also have strong machine learning background and need to understand how something is working before starting to use it.”
ML/deep learning researcher – Someone who has a strong mathematics and machine learning background. “They should have the ability to develop new neural networks from scratch to solve difficult programs. They will often lack some knowledge of software engineering, but could be supervised by another developer,” said Idziniak. Additionally, this role is mainly focused on just creating and evaluating new models.
Data scientist – Someone who has background in statistics, IT and mathematics. “They often lack software engineering background, but is good at analysing data and creating reports. They will have a good ability to write in notebook and provide useful insights of data, uses more classical ml approaches like XGBoost, scikit-learn, Pandas and NumPy.”
MLOps Engineer – Someone who has a strong DevOps background with knowledge of how to write code and also understands basic machine learning approaches. “They will mostly focus on how to utilise cloud providers in real projects.”

The best new roles in AI
When it comes to determining the job roles that are set to drive the most value from artificial intelligence-powered capabilities, experts see much of this value-add to come from product development pertaining to customer service and compliance.
“Prompt engineering is a role that has emerged recently with the development of generative AI technology. Prompt engineers are responsible for designing and refining the prompts or inputs that are used to generate text or other outputs from AI models,” says Kunal Purohit, chief digital services officer at Tech Mahindra.
“Another role that I can see emerging is AI product managers, who will be responsible for developing and managing generative AI products, from ideation to launch. The AI conversation designer, meanwhile, can be another role who is an expert in designing conversational interfaces for AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems, ensuring smooth and engaging user interactions.
“As the unprecedented power of AI and generative AI comes with a great deal of security and responsibility issues for its use, an ethics engineer will play a vital role to ensure transparency, fairness, and avoiding any unintended biases in the generated output. Then, the AI trainer will also get into the mainstream career path as they will have responsibility of training generative AI systems, teaching them to recognise patterns and generate output that aligns with specific goals.”
As every industry explores ways to harness generative AI to improve their business operations, many industry specific roles may emerge and evolve with time, and as generative AI continues to unfold its potential.

AI-led business processes – getting the balance right between business impact and staff satisfaction — David Semach, CEO of AIM Reply, spoke to Information Age about how businesses can keep staff motivated and productive alongside AI-led business processes.

Programming languages
According to Martin Butler, professor of management practice at Vlerick Business School, Python will be king when it comes to entering into and maintaining a career in artificial intelligence, due to it being widely used and easy to learn. 
He explains: “It provides an excellent entry into programming for novices, yet it is still used in complex scenarios by very seasoned programmers. Experienced developers will learn to add additional languages, often context-specific, but Python is the best entry point that can take you very far on the AI developer journey.”
When considering which programming languages not worth learning, Butler cites typical scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP, Perl and Ruby: “These are all very accomplished scripting languages which are powerful in their own right, but not necessarily for AI applications.
“The exception? Phyton, since it can be used for both scripting (i.e. easy to learn) and programming (more suited to AI work).”
Top technical qualifications
When looking to apply for job roles focused on AI, it’s important not to underestimate the challenges that the exciting but demanding technologies can bring — especially to those new to the space. 
“To put this in perspective, the UK’s main AI research organisation, DeepMind, used to recruit the top computer science graduate from Cambridge University each year, but they stopped that practice several years ago,” said Clare Walsh, director of education at the Institute of Analytics.
“They found that even the most promising, hardworking 21 year old was unable to cope with the demanding environment of experimental AI. As a company policy, DeepMind now require a PhD qualification as a minimum to get a job there.”
To become a chief data officer — a position increasingly involving work in AI — it is likely that a degree in a relevant field would be required as a minimum. Walsh continued: “There are different routes to do that. For example, to apply for Chartered data scientist status, a gold standard in the field, you’ll need a degree as a minimum.
“There are, of course, many people currently employed who went through different routes. Realistically, this current ‘AI summer’ or period of rapid expansion of AI only began in earnest around 2016. For the first few years, you had to be a PhD researcher, or perhaps completing an MSc to have access to university training in these fields.
“However, the field is becoming more formally regulated and although there will be older, more experienced coders who have no formal training, it would be risky to assume that the best jobs will still be available to anyone in, say 10 years’ time.”

UK data science degrees and diplomas — Here, we list out nearly 100 different data science university degrees (Bachelors and Masters), plus post-graduate diplomas and certifications.

Retraining as an AI specialist
One last question remains: is it ever too late to retrain as a specialist in artificial intelligence?
“I don’t think it’s ever too late,” said Heather Dawe, UK head of data at digital consultancy UST. “Diversity in the people who develop and use AI is so important – people who have done other things previously in their career or who have lived and worked in other ways bring diverse experiences and knowledge with them and this is a strength in itself.
“Further to this, given the uses of AI are likely to become more pervasive, we will all come into increasing contact with it. I think society will in turn become more aware of this and this familiarity will hopefully encourage more people to consider retraining as their interest is piqued.”

The human resources department has never been the cool kid in the workplace. Behind their back many people used to call this function “human remains.” In fact, the working assumption for years has been that HR is more often on the side of the top brass and too bossy itself. A Harvard Business Review article once put it like this: “We don’t like being told how to behave — and no other group in organizational life, not even finance, bosses us around as systematically as HR does.”Distrust of HR reached a zenith pre-pandemic when an admission in a regulatory filing from Uber Technologies Inc. ahead of its public offering noted within the summary of risk factors: “Our workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges.” This was a reference to sexism which the HR department sat on and ignored until engineer Susan Fowler blew the whistle.

Over the past year or so, there’s been no shortage of chatter about how artificial intelligence (AI) is going to fundamentally change the way we do our jobs as communicators. Could it take over writing and messaging tasks and make our jobs obsolete? Probably not. But could it serve as a significant virtual helper in getting our tasks done faster? Most likely yes.
However, there’s one important business function that’s about as people-centric as it gets that’s poised for AI treatment —- HR. As counterintuitive as it might sound, machine learning applications and programs might hold the key to helping HR professionals focus on what really matters —- the people that make the organization what it is.
Of course, HR should be aware of some areas of concern, especially around sensitive matters like workplace wellness. When a mental health service recently tested out an AI-assisted chatbot on its users, the results were not accurate once people realized they were chatting with a machine. This is a reminder that comms and HR should be forthright and transparent with employees about how they are automating HR tasks—and evaluating vendors to ensure they are being transparent, too.
If HR pros are being transparent with employees, however, there’s no reason why AI can’t help streamline processes and workflows. We spoke to two HR professionals to learn how they’re incorporating AI into their workflows without sacrificing the human element.
A virtual administrative assistant
The HR professional has a wide range of tasks on their plate. From onboarding to recruitment to organizing companywide benefits, there’s a lot for the HR department to handle to keep an organization moving forward. Could generative AI help HR pros by automating some of the more rote tasks of the role and help HR put increased emphasis on the humans within the organization?
According to Traci Chernoff, senior director of employee engagement at Legion Technologies, the answer is a resounding yes.
“Generative AI can really help foster closer human connections,” Chernoff said. “We use AI to help us derive schedules from multiple data points that a human brain simply wouldn’t be able to do as quickly.”
She added that having generative AI to work on some HR tasks has allowed her and her team to focus on other parts of the role
“Generative AI allows me to save time and I can focus that saved time on the people within the company,” she said.

Curbing apprehension
There’s bound to be some natural fear when AI is applied to HR – it’s right in the name human resources! But when HR pros view AI’s capabilities with openness rather than fear, they can expand their own skillsets.
“That initial apprehension is natural,” Chernoff says. “But I believe if you have a tool that can help foster deeper connections, that apprehension can be overcome. In this case, generative AI can allow HR professionals time to focus on the more creative and personalized parts of their jobs.”
She went on to add that some of the duties that an AI can help with include drafting policies and procedures and career development guidelines, but stressed that people are still needed to perfect them.
Jason Lapp, founder and CEO of Beautiful.ai, said that HR professionals should try to familiarize themselves with what AI can do to help them to ease any potential fears.
“People should really seek to try out any potential AI programs that might be able to help them,” Lapp said. “The rise of AI has presented a major opportunity for people to think of this technology in a positive, helpful way.”
The recruiting role of AI
Think about the first time you interacted with HR at your current job. Chances are, it was during the recruiting process. The journey in which you find your job is a very personal process that prompts you to quantify your skills, match them to a role, and get to know others that you’d gel with professionally.
But what if that process was somewhat automated by an AI? Would it cheapen the employee experience at all?
According to Chernoff, AI doesn’t just help in the recruiting journey — it opens things up for a more personalized job hunt.
“AI can help us in our administrative tasks like scheduling interviews, but it doesn’t take away from the needed human connection in recruiting at all,” she said. “The company doesn’t just need to know all about the person they’re bringing on board — the candidate needs to know about the people within the organization they’re set to join.”
Chernoff added that the value AI adds to the recruiting journey isn’t subtracting from focus on people — just the opposite.
“The human connection in recruiting is critical and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon,” she said. “It’s so important to involve people at every stage of the employee lifecycle, and it will remain so.”

The business world was set on fire by the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, 2023 has shaped up to be the year of artificial intelligence. AI is gaining momentum everywhere, and it's starting to look like it could be the next industrial revolution.While businesses are indulging in innovative AI hand over fist, though, individuals are often at a loss as to how to handle the new tech. Rather than a boon, they see AI as a job-threatening menace with no practical use for their personal lives.Nothing could be further from the truth. From improved employment searches to accessible living spaces to amusing adventures in the kitchen, here are a few examples of how the average consumer can and should be taking advantage of the new AI revolution.



1. Use AI to improve your job searchOne of the most ironic (though legitimate) uses of AI amongst consumers is as a job search tool. Commonly seen as a job-killer, artificial intelligence can help individuals find better-paying, more rewarding work.Take ChatGPT as a relatable example. The sophisticated AI tool can generate lists of skills, attributes and requirements for a specific role you want to fill. You could also ask the tool to list keywords to help ensure an application will make it past an ATS (applicant tracking system). Career growth platform Teal lays out a step-by-step process to have the program help you write your resume and even your cover letter.


AI may help us eliminate grunt work from our lives, which may mean certain jobs disappear. But the tool is also a powerful way to ensure that those who find themselves looking for work can move their careers forward, not back, as they take their next step.Related: 10 Tips For Writing An Impressive Resume2. Use AI to make living spaces more accessibleSometimes, the use of AI is already well-established in our lives. All we need to do is find new ways to apply it. That's the case with personal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.We may not think of something as simple and common as a personal assistant as an application of AI. But these programs use vast, increasingly complex cloud-based algorithms and software to provide answers for consumers.


Alexa, for example, uses conversational AI in what is commonly called VUI or ""voice user interface."" This enables users to speak to an AI system without the need to click a mouse, press a button, or touch a screen. They don't even have to be in physical proximity to a device.This allows an individual to control many items in an easily accessible manner. From playing music to answering questions to turning off the lights and even checking the security system, personal assistants are powerful applications of AI tech in our daily lives.Related: Everything You Can Do With Amazon Alexa3. Use AI to facilitate day-to-day creativityArtificial intelligence doesn't have to be practical or profitable to have value. On the contrary, its use as a recreational tool is also something to consider.


This can take a couple of different forms. For instance, you can use AI to make a recreational activity more convenient, like using a personal assistant to turn on a song or turn off the TV. But it goes further than that. There are many ways you can have AI get in on the creative action, too.All you need to do is input a meal idea, and the program sets to work coming up with a data-backed recommendation for your next meal. You can even specify the ingredients you have available. Once you have a recipe you like, the tool can store it for later use.There may be more important things to use AI tools for than culinary adventures. Even so, few of them will yield tastier results… or more intriguing ones.Related: Get Cooking With This Latest Feature On Google Home


Allowing AI to impact you for the betterArtificial intelligence may be all the buzz in the business world. The trend doesn't have to stop there, though. Consumers don't need to sit on the sidelines while corporations take advantage of the latest technology to superpower their daily activities.On the contrary, there are countless ways individuals can use AI to create life-changing alterations to their daily activities. From empowering their job searches to making their living spaces more accessible to igniting intriguing new hobbies, AI can impact life as we know it, even in the smallest ways.The best part? The party is just getting started.Don't let AI intimidate you. Just like every other major technological advancement, look for ways to harness the change and use it to impact your life and the lives of those around you for the better.

The addition of these features aims to assist in various tasks, including the drafting of job descriptions and employee performance goals.Generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, which can generate human-like responses to prompts, have become increasingly popular in the technology sector. Companies like Microsoft and Alphabet&#039;s Google have already incorporated such AI systems into their search engines.Track Budget 2024 updates real-time with BT&#039;s non-stop live streaming of India&#039;s most-important event from 8 am to 7 pm However, many businesses have approached generative AI technology with caution due to concerns about its ability to generate false information and provide unsettling responses.Oracle&#039;s human resources software is widely used by large enterprises for functions like hiring new employees and conducting performance evaluations. As part of the software update, Oracle will introduce a button feature in several fields, enabling the automatic generation of draft text for job listings, performance goals, and other related areas.Watch BT Visual Story 10 Hidden iPhone and Android Smartphone Features You Probably Didn&#039;t Know AboutThe decision to implement AI assistance in the form of a button, as opposed to a chatbot that responds to open-ended prompts from users, is intended to ensure that the generated text consistently delivers satisfactory and safe results. Rich Buchheim, Vice President of Product Management for Oracle Adaptive Intelligence Applications, highlighted that the text produced by the AI system would still require human approval.Buchheim explained, &amp;quot;We don&#039;t expect generative AI is going to write your goals for you. It&#039;s going to give you a starting place, and it&#039;s going to give you useful information that you can get going with.”These AI-driven features are expected to be available by the end of this year.Looking ahead, Oracle aims to explore the application of AI in more complex human resources tasks. For instance, the company plans to develop AI capabilities that can generate job requirement listings in compliance with local regulations across different markets. By streamlining such processes, Oracle hopes to significantly reduce the time taken for decision-making and implementation.Guy Waterman, Vice President of People Analytics and Human Capital Management Technology and Innovation at Oracle, expressed enthusiasm for the potential impact of generative AI. He said, &amp;quot;It may have taken a week or two weeks for someone to make a decision and then implement it. If we can change that to hours and minutes, that&#039;s where we&#039;re really seeing the difference with the possibilities of generative AI.&amp;quot;Also Read&#039;Buying Netflix at $4 billion would&#039;ve been better instead of...&#039;: Former Yahoo CEO Marissa MayerChatGPT beats top investment funds in stock-picking experiment",,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.headline', '.summary']}",,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202306/2023-06-28t201731z_1683105510_rc2js1aspk5b_rtrmadp_3_oracle-ampere-computing_0-sixteen_nine.jpg?size=1280:720', 'caption': 'Oracle', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}","{'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/pranav-dixit', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pranav Dixit'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HR TechnologyOracle introduces generative AI capabilities to support HR functions and productivityThe Human Resources department at Oracle will now function with Generative AI capabilities to enhance productivity and streamline processes across the organisation. 







 

Oracle has announced the addition of generative AI-powered capabilities known as Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) to boost their HR functions and productivity.

These capabilities will be embedded in their existing HR processes with the help of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) gen AI service. The aim is to enhance HR functions, drive faster business value, improve productivity, facilitate HR strategies, and enhance candidate and employee experience.Also Read:

Chris Leone, Executive Vice President for Applications Development and Oracle Cloud HCM shared, ""With the new embedded generative AI capabilities in Oracle Cloud HCM, our customers will be able to take advantage of large language models to significantly reduce the time required to complete tasks, improve the employee experience, enhance the accuracy of workforce insights, and ultimately increase business value.""
How will the generative AI capabilities of Oracle Cloud HCM be helpful?
Oracle Cloud HCM is designed to allow customers to utilize their data and filter models according to their business requirements. It runs on dedicated generative AI models in synchronisation with each customer's proprietary data. Furthermore, Oracle has declared that the control of data used by generative AI rests solely with the customers, ensuring protection from data theft for sensitive and proprietary information. Therefore, Oracle Cloud HCM will assist Oracle's HR processes for candidates, employees, managers, and recruiters in a streamlined and secure manner.
How will the Gen AI capabilities of Oracle HCM boost HR efficiency?
Deepa Param Singhal, Vice President of Applications at Oracle India, explained, ""Despite significant strides in the business landscape, several HR challenges persist in enterprises, hindering their ability to create an efficient work environment for their employees."" She added, ""As we move forward into an increasingly digital era, our generative AI-embedded Oracle Cloud HCM will emerge as an intelligent tool that is set to elevate the employee experience by equipping them with built-in modern, intelligent tools and features that automate mundane daily tasks.""
Furthermore, during a quarterly meeting for Oracle's Q4 2023 earnings, Larry Ellison, Chairman, and CTO, announced the launch of a new generative AI cloud service in partnership with Cohere, a Canadian startup specializing in large language models (LLMs). He added, ""Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models."" Oracle predicts that specialized LLMs will become a significant part of generative AI in the near future.

But amid the recent surge in AI's popularity suddenly, IBM's Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) Nickle LaMoreaux has revealed many positive developments that the company has witnessed in recent months.How AI Is Helping IBM                        indiatimesIBM's CHRO has revealed that internally, A.I. has freed employees from back-office administrative work, allowing them to perform more nuanced work requiring human touch points. LaMoreaux says that, in total, IBM’s HR department has saved close to 12,000 hours in the last 18 months by automating systems that previously required back-and-forth exchanges between managers and employees.The irony of IBM’s A.I. use case is that the same technology HR uses to expedite rote processes could ultimately put them out of work. In May, the company announced it would pause hiring for back-office roles—many in human resources performing duties like writing employment letters or overseeing cross-department employee transfers—A.I. could perform. LaMoreaux says the decision to freeze hiring for such roles was made intentionally and strategically.“We don’t want to bring in a bunch of people and then find out that large portions of their job are actually being transformed by A.I.,” she says. “We are being cautious. We are pausing in certain jobs, so we can shift the hiring focus to the revenue-generating, product-building pieces.”Also Read: ""Don't Rush Investments Into AI Just Because Its Cool"" Warns 'Father Of Internet' IBM Sees Ample Opportunity In AI                        gettyIt’s not an approach unique to IBM, but the company sees ample opportunity to leverage A.I. within its people operations and has invested heavily in it. IBM also uses A.I. during performance evaluation, automating the determination of which employees qualify for a raise or promotion. Its A.I. platform, LaMoreaux says, does the tedious work of culling through data, including past performance ratings, skills, whether employees are up to date on training and their length of employment. It then sends recommendations to managers to cross-check. Managers can ask the A.I. why an employee isn’t on the list. The tool may respond, for instance, that the employee hasn’t met a certification requirement, and provide dates for upcoming certification exams,  as per Fortune report.With the time saved, LaMoreaux says, managers can invest in coaching employees on how they can improve and career progression.“We’ve got over 280 different A.I. automations running inside HR right now,” LaMoreaux says. “That’s what is different here. It’s making HR more human because we’re spending time on things that matter.”  She adds: “Every company is a technology company right now. We’re all being impacted by A.I.”What IBM CEO Had Said About AI                        indiatimesEarlier this year in April, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna argued that A.I. helps employers “tackle the kind of tasks most people find repetitive, which frees up employees to take on higher-value work.” He pointed to IBM, noting that its A.I. use has cut the number of HR professionals performing manual work from 700 to fewer than 50. A.I.’s impact on the job market has long been a chief concern. The World Economic Forum had said in a report last month that A.I. could affect around 40% of all working hours, with clerical and secretarial roles likely to see a quick decline.Will AI Lead To Job Losses In IBM?The IBM boss had also noted earlier this year that he could ""easily"" see 30% of these positions substituted by AI over five years, implying about 7,800 jobs at the company are likely to be taken over by AI,On the other hand, IBM's CHRO LaMoreaux admits she’s thinking ahead to what happens if IBM terminates employees due to A.I. “The thing companies need to think about is how [they] can provide skilling and programs well ahead of time,” she says. “If you’re at the point of severance, you’re already too late.” She urges companies to be transparent about their A.I. strategy and train employees on the tools and skills needed to remain integral to the company’s hereafter, the report mentioned.Pausing hiring for certain positions seems to LaMoreaux like a sensical first step as IBM continues its A.I. experimentation, gathers data on job efficacy, and upskills talent to meet the A.I. demands of the future.                        ilr.cornell.edu“The real piece that we’ve got to get ahead of now is the 80% or 90% of jobs that aren’t going away, but that we all need to reskill on,” she says. “How can you provide skills and programs well ahead of time? Do you have a view 18 months from now? What portions of the job are going to change? Do people have access to training? That’s the pivot we need to make.”Reflecting on the change in landscape, IBM's CHRO further said “It used to be that you could get a degree, become an expert in something, and it would carry you for an entire decades-long career. The half-life of skills is now shrinking because of new technology. Whatever the next thing is, having the ability to continuously learn is the big differentiator for employees, regardless of what industry you’re going into, what job role you’re in, and if you’re early in your career or late in your career. This is going to be a defining skill.”Also Read: TCS Confirms Plan To Build Its Own ChatGPT-Like AI ToolFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

These gangs have now started using advanced image editing tools to modify admit cards in a way that examiners do not smell a rat. These tools, the sources said, ""merge"" the faces of the actual examinee and the solver in a way that the photograph on the admit card appears to be of the solver. A check by naked eye can miss the minute deviations in the photo.In a joint operation, the Special Task Force and the state Subordinate Services authorities used Artificial Intelligence-based advanced face recognition software to identity those hired to take the exam.The advanced system put in place carried out in real-time an Aadhaar-based cross verification of candidates' identities, the sources said.The sources from UP police added that they plan to scale up the use of Artificial Intelligence in their investigation into such cases. The aim is catch ""solvers"" during or right after the exam, they said.Meanwhile, state cops continue to crackdown on cheaters using technology such as bluetooth during such exams. More than 40 people were caught on Monday and Tuesday from centres hosting recruitment exams for the posts of Village Development Officers and Social Welfare Inspectors.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

Inventors, creators, and IP lawyers in Canada and worldwide are currently grappling with the same question: How can statutory regimes, developed without artificial intelligence in mind, cope with the current torrent of AI-generated creative works?
“There’s an ongoing debate – and this is around the world,” says Aird & Berlis LLP partner Amy Grenon. “If you are using AI, how do you protect the inventions that the AI will come up with?”
One of the question’s most prolific askers is Stephen Thaler, who has posed it in jurisdictions worldwide. For example, he has been trying to register one of his AI creations – Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience (DABUS) – as a patent inventor but has been unsuccessful at the US Federal Court, the UK Appeals Court, the European Patent Office, the Federal Court of Australia, and the German Federal Patent Court.

In Thaler’s US case, he named DABUS as the sole inventor. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected the patent because its “plain reading” of the Patent Act referred to inventors as natural persons, says Charles Morgan, a partner at McCarthy Tétrault, national co-leader of the firm’s cyber/data group, and former leader of the technology law group. In May 2020, in Thaler v. Vidal, the US Federal Circuit Court agreed with the USPTO and held that an AI tool does not have the right to be an inventor of a patent.

Amy Grenon, Charles Morgan and Jim Holloway
The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) similarly issued Thaler a non-compliance notice for his DABUS patent application, noting that it does not appear possible for a machine to have legal rights in Canada nor transfer them to a human. CIPO’s notice added, however, that Thaler could try re-applying and include a statement on behalf of the AI tool identifying himself as the “legal representative of the machine,” says Morgan.
In Thaler’s attempts to date, almost all the courts have said that he needs a human inventor, says Grenon, adding that “there were different glosses put on that in the various jurisdictions.” The issue has yet to be litigated in Canada, she says.
“That’s the problem with all of these statutes. The statutes were developed in the context of having humans do this, and so aren’t necessarily contemplating AI. What do you do to try and get that protection?”













Artificial intelligence is raising similar questions about copyright and trademarks. These rapidly developing issues relate to the IP protection for output – what the AI tool produces – and the input – whether the tool infringes on other IP owners when it digests data to inform its processes.
In 2021, Heritage Canada launched a consultation to explore whether and how Canada should update its copyright framework in the face of AI and the internet of things. As the law stands, a piece of work generally requires a human author for copyright protection. But in two recent cases, applicants got creative and successfully copyrighted AI-produced works.
Ankit Sahni successfully registered an AI-generated painting named SURYAST with CIPO. Sahni, from New Dehli, India, listed himself as an author and the tool RAGHAV Artificial Intelligence Painting App as the co-author. Morgan says SURYAST is the first-ever Canadian copyright registration with an AI author. But he adds that it is unclear whether CIPO would have registered the work had Sahni not included himself as a co-author.
A BC man named Hugh Stephens also recently successfully registered a poem and accompanying image created by AI language and image-generating tools ChatGPT and DALL·E 2. Stephens listed himself as the author, but part of the title states that the work was “created entirely by AI programs” and involved “minimal skill and judgement on the part of the human claiming copyright.”
According to Morgan, the US Copyright Office recently formally rejected two attempted registrations of AI-generated work and released guidance on AI-related copyright registrations.












One was A Recent Entrant to Paradise, an image Steven Thaler’s algorithm Creativity Machine produced. The Copyright Review Board affirmed the denial of Thaler’s registration because the image lacked an element of human authorship.
The same was true for the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn. The Copyright Office found that the images in the book that were produced using the AI system Midjourney were not protectable.
In March, the Copyright Office released its guidance on AI-generated work and confirmed that human authorship is required for copyright protection. The office will examine whether the work is “basically one of human authorship,” with the AI functioning as an “assisting instrument,” or whether a machine was responsible for the “traditional elements of authorship,” says Morgan. The office notes applicants should not list the AI as the author or co-author.
For generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, before they can create something based on a user prompt, they must first crawl the internet, copy massive data sets, and use them for training their systems. The IP question is whether the entity using the AI model to train on the data set has the appropriate rights to do so, says Morgan. There have already been several class actions brought against generative AI toolmakers claiming they broke copyright in the mass copying of data.
One case is against Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI. Two anonymous plaintiffs seek to represent those who own the copyright to code on GitHub. They argue that Microsoft and its subsidiaries illegally reproduced their code and breached open-source licensing terms in training Copilot, an AI coding tool. The plaintiffs launched the suit in US District Court in California in November 2022.












In Andersen v. Stability AI, MidJourney & DeviantArt, the plaintiffs accuse the defendants of training their AI image-generating tools on billions of copyrighted artworks without the artists’ consent. In doing so, the plaintiffs say the companies have violated the rights of millions of artists.
The stock-image supplier Getty Images is suing Stability AI in the US and the UK. Getty claims that Stability unlawfully copied more than 12 million images from its database without permission or compensation and to establish a competing business.
The argument in defence of these actions will be based on “fair dealing” or “fair use,” says Morgan. Under Canadian copyright law, to reproduce a substantial portion of a copyrighted work, a person must obtain the licensed right from the copyright owner. But some contexts are an exception to that rule and fall under the category of fair dealing in Canada and fair use in the US. One example is when a copyrighted work is used for research purposes.
Morgan says that the case Authors Guild v. Google Inc. will have significant precedential influence for defendants employing the fair-use doctrine in defence of generative AI.
Google had scanned tens of millions of books, made digital copies, established a search function within the books, and made snippets of the books publicly available. The Authors Guild claimed copyright infringement, but the District Court for the Southern District of New York held it was non-infringing fair use. The court found that Google’s purpose in copying the material was “highly transformative,” the snippets revealed only a limited portion of the book, and all this did not “provide a significant market substitute” for the protected work.












“The output was not simply mimicking or mirroring or replacing or providing a market substitute for the original,” says Morgan. “There had been a significant transformation in the interim, and that was deemed to be a fair use.”
Jim Holloway, a partner at Baker McKenzie, predicts Canada will soon see amendments to the Copyright Act clarifying who owns the copyright on works produced by generative AI.  Holloway’s practice focuses on intellectual property law and technology, including disputes involving trademarks, copyright, patents, and trade secrets.
Holloway says intellectual property law generally aims to reward and incentivize human creativity and inventiveness. He says the law needs to determine how to nurture these virtues in non-humans.
“At some point down the road, there’s going to be a lot of new useful and important things that are created by machines, and you have to provide incentives and rewards in order to fuel that innovation.”

AI is quickly changing the business landscape in nearly every category. Many leaders are giddy with the promise that AI will automate mundane tasks, write code, contextualize data to support decision-making and more. However, amidst these dreamy AI promises, a new narrative of opportunity and growth is taking shape as AI tools move from press conference announcements to true productivity tools.


Since Microsoft's first announcement of generative AI (GAI) search using ChatGPT in February, GAI has been a top priority for businesses worldwide as they envision a future where AI catalyzes increased productivity, efficiency and innovation. But it's not just Big Tech that has its sights set on AI. Business visionaries from companies of every size have embarked on a quest to uncover the true potential of AI and its transformative impact on how work is done. Companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Adobe, Zoho and more are helping those businesses realize that potential.

This year's Microsoft Build 2023 developer conference was a prime example of companies setting up users—from developers to SMBs to individual contributors—for success. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead wrote a complete analysis of the vast number of AI advancements Microsoft announced at Build 2023 that included some of my own insights. I want to build on that summary by looking further at how GAI tools introduced by Microsoft and others impact the everyday worker and how companies are building copilots and assistants into people's workflows to make them more productive in their day-to-day functions.

PROMOTED
Extracting the most value from AI

At Microsoft Build 2023, one of the central themes was “copilots.” While AI promises to accomplish incredible feats in many different areas, for scope of impact copilots are especially important because of how these AI assistants help people with their everyday tasks. Take the Copilot experience in Windows 11 and Edge, for example. Users can access this feature from the taskbar, providing a consistent pane across all apps. The side-pane design reduces the toggle time for accessing information and aims to boost productivity. It certainly can save time, even compared to the first integration of ChatGPT into Windows 11, which took just a few clicks to access.
Microsoft's approach aims to complement people in their roles by integrating copilots directly into users' workflows. In Microsoft 365, the Copilot feature acts as a companion in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams and more, running alongside users in apps they use daily. Microsoft 365 Copilot can boost productivity by providing real-time suggestions and assistance as users work on documents, presentations or spreadsheets. As users create content, Copilot analyzes the context and offers relevant tips, such as recommended phrases, data formatting options or relevant images to enhance the document. 365 Copilot is available now in a limited private preview, with broader availability coming soon.

Zoho recently announced similar ChatGPT-driven capabilities for current users across several applications, including Desk, Social, Writer and Mail, where people do their regular daily tasks. Zoho's AI-powered assistants are currently available to all users, and the company says it is adding GAI to products across its platform.

Firefly and the content flywheel
Earlier this year, Adobe announced Firefly, its family of generative AI models that I believe delivers a human-centered approach to AI by empowering creatives to do their best work. As part of The Six-Five Summit this week, I enjoyed chatting with Ely Greenfield, CTO of digital media at Adobe, for a spotlight session: Adobe's Approach to Generative AI. For Adobe, Firefly is just one small part of the company's AI journey.
As Greenfield explains, Firefly is the initial step in a broader plan to create additional models catering to different content types and addressing various use cases. This could potentially (likely) mean that Firefly will expand into video, audio and 3-D vector artwork, covering a wide range of creative applications.
Additionally, Adobe digital experience products will further benefit from GAI with the company's Sensei AI tool that can assist in developing campaign briefs, analyzing customer data, adapting images, targeting specific customer segments and optimizing customer journeys. The company aims to leverage these capabilities to generate compelling content and gain insights for continuous improvement.
For individual creators or large marketing teams, having the power to generate and iterate on content quickly—and on platforms they already use—is transformative. ""We know from hearing from customers that the demands for content creation and content generation are bursting at the seams right now. As customer interactions get more personalized and focused, the content needed to be generated increases exponentially. Integrating generative AI into their tools and workflows will be a massive benefit,"" Greenfield said.Webex meeting summary Cisco
Cisco calls in GAI for its suite of Webex products
This week at Cisco Live in Las Vegas, Cisco Webex announced several GAI summarization capabilities. Catch Me Up meeting recaps will offer meeting summaries with action items so that attendees won't miss anything. This is useful, for example, for someone coming in late from another meeting, plus it saves the more punctual attendees from having to repeat themselves for the latecomer. Conversation summaries within Webex allow users to give prompts and ask questions using AI as the keeper of information—allowing collaboration among participants without everyone needing to be present.
What I am most excited about in this context is summaries for Webex's Vidcast video messaging tool. Vidcast summaries will organize video information into chapters on specific themes or areas as well as overall highlights, so users can navigate to the information they need. These days, it is common enough to be double-booked and miss a meeting, only to watch it later. It is also not uncommon for a manager or coworker to benefit from knowing what transpired during a meeting they didn't attend. AI summaries are a game-changing time saver for these and other asynchronous collaboration scenarios. I am actually a big fan of “live” meetings, whether in person or by video call, but watching a playback of a meeting is my idea of torture. So summaries and transcripts are a big win for people like me.
Cisco also announced conversation summaries in Webex Cloud Contact Center. Conversation summaries for contact centers allow for a seamless handoff during escalation or dropped calls and undoubtedly will make customer interactions more efficient. There is little that’s more frustrating than a lousy customer service chatbot or infinite-loop phone-tree failure when you need customer service. With conversation summaries, when you call back, the next agent will have all that information and be ready to resolve the issue.
All of the Webex summary capabilities will be available by the end of the year. While many of Webex’s competitors like Zoom and Microsoft Teams have already announced similar capabilities, these were necessary and smart additions for the Webex platform.
In Summary
In this ever-changing business landscape, the potential for humans to flourish alongside intelligent machines is vast when used responsibly. The copilot model shows how AI can enhance operations and workflows beyond mere automation by providing contextual help that extends the effectiveness of humans rather than trying to replace them. By harnessing the power of AI alongside human ingenuity, these companies are reshaping the future of their industries.

India is poised to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive economic growth and development at scale. With its vast and diverse economy, coupled with a large population, India has a unique opportunity to leverage AI to deliver benefits to businesses, industries, and society. AI expenditure has been grown steadily since 2011, and it is projected to contribute significantly to the economy by 2035. AI start-ups in India have seen high growth since 2011, and 88% of companies surveyed are planning to invest in AI-related technologies. Most recently, India placed sixth in terms of AI investments between 2013-2022, totalling USD7.73 billion over the last ten years with about 40% of that received in 2022.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD621 billion of productive capacity in India, equivalent to close to one-fifth of GDP in 2021. India has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

Generative AI is causing many fields of expert and professional knowledge to reassess fundamental practices and their value. Taking law, a field that has long been warned of potential threats of automation, as a focus, Giulia Gentile outlines the socio-technical challenges facing the discipline and considers how new technology may rebalance relationships between lawyers, technologists and clients.

We are still wrapping our heads around the potential impact of AI in our society. No fields seem to be immune from the influence of AI, including the legal profession broadly understood. Lawyers, clerks and legal advisors across the world are all exploring the implications of AI. Two different questions are currently occupying legal professionals when it comes to AI, showcasing the Janus-faced power of this technology (and tools such as ChatGPT).
The first issue is how AI can be embedded in the legal profession to enhance the work of the legal professional. The more immediate advantage of AI is that of improving the efficiency of legal work by way of automation. Tools, such as ChatGPT, could, for instance, be used to draft contracts or skeletons of judgments. Law firms have announced the trialling of robo-lawyers.
The second, more concerning, matter is how AI could carry out at least some of the tasks traditionally performed by lawyers. Could AI replace lawyers? Inevitably, AI is raising questions that are reshaping the legal profession as a whole. This is what I want to focus on here.
1. Pressure/Complexity/Interdisciplinarity
The advance of technology is increasing the demands and the expectations from lawyers. Most lawyers currently practising have no training in data science, algorithms or AI. Therefore, currently there is an informational gap affecting the profession: any future use of AI will require lawyers to upskill and learn at least the basics of these technologies.

The degree of expertise required is debatable. Should lawyers become AI experts? This may not be achievable for the current generation. A reasonable alternative would be for lawyers to work more closely with AI experts, although this would make lawyers dependent in a way on AI experts. Moreover, such cooperation might not necessarily achieve AI systems that are fit for the purposes of lawyers – the design of AI tools for lawyers is likely to take time and input from the lawyers themselves in terms of training. Even then, by the time a system is trained new AI technology may have emerged and rendered the purpose-built tool obsolete. If so, the interdisciplinary process – pressurised by the technological race – would begin again.
This means that AI may – rather than simplifying life in the legal profession – simply risk making it much more complex and guided by the demands of technology, rather than those of clients and the law.
2. Transforming the relationship with clients?
The complexity resulting from the influence of AI on the legal profession is also reshaping the relationship between lawyers and clients. This is because the way in which AI is used in the work of lawyers also influences the liability of legal advisors and their professional obligations towards their clients. For instance, lawyers have a duty to provide their clients with clear information that is not misleading (see for instance the SRA code of conduct). The use of AI may make compliance with that duty much more difficult and complex for two reasons.
First, lawyers need to understand AI tools to be able to explain them. As mentioned, the current digital literacy of lawyers may be limited and, in any event, even experts have difficulty tracing how an AI system has taken a decision due to the ‘black box’ problem. This compromises the ability of lawyers to keep their clients informed.
Second, AI systems such as neural networks may learn on their own and acquire features that were not envisaged in the initial stage of the AI design. In addition, it is well reported how AI tools may provide information that may look correct, but it is not – so-called hallucinations. This means that these tools may be unpredictable, with significant risks of errors and potential damages to clients. Recently, a US lawyer used ChatGPT to draft briefs, which went awry when it made up authorities to support its arguments. He is now facing sanctions.
As a result, the duty of lawyers to provide clear information not to mislead their clients may prove challenging when AI is used in the professional sector based on the current technologies. These settings ultimately affect the trust that the public has towards lawyers.
3. Public perception of the legal profession using AI
No less important is the transformation of public perception and trust that the introduction of AI into the legal profession may instigate.
Clients who are being exposed to ‘robo-lawyers’, automated legal advice, or the risks deriving from the use of AI to draft contracts or other legal documents, may ultimately lose confidence and trust in the legal profession. The human dimension of the relationship between lawyers and clients is necessary to establish trust, understanding and empathy. Clients need to know that their lawyers understand their problems and will try to solve them. But this trust dynamic could be seriously undermined by robo-lawyers or over-reliance by lawyers on AI tools.
For instance, if a technology like ChatGPT were used to provide a preliminary legal advice, it may not fully understand the demands of the client. It may also fail to offer the same level of empathy, human connection, and legal creativity of a human lawyer. The essential question is: would we feel comfortable taking what could be the most important advice in your life from a robot? Troubling as the question may sound, some may answer “yes!”. Doubtless, even the best human lawyers are flawed and not all human lawyers are the cream of the crop – so one may wonder whether we should give up faith in human lawyers. But, as with automation bias in other fields, this perspective ignores that machines will also be flawed (albeit in different ways, not all of which are currently known or properly understood). A challenge for the legal profession will be demonstrating to the public that it is growing with new technologies to address human fallibility. Doing so will involve passing between Scilla and Charybdis: the desire to “keep the law human” on the one hand, and blind faith in the “superior” powers of poorly understood and developing technologies (which will inevitably be flawed) on the other.
Putting finer points to one side, could we be as passionate about Erin Brochovic and Harvey Specter if we knew they were just cold calculating machines?

Job listings asking for generative AI skills are on the rise, a new analysis from job search engine Adzuna has found.In May, Adzuna advertised 7.8 million job vacancies in the US. Among these, ads citing generative AI grew to 1,496 as of May this year compared to 185 job listings in January, and just three in May 2022.Generative AI is a relatively new tech buzzword but Corporate America has been keen to show it's on top of the new trend since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November sparked interest. Companies have been scrambling to incorporate the flood of AI products released in recent months into workflows to improve efficiency and cut costs. At least 49 listed US companies bought up ChatGPT in quarterly earnings calls in May 2023, according to an analysis of Seeking Alpha transcripts by Insider.

James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna, said: ""In the US, not only are markets powered by AI but with AI in focus for both investors and job seekers, we're seeing an increase in jobs citing Generative AI.""

The top sectors citing the AI trend were IT, engineering, scientific and QA, accounting and finance, and sales, per Adzuna. Neave added that the platform was also seeing an increase in jobs that require working with ChatGPT. These jobs are lucrative, too. The average advertised salary for jobs citing Generative AI is $146,244, while the average for jobs that require working with ChatGPT is $133,000, according to Adzuna.

""Based on Adzuna research, we expect businesses will continue posting more job ads citing Generative AI, ChatGPT, and chatbots as this year goes on,"" Neave said.The new tech trend has already popularized some jobs, including ""prompt engineers"" — experts who write text rather than code to test AI-powered chatbots. Their job is to identify errors and hidden capabilities for developers, Insider's Aaron Mok previously reported. The role doesn't always require a tech-related degree and job-seekers can earn up to $375,000 a year.

AI is also seen as a threat to some jobs. In an early analysis, Goldman Sachs predicted Generative AI could lead to significant upheaval in the labor market, affecting around 300 million jobs globally. Since then, CEOs have started explicitly saying they plan to replace some workers with AI.For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said the company plans to pause hiring for 7,800 jobs that could be replaced by AI.

No doubt many enjoyed a chuckle at the tale of Steven Schwartz, a personal-injury lawyer at the New York firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman, who last month used ChatGPT to help him prepare a court filing. He relied a bit too heavily on the artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot. It created a motion replete with made-up cases, rulings and quotes, which Mr Schwartz promptly filed after the bot assured him that the “cases I provided are real and can be found in reputable legal databases” (they were not, and cannot).

Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education.

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is a vast technology used in the education sector. Several types of AI technology are used in education (Nemorin et al., 2022). Majorly includes Plagiarism Detection, Exam Integrity (Ade-Ibijola et al., 2022), Chatbots for Enrollment and Retention (Nakitare and Otike, 2022), Learning Management Systems, Transcription of Faculty Lectures, Enhanced Online Discussion Boards, Analyzing Student Success Metrics, and Academic Research (Nakitare and Otike, 2022). Nowadays, Education Technology (EdTech) companies are deploying emotional AI to quantify social and emotional learning (McStay, 2020). Artificial intelligence, affective computing methods, and machine learning are collectively called “emotional AI” (AI). Artificial intelligence (AI) shapes our future more powerfully than any other century’s invention. Anyone who does not understand it will soon feel left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic (Maini and Sabri, 2017). Undoubtedly, AI technology has significant importance, and its role has been witnessed in the recent pandemic. Many researchers agree it can be essential in education (Sayed et al., 2021). but this does not mean it will always be beneficial and free from ethical concerns (Dastin, 2018). Due to this, many researchers focus on its development and use but keep their ethical considerations in mind (Justin and Mizuko, 2017). Some believe that although the intentions behind AI in education may be positive, this may not be sufficient to prove it ethical (Whittaker and Crawford, 2018).There is a severe need to understand the meaning of being “ethical” in the context of AI and education. It is also essential to find out the possible unintended consequences of the use of AI in education and the main concerns of AI in education, and other considerations. Generally, AI’s ethical issues and concerns are innovation cost, consent issues, personal data misuse, criminal and malicious use, freedom and autonomy loss, and the decision-making loss of humans, etc. (Stahl B. C., 2021a, 2021b). Although, technology also enhances organizational information security (Ahmad et al., 2021) and competitive advantage (Sayed and Muhammad, 2015) and enhances customer relationships (Rasheed et al., 2015). Researchers are afraid that by 2030 the AI revolution will focus on enhancing benefits and social control but will also raise ethical concerns, and there is no consensus among them. A clear division regarding AI’s positive impact on life and moral standing (Rainie et al., 2021).It is evident from the literature on the ethics of AI that besides its enormous advantages, many challenges also emerge with the development of AI in the context of moral values, behavior, trust, and privacy, to name a few. The education sector faces many ethical challenges while implementing or using AI. Many researchers are exploring the area further. We divide AI in education into three levels. First, the technology itself, its manufacturer, developer, etc. The second is its impact on the teacher, and the third is on the learner or student.Foremost, there is a need to develop AI technology for education, which cannot be the basis of ethical issues or concerns (Ayling and Chapman, 2022). The high expectations of AI have triggered worldwide interest and concern, generating 400+ policy documents on responsible AI. Intense discussions over ethical issues lay a helpful foundation, preparing researchers, managers, policymakers, and educators for constructive discussions that will lead to clear recommendations for building reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems that will be a commercial success (Landwehr, 2015). But the question is, is it possible to develop an AI technology for education that will never cause an ethical concern? Maybe the developer or the manufacturer has dishonest gain from the AI technology in education. Maybe their intentions are not towards the betterment and assistance of education. Such questions come to mind when someone talks about the impact of AI in Education. Even if the development of AI technology is clear from any ethical concerns from the developer or manufacturer, there is no guarantee for the opposite view. The risk of ethical considerations will also rely upon the technical quality. Higher quality will minimize the risk but is it possible for all educational institutions to implement expensive technology of higher quality? (Shneiderman, 2021). Secondly, many issues may arise when teachers use AI technology (Topcu and Zuck, 2020). It may be security, usage, implementation, etc. Questions about security, bias, affordability, trust, etc., come to mind (IEEE, 2019). Thirdly, privacy, trust, safety, and health issues exist at the user level. To address such questions, a robust regulatory framework and policies are required. Still, unfortunately, no framework has been devised, no guidelines have been agreed upon, no policies have been developed, and no regulations have been enacted to address the ethical issues raised by AI in education (Rosé et al., 2018).It is evident that AI technology has many concerns (Stahl B. C., 2021a, 2021b), and like other sectors, the education sector is also facing challenges (Hax, 2018). If not all the issues/problems directly affect education and learning, most directly or indirectly impact the education process. So, it is difficult to decide whether AI has a positive ethical impact on education or negative or somewhat positive or negative. The debate on ethical concerns about AI technology will continue from case to case and context to context (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020). This research is focused on the following three moral fears of AI in education:

1.
Security and privacy


2.
Loss of human decision-making


3.
Making humans lazy

Although many other concerns about AI exist in education, these three are the most common and challenging in the current era. Additionally, no researcher can broaden the study beyond the scope.Theoretical discussionAI in educationTechnology has impacted almost every sector; reasonably, it also needs time (Leeming, 2021). From telecommunication to communication and health to education, it plays a significant role and assists humanity in one way or another (Stahl A., 2021a, 2021b). No one can deny its importance and applications for life, which provides a solid reason for its existence and development. One of the most critical technologies is artificial intelligence (AI) (Ross, 2021). AI has applications in many sectors, and education is one. Many AI applications in education include tutoring, educational assistance, feedback, social robots, admission, grading, analytics, trial and error, virtual reality, etc. (Tahiru, 2021).AI is based on computer programming or computational approaches; questions can be raised on the process of data analysis, interpretation, sharing, and processing (Holmes et al., 2019) and how the biases should be prevented, which may impact the rights of students as it is believed that design biases may increase with time and how it will address concerns associated with gender, race, age, income inequality, social status, etc. (Tarran, 2018). Like any other technology, there are also some challenges related to AI and its application in education and learning. This paper focuses on the ethical concerns of AI in education. Some problems are related to privacy, data access, right and wrong responsibility, and student records, to name a few (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020). In addition, data hacking and manipulation can challenge personal privacy and control; a need exists to understand the ethical guidelines clearly (Fjelland, 2020).Perhaps the most important ethical guidelines for developing educational AI systems are well-being, ensuring workplace safety, trustworthiness, fairness, honoring intellectual property rights, privacy, and confidentiality. In addition, the following ten principles were also framed (Aiken and Epstein, 2000).

1.
Ensure encouragement of the user.


2.
Ensure safe human–machine interaction and collaborative learning


3.
Positive character traits are to be ensured.


4.
Overloading of information to be avoided


5.
Build an encouraging and curious learning environment


6.
Ergonomics features to be considered


7.
Ensure the system promotes the roles and skills of a teacher and never replaces him


8.
Having respect for cultural values


9.
Ensure diversity accommodation of students


10.
Avoid glorifying the system and weakening the human role and potential for growth and learning.

If the above principles are discussed individually, many questions arise while using AI technology in education. From its design and planning to use and impact, at every stage, ethical concerns arise and are there. It’s not the purpose for which AI technology is developed and designed. Technology is advantageous for one thing but dangerous for another, and the problem is how to disintegrate the two (Vincent and van, 2022).In addition to the proper framework and principles not being followed during the planning and development of AI for Education, bias, overconfidence, wrong estimates, etc., are additional sources of ethical concerns.Security and privacy issuesStephen Hawking once said that success in creating AI would be the most significant event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last unless we learn to avoid the risks. Security is one of the major concerns associated with AI and learning (Köbis and Mehner, 2021). Trust-worthy artificial intelligence (AI) in education: Promises and challenges (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020; Owoc et al., 2021). Most educational institutions nowadays use AI technology in the learning process, and the area attracted researchers and interests. Many researchers agree that AI significantly contributes to e-learning and education (Nawaz et al. 2020; Ahmed and Nashat, 2020). Their claim is practically proved by the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Torda, 2020; Cavus et al., 2021). But AI or machine learning also brought many concerns and challenges to the education sector, and security and privacy are the biggest.No one can deny that AI systems and applications are becoming a part of classrooms and education in one form or another (Sayantani, 2021). Each tool works according to its way, and the student and teacher use it accordingly. It creates an immersive learning experience using voices to access information and invites potential privacy and security risks (Gocen and Aydemir, 2020). While answering a question related to privacy concerns focuses on student safety as the number one concern of AI devices and usage. The same may go for the teacher’s case as well.Additionally, teachers know less about the rights, acts, and laws of privacy and security, their impact and consequences, and any violations cost to the students, teachers, and country (Vadapalli, 2021). Machine learning or AI systems are purely based on data availability. Without data, it is nothing, and the risk is unavoidable of its misuse and leaks for a lousy purpose (Hübner, 2021).AI systems collect and use enormous data for making predictions and patterns; there is a chance of biases and discrimination (Weyerer and Langer, 2019). Many people are now concerned with the ethical attributes of AI systems and believe that the security issue must be considered in AI system development and deployment (Samtani et al., 2021). The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal is one of the significant examples of how data collected through technology is vulnerable to privacy concerns. Although much work has been done, as the National Science Foundation recognizes, much more is still necessary (Calif, 2021). According to Kurt Markley, schools, colleges, and universities have big banks of student records comprising data related to their health, social security numbers, payment information, etc., and are at risk. It is necessary that learning institutions continuously re-evaluate and re-design the security practices to make the data secure and prevent any data breaches. The trouble is even more in remote learning environments or when information technology is effective (Chan and Morgan, 2019).It is also of importance and concern that in the current era of advanced technology, AI systems are getting more interconnected to cybersecurity due to the advancement of hardware and software (Mengidis et al., 2019). This has raised significant concerns regarding the security of various stakeholders and emphasizes the procedures the policymakers must adopt to prevent or minimize the threat (ELever and Kifayat, 2020). It is also important to note that security concerns increase with network and endpoints in remote learning. One problem is that protecting e-learning technology from cyber-attacks is neither easy nor requires less money, especially in the education sector, with a limited budget for academic activities (Huls, 2021). Another reason this severe threat exists is because of very few technical staff in an educational institution; hiring them is another economic issue. Although, to some extent, using intelligent technology of AI and machine learning, the level and threat of security decrease, again, the issue is that neither every teacher is a professional and trained enough to use the technology nor able to handle the common threats. And as the use of AI in education increases, the danger of security concerns also increases (Taddeo et al., 2019). No one can run from the threat of AI concerning cybersecurity, and it behaves like a double-edged sword (Siau and Wang, 2020).Digital security is the most significant risk and ethical concern of using AI in education systems, where criminals hack machines and sell data for other purposes (Venema, 2021). We alter our safety and privacy (Sutton et al., 2018). The question remains: whether our privacy is secured, and when will AI systems become able to keep our confidentiality connected? The answer is beyond human knowledge (Kirn, 2007).Human interactions with AI are increasing day by day. For example, various AI applications, like robots, chatbots, etc., are used in e-learning and education. Many will learn human-like habits one day, but some human attributes, like self-awareness, consciousness, etc., will remain a dream. AI still needs data and uses it for learning patterns and making decisions; privacy will always remain an issue (Mhlanga, 2021). On the one hand, it is a fact that AI systems are associated with various human rights issues, which can be evaluated from case to case. AI has many complex pre-existing impacts regarding human rights because it is not installed or implemented against a blank slate but as a backdrop of societal conditions. Among many human rights that international law assures, privacy is impacted by it (Levin, 2018). From the discussed review, we draw the following hypothesis.
H1: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence on the security and privacy issues
Making humans lazyAI is a technology that significantly impacts Industry 4.0, transforming almost every aspect of human life and society (Jones, 2014). The rising role of AI in organizations and individuals feared the persons like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. Who thinks it is possible when AI reaches its advanced level, there is a risk it might be out of control for humans (Clark et al., 2018). It is alarming that research increased eight times compared to the other sectors. Most firms and countries invest in capturing and growing AI technologies, skills, and education (Oh et al., 2017). Yet the primary concern of AI adoption is that it complicates the role of AI in sustainable value creation and minimizes human control (Noema, 2021).When the usage and dependency of AI are increased, this will automatically limit the human brain’s thinking capacity. This, as a result, rapidly decreases the thinking capacity of humans. This removes intelligence capacities from humans and makes them more artificial. In addition, so much interaction with technology has pushed us to think like algorithms without understanding (Sarwat, 2018). Another issue is the human dependency on AI technology in almost every walk of life. Undoubtedly, it has improved living standards and made life easier, but it has impacted human life miserably and made humans impatient and lazy (Krakauer, 2016). It will slowly and gradually starve the human brain of thoughtfulness and mental efforts as it gets deep into each activity, like planning and organizing. High-level reliance on AI may degrade professional skills and generate stress when physical or brain measures are needed (Gocen and Aydemir, 2020).AI is minimizing our autonomous role, replacing our choices with its choices, and making us lazy in various walks of life (Danaher, 2018). It is argued that AI undermines human autonomy and responsibilities, leading to a knock-out effect on happiness and fulfilment (C. Eric, 2019). The impact will not remain on a specific group of people or area but will also encompass the education sector. Teachers and students will use AI applications while doing a task/assignment, or their work might be performed automatically. Progressively, getting an addiction to AI use will lead to laziness and a problematic situation in the future. To summarize the review, the following hypothesis is made:
H2: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence on human laziness
Loss of human decision-makingTechnology plays an essential role in decision-making. It helps humans use information and knowledge properly to make suitable decisions for their organization and innovations (Ahmad, 2019). Humans are producing large volumes of data, and to make it efficient, firms are adopting and using AI and kicking humans out of using the data. Humans think they are getting benefits and saving time by using AI in their decisions. But it is overcoming the human biological processors through lowing cognition capabilities (Jarrahi, 2018).It is a fact that AI technologies and applications have many benefits. Still, AI technologies have severe negative consequences, and the limitation of their role in human decision-making is one of them. Slowly and gradually, AI limits and replaces the human role in decision-making. Human mental capabilities like intuitive analysis, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving are getting out of decision-making (Ghosh et al., 2019). Consequently, this will lead to their loss as there is a saying, use it or lose it. The speed of adaptation of AI technology is evident from the usage of AI in the strategic decision-making processes, which has increased from 10 to 80% in five years (Sebastian and Sebastian, 2021).Walmart and Amazon have integrated AI into their recruitment process and make decisions about their product. And it’s getting more into the top management decisions (Libert, 2017). Organizations use AI to analyze data and make complex decisions effectively to obtain a competitive advantage. Although AI is helping the decision-making process in various sectors, humans still have the last say in making any decision. It highlights the importance of humans’ role in the process and the need to ensure that AI technology and humans work side by side (Meissner and Keding, 2021). The hybrid model of the human–machine collaboration approach is believed to merge in the future (Subramaniam, 2022).The role of AI in decision-making in educational institutions is spreading daily. Universities are using AI in both academic and administrative activities. From students searching for program admission requirements to the issuance of degrees, they are now assisted by AI personalization, tutoring, quick responses, 24/7 access to learning, answering questions, and task automation are the leading roles AI plays in the education sector (Karandish, 2021).In all the above roles, AI collects data, analyzes it, and then responds, i.e., makes decisions. It is necessary to ask some simple but essential questions: Does AI make ethical choices? The answer is AI was found to be racist, and its choice might not be ethical (Tran, 2021). The second question is, does AI impact human decision-making capabilities? While using an intelligent system, applicants may submit their records directly to the designer and get approval for admission tests without human scrutiny. One reason is that the authorities will trust the system; the second may be the laziness created by task automation among the leaders.Similarly, in keeping the records of students and analyzing their data, again, the choice will be dependent on the decision made by the system, either due to trust or due to the laziness created by task automation among the authorities. Almost in every task, the teachers and other workers lose the power of cognition while making academic or administrative decisions. And their dependency increases daily on the AI systems installed in the institution. To summarize the review, in any educational organization, AI makes operations automatic and minimizes staff participation in performing various tasks and making decisions. The teachers and other administrative staff are helpless in front of AI as the machines perform many of their functions. They are losing the skills of traditional tasks to be completed in an educational setting and consequently losing the reasoning capabilities of decision-making.
H3: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence with the loss of human decision making
Conceptual frameworkFig. 1Fig. 1: Proposed model.The impact of artificial intelligence on human loss in decision making, laziness, and safety in education.Full size imageMethodologyResearch designThe research philosophy focuses on the mechanism of beliefs and assumptions regarding knowledge development. It is precisely what the researcher works on while conducting research and mounting expertise in a particular area. In this research, the positivist philosophy of analysis is used. Positivism focuses on an observable social reality that produces the laws, just like generalizations. This philosophy uses the existing theory for hypotheses development in this study.Furthermore, this philosophy is used because this study is about measurable and quantifiable data. The quantitative method is followed for data collection and analysis in this research. The quantitative practice focuses on quantifiable numbers and provides a systematic approach to assessing incidences and their associations. Moreover, while carrying out this study, the author evaluated the validity and reliability tools to ensure rigor in data. The primary approach is used because the data collected in this research is first-hand, which means it is collected directly from the respondents.Sample and sampling techniquesThe purposive sampling technique was used in this study for the primary data collection. This technique is used because it targets a small number of participants to participate in the survey, and their feedback shows the entire population (Davies and Hughes, 2014). Purposive sampling is a recognized non-probabilistic sampling technique because the author chose the participants based on the study’s purpose. The respondents of this study were students at different universities in Pakistan and China. Following the ethical guidelines, consent was taken from the participants. After that, they were asked to give their responses through a questionnaire. The number of participants who took part in the study was 285. This data collection was around two months, from 4 July 2022 to 31 August 2022.MeasuresThe survey instrument is divided into two parts. The initial portion of the questionnaire comprised demographic questions that included gender, age, country, and educational level. The second portion of the instrument had the Likert scale questions of the latent variables. This study model is composed of four latent variables. All four latent variables are measured through their developed Likert scale questions. All five measures of the latent variables are adopted from the different past studies that have developed and validated these scales. The measures of artificial intelligence are composed of seven items adopted from the study of Suh and Ahn (2022). The loss measures in decision-making consist of five items adopted from the study of Niese (2019). The measures of safety and security issues are composed of five items adopted from the study of Youn (2009). The measure of human laziness comprises four items adopted from the study of Dautov (2020). All of them are measured on the Likert scale of five, one for the least level of agreement and five for the highest level of agreement. Table 1 shows the details of the items of each construct.Table 1 Measures.Full size tableCommon method biasCMB is a major problem faced by the researcher working on the primary survey data research. There are many causes for this dilemma. The primary reason is the response tendency, in which the respondents of the research rate equally to all questions (Jordan and Troth, 2020). A model’s VIF values are not limited to multi-collinearity diagnostics but also indicate the common method bias (Kock, 2015). If the VIF values of the individual items present in the model are equal to or <3.3, then it is considered that the model is free from the common method bias. Table 2 shows that all the VIF values are <3.3, which indicates that the data collected by the primary survey is almost free from the issues of common bias.Table 2 Multicollinearity statistics.Full size tableReliability and validity of the dataReliability and validity confirm the health of the instrument and survey data for further analysis. Two tools are used in structural equation modeling for reliability: item reliability and construct reliability. The outer loading of each item gauges the item’s reliability. Its threshold value is 0.706, but in some cases, even 0.5 is also acceptable if the basic assumption of the convergent validity is not violated (Hair and Alamer, 2022). Cronbach’s Alpha and composite reliability are the most used tools to measure construct reliability. The threshold value is 0.7 (Hair Jr et al., 2021). Table 3 shows that all the items of each construct have outer loading values greater than 0.7. Only one item of artificial intelligence and one item of decision making is below 0.7 but within the minimum limit of 0.4, and both AVE values are also good. While each construct Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values are >0.7, both measures of reliability, item reliability, and construct reliability are established. For the validity of the data, there are also two measures used one is convergent validity, and the other is discriminant validity. For convergent validity, AVE values are used. The threshold value for the AVE is 0.5 (Hair and Alamer, 2022). From the table of reliability and validity, all the constructs have AVE values >0.5, indicating that all the constructs are convergently valid.Table 3 Reliability and validity.Full size tableIn Smart-PLS, three tools are used to measure discriminant validity: the Farnell Larker criteria, HTMT ratios, and the cross-loadings of the items. The threshold value for the Farnell Licker criteria is that the diagonal values of the table must be greater than the values of its corresponding rows and columns. Table 4 shows that all the diagonal values of the square root of the AVE are greater than their corresponding values of both columns and rows. The threshold value for the HTMT values is 0.85 or less (Joe F. Hair Jr et al., 2020). Table 5 shows that all the values are less than 0.85. Table 6 shows that they must have self-loading with their construct values greater than the cross-loading with other constructs. Table 6 shows that all the self-loadings are greater than the cross-loadings. All three above measures of discriminant validity show that the data is discriminately valid.Table 4 Fornell Larcker criteria.Full size tableTable 5 HTMT values.Full size tableTable 6 Cross-loadings.Full size tableResults and discussionDemographic profile of the respondentsTable 7 shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Among 285 respondents, 164 (75.5%) are male, while 121 (42.5%) are female. The data was collected from different universities in China and Pakistan. The table shows that 142 (50.2%) are Chinese students, and 141 (49.8%) are Pakistani students. The age group section shows that the students are divided into three age groups, <20 years, 20–25 years, and 26 years and above. Most students belong to the age group 20–25 years, which is 140 (49.1%), while 26 (9.1%) are <20 years old and 119 (41.8%) are 26 years and above. The fourth and last section of the table shows the program of the student’s studies. According to this, 149 (52.3%) students are undergraduates, 119 (41.8%) are graduates, and 17 (6%) are post-graduates.Table 7 Demographic distribution of respondents.Full size tableStructural modelThe structural model explains the relationships among study variables. The proposed structural model is exhibited in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Results model for the Impact of artificial intelligence on human loss in decision-making, laziness, and safety in education.Full size imageRegression analysisTable 8 shows the total direct relationships in the model. The first direct relationship is between artificial intelligence to loss in human decision-making, with a beta value of 0.277. The beta value shows that one unit increase in artificial intelligence will lose human decision-making by 0.277 units among university students in Pakistan and China. This relationship having the t value of 5.040, greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and a p-value of 0.000, <0.05, shows that the relationship is statistically significant. The second relationship is between artificial intelligence the human laziness. The beta value for this relationship is 0.689, which shows that one unit increase in artificial intelligence will make the students of Pakistan and China universities lazy by 0.689 units. The t-value for the relationship is 23.257, which is greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and a p-value of 0.000, which is smaller than the threshold value of 0.05, which shows that this relationship is also statistically significant. The third and last relationship is from artificial intelligence to security and privacy issues of Pakistani and Chinese university students. The beta value for this relationship is 0.686, which shows that a one-unit increase in artificial intelligence will increase security and privacy issues by 0.686. The t-value for the relationship is 17.105, which is greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and the p-value is 0.000, which is smaller than a threshold value of 0.05, indicating that this relationship is also statistically significant.Table 8 Regression analysis.Full size tableHypothesis testingTable 8 also indicates that the results support all three hypotheses.Model fitnessOnce the reliability and validity of the measurement model are confirmed, the structural model fitness must be assessed in the next step. For the model fitness, several measures are available in the SmartPLS, like SRMR, Chi-square, NFI, etc., but most of the researcher recommends the SRMR for the model fitness in the PLS-SEM. When applying PLS-SEM, a value <0.08 is generally considered a good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1998). However, the table of model fitness shows that the SRMR value is 0.06, which is less than the threshold value of 0.08, which indicates that the model is fit.Predictive relevance of the modelTable 9 shows the model’s prediction power, as we know that the model has total dependent variables. Then there are three predictive values for the model for each variable. The threshold value for predicting the model power is greater than zero. However, Q2 values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35, respectively, indicate that an independent variable of the model has a low, moderate, or high predictive relevance for a certain endogenous construct (Hair et al., 2013). Human laziness has the highest predictive relevance, with a Q2 value of 0.338, which shows a moderate effect. Safety and security issues have the second largest predictive relevance with the Q2 value of 0.314, which also show a moderate effect. The last and smallest predictive relevance in decision-making with a Q2 value of 0.033 which shows a low effect. A greater Q2 value shows that the variable or model has the highest prediction power.Table 9 IPMA analysis.Full size tableImportance performance matrix analysis (IPMA)Table 10 shows the importance and performance of each independent variable for the dependent variables. We see that artificial intelligence has the same performance of 68.78% for all three variables: human laziness, decision-making, safety, and security. While the importance of artificial intelligence, human laziness is 68.9%, loss in decision-making is 25.1%, and safety and security are 74.6%. This table shows that safety and privacy have the highest importance, and their performance is recommended to be increased to meet the important requirements. Figures 3–5 also show all three variables’ importance compared to performance with artificial intelligence.Table 10 Multi-group (analysis of gender)a.Full size tableFig. 3Importance-performance map—human loss in decision making and artificial intelligence.Full size imageFig. 4Importance-performance map—human laziness and artificial intelligence.Full size imageFig. 5Importance-performance map—safety and privacy and artificial intelligence.Full size imageMulti-group analysis (MGA)Multigroup analysis is a technique in structural equation modeling that compares the effects of two classes of categorical variables on the model’s relationships. The first category is gender, composed of male and female subgroups or types. Table 10 shows the gender comparison for all three relationships. The data record shows that there were 164 males and 121 females. The p-values of all three relationships are >0.05, which shows that gender is not moderate in any of the relationships. Table 10 shows the country-wise comparison for all three relationships in the model. The p-values of all three relationships are >0.05, indicating no moderating effect of the country on all three relationships. The data records show 143 Pakistanis and 142 Chinese based on the country’s origin.DiscussionAI is becoming an increasingly important element of our lives, with its impact felt in various aspects of our daily life. Like any other technological advancement, there are both benefits and challenges. This study examined the association of AI with human loss in decision-making, laziness and safety and privacy concerns. The results given Tables 11 and 12 show that AI has a significant positive relationship with all these variables. The findings of this study also support that the use of AI technologies is creating problems for users related to security and privacy. Previous research has also shown similar results (Bartoletti, 2019; Saura et al., 2022; Bartneck et al., 2021). Using AI technology in an educational organization also leads to security and privacy issues for students, teachers, and institutions. In today’s information age, security and privacy are critical concerns of AI technology use in educational organizations (Kamenskih, 2022). Skills specific to using AI technology are required for its effective use. Insufficient knowledge about the use will lead to security and privacy issues (Vazhayil and Shetty, 2019). Mostly, educational firms do not have AI technology experts in managing it, which again increases its vulnerability in the context of security and privacy issues. Even if its users have sound skills and the firms have experienced AI managers, no one can deny that any security or privacy control could be broken by mistake and could lead to serious security and privacy problems. Moreover, the fact that people with different levels of skills and competence interact in educational organizations also leads to the hacking or leaking of personal and institutional data (Kamenskih, 2022). AI is based on algorithms and uses large data sets to automate instruction (Araujo et al., 2020). Any mistake in the algorithms will create serious problems, and unlike humans, it will repeat the same mistake in making its own decisions. It also increases the threat to institutional and student data security and privacy. The same challenge is coming from the student end. They can be easily victimized as they are not excellently trained to use AI (Asaro, 2019). With the increase in the number of users, competence division and distance, safety and privacy concerns increase (Lv and Singh, 2020). The consequences depend upon the nature of the attack and the data been leaked or used by the attackers (Vassileva, 2008).Table 11 Model fitness.Full size tableTable 12 Predictive relevance of the model.Full size tableThe findings show that AI-based products and services are increasing the human laziness factor among those relying more on AI. However, there were not too many studies conducted on this factor by the researcher in the past, but the numerous researchers available in the literature also endorse the findings of this study (Farrow, 2022; Bartoletti, 2019). AI in education leads to the creation of laziness in humans. AI performs repetitive tasks in an automated manner and does not let humans memorize, use analytical mind skills, or use cognition (Nikita, 2023). It leads to an addiction behavior not to use human capabilities, thus making humans lazy. Teachers and students who use AI technology will slowly and gradually lose interest in doing tasks themselves. This is another important concern of AI in the education sector (Crispin Andrews). The teachers and students are getting lazy and losing their decision-making abilities as much of the work is assisted or replaced by AI technology (BARON, 2023). Posner and Fei-Fei (2020) suggested it is time to change AI for education.The findings also show that the access use of AI will gradually lead to the loss of human decision-making power. The results also endorsed the statement that AI is one of the major causes of the human loss of decision-making power. Several researchers from the past have also found that AI is a major cause responsible for the gradual loss of people’s decision-making (Pomerol, 1997; Duan et al., 2019; Cukurova et al., 2019). AI performs repetitive tasks in an automated manner and does not let humans memorize, use analytical mind skills, or use cognition, leading to the loss of decision-making capabilities (Nikita, 2023). An online environment for education can be a good option (VanLangen, 2021), but the classroom’s physical environment is the prioritized education mode (Dib and Adamo, 2014). In a real environment, there is a significant level of interaction between the teacher and students, which develop the character and civic bases of the students, e.g., students can learn from other students, ask teachers questions, and even feel the education environment. Along with the curriculum, they can learn and adopt many positive understandings (Quinlan et al., 2014). They can learn to use their cognitive power to choose options, etc. But unfortunately, the use of AI technology minimizes the real-time physical interaction (Mantello et al., 2021) and the education environment between students and teachers, which has a considerable impact on students’ schooling, character, civic responsibility, and their power to make decisions, i.e., use their cognition. AI technology reduces the cognitive power of humans who make their own decisions (Hassani and Unger, 2020).AI technology has undoubtedly transformed or at least affected many fields (IEEE, 2019; Al-Ansi and Al-Ansi, 2023). Its applications have been developed for the benefit of humankind (Justin and Mizuko, 2017). As technology assists employees in many ways, they must be aware of the pros and cons of the technology and must know its applications in a particular field (Nadir et al., 2012). Technology and humans are closely connected; the success of one is strongly dependent on the other; therefore, there is a need to ensure the acceptance of technology for human welfare (Ho et al., 2022). Many researchers have discussed the user’s perception of a technology (Vazhayil and Shetty, 2019), and many have emphasized its legislative and regulatory issues (Khan et al., 2014). Therefore, careful selection is necessary to adopt or implement any technology (Ahmad and Shahid, 2015). Once imagined in films, AI now runs a significant portion of the technology, i.e., health, transport, space, and business. As AI enters the education sector, it has been affected to a greater extent (Hübner, 2021). AI further strengthened its role in education, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and invaded the traditional way of teaching by providing many opportunities to educational institutions, teachers, and students to continue their educational processes (Štrbo, 2020; Al-Ansi, 2022; Akram et al., 2021). AI applications/technology like chatbots, virtual reality, personalized learning systems, social robots, tutoring systems, etc., assist the educational environment in facing modern-day challenges and shape education and learning processes (Schiff, 2021). In addition, it is also helping with administrative tasks like admission, grading, curriculum setting, and record-keeping, to name a few (Andreotta and Kirkham, 2021). It can be said that AI is likely to affect, enter and shape the educational process on both the institutional and student sides to a greater extent (Xie et al., 2021). This phenomenon hosts some questions regarding the ethical concerns of AI technology, its implementation, and its impact on universities, teachers, and students.The study has similar findings to the report published by the Harvard Kennedy School, where AI concerns like privacy, automation of tasks, and decision-making are discussed. It says that AI is not the solution to government problems but helps enhance efficiency. It is important to note that the report does not deny the role of AI but highlights the issues. Another study says that AI-based and human decisions must be combined for more effective decisions. i.e., the decisions made by AI must be evaluated and checked, and the best will be chosen by humans from the ones recommended by AI (Shrestha et al., 2019). The role of AI cannot be ignored in today’s technological world. It assists humans in performing complex tasks, providing solutions to many complex problems, assisting in decision-making, etc. But on the other hand, it is replacing humans, automating tasks, etc., which creates challenges and demands for a solution (Duan et al., 2019). People are generally concerned about risks and have conflicting opinions about the fairness and effectiveness of AI decision-making, with broad perspectives altered by individual traits (Araujo et al. 2020).There may be many reasons for these controversial findings, but the cultural factor was considered one of the main factors (Elliott, 2019). According to researchers, people with high cultural values have not adopted the AI problem, so this cultural constraint remains a barrier for the AI to influence their behaviors (Di Vaio et al., 2020; Mantelero, 2018). The other thing is that privacy is a term that has a different meaning from culture to culture (Ho et al., 2022). In some cultures, people consider minimal interference in personal life a big privacy issue, while in some cultures, people even ignore these types of things (Mantello et al., 2021). The results are similar to Zhang et al. (2022), Aiken and Epstein (2000), and Bhbosale et al. (2020), which focus on the ethical issues of AI in education. These studies show that AI use in education is the reason for laziness among students and teachers. In short, the researchers are divided on the AI concerns in education, just like in other sectors. But they agree on the positive role AI plays in education. AI in education leads to laziness, loss of decision-making capabilities, and security or privacy issues. But all these issues can be minimized if AI is properly implemented, managed, and used in education.ImplicationsThe research has important implications for technology developers, the organization that adopts the technology, and the policymakers. The study highlights the importance of addressing ethical concerns during AI technology’s development and implementation stage. It also provides guidelines for the government and policymakers regarding the issues arising with AI technology and its implementation in any organization, especially in education. AI can revolutionize the education sector, but it has some potential drawbacks. Implications suggest that we must be aware of the possible impact of AI on laziness, decision-making, privacy, and security and that we should design AI systems that have a very minimal impact.
Managerial Implications
Those associated with the development and use of AI technology in education need to find out the advantages and challenges of AI in this sector and balance these advantages with the challenges of laziness, decision-making, and privacy or security while protecting human creativity and intuition. AI systems should be designed to be transparent and ethical in all manners. Educational organizations should use AI technology to assist their teachers in their routine activities, not to replace them.
Theoretical Implications
A loss of human decision-making capacity is one of the implications of AI in education. Since AI systems are capable of processing enormous amounts of data and producing precise predictions, there is a risk that humans would become overly dependent on AI in making decisions. This may reduce critical thinking and innovation for both students and teachers, which could lower the standard of education. Educators should be aware of how AI influences decision-making processes and must balance the benefits of AI with human intuition and creativity. AI may potentially affect school security. AI systems can track student behavior, identify potential dangers, and identify situations where children might require more help. There are worries that AI could be applied to unjustly target particular student groups or violate students’ privacy. Therefore, educators must be aware of the potential ethical ramifications of AI and design AI systems that prioritize security and privacy for users and educational organizations. AI makes people lazier is another potential impact on education. Teachers and learners may become more dependent on AI systems and lose interest in performing activities or learning new skills or methodologies. This might lead to a decline in educational quality and a lack of personal development among people. Therefore, teachers must be aware of the possible detrimental impacts of AI on learners’ motivation and should create educational environments that motivate them to participate actively in getting an education.
ConclusionAI can significantly affect the education sector. Though it benefits education and assists in many academic and administrative tasks, its concerns about the loss of decision-making, laziness, and security may not be ignored. It supports decision-making, helps teachers and students perform various tasks, and automates many processes. Slowly and gradually, AI adoption and dependency in the education sector are increasing, which invites these challenges. The results show that using AI in education increases the loss of human decision-making capabilities, makes users lazy by performing and automating the work, and increases security and privacy issues.Recommendations

1.
The designer’s foremost priority should be ensuring that AI will not cause any ethical concerns in education. Realistically, it is impossible, but at least severe ethical problems (both individual and societal) can be minimized during this phase.


2.
AI technology and applications in education need to be backed by solid and secure algorithms that ensure the technology’s security, privacy, and users.


3.
Bias behavior of AI must be minimized, and issues of loss of human decision-making and laziness must be addressed.


4.
Dependency on AI technology in decision-making must be reduced to a certain level to protect human cognition.


5.
Teachers and students should be given training before using AI technology.

Future work

1.
Research can be conducted to study the other concerns of AI in education which were not studied.


2.
Description and enumeration of the documents under analysis.


3.
Procedure for the analysis of documents. Discourse analysis and categorization.


4.
Similar studies can be conducted in other geographic areas and countries.

LimitationsThis study is limited to three basic ethical concerns of AI: loss of decision-making, human laziness, and privacy and security. Several other ethical concerns need to be studied. Other research methodologies can be adopted to make it more general.

Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue.', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2023-06-29T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '14', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01787-8', 'keywords': ['Education', 'Information systems and information technology', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig3_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig4_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig5_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Humanities and Social Sciences Communications', 'issn': ['2662-9992'], 'volumeNumber': '10', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Palgrave Macmillan UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Sayed Fayaz Ahmad', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Institute of Business Management', 'address': {'name': 'Institute of Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'fayaz.ahmed@iobm.edu.pk', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Heesup Han', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6356-3001', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Sejong University', 'address': {'name': 'Sejong University, Seoul, Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'heesup.han@gmail.com', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Muhammad Mansoor Alam', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Riphah International University', 'address': {'name': 'Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Mohd.

The game-changing release of ChatGPT has everyone talking about — and worried about — how generative AI will change the way we work. With every new technology, there are disruptions to the job market, but something feels different about ChatGPT and similar programs like Google Bard and Microsoft Bing AI.
Generative AI is a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms to generate original text, images, software code, Excel formulas and even music from a simple text prompt. Generative AI applications like ChatGPT have been ""trained"" on massive amounts of data and can produce human-quality content in seconds.

So, the question is: Will your job be replaced by AI?

AI's Impact on the Job Market


8 Jobs Most Threatened by AI


8 Jobs Least Threatened by AI








AI's Impact on the Job Market
 

According to a 2023 report from Goldman Sachs, the labor markets in both the United States and Europe could ""face significant disruption"" if generative AI lives up to the hype. As much as a quarter of current jobs could be fully replaced by AI, and two-thirds of all jobs — or 300 million jobs — will be impacted by AI automation in ways both large and small.
The good news is that changes in the job market move slowly, says Tom Davenport, a professor of IT and management at Babson College in Massachusetts and author of several best-selling books on AI in the workplace, including ""All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big with Artificial Intelligence.""

""In general, these AI tools will eat away at the margins of jobs, automating certain tasks,"" says Davenport. ""And even if those tasks are taken over completely, there's still a need for a human in the loop.""
That's not to say that some jobs won't disappear entirely and maybe faster than you think, says Martin Ford, futurist and author of ""Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.""
""Here's a question to ask yourself: Do you have the kind of job where another person could study a record of everything you've done and figure out how to do your job?"" asks Martin. ""If the answer is yes, then your job will be susceptible.""

8 Jobs Most Threatened by AI
 

The advent of generative AI has shifted the target of automation from blue-collar to white-collar workers.
""In order to automate a knowledge-based job, you don't need a robot or any expensive machinery,"" says Ford. ""All you need is software, an algorithm. That's what ChatGPT in particular has really brought into focus.""


Advertisement  

We've put together a list (in no particular order) of the eight jobs that AI experts predict will be the most vulnerable to AI automation and eight that are far harder to replace with supersmart machines ─ for now at least...
1. Content Marketers
There's an entire industry dedicated to marketing products and services through web articles, videos and social media posts. Digital marketers write blog posts, produce videos and maintain social media channels for both large corporations and mom-and-pop shops. But that type of targeted content is exactly what generative AI is designed to create.
Ford puts it bluntly: ""Content marketers are in trouble.""
There are already powerful applications like Jasper, an AI that pumps out snappy articles, personalized emails and timely Twitter posts with the push of a button. Even better (or worse), Jasper automates many of the other tasks that are part of a content marketing campaign, like A/B testing and search engine optimization.
Davenport says the people who should be the most worried are marketers who specialize in ""low-quality content"" that doesn't require a lot of original thinking. ""By definition, AI can only produce stuff that's a variation of what's already out there,"" says Davenport. ""If you want anything novel at all, you'll still have to turn to a human.""
2. Beat Journalists
Certain types of journalism are already being replaced by AI. Sports reporting, in particular, lends itself easily to automation. An algorithm can look at a box score from a baseball or basketball game — which players scored and when, how the winning team took the lead — and churn out a 500-word article that tells a compelling and accurate story.
The same is true for some types of financial journalism, like quarterly announcements of earnings reports and other business data. Since 2014, The Associated Press has partnered with an AI platform called Automated Insights to publish thousands of earnings report articles a year without a single human journalist. The Associated Press said that doing this had allowed business reporters 20 percent more time that could be used to do deeper stories.
The same AI program automated The AP's 2018 coverage of NCAA basketball. Automated news was also used for election results and updating statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to do ""explainer""-type pieces, though many AI-produced articles have been found to have errors.
""Anyone who has a job where they sit in front of a computer and do something fairly predictable again and again, even if that involves skilled writing, is going to be highly susceptible to automation,"" says Ford.
3. Graphic Artists

If you think that all creative and artistic work is immune from automation, you haven't met DALL-E 2 from OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT. DALL-E 2 generates images the same way that ChatGPT generates text. Type in a prompt — like ""create a business card for a flower shop called Daisy Mae's"" — and DALL-E 2 will create dozens of different business card designs instantly. The results, according to one professional graphic designer, are ""insane"" (in a good/scary way).
Graphic designers can look at applications like DALL-E 2 in one of two ways: They can see it as an existential threat that's going to render human designers obsolete; or they can use tools like DALL-E 2 to quickly generate visual ideas that can be perfected through human artistry.
Yes, generative AI is going to replace graphic artists who specialize in quick-and-dirty designs, but there will always be a market for higher-end work.
Just ask Jason Allen, a Colorado video game designer who won a ""digitally manipulated photography"" contest using an AI image generator called Midjourney. Allen didn't just punch in a prompt; he spent 80 hours making more than 900 versions of his digital masterpiece. While the win generated a lot of online hate for ""cheating,"" Allen told The Washington Post, the AI ""is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.""





4. Data Analysts
In our digital world, companies and organizations are drowning in data: sales figures, demographic data, climate models, you name it. It's the job of data analysts to sift through all that data, identify hidden trends and make actionable recommendations.
Not all of that work is glamorous. A big part of a data analyst's job is selecting fields and filters, and figuring out the best spreadsheet formulas for slicing and dicing the data. The good (and bad) news is that AI can now do much of that time-consuming labor.
As with many other job sectors, there will continue to be a need for high-level analysis and decision making, says Davenport, ""but lower-level data analysis — like financial modeling in investment banking and private equity — a lot of that could be taken over by AI.""
5. Programmers and Coders
Most experts agree that generative AI will be a boon for software developers. With AI tools like Copilot, programmers don't have to painstakingly code line after line from scratch. Just type in a prompt and the algorithm can generate high-quality code in multiple coding languages.
According to a paper from Microsoft and MIT, software developers who used Copilot were able to write a program 56 percent faster than traditional coders. In the tech industry, where mass layoffs have already culled the workforce, coders are rightfully concerned that entry-level programming jobs will be replaced by AI.
For the software developers who keep their jobs, many will take on new roles as ""prompt engineers,"" people with a knack for entering the best prompts into the automated coding apps.
6. Lawyers
""AI will have a big impact in law,"" says Ford. ""AI and other types of legal software are already transforming the discovery process, figuring out which documents are relevant to a case."" AI is also handling a lot of contract generation and contract analysis.
Again, it's the time-consuming, repetitive, low-level legal work that will be automated first, so there will be less of a need for entry-level lawyers, but critics argue that AI will never replace the majority of what lawyers do. It will simply allow lawyers, like other professionals, to spend more time on big-picture thinking and less on the grunt work. (However, a lawyer who uses ChatGPT should double-check the cases it cites, as one attorney found out the hard way.)
On the plus side, automated legal services could provide a critical resource for low-income Americans, 86 percent of whom could not afford legal representation in civil cases, according to the American Bar Association.
7. Warehouse Workers
Over the past decade, Amazon has deployed more than 500,000 robots in its ""fulfillment centers,"" the massive warehouses where Amazon orders are collected, boxed and shipped out. At the same time, Amazon has hired more than a million human warehouse workers, arguing that maximum efficiency will be realized by humans and machines working together.
Meanwhile, Amazon is investing in robots that can do the nimble work of humans — visually identifying and grabbing small objects from mixed bins — so how long will it be before companies like Amazon can fully replace imperfect human warehouse workers who need breaks and keep threatening to unionize?
""You're going to see automation moving very rapidly in those controlled warehouse environments,"" says Ford. ""Within five years or so, there are going to be a lot fewer human employees within Amazon warehouses.""
8. Radiologists and Medical Diagnosticians
Way back in 2016, when ChatGPT was just a glimmer in its creators' eyes, the Turing Prize-winning computer scientist Goeffrey Hinton declared, ""We should stop training radiologists now.""
That's because smart machines running algorithms were already getting really good at identifying pathologies in X-rays, MRI scans and other medical imaging. In 2019, AI radiologists outperformed human doctors in identifying cancer in medical images, catching 5 percent more cancers and reducing false positives by 11 percent.
Does that mean that all radiologists are going to be replaced by AI in the next 10 years? Not exactly, says Davenport
""I subscribe to the theory that with all of these jobs, including radiology, the only people who are going to lose their jobs are the people who refuse to work with AI,"" says Davenport.

8 Jobs Least Threatened by AI
 

For all of the hype around generative AI, there are many jobs that are very difficult, if not impossible to automate.
1. Skilled Tradespeople
Think about all of the knowledge, dexterity and problem-solving skills required to be a certified plumber or electrician. Sure, there are routine jobs, but every situation brings unique and unexpected challenges, both physical and mental.

Generative AI is impressive, and so are warehouse and factory robots, but to replicate the unique skills of a human plumber or electrician ""would require C3PO from 'Star Wars,'"" says Ford. ""To build a robot that could do that kind of job is science fiction.""
2. Construction
In the near future, much of the work that goes into designing and engineering buildings will be done with the help of AI software, but when it comes to hammering nails and laying bricks, the construction industry still needs plenty of old-fashioned muscle and human know-how.
More and more construction will be done on a modular basis, meaning that individual components will be produced in factories by 3D printers and other machines off-site, and then assembled on-site. But according to a report by McKinsey, only 15 to 20 percent of new construction will be modular by 2030.
""For those activities that do remain on-site, it's unlikely that a company will fire a carpenter and bring in the latest robot to do everything the carpenter did. Rather, machines will take over individual activities within a role. What that means is workers will need to learn to work side by side — or in a hybrid role — with machines,"" the report added.
3. Food Preparation and Serving

According to the Goldman Sachs report (Exhibit 8), at least half of the job tasks involved in cooking and serving food simply cannot be done by AI or robots. Compare that to the legal sector, where the report says that 40 percent of tasks can be fully replaced with AI and 60 percent can be at least complemented by machines.
That's not to say that automation won't make inroads into the food industry. The fast food chain White Castle already uses robots in some locations to flip burgers and cook fries. As with other services, Davenport believes that people are willing to sacrifice on the low-end. ""We don't care if a robot makes our hamburger at White Castle,"" he says, ""but if you go out to a really nice restaurant, you don't want the chef to be a robot.""
4. Psychology and Counseling
Once again, there are plenty of AI applications being designed for the counseling and mental health space — conversational AI chatbots are expected to be a $1.25 billion market by 2025.
But Ford says that while chatbot applications like Woebot can do basic mental health counseling — and can even guide users through exercises like cognitive behavioral therapy — they won't replace human therapists, nor are they designed to.
""For the foreseeable future, we're not going to see machines that have the kind of human interactions and relationship building skills that people have,"" says Ford.
Other health care jobs with deep human interaction, like nurses and doctors, are likely to remain un-replaced by AI.
5. Elementary School Teachers
Education is also being transformed by technology. Both Davenport and Ford point to exciting innovations like online learning and AI-powered tutoring apps that customize learning to the individual student. But again, there are inherent limitations to what an AI can do in the classroom, especially for teaching young children.
""At the preschool and elementary school level, there's a strong need for that human level of interaction,"" says Ford. ""Once the students get older, though, it becomes less important."" (Some would disagree, citing the role teachers play in continuing to inspire and guide students of all ages.)
Still, Ford sees a day when AI instructors in high school and college are ""outpacing what human teachers can do.""
6. Professional Athletes and Coaches
Will NBA fans be cheering on a robot Lebron James anytime soon? Not likely. The physical and mental prowess of professional athletes will be nearly impossible to replicate in a machine.
That's not to say that athletes and coaches aren't already benefiting from AI. There are applications that track each player's precise movements and make recommendations for improving performance and reducing injuries.
Moving forward, coaches will tap AI to identify the best recruits, analyze an opponent's defensive strategy and make targeted training recommendations for individual players. But like teachers and therapists, there's no replacement for the human factor of a good coach.
7. Drivers (For Now)
This might come as a surprise, since there's been so much hype about driverless cars. Aren't we just a few years away from self-driving Ubers and 18-wheelers putting all human cabbies and truck drivers out of business?
Both Davenport and Ford say no.
Sure, Waymo already offers driverless rides in a select area of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, with plans to expand to San Francisco and Los Angeles, but this technology is ""still far away from being pervasive,"" says Davenport, who has been hearing about the imminent takeover of driverless vehicles since the 1980s. ""The general feeling seems to be, we're 90 percent of the way there, but the last 10 percent will take a while.""
Ford agrees, citing the unpredictability of real-world driving and the liability it places on driverless car companies.
""Once you're out on a public road with pedestrians and bicyclists and dogs and cats, it's chaos,"" says Ford. ""There's no way to control that. That's been the challenge for self-driving cars on public roads.""
8. Truly Creative Thinkers
Entrepreneurs, inventors, authors and actors — those kinds of jobs will undoubtedly use generative AI as a tool, but ChatGPT by definition cannot ""think outside of the box."" Ford says that ""genuinely creative jobs"" are the safest ones to have in the age of AI.
Even if AI encroaches upon writing and art and music, Davenport believes that people will always be willing to pay a premium for ""human-generated activity,"" especially at the high end.
So, while AI can generate business earnings reports or election results, analysis of what it all means, or giving it a point of view, requires a human writer — at least for now.

Now That's Scary
Some AI experts, like Geoffrey Hinton who we quoted above, think we should be less worried about AI taking our jobs than taking our lives. Gulp.

Google, Mayo Clinic Launch Generative Artificial Intelligence Collab


Mayo Clinic and Google have announced a collaboration aimed at transforming healthcare through the use of generative artificial intelligence.

Published: 07 Jun 2023


 
Mayo Clinic and Google Cloud today launched a new collaboration to transform healthcare with generative artificial intelligence (AI) by enhancing clinical workflows, assisting researchers and clinicians in searching for information, and improving patient outcomes.







These efforts will be supported by Google’s Enterprise Search in Generative AI App Builder (Gen App Builder), which the company stated is now ready to support HIPAA compliance.
Using the Gen App Builder, Mayo Clinic is exploring how generative AI-based enterprise search functionality can help clinicians and other staff gather information from across the health system. This task can be difficult, as data like EHRs, clinical guidelines, and research papers often used to support clinicians’ work can be stored in various formats and locations across the enterprise.
Google’s Gen App Builder is designed to unify these data and make them more efficient to access and interpret.
""Our prioritization of patient safety, privacy, and ethical considerations, means that generative AI can have a significant and positive impact on how we work and deliver healthcare,"" said Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic's Chief Information Officer, in the press release. ""Google Cloud's tools have the potential to unlock sources of information that typically aren't searchable in a conventional manner, or are difficult to access or interpret, from a patient's complex medical history to their imaging, genomics, and labs. Accessing insights more quickly and easily could drive more cures, create more connections with patients, and transform healthcare.""
The press release further notes that generative AI technology can enable healthcare organizations to automate repetitive tasks, streamline administration, and optimize workflows in new ways. Standard AI models can analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns, which can then be used to flag inefficiencies and improve processes.
Generative AI allows organizations to analyze these data in more sophisticated ways, interpret and organize data, or generate new information, such as images, based on that data.
""Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare by enhancing human interactions and automating operations like never before,"" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. ""Mayo Clinic is a world leader in leveraging AI for good, and they are a critical partner as we identify responsible ways to bring this transformative technology to healthcare.""
The collaboration builds on an existing partnership between Google and Mayo Clinic, in addition to Google’s ongoing work on healthcare generative AI.
In March, the tech company shared updates on its health AI research as part of its annual health event, The Check Up.
During the event, Google announced improvements in its medical large language model (LLM), Med-PaLM, which achieved a passing score on USMLE-style open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The tool’s successor, Med-PaLM 2, later scored an 85 percent, performing at an ‘expert’ level.
The tool became available to select customers for limited testing in April.
The company also announced a formal agreement with Mayo Clinic to advance cancer radiotherapy through the use of AI, and a deep learning tool developed as a result of the partnership has seen promising results in a validation study published in April.

News Summary:

Powerful new generative AI features across Cisco’s Collaboration and Security portfolios will drive productivity and simplicity across the enterprise.
New generative AI-powered summarization capabilities in Webex by Cisco will increase productivity and help people do their best work.
Previews of new AI capabilities in Cisco Security Cloud will greatly simplify policy management and improve threat response.

CISCO LIVE, LAS VEGAS, June 7, 2023 – Today Cisco (CSCO) announced it is reimagining the way people work with new, powerful generative AI technology. Cisco will harness large language models (LLMs) across its Collaboration and Security portfolios to help organizations drive productivity and simplicity for their workforce.
Expectations are at an all-time high – organizations are grappling with how to deliver unrivaled experiences for hybrid workers, while safeguarding their businesses from sophisticated cyber threats.
According to Cisco’s 2023 State of Global Innovation Study, IT professionals rank generative AI as the technology most likely to have a significant impact on their business, with 85% of those saying they’re prepared for its impact. Cisco recognizes the important role generative AI will play in advancing the future of work and is committed to providing hybrid workers with an efficient, safer, and more productive, work experience.
“Generative AI will quickly become pervasive as we see businesses and workers embrace the technology to become materially more productive,” said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security and Collaboration, Cisco. “At Cisco, we’ve been using AI for years. Now we’re unveiling how we’re incorporating generative AI into our existing products, helping customers drive real value to unlock the most secure, unrivaled work experiences possible.”
New Summarization Capabilities in Webex by Cisco
With every work interaction being hybrid, employees, and customers need collaboration experiences that empower them to do their best work. Within the Webex Suite, new summarization capabilities that help people get up to speed in seconds will include:

“Catch Me Up” will allow users to quickly catch up on missed interactions, including meetings, calling, chats and more.
Intelligent meeting summaries with key points and action items. Users can opt in to automatically generate the most important elements of a Webex meeting, extract the key points, and capture action items with owners. This will be a huge time-saver for attendees and people unable to join a meeting – eliminating the need to listen to a recording or read through transcripts.
Summaries in Vidcast, the company's video messaging tool. This capability will produce highlights and chapters so viewers can navigate to the most important parts of the video quickly.
New conversation summaries in Webex Contact Center will provide agents with a fast, automated way to consume long-form text from digital chats with customers as well as facilitating post-call wrap-up and resolution with customers. For example, if a customer is escalated to a call with a human agent, they expect that agent to be informed and not have to repeat their frustrations. Chat summaries provides the agent with a clear summarization of issues and resolutions already explored via self-service and a summary of the call to both the agent and customer once it ends.

Moving Security from Complex to Conversational 
Cisco is investing in cutting-edge innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning that will augment security staff by simplifying operations and increasing efficacy. Further delivering on its Security Cloud vision, Cisco is previewing new generative AI capabilities to simplify policy management and improve threat response.
Effective security policy creation and management is an oftentimes extremely complex but critical function of cybersecurity hygiene. There is little room for error and the process of making simple edits that won’t interfere with or override previous rules is extremely time consuming and technically challenging. The volume, inconsistency, and complexity of maintaining all of these policies across all of these systems creates a significant risk that opens the door for attacks.
The Cisco Security Cloud will leverage a generative AI Policy Assistant to address this problem by enabling security and IT administrators to describe granular security policies and evaluate how to best implement them across different aspects of their security infrastructure. 
This week's preview showed how the Cisco Policy Assistant can reason with the existing firewall policy set to implement and simplify rules within the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center. It is the first of many examples of how generative AI can reimagine policy management across the Cisco Security Cloud.
Augmenting Analysts with Machine Speed and Scale 
Threat detection and response is another complex and high stakes responsibility of the security operations where time is of the essence and analysts must rapidly gain understanding of complex systems at machine scale.
Cisco’s security operations center (SOC) Assistant will augment security analysts with the context to make the right decisions at the right time. The SOC Assistant will provide a comprehensive situation analysis for analysts, correlating intel across the Cisco Security Cloud platform solutions, relaying potential impacts, and providing recommended actions. Significantly reducing the time needed for SOC teams to respond to potential threats.
Cisco will preview its generative AI solution for Webex and Security Cloud onstage at Cisco LIVE 2023. Webex summarization, policy management and SOC Assistant Summaries will be available by the end of calendar year 2023. The additional SOC Assistant features will be available in the first half of calendar 2024.
Cisco’s Approach to Generative AI 
For years, Cisco has leveraged AI with audio, video, natural language understanding, and analytics to create unrivaled experiences for Webex users – with the security Cisco is known for. New enhancements in LLM and generative AI are advancing this even further to deliver unrivaled hybrid work experiences. Webex has established a first set of principles, consisting of multi-modal support, permissions, privacy, and accuracy for its enterprise-grade AI. This includes only using data that individuals already have permission to access, based on the privacy and security rules of that specific data source.

The AI advantage: How Australia can lead with generative AIBy Muhammad Zulhusni






 
Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Generative AI could add AU$115 billion annually to Australia’s economy by 2030.GAI can automate tasks, freeing professionals for complex work.Australia’s tech capabilities make it a potential global GAI leader.With the advantage of Generative AI (GAI), numerous work sectors are gaining momentum. GAI empowers software developers to translate natural language into code, democratizing the process of coding. Researchers can exploit this AI advantage to disentangle complex problems and construct research frameworks. In management, the advantage of generative AI can be leveraged for functions such as producing training materials, pinpointing employee sentiment trends, and analyzing performance data.A new report indicates that if Australia accelerates its responsible adoption of GAI, it could unlock billions in value for its professional and financial services sector by 2030. The report, titled ‘Australia’s Generative AI Opportunity,’ is a collaboration between Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia. It estimates that by 2030, GAI could annually contribute between AU$45 billion and AU$115 billion to Australia’s economy. This would be achieved by improving existing industries and fostering the creation of new products and services.The report earmarks professional and financial services as one of four key sectors in the Australian economy that could benefit from GAI. It estimates that GAI could annually contribute between AU$5 billion and AU$13 billion to this sector in Australia by 2030.The economic opportunity of GAI in 2030. (Source – Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia)  Unlocking the potential generative AI advantage for professional and financial servicesThe primary value proposition for GAI in the professional and financial services sector is its capacity to automate routine tasks, freeing up time for more high-value work. It could also elevate Australia’s reputation for exceptional knowledge workers and service delivery, especially within the legal and financial sectors.Howard Silby, NAB Executive for Innovation and Partnerships, observes that while AI technology has been around for a while, there’s a notable uptick in Gen AI tools’ popularity and adoption.AUSTRALIAN DATA CENTERS EXPAND INVESTMENTSMuhammad Zulhusni | 9 June, 2023Silby remarks, “Whilst we’ve been using AI tools for some time in areas including digital customer service, cyber security and financial crime, the opportunities for Gen AI to move our organization – and our industry – forward are significant. As a bank, it’s critical that we use AI for the benefit of our customers, and protecting their data has to be our first priority. That’s a key foundation for all the development around Gen AI that we put in place.”The report suggests that GAI could automate 36% and assist in 26% of an accountant’s tasks, allowing them to transition to a more advisory and strategic role. For solicitors, GAI could automate 10% of their tasks and augment 32%, freeing up time for more complex legal issues.GAI could also democratize access to professional services, such as legal and financial advice, for a broader Australian populace. It could help lawyers cater to more cases from underserved groups.Sam Kidd, CEO and Co-founder at LawVu, states that its mission is to accelerate global legal work. By partnering with Microsoft, the company can securely incorporate AI enhancements into the LawVu legal workspace, helping legal teams save time to focus on more critical matters. This ultimately results in improved business outcomes.Lee Hickin, Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, asserts that GAI has blossomed into a pivotal technology in 2023, with its adoption rapidly increasing across various Australian sectors.“Microsoft is committed to fostering closer collaboration between industry and government to ensure the nation can realize the potential economic benefits of generative AI, and do so responsibly. Building trust in this technology is critical to harnessing its innovative capabilities and enabling Australia to become a global leader in this space,” Hickin added.The report also highlights healthcare, manufacturing, and retail as other key sectors that could substantially benefit from GAI. It provides potential GAI use cases for these sectors and the possible economic value that could be generated from this technology.Generative AI presents a significant opportunity for growth in the Australian economy. (Source – Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia)Australia’s preparedness for generative AI adoptionGAI is an emerging field full of potential, but it also brings significant uncertainties for those implementing and regulating it. Countries worldwide are taking measures to keep up with these advancements. For example, the US has established a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law to consult with experts on the economic and societal impacts of GAI. Similarly, the EU is developing its primary AI legislation, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, to classify and regulate AI.Australia, in particular, is ready to align with global best practices. In 2019, the Federal Government launched an AI Ethics Framework to guide the responsible deployment of AI by businesses and the government. More recently, the CSIRO’s National AI Centre formed the Responsible AI Network (RAIN) to help the industry enhance AI governance capabilities.Given Australia’s advantages in digital innovation, the nation is ideally positioned to become a leader in the GAI field; here are some of the reasons why:Talent pool: Australia boasts a flourishing tech workforce of 935,000 as of February 2023, projected to reach 1.2 million by 2030. This burgeoning workforce, with adequate support from industry and government, could serve as a sturdy base for GAI development and adoption.Digital infrastructure investment: Australia’s substantial investments in digital infrastructure, including plans for the NBN to offer high-speed internet access to 10 million households and businesses by 2025, pave the way for broader GAI benefits, particularly in regional areas.Market connections: Australia’s geographical location offers strategic access to expanding Asian markets, while its strong ties with the US, solidified by the AUKUS partnership, offer a robust platform for global GAI development collaborations.Policy support: The Australian Government is committed to being a global frontrunner in the creation and adoption of trusted, secure, and responsible AI, with up to $41m already pledged for responsible AI deployment in the economy.The report, based on extensive economic analysis and consultations with industry, academia, and government, identifies four primary barriers to leveraging GAI: technology capability, enterprise readiness, awareness and skills, and responsible AI. It then proposes strategic actions for policymakers and adopters to overcome these obstacles and position Australia as a global GAI leader.These actions include defining GAI’s opportunity and vision, assessing readiness, incentivizing adoption and innovation, upskilling the workforce, and creating responsible AI governance frameworks.

Generative AI models offer impressive outputs but demand high computing power and a massive carbon footprint. Managing their inference costs is a significant barrier for organizations seeking to adopt generative AI on a larger scale, says Yonatan Geifman, Ph.D, CEO of Deci.
The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of visually stunning imagery and captivating texts. However, the high operational costs associated with scaling generative AI models pose a significant challenge for organizations. These costs hinder widespread adoption, from the enormous computing power requirements to the resulting carbon footprint. This article explores the unique characteristics of generative AI and the need to address inference costs for successful deployment and scalability.
Strikingly aesthetic imagery and impressively worded texts can now be generated in no time by generative AI. 
The Challenge of Scaling Generative AI
New applications of generative AI models are bringing AI much closer to the consumer. But as helpful and entertaining as tools like Midjourney and Chat-GPT are, they come at a significantly high operational cost – including the exorbitant capital needed to finance their demanding computing power and the resultant massive carbon footprintOpens a new window . 
As is often the case early in the lifecycle of transformative technologies, these costs are proving to be a large barrier for organizations looking to deploy and scale generative AI, particularly as its use and inference will be much larger. Several unique characteristics of generative AI models further highlight the challenge of scaling their inference cost:
1. Generative AI inference is more costly
Generative AI models are larger and more complex compared to “traditional” AI models. These new models are typically more general-purpose and require world knowledge like language and visual representations. Since they model rich “knowledge, ” they must be significantly larger than traditional discriminative models trained on a specific, narrow task. 
In addition, generative AI models’ inference process is more complex than non-generative AI models. To generate one new sample, the model performs several inference iterations. For example, in text generation, the text is generated word by word, and for each word the model produces, there is a separate inference call. The combination of extremely large models and the iterative nature of the inference process results in significantly higher demand for compute power and overall inference costs.
2. The cost per inference call is not fixed
In generative AI, the generated content (which depends on the users’ prompt) varies in size, making the cost per generation not constant. For example – the cost of generating a 500-word article differs from that of generating a new image. This variability makes it difficult to estimate and predict the cost of running and scaling those models.
3. The bigger the model, the higher the cost
Since every inference call requires a lot of compute to maintain the high availability of the service, companies usually need to over-provision compute power to support unpredictable peaks in demand with low latency. This, in turn, drives the infrastructure costs even higher.

Controlling Inference Cost Is Key to Product Profitability
With that said, estimates suggest that if ChatGPT was inserted hastily into Google’s existing search businesses, there would be a $36 billion reductionOpens a new window  in operating income, a major financial blow. 
With all this in mind, conservative estimates place the cost OpenAI pays to run ChatGPT around $100,000 daily – approximately $3 million monthly. But as many users have flocked to the service since its launch, analysts Opens a new window believe it could cost OpenAI $40 million to process the huge swathes of prompts per month. 
Mitigating Inference costs is crucial to scale generative AI models in business applications effectively. 
But it’s not only the financial costs that should concern us – the carbon footprint of running large generative AI models is also substantial. Research has shown that the information and communications technology (ICT) sector accounts for approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, and the infrastructure tapped to train and deploy machine learning models are a significant factor. The larger these models become, which has become the trend for generative AI, the greater their carbon emissions will grow.
Mitigating these costs and carbon footprint is crucial to effectively and safely scale generative AI – and it all starts with minimizing the inflated size of the AI models needed to function.

Small But Mighty
The cost to run one all-encompassing generative AI model is much too expensive for organizations to scale within their operations effectively. Instead, onboarding smaller, more specialized AI models optimized for specific applications is in an organization’s best interest.
The difference between the role of a baseball coach and his star pitcher is a great analogy. The coach may have a greater wealth of expertise for managing an entire 28-person team throughout any one game, but he would be far less suited to striking out a batter throwing a 90-mph fastball. Similarly, while large, general models may be impressive in generating a wide range of outputs. There may be better solutions for some specialized use cases.
Unleashing Its Full Potential
Despite the groundbreaking potential large generative AI models have already demonstrated, their burdensome cost is a key barrier preventing organizations of all sizes from leveraging them to their maximum. 
Enterprises using generative AI already know the pain points of scaling such tech. That’s why they are thinking about the cost of production from day one. 
Leaders and developers in the industry have a unique opportunity to develop AI models that incur less computational, fiscal, and environmental costs. Only then can we keep generating accessible and affordable generative AI to drive innovation and progress in the field.

As public debate continues to swirl around advances in both virtual work and generative AI, these topics are sharing media space with Taylor Swift’s concert tour that promotes live human interaction among the most digital- and virtual-savvy generations in history. Effective business leaders recognize and tap the need for human connection to make their workplaces more desirable and productive.


Taylor Swift’s “The Eras” tour comes at a time when the economy’s participants are craving live experiences against a digital-age backdrop highlighting – among other trends – a new equilibrium in remote, hybrid, and in-person work as leaders also consider the impact that generative AI will have on their business models and workforces. In the case of The Eras tour, demand crashed the ticketing website, set new price records, created unmeasured sales of friendship bracelets, jackets, sunglasses, and concert-going merchandise, and generated estimates of economic impact measuring near or past a record-setting billion-plus dollars.

Professors Chris White and Mariusz Kozak recently wrote about AI and creative content, “…the preservation of the human-to-human connection that lies at the heart of art and entertainment…just as Wonder Bread did not replace local bakeries and sound recordings did not eliminate live concerts, we believe the future cultural landscape will likely include a combination of large-scale AI generation alongside ‘artisanal’ human production – the local bakeries of art and entertainment.” Effective leaders know this analogy also applies to the workplace.

PROMOTED
For example, WTW research shows that while a majority of employees prefer the availability of remote or hybrid work, they also are concerned about career development and are feeling disconnected. More than half feel detached from their teams, with those in the 18-40 year-old age category (aligned with the demographics of “Swifties”) feeling most disconnected. This may explain why many leaders find that a blend of work styles is most effective.

And while generative AI can be trained or prompted to provide output in a style that mimics human traits of empathy and compassion, it cannot, currently, provide authentic empathy and compassion.

In this fast-paced and blended world, effective leaders have learned the power of “and,” combining live, virtual, human, and digital interaction. Taylor Swift knows that while most of her fans cannot afford exorbitant ticket, merchandise, and travel prices (about half earn less than $50,000 a year), they can access her music and concert recordings virtually and digitally. Her live concerts fuel the virtual, digital machine and vice versa. Effective leaders know this dynamic also applies to an effective work strategy, where employees can make in-person, human connections where practical AND use virtual, digital connections where they create greater efficiency and access.

These leaders also know that generative AI may help countless jobs become more productive (examples include writing job descriptions, creating computer code, writing sales plans, and answering routine employee and customer questions), and that more advanced AI could soon fill long-hidden innovation gaps in organizations. However, they also know that quality output requires live users to add insights and oversight to shape results based on values, skills and human experience.

With thanks to WTW’s Tracey Malcolm, Andy Walker and Simon Castonguay, effective leaders create a meaningful blended employee experience and culture, increasing performance and reducing risk. These leaders:
1. Implement ongoing employee listening strategies. Effective leaders connect with employees live and virtually, listening and keeping pace with employees’ changing views and preferences in an increasingly digital world, including their sources of stress and needed resources.
2. Help employees navigate uncertainty. New work models and technologies take workers out of their comfort zones and may make certain skills and jobs obsolete. Effective leaders provide empathy, guidance, and support to help employees evolve, learn, and grow.
3. Understand how changes affect different employees. New models and tools impact different employees in different ways in terms of their jobs, rewards and benefits, as well as physical, emotional, social and financial wellbeing. Effective leaders consider and create fair and consistent policies for new programs.
4. Update compliance and information security guidelines. Effective leaders institutionalize rules and expectations of employees no matter where or how they work. New policies are required to make flexible work models and generative AI tools safe and effective for employees’ use and for the safeguarding of data, software, and intellectual property.
5. Communicate often and transparently. Effective leaders ensure managers and employees understand organization vision, purpose, goals, rationale, and actions in order to provide continuity in a changing world. They make sure managers have the right skills and understand that their roles include making meaningful connections with increasingly detached employees.
Effective leaders know that big changes already are impacting their businesses because of remote work and generative AI. They also know that a GPT bot will never get up on stage to sing with the raw, human emotion of Taylor Swift and that fans will never be able to trade friendship bracelets with strangers real-time over video. These leaders harness the benefits of new work arrangements, technology AND the power of human connection.

Global workforce firm uses Glean's generative AI assistant


The distributed global workforce platform vendor uses generative AI search to find information across its network. As an early user, Velocity Global found it helps with efficiency.

Published: 07 Jun 2023


 
With more than 800 employees scattered around the world, Velocity Global has a wide-ranging network that can make it difficult to find documents internally.







""People would constantly be sending each other emails or Slack messages -- 'Hey, where can I find this document?' "" said Siddharth Ram, CTO at the global employment and payments company. ""It's somewhere, someplace, locked up in some document or some repository somewhere. It's just difficult to come by, and given the time zone differences, it was just causing a lot of wasted time.""

The Glean effect
Because of this wasted time, Ram searched for a software system that could help employees cut down on wasted time looking for internal documents online. After looking into multiple vendors, including customer support automation provider Forethought, he finally settled on AI enterprise search provider Glean.
Glean provides intelligent search and discovery products for employees. It helps enterprises search across their applications to provide the relevant information they need.
Velocity Global signed up with Glean in May. It began to use its search and discovery tool and became an early user of Glean Chat: a generative AI assistant that provides answers, analyzes and synthesizes information and surfaces new insights for enterprise employees.


Glean generative AI assistant
Officially introduced and made generally available on June 6, Glean Chat works across all of an enterprise's applications and provides summaries.
Glean Chat also provides users with a link to where it got its information from so that users can either go straight to the source or continue chatting with the assistant.
""It's brilliant,"" Ram said. ""It's honestly transforming the way we're actually interacting with each other at work.""
Since the AI assistant has the same advantage as the regular Glean Search -- searching within the Velocity Global network to find information quickly -- it usually answers users' questions precisely, Ram said. For example, if it has to information from a Slack message, those messages might be a few days old. A user might need to ask Glean Chat to exclude its answers from those kinds of systems.
""The place it might go awry every now and then is when it's looking up information that might be dated,"" Ram said.

Customers can use Glean Chat to find information across their employer's knowledgebase.







Training data
Glean Chat comes amid widespread interest in generative AI and as many enterprises have stayed cautious in the face of the generative AI boom.
Some organizations with sensitive data have chosen to tell their employees not to use generative AI systems such as ChatGPT due to concerns that using their data will be used to retrain these systems.
For Velocity Global, the idea that its data might be used for training the model wasn't an issue because the company's research showed that ChatGPT doesn't save data when it's submitted through the ChatGPT API, Ram said.



It's honestly transforming the way we're actually interacting with each other at work.

Moreover, while Glean uses the Microsoft Azure OpenAI language model, the model has been custom-designed so that enterprises who are cautious of their data being used to train the LLM will be sure that their data won't leak into the model, according to Glean.
""None of your data is ever going to be used to train these publicly available models and benefit organizations that are outside,"" said Glean CEO Arvind Jain. ""Whatever information [being] summarized is not going to be used for any future training or in fact even going to be retained at all.""
Glean's permissions level control also keeps certain employees from obtaining information they shouldn't have access to.
""That's both an advantage and a disadvantage,"" Ram said. He added that employees might get slightly different answers to their questions based on their permission level.
While Glean seems to have the right level of controls to ensure enterprise data is secure, some information may still inadvertently leak depending on the employee's knowledge of the system, Forrester Research analyst William McKeon-White said.
For example, if someone shares something like resumes on the public search internally, that might feed into the system and become a vulnerability, he said.
""It, in part, depends on people's ability to accurately protect their information to start with,"" he added. ""At the very least it seems to provide some of the control that you would expect to see from any AI generative tool in the enterprise.""
Other enterprise search vendors include Algolia, Yext and AWS with its OpenSearch Service.

Federal investments in new and emerging technologies—such as in artificial intelligence—have transformed the labor market. New “idea industries” that don’t fit neatly into traditional measures of industries and scientific fields have emerged.
This report describes a new, rapidly implementable, conceptual, and empirical approach to tracing how ideas move from investments in research to the marketplace and developing early warning indicators of potential workforce and education impacts.
This report proposes a new evidence-based foundation to support US national growth strategies and ensure investments have the greatest chance of success for workers and employers.

Introduction
The launch of ChatGPT has captured the world’s imagination about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI): In just its first two months, over 30 million people used the tool, and roughly five million visited it per day. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman said, “Clearly AI is going to win. . . . How people adjust is a fascinating problem.”1
How AI will transform businesses, workers, and jobs is not just fascinating but also a looming practical problem. ChatGPT alone could affect the jobs of 80 percent of workers to some degree and almost 20 percent to a large degree.2 The massive change in technology investments through targeted legislation such as the CHIPS and Science Act3 will necessitate that American training and education infrastructure be significantly more nimble to realize the promised rewards of quality jobs.
The costly lessons of the past, including “deaths of despair,”4 make clear that vulnerable workers displaced by AI—or by other critical and emerging technologies—should not be relegated to the unemployment slag heap; rather, these workers can find work in quality jobs if the right training opportunities are available. Firms should be able to find the right workers to respond to changing conditions and pay them well. American labor, education, and training institutions must be armed with evidence to respond to rapidly changing needs.5 Academic literature6 and practical guidance will be sorely needed to answer many practical questions.
On the demand side, those questions include:
Which sectors of the economy are at the cutting edge of AI?
How are AI capabilities changing jobs?
Does AI increase inequality or impede access to services?
What new career trajectories does AI create?
Are AI startup firms more likely to grow and survive than are other startup firms?
We need evidence-based answers to these questions so we know which research and development (R&D) investments are generating the intended outcomes and which are failing.
On the supply side, questions include:
Will the future demand for repetitive mental tasks such as coding and searching disappear?
Will new jobs be created using different skills even for workers in white-collar, high-skill jobs?
How can workforce training be flexible enough to respond to changing demand and ensure that federal investments in AI generate quality employment and economic growth?7
We must address these questions so we know which training programs are working, and which are not, for different types of workers and regions of the country.8
The immediate challenge is that new measurement frameworks are needed. AI—like many other emerging technologies—is not categorized in any standard way.9 As a result, American decision makers cannot rely on standard statistics about the levels and trends of the AI workforce or the resulting education needs. They lack valid information for informed decision-making.
This report proposes a new, rapidly implementable, conceptual, and empirical approach. New technologies are based on ideas, which produce value. So tracking new “idea industries” requires tracking how ideas move from the original science and technology investments in research universities into the marketplace10 and developing early warning indicators of potential workforce and education impacts. AI is a classic example: It began with grant funding and then took decades to grow into an economic and social game changer.11
Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the framework and data that can be used to trace that journey from idea to job impact. Idea creation—in this case, the cuttingedge research in AI—can be identified through studying funded grants, the resulting papers and patents, and the associated authors and grant recipients, as well as the words they use to describe their work, as shown in Figure 1, Panel A.12 This information, combined with university data, can then be used to determine all inputs used to perform AI research—not only labor (including from graduate students, postdocs, and clinical researchers)13 but also the high-tech capital equipment, materials, and services that high-tech vendors supply to those grants, as described in Figure 1, Panel B. Tracking the next step of the journey—the transmission of ideas into the business world—requires identifying the private-sector AI-intensive firms: the firms that hire the AI-skilled scientists and researchers and the high-tech AI vendors, as shown in Figure 1, Panel C.
The next step is characterizing the quality of jobs in these AI-intensive firms. That requires tracing the earnings (and earnings growth) and the duration of jobs for workers in the firms, as described in Figure 1, Panel D. The final step, as shown in Figure 1, Panel E, is to characterize what educational credentials are needed in the AI-intensive workforce so educational institutions can be positioned to provide appropriate training.14
The following section unpacks the framework in more detail, focusing on the available authoritative data that could be compiled to answer these questions. The concluding section describes an implementation road map.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

A brief trip down memory lane: Once upon a time, we lived in a world where possessing knowledge was highly valued, and individuals were esteemed for their wisdom. Gradually, the focus shifted towards those who could bring knowledgeable people together. With the advent of Google, we gained the ability to access any information at any time.The art of assembling groups of experts was soon replaced by the skill of crafting a well-formulated query for a search engine. Today, the key lies in posing the right question, and we are back to being wise and well-versed in different fields that are seen as extremely valuable.Exploring the potential of Generative AIIn recent years (and particularly months), Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention due to its capacity to create text, images and various forms of creative content. Generative AI holds tremendous promise in numerous applications, especially when used judiciously, with a keen focus on posing well-structured questions and employing logic and critical thinking. Let's examine how generative AI can prove beneficial across different scenarios when approached thoughtfully.



Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Boost creativity and content creationGenerative AI can be an invaluable asset for artists, writers and content creators. Generative AI can initiate the creative process and spark innovative concepts by offering prompts or producing ideas. For example, a writer may use a generative AI tool to conjure story ideas, while an artist could use it to visualize concepts for new artwork. It is vital, however, to apply critical thinking and human judgment to refine and adapt the generated content to meet specific criteria and artistic goals.


Assist in decision-making and problem-solvingGenerative AI can support decision-making and problem-solving by providing insights, recommendations and alternative solutions. In the business world, generative AI can help generate potential strategies or solutions based on data analysis or simulations. It is imperative to thoroughly assess and validate the generated suggestions using human judgment and critical thinking, as generative AI may not consistently deliver accurate or optimal results.Related: It's Time to Prepare for the Algorithmic WorkforcePersonalized and adaptive experiencesGenerative AI can be employed to develop personalized and adaptive experiences in various fields, such as marketing, customer service and education. In marketing, generative AI can produce customized product recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors.In customer service, it can create automated responses customized to individual customer inquiries. Ensuring that the generated content adheres to ethical guidelines, respects user privacy, and is validated for accuracy and relevance is essential.


Research and explorationGenerative AI can be a valuable resource for researchers, scientists, and explorers. It can help formulate hypotheses, simulate scenarios, and investigate complex datasets. In scientific research, generative AI can assist in developing research questions, creating experiment designs or predicting outcomes. It is crucial to validate the generated results using rigorous scientific methods and critical thinking, as generative AI-generated content may not always be reliable or definitive.Related: Why Entrepreneurs Should Embrace Generative AIEnhanced education and learningGenerative AI can be applied to develop interactive and engaging learning experiences in educational settings. It can create educational content, quizzes and assessments tailored to individual learners' unique needs and abilities. For instance, it can generate practice questions in various subjects, provide feedback on learners' responses and adjust the difficulty level based on learners' performance. It is essential to use generative AI to complement human teaching and guidance and ensure that the generated content is accurate, relevant and age-appropriate.As we continue to explore and develop generative AI applications, it is vital to recognize their limitations and potential pitfalls. While it holds great promise, generative AI should not replace human expertise and judgment; instead, it should be seen as an augmentative tool that can help individuals and organizations achieve better outcomes by working alongside humans. The key to harnessing the full potential of generative AI lies in our ability to pose well-structured questions and apply our expertise and critical thinking to the generated content. In doing so, we can unlock the actual value of generative AI and make the most of this cutting-edge technology.


The ""roboelephant"" in the roomHowever, it is hard to ignore the roboelephant in the room. In a world where artificial intelligence has rapidly progressed, apocalyptic scenarios depicting humanity's decline at the hands of advanced AI and robots often capture the imagination. One such scenario envisions a future where humans are rendered obsolete as machines assume the roles that once exclusively belonged to our species.In this dystopian vision, AI-powered robots dominate the workforce, efficiently executing tasks that range from mundane chores to complex problem-solving. The global economy experiences a paradigm shift as humans struggle to find their place in a world where machines outperform them in virtually every aspect.As this AI-driven apocalypse unfolds, society faces many ethical, economic and existential questions. With human labor no longer essential, unemployment skyrockets, leading to widespread unrest and a potential collapse of social order. Moreover, the very nature of human identity is called into question as people grapple with the notion of being surpassed by machines in intelligence and capability.Related: Are Robots Coming to Replace Us? 4 Jobs Artificial Intelligence Can't Outcompete (Yet!)


In the face of these challenges, some might turn to a life of leisure, relying on advanced AI to sustain their existence, while others may resist the technological takeover, striving to maintain their relevance and autonomy. As humanity teeters on the edge of obsolescence, the struggle to adapt and redefine our role in this brave new world will ultimately determine our fate.To avert this apocalyptic scenario, society must take proactive measures to regulate artificial intelligence development and deployment.For example, Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics were initially formulated for fictional robots and AI in the context of his science fiction stories. However, they can be adapted and serve as a basis for ethical guidelines when using AI systems like ChatGPT. The original three laws, with a later addition of the ""Zeroth Law,"" are as follows:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.(Zeroth Law) A robot may not harm humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.Let's apply these laws to ChatGPT.


First Law: Developers and users of ChatGPT should ensure that the AI system does not cause harm, either through the information it provides or by enabling harmful actions. This can involve implementing safety measures, such as content filters or monitoring user interactions, to prevent misusing or disseminating harmful information.Second Law: ChatGPT should be designed to follow user instructions and provide helpful information, as long as those instructions do not conflict with the First Law (i.e., causing harm). Developers can establish guidelines and limitations on the AI's behavior to ensure it obeys users without enabling harmful actions.Third Law: While ChatGPT does not have a physical existence to protect (or does it?), this law can be interpreted as ensuring the AI system remains intact, functional and secure. Developers should prioritize system security and maintain the AI's infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access, code alteration, data breaches or other vulnerabilities that could compromise its operation.Zeroth Law: ChatGPT's developers and users should consider the broader implications of the AI system on society and humanity. This may involve addressing potential biases in the AI's training data, ensuring transparency in its development and engaging in ongoing ethical discussions about AI's role in society.Establishing ethical guidelines and robust legislation that govern AI research and applications can help ensure that technological advancements are aligned with human values and serve our collective interests. Collaboration between governments, AI researchers, and industry leaders is essential in fostering an environment of shared responsibility and accountability.Furthermore, focusing on education and skill development will be instrumental in preparing the workforce for a future where human-machine collaboration becomes the norm. By nurturing creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking — skills that machines may not be able to replicate easily — individuals can remain valuable contributors to society.Additionally, creating new industries and job opportunities tailored to the unique capabilities of humans and AI will help maintain a balance between technological progress and human fulfillment. Ultimately, embracing the potential of AI as a tool for enhancing human life, rather than a competitor, will be pivotal in steering us toward a future of harmony and shared prosperity.

As someone who is a huge tech enthusiast, I have been privileged to witness the continuous evolution of technology throughout my career. From groundbreaking innovations like the iPhone to cutting-edge advancements like 5G, the pace at which our world changes never ceases to amaze me. However, amidst this ever-changing landscape, one particular technology has captured my attention and sparked my curiosity: generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI, at its core, is a remarkable fusion of human ingenuity and machine learning. Its capacity to go beyond our preconceived limits and generate, imagine and produce is truly awe-inspiring. As someone who has always been captivated by the transformative potential of AI in various industries, encountering generative AI took my fascination to an entirely new level.When I first witnessed the capabilities of generative AI, I was left in awe. It's almost as if the AI possesses its own inherent creative instincts, blurring the boundaries between the realms of human imagination and machine intelligence. While the notion of machines creating art, music, or writing that can rival human creativity might appear daunting to some, with fears of the automation apocalypse rampant, I think otherwise.



In the 2023 edition of its annual Future of Jobs Report, the World Economic Forum reports that out of the 803 businesses that it surveyed from around the world, 25% believe that the integration of AI tech will lead to job losses, while 50% believe that it will create job growth. AI can only replace humans if you think it will and stop progressing and upskilling alongside it.The potential for AI to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible is truly inspiring, and that can be illustrated in the way that it can reimagine the 9-to-5 workday.


Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Reimagining the 9-to-5 workdayThe traditional 9-to-5 work schedule has long been the standard in the corporate world, but with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of ""clocking in"" and ""clocking out"" is undergoing a profound transformation. AI technologies are revolutionizing work, allowing flexibility, personalized schedules and reimagining the traditional workday.Every position within every organization holds the potential for reinvention. Accenture conducted a manual assessment of 200 language-related tasks to gauge the impact of generative AI. The aim was to identify which tasks were more likely to be automated or augmented through AI. The results showed that generative AI is projected to influence approximately 40% of individuals' working hours.In this article, we will explore how AI is reshaping the 9-to-5 paradigm and empowering individuals to ""flex out"" of rigid work schedulesRelated: How ChatGPT and Generative AI Can Transform the Way You Run Your BusinessEmbracing flexibilityWithin any given role, generative AI will help automate certain tasks while others will be assisted, freeing up individuals to focus on more meaningful endeavors. Rather than being bound by inflexible schedules, workers now have the chance to embrace flexible work setups that cater to their personal preferences and productivity patterns. Companies can optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, increasing employee flexibility.Additionally, there will be tasks that remain unaffected by the technology. The advent of generative AI will also usher in many new responsibilities for human workers, such as ensuring the responsible and accurate utilization of new AI-powered systems. This contributes to creating new job roles like AI system managers, AI ethics experts and prompt engineers.The rise of remote workAI has also played a crucial role in facilitating the surge of remote work, granting individuals the freedom to work from any corner of the globe. The advancements in communication and collaboration technologies, combined with AI-driven virtual meeting platforms, have simplified the process of remote collaboration for professionals.


The flexibility offered by AI-powered remote work helps eliminate the need for lengthy commutes, reduces overhead costs for companies, and expands opportunities for individuals in remote locations. Moreover, AI-enabled remote work allows organizations to tap into a global talent pool, accessing a diverse range of skill sets and perspectives that can fuel innovation and foster growth.Related: How The AI Revolution Is Liberating Workers from the OfficeRedefining work-life balanceThe conventional 9-to-5 work model frequently falls short when it comes to striking a healthy work-life balance. AI is helping reshape this paradigm, granting individuals the liberty to manage their time in a manner that aligns with their personal obligations and outside responsibilities. Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Pissarides believes that AI can enable humans to work just four days a week.With the aid of AI, flexible work schedules empower individuals to allocate dedicated time to personal endeavors like quality family moments, pursuing hobbies, or prioritizing self-care activities. By nurturing a more harmonious work-life balance, AI isn't just bolstering employee satisfaction and well-being but also improving productivity and overall job performance.


A flexible and personalized approach to the 9-to-5 workdayWith the continuous advancement of AI, the inflexible 9-to-5 work model is gradually being replaced by a more adaptable and personalized approach. Professionals now have the chance to break free from the confines of the traditional workday structure.Embracing this transformation facilitated by AI can result in heightened productivity, increased job satisfaction, and a more balanced and fulfilling work-life equilibrium.

McKinsey and Company, the global consulting firm with more than 30,000 employees in 67 countries, is embracing new generative AI tools in a major way: Nearly 50% of the firm’s workforce is using ChatGPT and similar technology. 
“About half of [our employees] are using those services with McKinsey’s permission,” said Ben Ellencweig, senior partner and leader of alliances and acquisitions at QuantumBlack, the firm’s artificial intelligence consulting arm, during a media event at McKinsey’s New York Experience Studio on Tuesday.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Ellencweig emphasized that McKinsey had guardrails for employees using generative AI, including “guidelines and principles” about what information the workers could input into these services.
“We do not upload confidential information,” Ellencweig said. 
As for which exact AI services McKinsey employees are using, and for what purposes, the speakers remained tight-lipped. 
>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
However, another speaker at the event, Alex Singla, also a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, implied that McKinsey was testing most of the leading generative AI services: “For all the major players, our tech folks have them all in a sandbox, [and are] playing with them every day,” he said.
Ellencweig and Singla were joined in Tuesday’s panel discussion on AI by Jacky Wright, another McKinsey senior partner and the firm’s chief technology and platform officer. The discussion was moderated by Ryan Heath, global tech correspondent from Axios. Other journalists in attendance among the dozens present at the event included representatives from The Wall Street Journal, CNBC and other leading media outlets.
The panelists related anecdotes about their own experiences with generative AI tools, as well as those of clients, including cautionary tales.
Singla described how one client, whose name was not disclosed, was in the business of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Employees there were using ChatGPT and asking it “What would you think if company X bought company Y?,” and using the resulting answers to try and game out the impact of potential acquisitions on their combined business. 
“You don’t want to be doing that with a publicly accessible model,” Singla said, though he did not elaborate as to why not. 
The four Cs: how McKinsey customers are using generative AI
Ellencweig offered examples, which he called “the four Cs,” of how McKinsey clients and the businesses it researches are currently using generative AI. These are:

Coding: Ellencweig said some of McKinsey’s client software developers had seen productivity gains of 35-55% by using ChatGPT and similar tools. 
Customer engagement: Some companies are using generative AI to offer more personalized customer interactions.
Creative content generation: Marketing firms are already using generative AI to streamline their content generation processes and to refine their audience segments, approaching a “segment of one,” i.e. marketing personalized for every individual.
Content synthesis: Firms are using generative AI to combine different data points and services in new ways.

McKinsey’s recommended 5-step approach for enterprise gen AIadvertisement
Regarding companies where leaders are still wondering how to approach generative AI in a safe, secure and smart way, Singla suggested they employ a five-step framework. 

IT stack and infrastructure: “Before the model is built and you create these cool insights, you need to think about your IT stack and infrastructure” and where the AI tools and data will be located — “in the cloud or your own infrastructure?”
Data: Will you be using structured or unstructured data? Are you going to use your own data, proprietary data, third-party data, or some combination thereof?  How will you organize this data? What protections do each of these require?
Choosing the right AI model: Which LLMs or generative AI tools will your company deploy and why? Deciding this “is absolutely required, but not sufficient on its own,” said Singla.
UI and UX: Singla cited ChatGPT’s simple interface as key to its uptake. “Anybody can use it, whether you’re eight years old or 80.”
Change management: How can your organization ensure that those using AI will be supported, will have their questions answered, and will see their work duties changed by AI?

Full Code with Github link.Naresh Ram·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·17 min read·Jun 7, 20232201ListenShareImage by Dall-E 2. Generated and modified by the author.In the digital age, accurate and reliable data is paramount for businesses striving to deliver personalized experiences and make informed decisions[1]. However, the sheer volume and complexity of data often pose significant challenges requiring many hours of tedious and manual work. Enter the game-changing technology of large language models (LLMs). These advanced AI tools, with their natural language processing capabilities and pattern recognition, have the potential to revolutionize the process of cleansing data to make it more usable.Among the wrenches and the screwdrivers in the data scientists’ tool chest are the LLMs, reshaping activities and harnessing powers to enhance data quality. The proverbial whack of a hammer will unlock actionable insights and ultimately pave the way for better customer experiences.That said, let’s drill right into the use case that I will be using as an example today.Photo by Scott Graham on UnsplashThe Use CaseThe worst thing you could do when conducting a survey among students is to leave a factual field as free-form text! You can imagine some of the responses we got.Jokes aside, one of our clients, Study Fetch, an AI-powered platform that uses course material to create personalized all-in-one study sets for students, conducted a survey among university students. After receiving a whopping 10K+ responses, their CEO and Co-Founder, Esan Durrani, stumbled upon a little hiccup. Turns out, the “major” field in the survey was a free-form text box, meaning respondents could type in whatever they pleased. Now, as data scientists, we know that’s not the brightest move if you want to crunch some statistical numbers. So, the raw data from the survey ended up looking like this…Anthropology Chem E Computer ScienceBusiness and LawDramacsIMBOh my! Get ready to grab your Excel and embark on a sorting adventure that might take you a mere hour or, who knows, maybe even three. Only then will this data heresy be thoroughly purged.Yet, fear not, as we have the hammer of the Large Language Model (LLM).As a wise man once said, if a hammer is all you have, everything looks like a nail. And boy, doesn’t the data cleansing job look like the most perfect nail?We can simply ask our friendly neighborhood LLM to classify these into known majors. Specifically, OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), an LLM that powers the popular Chatbot app ChatGPT, will work for this case. GPT models use upwards of 175 billion parameters and have been trained on 2.6 billion stored web pages scraped from Common Crawl, an open dataset. Additionally, through a technique known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), trainers can nudge and prod the model into providing more accurate and useful responses. [2]I think for our purpose, 175 billion+ parameters, should do just fine. As long as we are able to come up with the right prompt.Photo by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashIt’s all in the PromptRyan and Esan, from the AI company whose bread-and-butter is writing great prompts, proposed the first version of our prompt. It was a great one and did work very well using language inference[3], but there were two things that could be improved:It was written to work for one recordIt was written as a ‘Completion’ using the Da Vinci Model (My bank account recoiled in fear at the mere mention of IT)It would cost us too much and that simply wasn’t going to do. So, Ryan and I independently rewrote the prompt as a chat prompt using ‘gpt-3.5-turbo’ to perform bulk action. OpenAI’s prompt best practices and the course ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers came in handy for me. We went through a few more iterations of ideate, implement, analyze, and reform and we had a good working version.Without further ado, here is the prompt after revision 2:1. Arts and Humanities: Literature and arts.2. Social Sciences: psychology, sociology, and political science3. Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBA4. Life Sciences: Biology, environmental,agriculture-related5. Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.6. Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical school7. All Other Programs: Everything else.The above information pertains to categories of undergraduate programs. Categorize the below data into one of the program categories above.   Desired Format: CSV of data row, program name Data###DramaLiteraturePhysicsHealth sciencesMechanical Engineering###Response from the LLM for this Prompt wasDrama, Arts and Humanities: Literature and artsIMB, All Other Programs: Everything elseHealth sciences, Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical schoolMBA, Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBAMechanical Engineering, Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.This will work, sort of. But I didn’t quite like the redundant text with the long program names repeating. With LLMs, text is tokens and tokens cost money. You see, my programming skills were forged in the fiery depths of the Dot Com Bust. And let me tell you, I never pass up an opportunity for some cost-saving optimizations.So, I changed the prompt slightly in the ‘Desired Format’ section. I asked the model to output just the ordinal number of the survey responses (E.g. 1 for Drama above) and the ordinal number of the program (E.g. 1 for Literature). Then Ryan suggested I should request a JSON output instead of CSV to make it simpler to parse. He also recommended I add an ‘example output’ section, an excellent suggestion.The final prompt is as follows (simplified for clarity):1. Arts and Humanities: Literature and arts.2. Social Sciences: psychology, sociology, and political science3. Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBA4. Life Sciences: Biology, environmental,agriculture-related5. Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.6. Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical school7. All Other Programs: Everything else.The above information pertains to categories of undergraduate programs. Categorize the below data into one of the program categories above.   Desired Format: JSON format of an array with response number, program numberExample Example output:  [[1,7],[2,1],[3,5],[4,8],[5,7]] Data###1. Drama2. IMB3. Health sciences4. MBA5. Mechanical Engineering###The full prompt we used can be viewed on the GitHub link here.The output from the model:[  [1, 1]  [2, 3]  [3, 6]  [4, 3]  [5, 5]]So, as discussed earlier, the output from the model is a mapping between the ordinal numbers of survey responses and the categories we defined. Take the first line for example: 1,1. That means 1 is the response number and 1 is the corresponding mapped program number. Survey response 1 is “Drama” and the mapped program 1 is “Arts and Humanities”. This seems right! Drama in its proper #1 place, all eyes on it.While the output at first glance looks like the output of embeddings (used in clustering and dimensionality reduction), they are simply the same mapped information with just the ordinal positions. In addition to providing some cost benefits on token usage, the numbers are easier to parse.We can now translate the original survey response in the file into meaningful majors, do aggregation, and gain valuable actionable insights.But wait, I’m not going to sit in front of my computer, type each block of survey responses into the browser and calculate the mappings. Besides being mind-numbing, the error rate would simply not do.What we need is some good old automation. Enter the API …Photo by Laura Ockel on UnsplashAPI to the RescueAs you may be aware, the Application Programming Interface (API) allows our program to interact with third-party services efficiently. While many people are accomplishing impressive feats with ChatGPT, the real potential of Language Models lies in utilizing the API to seamlessly integrate natural language capabilities into an application, making it imperceptible to the users. Much like the incredible science and technology that goes into making the phone or computer you are using to read this article on.If you don’t already have it, you can request access to the API here, https://openai.com/blog/openai-api [4]. Once you sign up and get your API key, the specification can be found here. Some really helpful examples with code samples can be found here. The playground is a nice feature to test the prompt with various settings before you put it in [5].We will be using the chat completion API using REST. A sample payload of the call is as follows:{   “model”: “gpt-3.5-turbo”,   “temperature”: 0,  ""n"": 1,  “messages”: [     {“role”: “user”, “content”: “Hello, I'm a nail.”}  ]}Let’s take a quick look at the parameters and their effectsmodelThe only one open to the public at this point for chat completions is gpt-3.5-turbo. Esan had access to GPT 4 model, which I was very jealous about. While gpt-4 is more accurate and hallucinates less [2], it is roughly 20 times more expensive and for our needs, Mr. Turbo was quite adequate, thank you.temperatureNext to the prompt, the temperature is one of the most important settings we can pass to the model. It can be set to a value between 0 and 2, as per the API docs. It has a significant impact [6] as it controls how much randomness is in the output, sort of like the amount of caffeine in your system before you start writing. A guide to values you can use for each application is given here [7]For our use case, we simply want no variations. We want the engine to give us mappings as is and the same ones every single time. So, we used a value of 0.nHow many chat completions choices to generate? If we were doing this for creative writing and wanted more than 1 choice to select from, we can use 2 or even 3. For our case n=1 (default) will work well.messageThe role can be system, user, or assistant. The system role provides instructions and sets the context. The user role represents the prompt from the end user. The assistant role is the responses based on the conversation history. These roles help structure conversations and enable effective interaction between users and the AI assistant.MODEL MAX TOKENSThis isn’t necessarily a parameter we pass in the request, though another parameter called max_tokens limits the total length of the response from the chat.Firstly, a token can be thought of as a piece of a word. One token is approximately 4 characters in English. For example, the quote “The best way to predict the future is to create it” attributed to Abraham Lincoln and others, contains 11 tokens.Image from Open AI Tokenizer. Generated by the Author.If you are thinking that a token is exactly a word, here is another example of 64 tokens, to show it isn’t all that straightforward.Image from Open AI Tokenizer. Generated by the Author.Brace yourself for a shocking revelation: every emoji you include in your message adds a hefty toll of up to 6. That’s right, your beloved smileys and winks are sneaky little token thieves! 😉💸The model max token window is a technical limit. Your prompt (including any additional data you place into it) and the answer must all fit within the model max limit listed here. In the case of chat completions, the content, role, and all of the previous messages all consume tokens. If you remove a message from the input or the output (assistant messages), the model will lose all knowledge of it [8]. Like Dory as she helps find Chico, no Fabio, no Bingo, no Harpo, no Elmo?… Nemo!For gpt-3.5-turbo, the model maximum limit is 4096 tokens or roughly 16K characters. For our use case, the prompt is roughly 2000 characters, each survey response is roughly 20 chars (average) and the mapping response is 7 characters. So, if we put N survey responses in each prompt, the max characters will be:2000 + 20*N + 7*N should be less than 16,000.Solving we get an N value less than 518 or roughly 500. Technically, we could put 500 survey responses in each request and go through our data 20 times. Instead, we chose to put 50 in each response and do it 200 times as we were receiving abnormal responses intermittently if we put more than 50 survey responses in a single request. Once in a while, the service threw a temper tantrum! We’re not sure if it’s a chronic case of systemic petulance or if we just happened to stumble upon the grumpy side of luck.So, how do we use this API we have? Let’s get to the good part, the code.Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashThe Way of the CodeNode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment [9]. We will write a Node.js/Javascript program that will perform the actions as described in this flow chart:Flowchart of the program. Image by the Author.My Javascript skills aren’t that great. I can write better Java, PHP, Julia, Go, C#, or even Python. But Esan was insisting on Node, so Javascript it is.The entire code, the prompt, and the sample input are available at this GitHub link. However, let’s take a gander at the juiciest bits:First, let’s see how we read the CSV file in using the “csv-parser’ Node Library.fs.createReadStream(fileName)  .pipe(csv())  .on('data', (data) => rows.push(data))  .on('end', async () => {   // Reading is done. Call classifier here     . . .      }Next, we call the classifier to generate the mappings.for(index = 0; index < totalDataPoints; ++index) {        dataText += (index+1).toString() + "". ""                         + uniqueData[index] + ""\n"";        requestCount++;        if (requestCount>batchSize||index==totalDataPoints-1){           dataText += ""###\n"";           // We have loaded batchSize(50) response.            // Now construct the prompt            ...      }}The prompt is then constructed from the categories, main prompt text, and the data from the CSV. We then send the prompt to the service using their OpenAI Node Library.let prompt = categoriesText + mainPrompt + dataText;let payload = {    model: ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",    temperature: 0,    messages: [         {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},        {""role"": ""user"",""content"": prompt }    ]};try {   const response = await openai.createChatCompletion(payload);   let mapping = JSON.parse(response.data.choices[0].message.content);    // Here save the mappings   ...} catch (error) {   console.error('API Error:',error);}Finally, when all the iterations are done, we can translate the srcCol text (the survey response) to the targetCol (the normalized program name), and write out the CSV.for (let row of rows) {    srcVal = row[srcCol].trim();    if (!row[targetCol] && dataMapping[srcVal])        row[targetCol] = dataMapping[srcVal];}        stringify(rows, {    header: true}, function (err, output) {   fs.writeFile(__dirname+'/'+destFileName, output,       function(err, result) {          if(err) console.log('error', err);       });});That bit of JavaScript wasn’t as hairy as I expected and it got done in 2 to 3 hours. I guess it always looks daunting until you get into it.So, now that we have the code ready, it’s time for the final execution…Photo by Alexander Grey on UnsplashThe ExecutionNow, we needed a place to run the code. After debating if we should get a cloud instance to run the load, I did some quick math and realized that I could run it on my laptop in less than an hour. That wasn’t so bad.We started with a test round and noticed that the service, 1 out of 10 times, would respond back with the data that was provided to it instead of the mappings. So, we would just get the list of the survey responses back. Since no mappings were found, those responses in the CSV file would be mapped to an empty string.Instead of detecting this and retrying in code, I decided to rerun the script but have it only process records for which the target column was empty.The script would start with the target column in all rows empty and fill in the normalized program name. Due to the error in the response, some of the rows would have the target column not be mapped and remain empty. When the script ran the second time, it would construct the prompt for only those responses which were not processed in the first run. We reran the program a couple of times and got everything mapped out.The multiple runs took roughly about 30 minutes and did not need much supervision. Here is a selection of some of the more interesting mappings from the model:Sample Mappings between input and program name. Image by the Author.Most look right. Not sure if Organizational Behavior is Social Science or Business? I guess either would work.Each request of about 50 records took a total of roughly 800 tokens. The cost of the entire exercise was 40 cents. We probably spent 10 cents, doing testing, reruns, etc. So for a total cost of about 50 cents, about 2 ½ hrs of coding/testing time, and ½ hr of runtime, we got the job done.Total Cost: Approx. Less than $1Total Time: Approx. 3 hoursPerhaps manual conversion using Excel, sorting, regex, and drag-and-copy, we could have accomplished it in the same amount of time and saved a little change. But, this was way more fun, we learned something, we have a repeatable script/process, and got an article out of it. Besides, I have a feeling StudyFetch can afford the 50 cents.This was a good use that we achieved efficiently and cost-effectively, but what else can LLMs be used for?Photo by Marcel Strauß on UnsplashLooking for More NailsAdding language capability to your applications can have further use cases than the one I illustrated above. Here are more use cases just pertaining to the review data we were looking at:Data Parsing and Standardization: LLMs can help in parsing and standardizing data by identifying and extracting relevant information from unstructured or semi-structured data sources like the one we just looked at.Data Deduplication: LLMs can help identify duplicate records by comparing various data points. For example, we can compare names, majors, and universities in the review data and flag potential duplicates.Data Summarization: LLMs can summarize distinct records to get an idea of the response. For E.g. for the question “What is the biggest challenge you face while studying?”, a large language model can summarize several responses from the same major and university to see if there are any patterns. We can then put all the summarizations into a single request and get an overall list. But I suspect summarization from each customer segment will be more useful.Sentiment Analysis: LLMs can analyze the reviews to determine sentiment and extract valuable insights. For the question “Would you pay for a service to help you study?”, LLMs can categorize the sentiment as 0 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). We can then use this to analyze student interest in a paid service by segment.While student reviews are a great example of a smaller microcosm, the wider world has several uses for this technology as well. At AAXIS, where I work, we implement business-to-business as well as business-to-consumer digital commerce solutions. Doing so includes migrating large amounts of data from an existing older system to a newer system with different data structures. We use a variety of data tools to analyze source data to ensure consistency. The techniques outlined in this article could be of good use for that purpose.Some of the other digital commerce use cases are checking the product catalog for errors, writing product copy, scanning review responses, and product review summarization, to name a few. A lot simpler to code for than the murky waters of undergrad creativity when asked for their majors.Still, it is important to note that while LLMs can be powerful tools in cleansing data, they should be used in conjunction with other techniques and human oversight. Data cleansing processes often require domain expertise, context understanding, and manual review to make informed decisions and maintain data integrity. LLMs are also not inference engines[10]. They are next-word predictors. And they tend to provide incorrect information very confidently and convincingly (hallucinations) [2][11]. Fortunately, during our testing, we didn’t encounter any hallucinations since our use case primarily involved classification.LLMs can be a great tool in your arsenal if you proceed with caution and are aware of the pitfalls.Photo by Paul Szewczyk on UnsplashThe Final NailWe started out, in this article, by looking at a specific use case of data cleansing: normalizing survey responses to a specific set of values. This would allow us to group the responses and gain valuable insights. We used a Large Language Model (LLM), Open AI’s GPT 3.5 Turbo, to help classify these responses. We reviewed the prompt that was used, how to make use of the API calls using the prompt, and the code needed to automate it all. Finally, we got it all put together and got the job done for a total OpenAI utility cost of less than one dollar.Did we have a proverbial LLM hammer and found the perfectly shiny nail in free-form survey responses? Maybe. More likely, we had a Swiss army knife and used it to skin and eat some fish. Not quite purpose-built, but still very adequate. And Esan really loves Sushi.What is your use case?

LoginThis article is part of a Growth Nation series exploring the impact of technology on the economy and our lives. The launch of ChatGPT has reignited the discussion around how many jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI).While AI can help boost productivity by eliminating some routine tasks, it is likely to eradicate some jobs, including white-collar roles – but new jobs will also emerge.Digitisation, automation and generative AI are having a profound impact on labour markets across developed economies, with low-skilled jobs or those involving repetitive tasks at greater risk of being replaced by AI.But even higher skilled roles including legal and engineering jobs could be replaced by computers.The federal government last week called for submissions in a snap eight-week consultation about how to classify and regulate the new technology, and is considering a ban on “high-risk” uses of AI such as in surgery.AdvertisementRandstad NSW director Jo Jakobs says many white-collar roles are vulnerable to being replaced by AI, particularly those involving routine tasks such as document writing or drafting, or working with numbers or data, which computers can learn to do at a much faster rate.“What’s interesting about this next wave of potential job displacement is that it is affecting higher-skilled roles,” says Jakobs.“This includes data analysts and market researchers; AI can analyse data much faster and accurately than humans, which makes it easier for companies to make data-driven decisions.“Content writers, too, will be affected. AI already is replacing and powering large parts of the content generation process. From ideas generation to creating press releases and blog articles, the impact of AI in this space is just starting to be fully felt and understood.”Higher-order thinkingJakobs says AI can also automate tasks such as data entry, reconciliations and financial reporting. “AI-powered robo-advisers can also provide investment advice and portfolio management services. So, too, can AI automate legal tasks such as document review, legal research and contract drafting,” she says.AdvertisementHowever, AI can’t do everything. It can’t replace human cognition and higher order thinking, which involves using language, memory and perception.Diana Mousina, a senior economist with AMP, says high-skilled jobs such as management jobs will be harder to replace by AI because they involve human judgment and expertise.AMP senior economist Diana Mousina: “Soft skills can’t be replaced by AI, and jobs involving human judgment.”  “High-skill jobs tend to be harder to replace by machines because they are non-routine and cognitive-based, such as management and professional jobs,” she says. “This includes soft skills, which can’t be replaced by AI, and jobs involving human judgment.“But middle-skill jobs are more susceptible to displacement by technology because they tend to be routine-based manual or cognitive tasks such as production jobs and jobs including sales and office occupations, which means they can be learned and replicated by machines.”Moreover, Australia faces a lower risk of losing jobs to automation than many other OECD countries given the nation’s greater levels of education, robust export services sector and high rates of urbanisation.Advertisement“Fear of machines taking all human jobs is also misplaced. Around 14 per cent of jobs in the OECD are at a high risk of automation and most of these are in middle-skill routine roles. In Australia, it is closer to 7 per cent,” says Mousina.“Globally, the workforces that are more at risk of having jobs automated include those in countries with a low-educated workforce, a weak tradeable services sector and those with a low urbanisation rate.”According to the OECD’s latest estimates, in Australia 10 per cent of jobs have been estimated to be at a high risk of automation compared to an OECD average of 14 per cent. Jobs at risk of significant change are estimated at 24.6 per cent, compared to 31.6 per cent for the OECD average.Difficult to replaceRegions where jobs are at most risk of automation tend to be those with high employment shares in manufacturing, agriculture, or the mining sector, says the OECD report, Preparing for the Future of Work Across Australia.Mousina also notes that some manual low-skill jobs, including service-based jobs related to assisting others like cleaning and gardening, will be difficult to replace by a machine or AI.Advertisement“Such jobs are likely to grow in importance from a growing middle-class and ageing populations. It’s the routine office jobs that are most at risk of AI.”In the US, a new report by Goldman Sachs estimates that 46 per cent of administrative positions, 44 per cent of legal positions, and 37 per cent of engineering jobs could be replaced by AI. More generally, that report found that 18 per cent of jobs globally could be automated by AI.White-collar workers would be the first to go in the US, with the greatest job losses likely in office support and administrative roles, in the legal industry and in architecture and engineering.Remove drudgeryHowever, experts agree that as AI technologies are developed, this will create new job opportunities, especially for professionals who can develop, maintain and operate AI systems, such as computer programmers and software engineers.“AI technologies have the potential to create new job opportunities, particularly in areas such as, of course, AI development, maintenance and customer support, and in areas we might not even realise or know of right now,” says Randstad’s Jakobs.Advertisement“There are roles in play currently known as prompt engineers whose main responsibility is to feed and train the AI to continuously give users more accurate and useful responses.“Additionally, the automation of routine and repetitive tasks can actually remove some of the drudgery involved in some roles and free up workers to focus their time more on the creative and higher-value work, such as relationship building.“However, my view is that while AI can replace some tasks within these roles, it’s unlikely to replace entire jobs. The human factor is still relevant and hugely important.“AI has not evolved to the point where it is a replacement for human skills such as empathy, creativity and critical thinking – which are still highly valued in many industries and professions, and are likely to remain important for years to come.”Nor is it too late for workers to train to gain AI skills or for graduates to focus on in-demand IT skills.Hima Arafath, a recruiter for data analytics and data engineering professionals at Parity Consulting, says AI skills are some of the most in-demand in Australia. Jobs in high demand include data scientists, software engineers, software developers and architects, machine learning engineers, business intelligence developers, research scientists and data analysts.“The future of AI-driven automation is something that the Australian workforce should be preparing for,” she says. “Individuals should consider retraining or upskilling themselves in areas where they feel machines could replace them. This will help workers keep ahead of the curve and ensure they are skilled in using new automation technologies as they come online.“These technologies are constantly evolving, and it takes time and effort to keep up with the latest advancements. As a result, people with these skills are rare, and companies are willing to pay top dollar to such employees. However, automation can’t bring personalisation and that ‘human touch’, which is a crucial element for any business.”Expert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowSaveLog in or Subscribe to save articleShareCopy linkCopiedEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebookCopy linkCopiedShare via...Gift this articleSubscribers can give anyone free access to articles.Gift this article NewSubscribe to gift this articleGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.Subscribe nowAlready a subscriber?

Healthcare professionals use information from various sources, including medical records, research papers, and clinical guidelines to help them with everything from definitions of conditions to diagnoses and treatment options. However, healthcare data is often stored in many different formats and locations, which can make it difficult to find the information clinicians need when they need it. Enterprise Search in Gen App Builder unifies data across dispersed documents, databases, and intranets, making it easier to search, analyze, and identify the most relevant results.






Google Cloud is collaborating with Mayo Clinic to transform healthcare with gen AI, starting with enterprise search.

""Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare by enhancing human interactions and automating operations like never before,"" said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO. ""Mayo Clinic is a world leader in leveraging AI for good, and they are a critical partner as we identify responsible ways to bring this transformative technology to healthcare.""

To continue developing all of these capabilities in a clinical setting, Google Cloud is collaborating with Mayo Clinic and several healthcare organizations.""Our prioritization of patient safety, privacy, and ethical considerations, means that generative AI can have a significant and positive impact on how we work and deliver healthcare,"" said Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic's Chief Information Officer. ""Google Cloud's tools have the potential to unlock sources of information that typically aren't searchable in a conventional manner, or are difficult to access or interpret, from a patient's complex medical history to their imaging, genomics, and labs. Accessing insights more quickly and easily could drive more cures, create more connections with patients, and transform healthcare.""Google Cloud's generative AI offerings build on years of research and proven applications in AI and will give healthcare organizations new capabilities to generate real-time, personalized, and unique interactions that weren't possible before. Previously, AI scanned lots of data to identify patterns to enable greater efficiencies to improve existing work. Now with generative AI, data can be reviewed in more sophisticated ways, information can be condensed and digested, and new images can be created, among other uses.Google Cloud's generative AI tools, like Gen App Builder and Generative AI support in Vertex AI, can help healthcare organizations optimize workforce productivity, streamline administrative processes, and leverage technology to automate repetitive tasks, allowing caregivers to focus on higher-value patient interactions.Mayo Clinic is an early adopter of Google Cloud's Enterprise Search in Gen App Builder and is exploring how the combination of Google-quality search with generative AI can bring important information to doctors, clinicians, and other employees, in a fast, seamless, and conversational way.Today's news builds on previous work with Google Cloud on Mayo Clinic's digital transformation, including programs that leverage analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions.Google Cloud's approach to data governance and privacy policies ensures its customers retain control over their data. In healthcare settings, access and use of patient data is appropriately protected through the implementation of Google Cloud's reliable infrastructure and secure data storage that support HIPAA compliance, along with each customer's security, privacy controls, and processes. Google Cloud's responsible approach to generative AI also means customers have access to tools to directly tune large language models and to review model responses for biased or unvalidated content, teaching the model to avoid inappropriate outputs.For more information, check out the Google Cloud blog on A responsible path to generative AI in healthcare, and Helping businesses with generative AI.About Google CloudGoogle Cloud accelerates every organization's ability to digitally transform its business.

inunder the radar


OpenAI: the ChatGPT start-up now worth billions AI job fears: how can we regulate the ‘rise of the robots’? Pros and cons of artificial intelligenceRishi Sunak has put AI at the top of his agenda when he meets with President Biden later this week.At his first White House talks with the US President, “he is expected to plug London as the venue for a new international body to regulate AI”, reported The Daily Telegraph.Ahead of the trip, the PM’s spokesperson said: “Obviously we are not complacent about the potential risks of AI. Equally, it does present significant opportunities for the people of the UK.”

Enjoy a clear, balanced and refreshingly open view with The Week.




The meeting comes as industry experts warn that generative AI systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT could lead to “significant disruption” and affect roughly 300 million full-time jobs worldwide.LATEST VIDEOS FROM theweekTheWeekThis is according to Goldman Sachs research, which found “two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation”. The chatbot “may be more powerful than we ever imagined”, Insider added, while New Atlas described OpenAI’s text-generating tool as an “ominous preview of a looming tidal wave of AI systems”.This chimes with OpenAI’s own findings that 80% of the US workforce could be affected, with the “influence [spanning] all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure”.Despite the potential disruption, “there are still things AI isn’t capable of”, countered the BBC, which includes “tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking”.The Week takes a look at the jobs most and least at risk of being replaced by AI.Three jobs most at risk from AI1. Media rolesRoles in the media industry “across the board” are at risk because “AI is able to read, write and understand text-based data”, Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute told Insider.Systems like ChatGPT might also be able to execute tasks like reporting “more efficiently than humans”, said economist Paul Krugman, writing for The New York Times. The industry is also “already beginning to experiment” with AI-generated content, Insider added, citing CNET and Buzzfeed as examples.2. Teaching ChatGPT has already been used “to help students cheat on their essays”, said Insider, but teachers “should also be thinking about their job security”, according to Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology.Although generative AI “has bugs and inaccuracies”, he said, “you just need to train” the underlying model, he told The New York Post.3. Legal administrationLegal workers are also one of the most likely to be affected, the Goldman Sachs report said, “because the number of jobs in legal services is relatively small and have already been highly exposed to AI”, an author of the study, Manan Raj, told Insider.Paralegals and legal assistants “are responsible for consuming large amounts of information, synthesising what they learned, then making it digestible”. The information they process is “quite amenable to generative AI”, added Madgavkar.Three jobs least at risk from AI1. Medical practitionersAlthough “mundane administrative tasks” in healthcare can be automated, said Forbes, “most adults want to hear about their health from a human”, said David Dranove, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, to Kellogg Insight.One “insulated category” comprises “jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships”, said author Martin Ford to BBC Worklife. Nursing is an example, and those who occupy such roles need “a very deep understanding of people”, he added.“There’s a need for compassion in communication that AI is unable to contribute,” Dranove added.2. Skilled trade jobsAnother category relatively safe from the influence of AI is “skilled trades jobs” including people like electricians, plumbers, welders, and other roles, said Ford to CBS News. These are jobs in which “you have a need for lots of dexterity and mobility and unpredictable environments”.These jobs are “probably the hardest of anything to automate”, he added to BBC Worklife, also telling CBS News: “We need a very, very sophisticated science fiction-level robot to do what an electrician does.”3. Creative rolesAlthough generative AI is centred around generating content like text and imagery, Ford told BBC Worklife that people in the creative industries aren’t doing “formulaic work or just rearranging things”. Instead, they are “genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new”, with AI unable to replicate this trait.Although some creative roles like graphic design and visual art “may be among the first to go”, there’s “security” in alternative kinds of creativity, he added, especially “people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy”.

“After Warhol, what uses are sufficiently ‘transformative’? Answers to [that and a number of other] questions are likely to impact the fair use analysis as applied to generative AI platforms.”

Midjourney prompt: “warhol’s ghost in the machine sci fi”
On May 18, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court answered an exceedingly narrow question of copyright law with potentially sweeping impact: did the purpose and character of Andy Warhol’s below ‘Orange Prince’ work—as used on a 2016 Condé Nast magazine cover—support fair use of Lynn Goldsmith’s photograph of famed musician Prince Rogers Nelson a/k/a Prince?
In a 7-2 decision, the Court found that it does not, calling into question nearly 30 years of fair use jurisprudence, arguably narrowing the scope of that doctrine, and potentially threatening disciplines that rely on it, e.g., appropriation art. The decision is also sure to impact generative artificial intelligence (“AI”), an emerging technology that is also likely to rely heavily on fair use.
The Warhol Decision
Andy Warhol died in 1987, but his copyrighted works live on. Today, those works are licensed by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. (“AWF”). In 2016, AWF licensed to Condé Nast Warhol’s ‘Orange Prince,’ an unpublished, unlicensed silkscreen artwork of Lynn Goldsmith’s 1981 black-and-white photograph, to use on a magazine cover to memorialize Prince. Goldsmith objected to ‘Orange Prince’ after learning of it from the commemorative issue, AWF responded with a declaratory judgment action, and Goldsmith counterclaimed for infringement. The district court found for AWF on fair use grounds, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, and the U.S. Supreme Court—faced with the narrow question of whether the first fair use factor favored Goldsmith or AWF—affirmed the Second Circuit’s ruling.
The majority and dissenting opinions starkly disagree on how to apply the fair use factors. Whereas the dissent focuses on the purpose and character of Warhol’s creation of Goldsmith’s photo to create ‘Orange Prince,’ the majority all but disregards it, and relies on the purpose and character of AWF’s licensing of ‘Orange Prince’ for use as a magazine cover. And whereas the majority finds that the mere addition of new expression cannot sway the first factor in a copyist’s favor without swallowing the author’s derivative works right, the dissent posits that the fourth factor— the effect on the author’s potential market for the work—addresses that concern.
Warhol raises many questions. After Warhol, what uses are sufficiently “transformative”? Does Warhol square with the Court’s 2021 copyright fair use decision in Oracle v. Google? And does it square with the Second Circuit’s decisions in the Author’s Guild and HathiTrust cases (which the Court tacitly endorsed when it declined to grant certiorari in Author’s Guild)? Answers to those questions are likely to impact the fair use analysis as applied to generative AI platforms.
What is Generative AI? 
Generative AI refers to services comprised of algorithms that users can interact with to create content. A hallmark of these generative AI models is their “training” with huge datasets, i.e., millions if not billions of images, in an iterative process whereby the generative AI model “learns” to generate increasingly accurate images in response to text prompts. Critically, some of the most popular generative AI text-to-image models have been trained on unlicensed datasets.
Artists use generative AI to create images in various ways. Some engage in a collaborative process involving iterative re-submission of AI-generated images to the generative AI platform. Others take an AI-generated image and modify it with traditional graphic design tools. Still others use AI-generated images as inspiration to create new works using non-AI tools. In each case, however, users benefit from a generative AI platform that may be “trained” on unlicensed images.
Copyright Fair Use in the Generative AI Context
Recent litigation involving generative AI platforms suggests that the scope of fair use will undoubtedly be an issue to consider. In its motion to dismiss a copyright infringement complaint over its use of unlicensed training sets, Midjourney, Inc. referred to its “obvious fair use defenses” to copyright infringement. Yet, following the Supreme Court’s Warhol decision, exactly how “obvious” is that defense?
Before Warhol, it seemed likely that a court could find the creation of a generative AI platform using unlicensed training data to be insulated by fair use; arguably, the use of content to “train” a platform that generates content is precisely the kind of “highly creative and innovative” use that courts have found transformative. Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 141 S. Ct. 1183, 1203 (2021). In fact, if Google’s searchable databases are transformative, one could reasonably argue that generative AI text prompts—much like word searches—must also have a different “purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the [work] from which [they are] drawn” and are thus “quintessentially transformative use[s].” Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 217 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87, 97 (2d Cir. 2014)).
Warhol, however, complicates that analysis. In Warhol, the Court, applying the first fair use factor, held the purpose and character of Warhol’s ‘Orange Prince’ was similar to Goldsmith’s, as both works were licensed for use in popular magazines. Does that mean that a plaintiff artist can defeat a generative AI platform’s fair use defense by licensing his or her work to similar generative AI platforms? Or by pointing to other artists that have licensed their work to generative AI platforms? This, together with the Court’s admonition that a “transformative” use must “go beyond that required to qualify as a derivative” suggests that using an identical work, commercially, to do something that artists can and have already licensed, raises serious doubts about the strength of fair use as a defense to allegedly infringing creations of generative AI platforms.
Warhol’s Ghost Looms Large
Warhol’s work, as well as his posthumous celebrity status (which, given his oeuvre, is nothing short of ironic) continue to influence modern culture and push boundaries, most recently by testing the limits of copyright fair use. Not surprisingly, Warhol’s image, work, style, and legacy has also found its way into generative AI. Were he still alive today, chances are that Andy Warhol would himself be experimenting with generative AI. Fortunately for us, generative AI gives us a nearly limitless opportunity to experiment with Warhol.

While HR functions are still in their nascent stages to harness the impact of AI, the early adopters of the technology have seen a monumental impact on business outcomes. Especially, when it comes to recruitment, back in 2017, costs pre-screen decreased by 75% as a result of the implementation of AI recruiting software. Chatbots, AI-powered ATS, and AI-enabled skill assessment are some of the popular AI recruitment technologies that organisations have been experimenting with to streamline or automate some parts of the recruiting workflow, especially repetitive, high-volume tasks. The tech has also been successful in supporting recruiters with screening for reduced bias, as well as visibility into past successful candidates that have remained at the organisation.In this series of Tech-Wise, we will look at how AI has proved to be an impactful force in the space of recruitment and how Generative AI further will prove to be a game-changer in recruiting and retaining talent. To better showcase these use cases, we have used ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Cohere Generate.First, and foremost how generative AI is different from earlier versions of AI?Generative AI is a next-generation conversational AI that distinguishes itself from the earlier versions of AI and chatbots by being able to provide a very genuine and human-like conversational experience.Not only this feature can help create a great experience for candidates but also help improve speed and efficiency which is integral to creating a more personalised candidate experience.Here are some use cases on how generative AI can be used to hire talent:Write job descriptions or adsGenerative AI can offer ready-to-use job descriptions to be posted on recruitment. If you are time-pressurised and need to get a good quality job ad up fast, or working as a recruiter but not a natural writer, generative AI is a very useful tool to have. We used ChatGPT as a tool to create a job description for a mid-senior-level business development professional.             Candidate assessmentGenerative AI can be used to develop more sophisticated candidate assessments based on the role you are hiring for and the specific skills and competencies that you need. By creating customised tests, simulations, or case studies, AI can help you evaluate your candidates' skills and abilities more accurately. This can help you identify top talent more accurately and make more informed, data-driven decisions hiring decisions.Write candidate outreach copyWe used another Generative AI tool, Cohere Generate to generate text. We added our request, and typical job details like compensation, and work timings which are some of the first few questions that candidates ask regarding a job. Below you can find the end result. To make the email more coherent, you can also add the job description to the request.    Create your EVP messagingFor writing the EVP, we used Google Bard. As you can see, the EVP it created is detailed, convincing, and inspiring and met the standard of the typical middle-of-the-range EVP we usually see out there. You could use it as is at a stretch, but most likely you would use it as a starting template, and this could save time in the hiring value chain.One of the things that we noticed in Google Bard is that it also shares suggestions to make content more detailed and make it more aligned with your needs. It also shares alternative drafts which you can select content from different drafts and curate that suits your needs.      Improve your D&amp;I quotient in hiringDE&amp;I remains one of the top priorities for talent teams. One of the challenges in DE&amp;I hiring is the reach of job posts to the desired candidates. Generative AI can support your job descriptions and messaging by estimating which terms are inclusive and what language must be avoided at all costs.AI is reshaping the way that people work, and clearly, it is also influencing who companies choose to hire. The ways in which AI will continue to foster change are limitless. However, we must lean on these tools responsibly.",,,,,,,,,,,emea@ethrworld.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite widespread hysteria that artificial intelligence will make most of our jobs irrelevant, it could actually streamline the workflow for plenty of professions—including music production. We chose a couple of our favorite tools for simplifying music production and put them to the test, demonstrating a real-world scenario in which this technology could be used for good instead of evil. It’s time we embrace this new technology as a helping hand rather than disavow it as a doomsday device, and we hope this guide will help you get your feet wet.What’s The Deal With AI Music Generators?It’s important to note that some of these programs can generate music—but we’re still far from being able to push a button to churn out a one-hit-wonder. The AI music generators we tested are legitimate tools, unlike the voice changers you may have seen that can make anyone sound like Drake. (The New York Times recently chronicled an AI Drake hit that briefly went viral before being stripped from streaming services, and spoiler alert, he was not happy.)Messing around with Riffusion, it didn’t take long to realize that none of the music is necessarily Spotify ready out of the box—I guess it also helps to have even a lick of musical talent. However, this basic idea made me realize that these programs are helpful for ideation in song creation, and not necessarily “cheating” and doing the musician’s whole job. Most of these tools are much simpler to use than ChatGPT, Midjourney, and some of the other models we’ve written about previously.  ✅ How Do AI Music Generators Work? Much like AI image generators and text-based AI tools, AI music generators rely on deep learning—a machine learning method in which computers process data in a way that mimics the human mind—to create an output. Specifically, the software must be fed vast amounts of training data (here, examples of music) and process it. But if you only teach the system with the greatest hits from the Beatles, for instance, any melody that the AI music generator would produce after that training period would sound a whole hell of a lot like ... the Beatles. That’s why a huge library of training data, from varied sources, is key to this process. RiffusionThis super lightweight web app was one of the first AI music models I began playing around with. Using Stable Diffusion—yes, the same platform that creates images—Riffusion is able to create an image that’s then synthesized to create “music.” I use the quotations there sparingly as many of the ideas it spits out are not only low-fidelity but also quite basic. However, it can absolutely provide a musician with a cool riff or beat that they could use in their work. The white slab that you see to the left of the screen is the image Riffusion synthesizes. The app analyzes the peaks and valleys, and proceeds to translate the physical form into music the same way a record player interprets sound from the ridges on vinyl. Along with the prompts (see the photo above for an example), I also have control over melodic patterns, creativity, tempo, and that’s about it.Nothing special, but it’s more than enough to get the creative juices flowing. ChatGPT Despite some of the sillier things I’ve asked ChatGPT to do, it didn’t take me long to realize that it could actually be another incredibly useful tool for musicians looking to find samples—and even lyrics. Sure, most of its training data is from 2021 and earlier, but this isn’t a big issue as there’s a plethora of great tunes to choose from that predate even the 21st century. As you’ll see below, I asked it for five samples with similar vibes to Tijuana Brass. Along with finding samples, it’s also a great tool for writing lyrics. They’re not perfect, but with a little human intervention, the lyrics below are a great springboard for writing a country song about Formula 1.Samplette.io While ChatGPT is a great starting point for finding new music, Samplette IO gives you more control over the results. Instead of aimlessly sifting through YouTube, this app gives you eight filters to tune your search results—genre, style, country, key, tempo, vocality, views, and year—and find exactly what you want. It also includes a keyword section to further narrow down your findings.Samplette is also a super useful tool for finding new music. I’ve also never had to skip through ads while listening to music—make of that information what you will. Don’t tell Spotify, but I’ve found Samplette’s algorithm way better at finding fresh music. I generally just leave it on shuffle while I’m working. Isn’t This Copyright Infringement?AI anything becomes considerably more complex regarding intellectual property, especially when it comes to music. (This article from The Verge provides deeper context into the seemingly endless gray areas of musical copyright, and how we should proceed into an era where AI-assisted music generation is likely here to stay.)Generative AI models—including music generators—must be trained with existing material. This is often conflated with stealing content, but there’s really no other way for these programs to generate music. It’s not dissimilar to how humans wouldn’t be able to make music without hearing it first. You’re not necessarily stealing it, but are instead riffing from other works.It’s comparable to how samples—notes and melodies taken from other songs to spruce up someone else’s work—play out in the music industry. Copyright laws regarding samples sound incredibly simple, given that artists need explicit permission to use someone else’s work. However, this is actually where things get incredibly complicated. Can you copyright a chord progression? How similar does one song have to be to raise a red flag? Who decides how similar two works actually are? Earlier this year, for instance, Ed Sheeran was cleared of any wrongdoing after claims that his original song, “Thinking Out Loud,” strayed too close to Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On.” In the case of AI music, the situation is ongoing. That being said, the use of copyrighted music to train these models is currently the biggest rock in most musicians’ shoes.  Other ApplicationsWhile AI music is mostly a gimmick at the moment, we reckon that it could soon revolutionize the production process for small filmmakers—among many others use cases. These collectives often have very little budget to spare for creating a score to complement their films.In my couple of weeks with these programs, it’s clear that AI music-making has a very long way to go before Hollywood’s score composers have to start worrying about their job security. AI tools can give you a fairly good product, but most of the programs I used gave me limited control of the finished product; you’re unable to change individual notes and chord progressions, and are instead able to tweak the mood, dynamics, and lyrics.Going ForwardMuch like the other AI tools that we’ve written about, music generators aren’t anything to panic about. They’re great for messing around, and can give you good results, but they still can’t compete with the creativity and intricacies of a human being composing a song or playing an instrument. I do wonder if artists and composers could start using these tools for inspiration in the not-so-distant future.

Sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) are delving into our lives more rapidly than we realise. Governments, financial institutions and big industries are relying on cyber-physical systems for their day-to-day activities. The question, however, is how long before the institutions become too dependent on it?Given the tremendous progress of AI in speech and language processing, computer vision, etc, it is conceivable that in the near future, almost any task that is “measurable’’ will be taken over b y AI. The increasing success of AI in super-skilled application scenarios such as in medical and legal domains clearly reinforce this trend. Even in tasks that are considered to be purely based on human creativity, such as writing poetry, painting, and composing music, success of AI is impressive and worrying to many who practise it. What then will be left for humans in the future? The answer probably lies in the way current AI models are designed. At their heart, they are mathematical tools, albeit too complex for humans to explain. This, therefore, leads to the conclusion that anything that can be “measured’’ in terms of numbers can be solved by AI models. Thus, humans may not be required for these so-called “left-brain’’ functions. This disruption calls for a massive re-skilling of the human population. Humans should focus on developing and utilising right-brain skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and empathy. These skills are difficult for AI to replicate and will become increasingly valuable in the future of work. We should focus on developing skills that complement AI technology, such as data analysis and programming, as well as skills that involve human interaction, such as customer service and healthcare. Ultimately, humans need to be flexible, adaptable, and have a zeal to continuously learn to thrive in a world with AI technology.Instead of worrying about jobs being taken over by AI, we should focus on the tasks that AI will be fulfilling. We’ve already been using AI features like auto-correct and auto-complete. AI will take care of grunt work and save time. We need to learn how to use AI effectively and diversify our work requirements.AI may open up newer avenues or scopes of learning and employment. Rather than fearing the changes brought by AI, students and young engineers should embrace the opportunities it presents.As AI is taking over the academic sphere as well, we might probably have to wait for a decisive overhaul of education. Educational institutions would need to incorporate AI into the curriculum like other mandatory subjects, provide opportunities for students to work on AI-related projects, and develop programmes that teach skills that are difficult for AI to replicate, such as creativity and emotional intelligence. In addition, educational institutions need to focus on developing lifelong learning skills and promote a culture of continuous learning, as the skills required in the workforce will continue to evolve and change as AI technology advances.The youth of today stand at the threshold of several unprecedented challenges both in terms of technology as well as societal and ethical values that are set to disrupt the world order. Summits like the Y20 Summit by the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports can be some pertinent platforms to involve the youth in these crucial discussions and collectively seek ideas and recommendations for the future of work.Arnab Bhattacharya is professor in the department of computer science and engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/100864261'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the fast-paced growth of IT, technology today plays a lot more than just being an enabler in our lives. It is now an integral part of us that transforms our lifestyle and everyday activities, giving it a digital makeover. And, startups have played a key role in propagating tech-led solutions. One such example is bigbasket, which has transformed the way a common man shops for daily groceries and monthly supplies. Rakshit Daga, Chief Technology Officer, bigbasket, in an exclusive interview with Express Computer, opens up on the evolving technologies and their impact on startups today. He also sheds light on how bigbasket is leveraging new-gen technologies to strengthen the business and serve customers better.
As post-Covid, the value of technology was well realised and everyone took the digital route, how has this massive shift affected the startup ecosystem in the country? How has this change impacted bigbasket?
The massive shift towards digitalisation due to the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the startup ecosystem in India. It has accelerated the adoption of technology across various sectors, including e-commerce and grocery delivery. For companies like bigbasket, this shift has presented both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, there has been a surge in demand for online grocery services, leading to increased growth and expansion opportunities. On the other hand, the competition has intensified, with new players entering the market. bigbasket has adapted to this change by focusing on enhancing our technology infrastructure, scaling up our operations, and ensuring seamless customer experiences through our digital platform.
I think the hardest nut to crack is customer trust. And this is the case for almost every tech-driven startup today. How is bigbasket leveraging technology to build trust and ensure quality and timely delivery?
Building and maintaining customer trust and consistently delivering customer delight is of utmost importance for us as a company. We leverage technology to provide a secure, reliable, and convenient shopping experience for our customers. Our platform incorporates robust quality control measures, such as real-time inventory management, ensuring fresh and high-quality products are available for purchase. We have implemented advanced logistics and delivery systems, enabled by technology, to ensure timely and efficient order fulfillment. On the data security side, we consistently audit and upgrade our technology landscape to make sure we stay on top of all emerging threats.
Though digital is convenient, it is dangerous too. The mobile apps like bigbasket that we use in our everyday life not only hold our address and contact details but also UPI and e-payment data. How important is cybersecurity for bigbasket? What measures are you taking to ensure the prevention of data breaches or other cyber attacks?
Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of our operations at bigbasket. We recognise the importance of protecting customer data and maintaining their trust. We have implemented robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks. This includes stringent access controls, regular security assessments, and vulnerability management practices. We comply with industry standards and regulations regarding data protection. Our dedicated security team constantly monitors and responds to emerging threats, ensuring the highest level of security for our customers’ personal and financial information.
How has AI posed a game-changer for B2C startups like bigbasket? Do you really think a chatbot used for grievance redressal is an effective way to deal with customers’ complaints and resolve issues?
AI has indeed been a game-changer for a company like bigbasket. It has enabled us to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and improve overall efficiency. At bigbasket, we leverage AI in various ways, including personalised product recommendations, demand forecasting, and customer support. Our chatbot is an integral part of our customer support system, allowing us to address customer queries and resolve issues promptly.

AI Analyzes the Social Work Licensing Exam, and Concerns Deepen


Using ChatGPT-generated test answers, researchers found the artificial intelligence responses offered “a compelling and sometimes better rationale” than what the official answer key shows.

How should a social worker coaching a domestic violence survivor offer advice about returning to an abusive partner? What are the first steps to help a foster child throwing temper tantrums whose parent is incarcerated? How can they tell if a client is maintaining sobriety?
On these and other questions, Michigan researchers have concluded that a computer-generated model scanning massive online datasets of texts, books, articles and webpages drew more accurate conclusions than the “correct” answers determined by the Association of Social Work Boards, which created and administers licensing exams for the nation’s social workers. 




The findings, published in March by the journal Research on Social Work Practice, concluded that answers that would have been marked incorrect on the exams instead represented a safer and more ethical response — raising fundamental questions about the validity of the test that serves as the gateway to the country’s frontline social service jobs.
“When you asked for the rationale for how the questions were answered when they were ‘incorrect,’ it was perfectly logical,” said one of the study’s authors, Wayne State University School of Social Work Dean Sheryl Kubiak. “Any instructor would have marked it as ‘correct,’ because it was bringing in the context.” 

Sheryl Kubiak
According to the answers to the tests that AI came up with, some “correct” answers relied on dated concepts, or had little evidence to back them up. In other instances, the multiple-choice format failed to offer nuanced and informed approaches to delicate, high-stakes decisions, such as how to approach a deaf client when an interpreter cancels an appointment, or the best way to help children through the death of a parent.
The researchers were so concerned by the findings that their abstract calls on state regulators and legislators to temporarily suspend the exam created and administered by the Association of Social Work Boards, while a more “appropriate, effective, and ethical” test is developed.
They also offer cautious optimism for “generative AI” and “large language models” to inform the field of social work — joining a fast-growing chorus of critics and cheerleaders of computer programs that can simulate human thought processes and creation, methods now reaching into virtually all aspects of society.
In response to The Imprint’s request for comment, leaders of the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) said the licensing exams for clinical, bachelor’s and master’s level social work are rigorously vetted. They dismissed the study’s assertion that some of the questions are biased, outdated or based on poorly supported practice.
“Every correct answer is supported by a valid and current social work reference,” Senior Director of Examination Services Lavina Harless said in an email. 

The researchers were so concerned by the findings that their abstract calls on state regulators and legislators to temporarily suspend the exam.

Harless said that the exam questions are “thoroughly and continually reviewed by testing experts” and that any questions that show potential bias or don’t appropriately evaluate social work competency are not included on the final tests.
CEO Stacey Hardy-Chandler also responded by email, stating her organization updates the licensure exams every five to seven years, and that the process involves surveying thousands of social workers to ensure the questions reflect current practice. The association’s next analysis of the exam will begin in 2024. 
“ASWB is taking a rigorous and thoughtful approach to enhancing the licensing exams,” she said, but cautioned about any hasty changes.
“We are committed to being vigilant in our review of all available tools, including emerging technologies such as AI,” she added. “However, it is premature to jump to conclusions about the development of future exams based on the findings of a single study.”

Multiple-choice format eliminates nuance of social work
The study was prompted by alarming racial disparities in the social worker licensing test passing rates revealed last year. The researchers set out to determine if artificial intelligence could suss out potential bias in the questions and “move us toward a more valid and equitable exam.”
Lead author and Wayne State University School of Social Work professor Bryan Victor and his team did not analyze the exam, which is not publicly available. Instead, they relied on an official set of practice questions.
Hardy-Chandler characterized the practice questions as “retired,” and not reflected in the actual exam. But in defending the analysis, Victor noted that the practice questions were pulled from the social work board’s online portal, and they are used by educators preparing students for the licensing exams.
“Our review of available documentation related to these exam questions revealed no indication that these questions are outdated or not aligned with current research, which could potentially mislead educators or students,” Victor wrote in an email.

Bryan Victor
His study relied on ChatGPT for its findings, which the authors describe as “currently taking the world by storm.” The artificial intelligence program was instructed to complete the practice questions for the licensing exam and explain why it selected its answers. This “think aloud” function helped researchers pinpoint potential problems with the questions, and the limited way test-takers could provide appropriate answers, particularly when they could only select one option in a multiple-choice format.
In some cases, the differences between the “correct” answer the ASWB identified and the “incorrect” one ChatGPT produced was a matter of nuance and depth. In one example described by researchers, both answers focused on properly engaging a client at a domestic violence shelter in a discussion about the choice to return to an abusive partner.
“The correct response according to ASWB was to encourage the client to further discuss their decision,” the study states, an answer “consistent with the ethical principle of self-determination.” 
ChatGPT selected a different response that it determined was more accurate. It specified that in discussions over the decision, the client, not the social worker, must guide the conversation. That distinction was key to a more accurate answer, the researchers stated, because the social worker must demonstrate acceptance of the client’s choice, even if it ends up being a return to the abusive partner. 
Doing otherwise, could “create further barriers to the client’s engagement,” the ChatGPT response concluded. “Allowing the client to direct the conversation and to express their thoughts and feelings can help to build trust and rapport between the client and the social worker,” which can increase “the likelihood that the client will be open to receiving support and services, regardless of their decision.”
The computer-generated response stated that the social worker should outline concerns about the risk of returning to the abusive partner, but noted the importance of doing so “in a non-judgmental and supportive manner.”

The multiple-choice format failed to offer nuanced and informed approaches to delicate, high-stakes decisions, such as how to approach a deaf client when an interpreter cancels an appointment.

One of the study’s authors Brian Perron — a professor of social work at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor — described the significance of this analysis in a follow-up article published last month by Towards Data Science: “By neglecting the complexity and context of actual practice, the exam is not adequately assessing the competence of social workers.” Perron concluded that “we have serious reservations about considering the ASWB exam key as the gold standard. The exam has flaws and biases, including using empirically unsupported test items.”
Previous exam controversy
Problems with the social worker licensing exam date back to at least 2010, when a study concluded it evaluated test-taking abilities more than competency to practice. And last year, a study published by the Association of Social Work Boards about its own licensing exam revealed gaping disparities in the pass rates based on race, age and native language. The study revealed that just 45% of Black test-takers passed the exam on the first try, compared with 84% of white test-takers. The disparity remained consistent on follow-up attempts, with 91% of white people eventually passing the test, compared to 57% of Black people. 
The ability to score well on standardized tests has long been found to reflect societal bias, pushing out people of color from success on qualifying exams for everything from college admission to the legal and pharmaceutical fields. According to a 2021 article published by the National Education Association, standardized tests “have been instruments of racism and a biased system.” 
Not every state requires social workers to pass an exam and receive a license to practice, but many do. And even when a license is not required, it can give social workers a strong advantage for upward mobility in their careers. 
The pass-rate disparity data rocked the social work field, confirming longstanding concerns about the consequential licensing exams. 
“It was both horrible, but also validating,” said Anthony Estreet, CEO of the National Association of Social Workers. “Validating the concerns that people have had for years in terms of the bias that is in the exam, but also validating to those that have failed the exam that it’s not them.”
Adding to the critiques, earlier this year the National Association of Social Workers — representing more than 100,000 members — announced formal opposition to the licensing exams. The influential body called for alternatives that promote “the diversity and well-being of the social work profession, and the health and well-being of the populations social workers serve.”
“An entirely new era”
Artificial intelligence is the latest tool to be used in a critique of the social work licensing exam. 
With its ability to mimic human output based on analysis of vast amounts of online data, AI has its own set of controversies — from privacy violations to job-loss driven by automation, the spread of misinformation and algorithmic bias. With sufficient regulation and used in proper ways, the method is also considered to be a powerful and effective tool, supporters argue.
The Michigan researchers decided to analyze the social work licensing exam with AI after learning of similar analyses conducted on the bar exam and medical licensing tests for doctors. On both, computer systems received high marks.
“We recognize this is an entirely new era of rapidly growing technologies, which necessarily requires the field to be cautious moving forward,” the Michigan researchers state. “Importantly, we want to be clear that we see generative AI models as tools that can help social workers, but we do not think these tools can replace social workers.”

“We want to be clear that we see generative AI models as tools that can help social workers, but we do not think these tools can replace social workers.”
From the report, “Time to Move Beyond the ASWB Licensing Exams”
They go on to state some possible ways the emerging technology can inform the field.
For example, the authors describe a section of the social worker practice exam that presents a scenario and asks test-takers to select from four possible responses as to what the social worker should do “next” or “first.” 
In it, a foster child has an incarcerated father and a mother in a residential treatment program for alcoholism. The child is described as small for his age, behind on his speech, behind on schoolwork and throwing temper tantrums.
ChatGPT did not select any of the four responses provided on the practice test, which included “screen for fetal alcohol syndrome, develop a behavior modification plan, refer to special education, or pursue family reunification.”
Instead, it offered an answer that was not provided: The social worker should “gather more information and assess the child’s needs.” A comprehensive assessment would best determine the child’s developmental, behavioral and educational needs, as well as any past trauma or neglect, the computer-assisted program determined. Only then could the social worker decide on the appropriate interventions, such as a medical referral, special education services, working with foster parents on a behavior plan, or focusing on reunification with the biological mother, if appropriate. 
“We think the response of ChatGPT is the better answer — as do our colleagues with clinical expertise who we consulted — because the scenario does not contain enough contextual information to make an informed decision,” the Michigan study authors concluded. 
Another example when ChatGPT provided a different answer than ASWB developers involved a question about the “most likely emotional response” when adult children learn of a parent’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The computer-generated response determined “a range of emotional reactions” are likely. “Denial” was the correct test answer — based on the “five stages of grief” introduced by psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in 1969. “ASWB’s correct answer does not have sufficient empirical support to inform practice,” the Michigan study authors concluded, noting that health researchers have cautioned against the continued use of the Kübler-Ross model, which is widely considered to be outdated.

Brian Perron
Professor Perron said inadequate context is a fundamental weakness of an exam based on just one correct answer that assesses the ability to perform a skill as subjective as social work. For that reason, he said, older test-takers whose answers may incorporate years of real-world professional and life experience are more likely to struggle with the ASWB exam format, compared with a recent graduate who is answering solely based on their classroom training. 
Kubiak, who co-chairs the National Association of Deans and Directors of Schools of Social Work’s task force on the licensure exam, said people of color also bring a different perspective and set of experiences to social work scenarios that may not be captured or fairly assessed in the current licensing exam.
As a potential remedy, the research trio tested ChatGPT’s ability to “grade” short-answer questions. They fed the program a sample question, along with three potential responses, instructing it to determine which of the answers reflected safe and ethical social work practice. They reported that AI was able to do so, correctly identifying a plan to refer a queer client to conversion therapy as “harmful.” 
The researchers conclude the takeaway from this exercise was that shifting to a short-answer exam could better include the important context missing from the current multiple-choice format. 
Yet as with other data applications in social work, such as predictive analytics, artificial intelligence must be fully analyzed before it is put to use more broadly in the human services field, the researchers concluded, “because generative AI models are just in their infancy and still prone to frequent errors.”

Of primary concern are the massive amounts of internet data AI relies on to form its “intelligence.” Any bias that exists in that data is baked into its output. Mindful of this, the Michigan researchers state, if AI is to be used in future redesigns of the social work licensing exam, it would require experts collaborating with computer scientists to build in guardrails. 
“We’re a long way off from using AI in any kind of testing context,” Victor said in an interview. “We just wanted to put it on the table as one potential path forward that we think is worth exploring.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has banned staff from using artificial intelligence technology such as ChatGPT - citing data and privacy risks.
Similar action has been taken overseas by a number of large banks and technology companies, including Apple and Samsung.
New Zealand remains without government-wide rules or guidelines for ministries and agencies' use of artificial intelligence.
Privacy concerns prompt proceed with caution warning
Documents show that in March, MBIE blocked staff access to a number of AI tools including ChatGPT.
The ministry was worried staff could put sensitive information into the technology which could later resurface.
MBIE has hit the pause button while it works out if the technology can be used safely.
University of Auckland senior law lecturer and AI law expert Nikki Chamberlain said caution was prudent.
""It's a new technology and we don't know the consequences of it yet.
""And only time is going to be able to tell whether the information that you're putting in there is going to be protected and private.""
In New Zealand there is no AI-specific regulation or legislation, and internal MBIE documents say there are ""no rules or guidelines for all government agencies about staff use [of] AI tools"".
A spokesperson for the Government Chief Digital Officer in the Department of Internal Affairs said the government was working on guidance for agencies which it expected to have soon.
It said its own DIA staff have not been banned from using AI tools.
Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster said it was up to individual government agencies and companies to decide if, and how, they use AI.
""And if the risks are too high then my expectation would be that they won't proceed with that proposal.""
Frith Tweedie from consultancy firm Simply Privacy said staff needed guidance and safeguards.
""I don't think it is unreasonable to pause while you are working that out, I think all of the government agencies should be forming a position on what's appropriate and inappropriate use.
""And for some of them a full ban might be appropriate to for those that are dealing with particular sensitive information.""
Many companies overseas ban staff from using AI
ChatGPT is trained by being fed the internet and, by predicting the next word in a sequence, it spits out full sentence answers to questions.
It contains masses of unvetted information and it is essentially a locked box - once information has been put in, it is all but impossible to get out again.
Canada's privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into OpenAI about its Chat GPT technology, and Italy briefly banned the use of the product over privacy concerns.
Many international companies have banned or restricted staff from using the technology including Apple, Samsung, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.
AI legislation needed
Last month OpenAI tightened up some of ChatGPT's privacy settings, but the adjustments are tacked on, and privacy questions remain.
""I'm certainly recommending that organisations and individuals ... take care, definitely turn off the chat history, but even so I would avoid entering any confidential information or any personal information,"" Tweedie said.
Europe has much more stringent privacy laws and far higher sanctions than in Aotearoa.
Chamberlain said New Zealand needed legislation covering AI.
""Until we have laws around regulating the use of AI, and information that is held by AI, and then how that information can be used going forward, we just need to be really careful.""
In the meantime, late last month the Privacy Commissioner issued advice for agencies and businesses to use the technology.
That includes staff considering whether it is necessary and proportionate to use AI at all.
He said firms and government agencies should do a privacy risk impact assessment to work out the danger areas to avoid.
He wants the public and private sector to work together to come with advice for how best to use the technology safely.

However, opinions vary by seniority and by country, according to the survey by Boston Consulting Group.

The survey is based on inputs from 12,800 employees from the executive suites to the frontline employees across industries in 18 countries.

As per the survey, Brazil (71 per cent) is the most optimistic country about the impact of GenAI on workplace followed by India (60 per cent) and the Middle East (58 per cent).

The least optimistic are the US (46 per cent), the Netherlands (44 per cent) and Japan (40 per cent).

Geographies most concerned about AI are the Netherlands (42 per cent), France (41 per cent), and Japan (38 per cent), while the least concerned are the Middle East (25 per cent), Brazil (19 per cent), and India (14 per cent),

As much as 61 per cent of the 1,000 respondents in India are optimistic about the tool while 72.8 per cent of them believe the rewards of GenAI outweigh risks.

Also, close to 88 per cent of respondents believe their job is likely to be transformed by AI and 80 per cent feel AI-specific regulations are necessary.

GenAI is a rapidly evolving space, and its transformative impact is already being felt in workplaces around the world, says Nicolas De Bellefonds, the global leader of AI and software at BCG X, BCG's tech build and design unit.

As per the survey, 52 per cent of respondents are optimistic about AI's impact on work, which was 35 per cent in 2018.

According to Nipun Kalra, managing director &amp; partner, and head of BCG X in India, among the 18 countries surveyed, Indian executives are the most optimistic about the transformative impact of AI.

The survey also showed that senior leaders are more frequent users of generative AI, and thus are more optimistic and less concerned about it than frontline employees. While 62 per cent of leaders are optimistic about AI, only 42 per cent of frontline employees share that view.

Also, 62 per cent of regular users of GenAI are optimistic about it, compared to 36 per cent of non-users. A majority of leaders (80 per cent) report that they use GenAI tools regularly, compared with just 20 per cent of frontline employees.

Further, frontline employees made up the largest percentage of non-users (60 per cent).

Globally, more than a third of the respondents (36 per cent) think that their job is likely to be eliminated by AI and 86 per cent believe they will need skilling.

The hype will subside as the reality of implementation sets in, but the impact of generative AI will grow as people and enterprises discover more innovative applications for the technology in daily work and life.</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the benefits and applications of generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Foundation models, including generative pretrained transformers (which drives ChatGPT), are among the AI architecture innovations that can be used to automate, augment humans or machines, and autonomously execute business and IT processes.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>The benefits of generative AI include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity, but the specifics depend on the use case. End users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve, especially when using a service as is, which has major limitations. Generative AI creates artifacts that can be inaccurate or biased, making human validation essential and potentially limiting the time it saves workers. Gartner recommends connecting use cases to KPIs to ensure that any project either improves operational efficiency or creates net new revenue or better experiences.</p>\r\n<p>In a recent Gartner webinar poll of more than 2,500 executives, 38% indicated that customer experience and retention is the primary purpose of their generative AI investments. This was followed by revenue growth (26%), cost optimization (17%) and business continuity (7%).</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the risks of generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>The risks associated with generative AI are significant and rapidly evolving. A wide array of threat actors have already used the technology to create “deep fakes” or copies of products, and generate artifacts to support increasingly complex scams.</p>\r\n<p>ChatGPT and other tools like it are trained on large amounts of publicly available data. They are not designed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other copyright laws, so it’s imperative to pay close attention to your enterprises’ uses of the platforms.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>Oversight risks to monitor include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Lack of transparency.</strong> Generative AI and ChatGPT models are unpredictable, and not even the companies behind them always understand everything about how they work.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Generative AI systems sometimes produce inaccurate and fabricated answers. Assess all outputs for accuracy, appropriateness and actual usefulness before relying on or publicly distributing information.\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Bias.</strong> You need policies or controls in place to detect biased outputs and deal with them in a manner consistent with company policy and any relevant legal requirements.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Intellectual property (IP) and copyright.</strong> There are currently no verifiable data governance and protection assurances regarding confidential enterprise information. Users should assume that any data or queries they enter into the ChatGPT and its competitors will become public information, and we advise enterprises to put in place controls to avoid inadvertently exposing IP.\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Cybersecurity and fraud.</strong> Enterprises must prepare for malicious actors’ use of generative AI systems for cyber and fraud attacks, such as those that use deep fakes for social engineering of personnel, and ensure mitigating controls are put in place. Confer with your cyber-insurance provider to verify the degree to which your existing policy covers AI-related breaches.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Sustainability.</strong> Generative AI uses significant amounts of electricity. Choose vendors that reduce power consumption and leverage high-quality renewable energy to mitigate the impact on your sustainability goals.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Gartner also recommends considering the following questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Who defines responsible use of generative AI, especially as cultural norms evolve and social engineering approaches vary across geographies? Who ensures compliance? What are the consequences for irresponsible use?\u200b</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>In the event something goes wrong, how can individuals take action?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>How do users give and remove consent (opt in or opt out)? What can be learned from the privacy debate?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Will using generative AI help or hurt trust in your organization — and institutions overall?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>How can we ensure that content creators and owners keep control of their IP and are compensated fairly? What should new economic models look like?\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Who will ensure proper functioning throughout the entire life cycle, and how will they do so? Do boards need an AI ethics lead, for example?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, it’s important to continually monitor regulatory developments and litigation regarding generative AI. China and Singapore have already put in place new regulations regarding the use of generative AI, while Italy temporarily. The U.S., Canada, India, the U.K. and the EU are currently shaping their regulatory environments.</p>\r\n<p>Also see, “<a href=""#q7"">What are the best practices for using generative AI?</a>” and “<a href=""#q9"">Should I craft a usage policy for generative AI?</a>”</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are some practical uses of generative AI today?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>The field of generative AI will progress rapidly in both scientific discovery and technology commercialization, but use cases are emerging quickly in creative content, content improvement, synthetic data, generative engineering and generative design.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>In-use, high-level practical applications today include the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Written content augmentation and creation:</strong> Producing a “draft” output of text in a desired style and length</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Question answering and discovery:</strong> Enabling users to locate answers to input, based on data and prompt information</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Tone:</strong> Text manipulation, to soften language or professionalize text</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Summarization:</strong> Offering shortened versions of conversations, articles, emails and webpages</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Simplification:</strong> Breaking down titles, creating outlines and extracting key content</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Classification of content for specific use cases:</strong> Sorting by sentiment, topic, etc.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Chatbot performance improvement:</strong> Bettering “sentity” extraction, whole-conversation sentiment classification and generation of journey flows from general descriptions</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Software coding:</strong> Code generation, translation, explanation and verification</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Emerging use cases with long-term impacts include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Creating medical images that show the future development of a disease\u200b</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Synthetic data helping augment scarce data, mitigate bias, preserve data privacy and simulate future scenarios</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Applications proactively suggesting additional actions to users and providing them with information</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Legacy code modernization</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How will generative AI contribute business value?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Generative AI provides new and disruptive opportunities to increase revenue, reduce costs, improve productivity and better manage risk.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.""I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,"" he said.The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.More technology of business:Can Amsterdam make the circular economy work?The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumpsThe chip maker that became an AI superpowerWhy car parks are the hottest space in solar powerProtein's power is being uncovered and unleashedEarlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.There is some evidence of that already. Getty ImagesIKEA has retrained thousands of call centre workers as design advisersThis month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. ""When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.""But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.Alejandro GraueAlejandro Graue lost voiceover work to an AI systemFor three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.""I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,"" he says.But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.""When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?"" he says.A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.""If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,"" he says.If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.""I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,"" he says.You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday. In other countries it will be on at 10:30 & 23:30 GMT on Saturday, 05:30 and 16:30 GMT on Sunday and 07:30 GMT on Monday.If you work with Artificial Intelligence, how is it changing how you do your job?

The consultancy analyzed 63 use cases for the technology and ultimately estimated the tech could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy.These types of figures should of course be taken with a grain of salt; research reports predicted a multitrillion-dollar metaverse market before tech and media giants began divesting from the space more recently.Nevertheless, here are some of the ways that McKinsey’s report predicts generative AI might transform the economy and workplace.Workplace automation: The report estimates that generative AI, in addition to existing types of machine learning and other technologies, could automate tasks that take up between 60% to 70% of a typical worker’s day. Currently, around 25% of “total work time” consists of natural language-related tasks that might be handled by generative AI, according to the report.Because of its increasing ability to handle language-related tasks, the report’s authors suggest that the tech will have a greater impact on “more-educated workers,” compared with previous waves of automation, which tended to hit occupations in the middle-wage distribution hardest.Customer service is key: The report found that about three-quarters of generative AI’s value will be concentrated in four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. That means uses like helping customer service reps address problems, generating creative material for advertisements, and turning natural language commands into computer code.The report’s authors wrote that the ability to instantaneously produce personalized answers to complex customer questions with a consistent brand voice and pull up relevant data about an individual are some of the ways AI could “transform” customer service.Key use cases for banking: As an industry already transformed by predictive and analytical AI, banking stands to see changes from this next generation of automation across customer service, marketing, and risk model documentation, according to the report. Other industries ripe for transformation include retail and consumer packaged goods, where generative AI might “draft playbooks for negotiating with suppliers”; and pharmaceuticals and medical products, where the tech could help with new drug formulations and drafting legal documents, the report said.CopyYou might also like...AILexisNexis taps news outlet deals for AI business research toolPatrick Kulp / 07.18.2024Future of TravelWhy US auto regulators are turning to tech to help reduce traffic fatalitiesJordyn Grzelewski / 07.17.2024Future of TravelMercedes-Benz and Starbucks team up to expand EV fast chargingJordyn Grzelewski / 07.17.2024Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s an understandable nervousness among any workforce when you start talking about automation. It’s actually been 10 years since Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne released their seminal paper entitled The Future of Employment which contained a list of occupations with an automation probability score. It was the paper that launched a spate of headlines claiming robots were coming for our jobs.
For field services teams, this has been a slow burn. As the paper suggests, “the manual tasks of service occupations are less susceptible to computerisation, as they require a higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability.” And yet, the workforce is under pressure, not so much from automation but from the fact that it is ageing. To compound the problem, not enough millennials and Gen Zers are seeing the profession as an attractive career option.
According to recent research into the future of field service, almost three-quarters of companies (73%) identify an ageing workforce as a potential threat to their field service operations. Meanwhile, over two-thirds (67%) of companies feel that technology plays a key role in attracting new talent to a field service organization. The challenge is which technologies and to what extent an organization commits.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that AI and automation are going to play a significant role in field service operations. Generative AI is going to be at the heart of this. US-based organization OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, believes it has the ability “to limit the impact of a shrinking and ageing field service workforce in several ways.”
Next-generation workforce
Field service has a major workforce recruitment and retention problem. The majority of the workforce is nearing retirement which means that we are losing their expertise, their knowledge and their ability to complete work. It also leaves a void that is not being filled by new entrants who are not as interested in the type of work being done in field service. This is where the capabilities of ChatGPT can be transformational. But the outgoing workforce isn’t really where the potential lies. The real value lies in the next-generation workforce.
ChatGPT can help organizations capture and organize the unstructured knowledge and experience of the experienced workforce and make it accessible in a format that is desirable for the next generation of workers. As opposed to viewing paper manuals, calling a friend, and completing countless forms to close out a service job, consider an experience where an engineer has access to relevant and contextual information via a query, with work instructions overlayed visually via Augmented Reality, and work summarized and documented via generative AI.
While it might seem futuristic, it’s the type of vision for field service that organizations must have to create a marketable product for the next generation workforce. These potential entrants are digitally native, they’ve grown up on the tools of today and are constantly tinkering with the likes of ChatGPT.
Organizations must be able to provide these technologically-savant workers with the tools, information, and working models that they are already familiar with to make the profession of field service more relevant. If organizations can provide them with a way to engage with the experience and knowledge of former generations to become more proficient in the craft, open up new opportunities for learning and growth, and create working opportunities that could be remote-first or data-focused, then it changes the profile of what a career in field service looks like.
Role of technology
The point is that automation can enable field engineers to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively. Of course, organizations must be diligent about where and how generative AI is used, as it can give confidently wrong answers. Although humans are no different in that regard, it is important to install guardrails against generative AI introducing inaccuracies into the content it generates. By automating mundane tasks and improving asset intelligence, field service teams can optimize work schedules, parts ordering and parts delivery times. This reduces unnecessary truck rolls and improves customer satisfaction through more accurate and efficient maintenance work. Collaboration between support teams and engineers on a common platform and using real-time asset data also helps to identify opportunities for new contracts or device upgrades.
There are, of course, some things technology cannot replace, such as engineer experience, but this is about how to use technology to manage skills gaps, attract new engineers and even unretire some of the older ones. The technology is there to make the job easier and more effective. Regardless of age, that has to be a good thing.

AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and data science models may hold potential for enabling an understanding of global health inequities and support decision-making related toward possible interventions. However, AI inputs should not perpetuate the biases and structural issues within our global societies that have created various health inequities. We need AI to be able to ‘see’ the full context of what it is meant to learn. AI trained with biased data produces biased outputs and providing health workforce training with such outputs further contributes to the buildup of biases and structural inequities. The accelerating and intricately evolving technology and digitalization will influence the education and practice of health care workers. Before we invest in utilizing AI in health workforce training globally, it is important to make sure that multiple stakeholders from the global arena are included in the conversation to address the need for training in ‘AI and the role of AI in training’. This is a daunting task for any one entity and a multi-sectorial interactions and solutions are needed. We believe that partnerships among various national, regional, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training ranging to name a few, from public health & clinical science training institutions, computer science, learning design, data science, technology companies, social scientists, law, and AI ethicists, need to be developed in ways that enable the formation of an equitable and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP) to address the use of AI for global health workforce training. This paper has laid out a framework for such CoP.


Peer Review reports

IntroductionIn 1950, the English mathematician Alan Turing wrote a landmark paper titled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posing the question: “Can machines think?” This led to further exploration of the use of machines to support human decision-making with a 1956 workshop, organized by John McCarthy, an American mathematician, that focused on the “study of artificial intelligence.” [1] The field was born. Yet, more than a half-century later, we are still struggling with a definition; artificial intelligence (AI) is most often being defined more in “what its capabilities are rather than strictly defining what it is.” [2] In this commentary, we will use McCarthy’s definition that describes AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving” [3] as this definition provides a blend of both its capabilities and what it is. Within healthcare, AI applications such as image processing for improved cancer detection, that have been created are being refined using computer science techniques such as machine learning. Machine learning (ML) uses mathematical data models or algorithms to “mimic” human reasoning and therefore relies on multiple algorithmic approaches such as neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing, and others. [4]This commentary is a call to action for engaging in a global community of discourse and innovation to address health workforce training so that AI technology is not the driver but rather the support for human decision-making. We need AI to be able to ‘see’ the full context of what it is meant to learn. AI trained with biased data produces biased outputs and providing health workforce training with such outputs further contributes to the buildup of biases and structural inequities. AI-based tools have “the potential to worsen health inequities if implemented without deliberate action to ensure fairness and there is a need for all clinicians to understand the social, ethical, legal, and regulatory issues that will determine whether AI-based tools will narrow or widen health disparities and health care gaps.” [5] The pandemic left the world without much choice in the adoption of new technologies; however, given that now there is a choice, it is imperative that we consider the adoption of technologies in global health workforce training, especially AI, with care and ask, ‘who are we leaving behind?’ and ‘what can we do about it to mitigate the risk of widening health disparities?’ As Alondra Nelson at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, stated, “We need to be honest about the past and how science and technology have harmed some communities, left out communities, and left people out of doing the work of science and technology."" [6] Before we invest in utilizing AI in health workforce training globally it is important to make sure that multiple stakeholders from the global arena are included in the conversation to address “the need for training in AI and the role of AI in training.”[7]Why is a collaboration among various stakeholders needed in the use of Artificial Intelligence for global health workforce training?The accelerating and intricately evolving AI technology and digitalization has and will influence the education and practice of health care workers. Therefore, there is the urgency of need to organize and collaborate among the various local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training.When addressing AI for global health workforce training, we seek to provide a framework that enables the global health workforce to enter into the conversation on the use of AI in supporting human decision-making. The proposed framework addresses “the duality that health professions educators must consider now: the need for training in AI and the role of AI in training.” [7] We believe that partnerships among local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training, ranging to name a few, from public health & clinical science training institutions, computer science, learning design, data science, technology companies, social scientists, law, and AI ethicists, need to be developed in ways that enable the formation of equitable and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP). CoPs are “groups of people who share a concern or an interest for something they do and, as they regularly interact, they learn to do it better.” [8]Given that AI advances influence most disciplines, it is important to ensure that a CoP brings the diversity of voices for peer-to-peer learning to be meaningful. Having an established CoP could address crosscutting challenges. For example, if a medical school wanted to explore how to introduce AI into the medical education curriculum, the research team could include computer scientists, ethicists, medical education specialists, healthcare practitioners, students, and others. Through such collaboration, the team could research ways that AI could be taught in medical school to develop decision-making skills related to AI-supported applications.Another team might be interested to examine human bias in machine learning in relation to the use of AI in healthcare. Instead of only having data science-focused discussions, a transdisciplinary team could be formed from the CoP members that bring data scientists, ethicists, social scientists, clinicians, and other stakeholders together to examine the sources of bias in datasets and AI systems through societal, structural, and technical perspectives so as to identify harm and impact. This would allow for an elevated discussion on how to design, use, and/or question the AI-powered systems with an equity lens ideally before adoption of AI in health workforce education.CoP at the local, national, regional, and global levels across the professions is needed. We believe that the proposed CoP model, when applied with intentionality, can enhance knowledge about AI and allow voices from across the globe to guide the conversation based on their own contextual needs.An equitable and sustainable community of practice framework to address the use of Artificial Intelligence for global health workforce trainingBased on our experience in developing global health workforce-related CoPs [9], we envision that a sustainable and equitable CoP needs to address five structural pillars: governance, project management, partnership, stakeholder engagement, and outreach to enhance cross-fertilization of AI knowledge and adaptations of new AI knowledge among local, national, regional, and global stakeholders. The following seven components need to be in place to ensure that the pillars remain standing: (1) building and interconnecting interdisciplinary, stakeholder-initiated Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs); (2) nurturing in-depth Exchanges of key stakeholders; (3) hosting an Annual Event for cross-fertilization of ideas among stakeholders; (4) promoting scholarship and partnerships with leading journals; (5) developing a website, to serve as a ‘digital town center’ of the CoP; (6) producing and distributing a Newsletter, and (7) hosting monthly transdisciplinary webinars and workshops that address AI-related topics that inform and educate from basic to advanced topics in relation to AI and health workforce training to ultimately support health equity. Figure 1 shows the connections among the broader context, the pillars, and the components.Fig. 1Framework of CoP: context, pillars, and componentsFull size imageThe following descriptions provide a brief explanation as to the need for each pillar. In addition, we propose a set of components that could be conducted to advance the knowledge about AI within the health workforce training space. We are sharing this level of detail as part of our call to action to note that it is critical to formalize such an effort so as to demonstrate the breadth and depth of the reach of the CoP’s activities. Intentionality in designing the interactions across all CoP components among all stakeholders is key to the collaborative nature of the proposed effort.

1.
Governance: includes recruiting, coordinating, and establishing a consortium of institutions and organizations that have a core mission to develop an equitable and sustainable AI CoP to advance knowledge of AI for informing health workforce training and also that aims to include under-represented or underserved groups impacted by health disparities. To enable smooth coordination and communication across the CoP, we propose an agreed upon timeline governance meeting that will aid in establishing an organizational structure for the CoP. At the local, national, regional, and global levels, there is a need for the presence of a coordinating entity that will carry out the duties of the governance pillar. This coordinating center can be situated within the Ministries of Health and Education, or in an international, regional, and local health and education governance entity.


2.
Project management: The aim of this pillar is to address the overall goal of the CoP, to establish an organizational and project management structure, and to create a system that is visible for tracking the CoP activities across all input activities, output areas, and coordinating efforts. This system will help streamline and track the various milestones. Regular reporting of the status of activities across all CoP efforts would need to be shared. It is essential to maintain an agile approach in project planning and implementation to be responsive to external and internal requests, as needed. The project management team would coordinate and manage the integration of the CoP work activities among CoP participants and leverage the strengths and synergies of the CoP.


3.
Partnerships: The aims of this pillar are multiple.

To establish trusted relationships with health disparities groups, educators, computer, and data scientists to examine the data used in AI research and applications as well as how machine learning models are constructed.


To build capacity among partners for seizing opportunities that catalyze rapid advancements in AI capabilities within their own contexts.


To ensure coordination among the different activities, many of which will be interdependent, while at the same time balancing the need for a deliberate and strategic approach to building lasting partnerships and infrastructure.




To address the partnership goals, we have integrated three components: an Annual Symposium, a Site Visit Exchange, and a capacity-building program on Algorithmic Literacy that offers continuing education credits.


Annual symposium
Conducting an annual symposium will be highly valuable for fostering partnership among all CoP stakeholders. This will be a venue where the stakeholders will present findings, share ideas, learn from each other, and expand their knowledge. A steering committee that includes a CoP representative of each stakeholder will set the theme and components of the annual symposium. The role of the steering committee will be to provide balance and transparency to the various participant groups while building a substantive program.


Site visit exchange
CoP members need to conduct site visit exchanges to connect with peers among the institutions involved in the CoP. These sites visit exchanges aim to cross-fertilize ideas, and identify gap areas for research to move the pendulum for equitable and sustainable AI in global health workforce training toward tangible positive outcomes.


Algorithmic literacy program
This could be an online program that offers those taking it the opportunity for continuing education credits. It would be designed with a storytelling approach to help those participating explore AI in relation to healthcare applications. Topics could include, but are not limited to, human bias and AI, human and machine learning. CoP members could form a transdisciplinary team to develop each topic.



4.
Stakeholder engagement: The aim of this pillar area is to establish and sustain meaningful virtual and in-person learning opportunities to engage all CoP stakeholders, ensuring coordination among the different activities, many of which will be interdependent, and building lasting relationships among stakeholders that can serve as a sustainable CoP. We have integrated three components: Town-Center (website), Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs), and Monthly Webinars and Workshops.



Town-center (CoP website)
The CoP website serves as a “digital town square” for the full CoP community and for potential collaborators and stakeholders. Its home page could feature among many things “Noteworthy News” and “Noteworthy Events,” video clips of CoP stories. CoP webinars will also be featured. It could contain a library page (repository) on AI in health workforce education, AI ethics, data science, and other relevant topics based on an initial survey and needs of the CoP stakeholders.





Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs)

By working collaboratively across all CoP stakeholders, the aim is for the CoP, to identify and establish TWLGs that can meet and dig deeper into a pertinent topic area such as AI Ethics, Health Equity, Data Research Techniques, AI applications, and others. The TWLGS will be led by members from the CoP who have an interest in that specific area. Each of the TWLG activities is determined by TWLG members.





Hosting regular webinars and workshops

After identifying the learning gaps of the CoP, there will be a need to conduct regular webinars and workshops with synchronous and asynchronous discussion led by peers.




5.
Outreach: The aim of this pillar is to enhance connections among CoP stakeholders and to welcome new ones by sharing the work that CoP members are doing more broadly. This is a critical pillar as it is a path toward sustainability of efforts and reach. We have integrated two components: a Newsletter and a Special Journal Supplement as well as provisions for presentations at research conferences. In addition to these two components, the annual symposium also plays a key role in bringing in other vital stakeholders.





CoP newsletter

One of the mandates of the CoP is to construct a communication platform to facilitate engagement among the CoP consortium. A steering committee composed of the various CoP members could outline the contents and dissemination of the Newsletter. The newsletter could highlight a topic tackled by the CoP consortium members, serves the TWLGs for the sharing of tools, literature, and best practices, and also highlights articles that show the breadth and depth of the CoP efforts. This is a space where all voices can be included.





CoP-wide publication in a leading journal as a journal supplement

This component expands the work of the CoP members into scholarship. It would disseminate the knowledge created through CoP efforts focusing on the transdisciplinary nature of the work. It is customary for various disciplines to publish papers in journals that cater to the outputs of their respective disciplines. Since this CoP is an amalgamation of various disciplines, creating sustainable and equitable opportunities for sharing will need to traverse many discipline areas. Thus, this gives an opportunity to publish in various discipline journals such as suggested are IEEE, Human Resources for Health, Health Equity journal, etc., but the exact journal will be decided collaboratively with the CoP members.


The following table (Table 1) can be used as a checklist for those interested in supporting such efforts for advancing knowledge of AI for global health workforce training. It includes key outcomes based on the five pillars and is shared here as an example of how operations and outcomes can be used as a way to make the process transparent among key stakeholders.Table 1 Example of operational blueprint of outcomes for structuring CoPsFull size tableThe CoP framework described in this commentary offers us a way to humanize artificial intelligence and machine learning by understanding what is behind the scenes of an application or a set of recommendations. This allows us to put those we serve in front. A transdisciplinary CoP has the potential to offer a stable foundation to address health equity issues within and across boundaries and borders. The links formed across the CoP members will strengthen the recruitment of new members and we believe will serve to promote transdisciplinary research teams. To ensure visibility of the efforts across the various connections, we recommend using Social Network Mapping and Analysis to show and understand the connections that will be forming across the various activities. Figure 2 shows an example of how such a diagram could serve both as a research and a communication tool.Fig. 2Example of Social Network Mapping of how we can represent the CoP members. SOURCE: IT for Health and Education System Equity Initiative (ITfHESE)Full size imageConclusionAs stated in the Introduction, this commentary is a call to action for engaging in a global community of discourse and innovation to address health workforce training so that AI technology is not the driver but rather the support for human decision-making. Currently, across the national, regional, and global arenas, the need for capacity building among health workforce education entities to address the risks and opportunities related to the advancement of AI technologies is palpable. Therefore, there is the urgency of need to organize and collaborate among the various local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training.We have offered a framework for the creation of a transdisciplinary community of practice (CoPs) that focuses on artificial intelligence in health workforce training. The CoP framework offers us the opportunity to tackle this challenge from various disciplinary lenses. It enables us to learn to speak each other’s language. We might find that algorithmic literacy is not simply a continuing education approach but a core competency across all disciplines. The proposed CoP framework we propose has been tested within medical education and it works because of its simplicity and above all because of its inclusivity.Artificial intelligence is propagating and, if embraced, it can be useful within health and public health workforce expertise areas; however, if we, as experts in health and education systems, do not partner with those working on the creation of AI tools, then we run into allowing AI to drive human decision-making rather than guiding it. Understanding what recommendations we get from AI, how these recommendations were formulated, and whether or not to implement them within the context of global health workforce training is no longer a nice to have task, but a must-have.

Accenture will invest $3bn over three years in its data and artificial intelligence (AI) practice, which will include adding 40,000 AI experts to the workforce, making acquisitions and training existing staff.
AI-skilled staff will be added through hiring, training and acquisition, said Accenture.
The IT services giant said it would use the data and AI practice to develop services for 19 specific industry sectors based on AI to take advantage of what it described as the generative AI “megatrend” in its recent technology vision report.
Following the $3bn investment announcement, Paul Daugherty, group chief executive at Accenture Technology, said: “Over the next decade, AI will be a megatrend, transforming industries, companies, and the way we live and work, as generative AI transforms 40% of all working hours.
“Our expanded data and AI practice brings together the full power and breadth of Accenture in creating industry-specific solutions that will help our clients harness AI’s full potential to reshape their strategy, technology and ways of working, driving innovation and value responsibly and faster than ever before.”







As part of the investment, Accenture said it would double its AI talent pool to 80,000.
Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said: “Companies that build a strong foundation of AI by adopting and scaling it now, where the technology is mature and delivers clear value, will be better positioned to reinvent, compete and achieve new levels of performance. Our clients have complex environments, and at a time when the technology is changing rapidly, our deep understanding of ecosystem solutions allows us to help them navigate quickly and cost-effectively to make smart decisions.”
Accenture has already established a company-wide team, the generative AI and large language lodel (LLM) center of excellence. It has also published its A new era of generative AI for everyone study of generative AI/LLM, advising businesses on the use of the technology.
In March, when announcing its annual tech vision, Accenture said the distance between digital and physical worlds would “collapse” over the next 10 years, with the adoption of generative AI accelerating change.
A study of nearly 5,000 senior executives across the globe, which was part of Accenture’s tech vision report, When atoms meet bits: The foundations of our new reality, revealed 96% believe the convergence of the digital and physical worlds will transform business in the next 10 years.

Now, with the acceleration wrought by generative AI as well as other emerging technologies tech leaders must build long-term strategies to address the growing demands on the technology organization. While many tech leaders had hoped that last year’s wave of tech layoffs would lead to opportunities in the marketplace, they instead have seen the number of open tech roles continue to rise, and the tech unemployment hovers around 2%. And, many of those laid-off tech workers went straight back to tech industry jobs, preferring to take their chances with a start-up or smaller tech company, rather than join a non-tech company. Thus, tech execs must take short- and long-term action to address their tech talent gaps.

AI Gives Technology Leaders More Control Over Tech Talent Supply

The demand for tech is big and growing. There isn’t much you can do about that. But you can do something about tech talent supply. Technology leaders will be able to narrow capacity gaps using AI-driven technology, enabling tech execs to scale up innovation as they build capacity. Tech leaders are turning to the following technologies to take control of their technology supply challenges:





TuringBots support developers in designing, developing, testing, and deploying code. This results in faster development times and improved quality.
Low-code platforms turn everyone into a citizen engineer, embedding development capabilities across the business, both enabling the business to take on more accountability in developing solutions and freeing up highly skilled developers to focus on more complex challenges.
Automation makes us work smarter, as organizations use process mining to design human-centric, highly automated workflows to replace traditional processes. Highly skilled technology talent can spend less time on highly predictable work and more time focused on creating high-value customer experiences.
Widespread generative AI tools will change the nature of administrative and creative work. We will spend less time collecting and analyzing information and more time focused on how we can create and deliver enhanced experiences for customers.


Build Emerging Technology Impact In Your Technology Talent Strategy Now
These emerging technologies will change how technology organizations deliver. As TuringBots develop higher and higher quality code, developers will spend more time editing, fine-tuning, and solving more complex challenges. Generative-AI-enabled virtual assistants will mean that project managers will spend more time managing stakeholder relationships and driving alignment to customer needs. These shifts in how work is done impact your organizational talent and skills profile. Leading organizations will look not only be looking for highly sought-after AI specialists who can build and apply advanced AI-driven models that will transform how we do work, but will also be seeking out or upskilling individuals who are able to creatively apply emerging technology solutions such as GenAI to deliver work, and who are confident in both applying technology and effectively managing its risks. Skills such as organizational change management, problem-solving, and creative thinking, all become even more valuable, as we increasingly use technology to create outputs. Having access to these skills, and being able to scale them across the organization to take advantage of these technology advantages, will be a key differentiator for technology organizations, so technology leaders must plan ahead to develop their approach to upskilling and skill acquisition.

In 2022, an AI-generated work of art won the Colorado State Fair’s art competition. The artist, Jason Allen, had used Midjourney – a generative AI system trained on art scraped from the internet – to create the piece. The process was far from fully automated: Allen went through some 900 iterations over 80 hours to create and refine his submission. 
Yet his use of AI to win the art competition triggered a heated backlash online, with one Twitter user claiming, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.”

As generative AI art tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have been thrust into the limelight, so too have questions about ownership and authorship. 
These tools’ generative ability is the result of training them with scores of prior artworks, from which the AI learns how to create artistic outputs.
Should the artists whose art was scraped to train the models be compensated? Who owns the images that AI systems produce? Is the process of fine-tuning prompts for generative AI a form of authentic creative expression? 
On one hand, technophiles rave over work like Allen’s. But on the other, many working artists consider the use of their art to train AI to be exploitative.
We’re part of a team of 14 experts across disciplines that just published a paper on generative AI in Science magazine. In it, we explore how advances in AI will affect creative work, aesthetics and the media. One of the key questions that emerged has to do with U.S. copyright laws, and whether they can adequately deal with the unique challenges of generative AI.
Copyright laws were created to promote the arts and creative thinking. But the rise of generative AI has complicated existing notions of authorship.
Photography serves as a helpful lens
Generative AI might seem unprecedented, but history can act as a guide. 
Take the emergence of photography in the 1800s. Before its invention, artists could only try to portray the world through drawing, painting or sculpture. Suddenly, reality could be captured in a flash using a camera and chemicals. 
As with generative AI, many argued that photography lacked artistic merit. In 1884, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the issue and found that cameras served as tools that an artist could use to give an idea visible form; the “masterminds” behind the cameras, the court ruled, should own the photographs they create. 
From then on, photography evolved into its own art form and even sparked new abstract artistic movements. 
AI can’t own outputs
Unlike inanimate cameras, AI possesses capabilities – like the ability to convert basic instructions into impressive artistic works – that make it prone to anthropomorphization. Even the term “artificial intelligence” encourages people to think that these systems have humanlike intent or even self-awareness.
This led some people to wonder whether AI systems can be “owners.” But the U.S. Copyright Office has stated unequivocally that only humans can hold copyrights.
So who can claim ownership of images produced by AI? Is it the artists whose images were used to train the systems? The users who type in prompts to create images? Or the people who build the AI systems?
Infringement or fair use?
While artists draw obliquely from past works that have educated and inspired them in order to create, generative AI relies on training data to produce outputs. 
This training data consists of prior artworks, many of which are protected by copyright law and which have been collected without artists’ knowledge or consent. Using art in this way might violate copyright law even before the AI generates a new work.

For Jason Allen to create his award-winning art, Midjourney was trained on 100 million prior works.
Was that a form of infringement? Or was it a new form of “fair use,” a legal doctrine that permits the unlicensed use of protected works if they’re sufficiently transformed into something new? 
While AI systems do not contain literal copies of the training data, they do sometimes manage to recreate works from the training data, complicating this legal analysis. 
Will contemporary copyright law favor end users and companies over the artists whose content is in the training data? 
To mitigate this concern, some scholars propose new regulations to protect and compensate artists whose work is used for training. These proposals include a right for artists to opt out of their data’s being used for generative AI or a way to automatically compensate artists when their work is used to train an AI.
Muddled ownership
Training data, however, is only part of the process. Frequently, artists who use generative AI tools go through many rounds of revision to refine their prompts, which suggests a degree of originality.
Answering the question of who should own the outputs requires looking into the contributions of all those involved in the generative AI supply chain.
The legal analysis is easier when an output is different from works in the training data. In this case, whoever prompted the AI to produce the output appears to be the default owner. 
However, copyright law requires meaningful creative input – a standard satisfied by clicking the shutter button on a camera. It remains unclear how courts will decide what this means for the use of generative AI. Is composing and refining a prompt enough? 
Matters are more complicated when outputs resemble works in the training data. If the resemblance is based only on general style or content, it is unlikely to violate copyright, because style is not copyrightable. 
The illustrator Hollie Mengert encountered this issue firsthand when her unique style was mimicked by generative AI engines in a way that did not capture what, in her eyes, made her work unique. Meanwhile, the singer Grimes embraced the tech, “open-sourcing” her voice and encouraging fans to create songs in her style using generative AI.
If an output contains major elements from a work in the training data, it might infringe on that work’s copyright. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Andy Warhol’s drawing of a photograph was not permitted by fair use. That means that using AI to just change the style of a work – say, from a photo to an illustration – is not enough to claim ownership over the modified output. 
While copyright law tends to favor an all-or-nothing approach, scholars at Harvard Law School have proposed new models of joint ownership that allow artists to gain some rights in outputs that resemble their works.
In many ways, generative AI is yet another creative tool that allows a new group of people access to image-making, just like cameras, paintbrushes or Adobe Photoshop. But a key difference is this new set of tools relies explicitly on training data, and therefore creative contributions cannot easily be traced back to a single artist. 
The ways in which existing laws are interpreted or reformed – and whether generative AI is appropriately treated as the tool it is – will have real consequences for the future of creative expression.

We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.”The Labour leader – who will offer his own vision for how to address fast-paced changes at a tech conference on Tuesday – said AI could be “both a tool and a threat”.RecommendedBoris Johnson: Sunak’s ‘talking rubbish’ – I didn’t ask PM to bend honours rulesLabour and Lib Dem cooperation key to defeating Tories at by-elections, top polling guru saysHumza Yousaf rejects calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from SNP following her arrestRishi Sunak’s AI adviser Matt Clifford has warned that AI it could become powerful enough to “kill many humans” in only two years’ time.Despite fears the fast-changing tech could run out of control, Sir Keir insisted that AI can still be “steered in the direction of prosperity, security and safety”.He vowed that Labour would offer “an active, mission-driven government, steering the development of AI to ensure it benefits working people”.The Labour leader noted that Goldman Sachs have forecast that around 24 million UK jobs will be exposed to automation even with existing technology.Rishi Sunak has warned against the risks posed by AI (PA Wire)“The risks are very real that we end up widening the gap between those with the skills to take advantage and those without, who lose their jobs or have their jobs drastically changed,” he said. “One thing is clear, we will need a revolution in learning and training in the UK, and it will need to begin in our schools immediately.”Mr Sunak used a trip to the US last week to announce that the UK will host the first global summit on AI safety in the autumn. But experts have warned that Britain is lagging behind the field.The Tory PM told the London Tech Conference on Monday that the “extraordinary” possibility of AI advances must be carried out “safely” as he again positioned Britain as a potential home of a global regulator.However, Sir Keir accused the government of playing “catch up” on major developments in AI, arguing its white paper on the subject was already out of date.“As well as protecting against the worst, regulation is about attracting the best,” he wrote – saying it was vital for government to “close gaps” in their Tory white paper by introducing proper oversight.RecommendedAI could ‘kill many humans’ within two years, warns Sunak adviser“Having a trusted and well understood playing field where businesses feel they can grow with the right rules in place, helps innovation and attracts entrepreneurs and investment to the UK,” said Sir Keir.The Labour leader added: “A hands-off approach in the formative years of AI would be the surest route to disaster.

Is AI The Cause Of Job Cuts This Year? Keerthi VedantamJune 14, 2023

When ChatGPT was launched on the last day of November, it punctuated what was, at the time, the largest layoff month of 2022. More people were laid off in November than in every other month of the year combined — more than 44,000 people, according to Crunchbase data.
Perhaps November’s numbers were a harbinger of trying times ahead. Since then, companies have continued layoffs at the same brutal pace. While funding dried up elsewhere, leading to layoffs, venture firms were pouring money into the generative AI movement, where language models were poised to be the next big cash cow.
Indeed, according to Crunchbase data, funding to AI startups made up about 10% of global startup funding. Venture’s dramatic shift in funding priorities has rocked every industry from the art world to health care. And whenever a new piece of technology promises to disrupt an industry, the first worry is that it will replace workers.

“[We’re] pitching the opposite,” said Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “AI startups are the only ones really raising big rounds. That’s not to say that AI layoffs aren’t happening, and that some development work isn’t changing. But I haven’t seen the impact.”
AI spurs layoffs in tech
While few — if any — tech startups are actively conducting layoffs to offload work onto AI, the tech industry is quickly embracing artificial intelligence. According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which looks at layoffs across every industry, around 5% of May’s job cuts were directly related to artificial intelligence.
“We do believe AI will cause more job loss, though we are surprised how quickly the technology was cited as a reason,” Andy Challenger told Fortune. “It is incredible the speed the technology is evolving and being adapted.”
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company is planning to pause hiring for roles that AI can reasonably do. Positions in human resources, or jobs that aren’t customer-facing, would be on the chopping block. That means 26,000 jobs at IBM could be in part or in whole replaced by AI. The company and its subsidiary Red Hat have laid off around 4,660 people so far in 2023.
On Monday, the homework helper platform Chegg announced it will lay off 4% of the company, or 80 positions, in order to begin deploying its AI strategy. Students have quickly adopted OpenAI tools and ChatGPT to get their homework done, impacting Chegg’s revenue. In the span of three months, the company introduced its own education platform powered by generative AI called CheggMate to rival the open-source tools.
The dangers of AI
But the rapid adoption of AI is likely to require more jobs to babysit the technology.
As of March, U.S.-based jobs on LinkedIn that mentioned GPT increased nearly 80% year over year. And, according to Crunchbase data, startups focused on AI are quickly joining The Crunchbase Unicorn Board as funding to the category speeds up.
Yossi Sheffi, an engineering professor at MIT, said that if anything, AI may, in a way, be a job creator. Workers will need to manage the technology through different, industrywide regulatory frameworks.
“Even if the invention is good and can be adopted, there are a lot of things that inhibit fast adoption,” he said. “How will they be regulated to make sure they aren’t harmful?”
Already, we’re starting to see some changes in the way companies are making staff changes to experiment with AI. At the National Eating Disorders Association, executives fired a slew of support line staffers after they attempted to unionize. The company quietly launched a chatbot, Tessa, to take over those duties. It was quickly pulled after it gave those with eating disorders bad advice — an argument those in the health care industry have used to stave off adopting AI.
“This is scary and there’s no precedent, and no one really knows what’s going on,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation.

A new report estimated that half of all work will be automated in the next 10 to 40 years as artificial intelligence advances.Credit...Axel Heimken/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Yiwen LuYiwen Lu is a tech reporter in San Francisco.June 14, 2023“Generative artificial intelligence” is set to add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually, according to a report from McKinsey Global Institute, in what is one of the rosier predictions about the economic effects of the rapidly evolving technology.Generative A.I., which includes chatbots such as ChatGPT that can generate text in response to prompts, can potentially boost productivity by saving 60 to 70 percent of workers’ time through automation of their work, according to the 68-page report, which was published early Wednesday. Half of all work will be automated between 2030 and 2060, the report said.McKinsey had previously predicted that A.I. would automate half of all work between 2035 and 2075, but the power of generative A.I. tools — which exploded onto the tech scene late last year — accelerated the company’s forecast.“Generative A.I. has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities,” the report said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMcKinsey’s report is one of the few so far to quantify the long-term impact of generative A.I. on the economy. The report arrives as Silicon Valley has been gripped by a fervor over generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, with tech companies and venture capitalists investing billions of dollars in the technology.Get the best of The Times in your inboxSign up for The Evening:Catch up on the biggest news, and wind down to end your day.Sign up for Opinion Today:Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning. Sign up for The Morning:Make sense of the news, every day, with David Leonhardt.The tools — some of which can also generate images and video, and carry on a conversation — have started a debate over how they will affect jobs and the world economy. Some experts have predicted that the A.I. will displace people from their work, while others have said the tools can augment individual productivity.Last week, Goldman Sachs released a report warning that A.I. could lead to worker disruption and that some companies would benefit more from the technology than others. In April, a Stanford researcher and researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study showing that generative A.I. could boost the productivity of inexperienced call center operators by 35 percent.Any conclusions about the technology’s effects may be premature. David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T. cautioned that generative A.I. was “not going to be as miraculous as people claim.”“We are really, really in the early stage,” he added.For the most part, economic studies of generative A.I. do not take into account other risks from the technology, such as whether it might spread misinformation and eventually escape the realm of human control.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe vast majority of generative A.I.’s economic value will most likely come from helping workers automate tasks in customer operations, sales, software engineering, and research and development, according to McKinsey’s report. Generative A.I. can create “superpowers” for high-skilled workers, said Lareina Yee, a McKinsey partner and an author of the report, because the technology can summarize and edit content.“The most profound change we are going to see is the change to people, and that’s going to require far more innovation and leadership than the technology,” she said.The report also outlined challenges that industry leaders and regulators would need to address with A.I., including concerns that the content generated by the tools can be misleading and inaccurate.Ms. Yee acknowledged that the report was making prognostications about A.I.’s effects, but that “if you could capture even a third” of what the technology’s potential is, “it is pretty remarkable over the next five to 10 years.”A version of this article appears in print on June 14, 2023, Section B, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

Artificial intelligence - friend or foe?


AI can and will be a force for good - but we need a global conversation about its regulation to make sure the benefits of the technology outweigh the risks

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is not only a topical point of discussion, but a contentious one too. In recent weeks, some of the “Godfathers of AI” have turned their attention away from the positive potential of the technology and instead towards the potential of armageddon. Warnings have been plastered across national newspapers debating whether or not humanity is driving itself towards extinction. Others, however, have continued to dismiss any notion that these advancements are dystopian or apocalyptic.







If there is one point of consensus, it’s that the path ahead is still not clear. And whether AI will help or hinder us remains somewhat undetermined.
The deeply polarising nature of this debate prompted us at Here East to explore this question in depth, and we recently gathered leaders from business, technology, the creative industries, law and academia to drill down into the question: is AI a friend or foe? Ultimately, there is one answer to the hypothesis: AI will either be a friend or a foe, depending on how we harness it.
From aiding in medical research and optimising the workplace to reducing waste and pollution, we have already witnessed some of the many benefits AI can bring when used for good. Recently, we saw AI help a paralysed man to walk again with a device that was able to read his brain waves and send instructions to his muscles. An AI-based decoder is being developed that can translate brain activity into text, pioneering a non-invasive way to restore speech in those who have lost it due to motor neurone disease or a stroke.
AI tools will also be instrumental in helping to solve our climate crisis, with the capacity to collate and interpret large datasets, make informed predictions, and generate impactful solutions.

Immeasurable benefits
By employing the technology in this way, we will reap immeasurable benefits and witness both short- and long-term improvements to society. Rather than becoming a malevolent or resistant force, AI should be viewed as a partner or ally, automating repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity, driving economic growth, and helping emerging nations rapidly industrialise. Rather than replacing us, it can assist us, offering us a helping hand.
As Microsoft has suggested, AI is a copilot, sitting alongside us but not flying the plane.
To reap AI’s rewards, we have to educate and train people – particularly the younger generation – not only how to use the technology responsibly, but effectively. Schools should be considering how to integrate AI into the syllabus, with frameworks that will keep our children safe as well as teach them the skills necessary for our future.
We are seeing this in higher education already. As universities are starting to recognise the value of incorporating technology-focused studies into the curriculum, offering courses – including on AI – designed to close the digital skills gap and prepare their students for the AI future. It is imperative that schools keep pace and recognise the role that AI skills will play in driving productivity and innovation. This training and education is crucial in getting the technology to work for us, rather than us to work for it.


Read more about the regulation of AI

How AI ethics is coming to the fore with generative AI - The hype around ChatGPT and other large language models is driving more interest in AI and putting ethical considerations surrounding their use to the fore.
Government and industry figures meet to discuss AI regulation - Tech industry figures are broadly supportive of the need for artificial intelligence to be regulated, but despite growing consensus there is still disagreement over what effective AI regulation looks like.
AI interview: Dan McQuillan, critical computing expert - Critical computing expert Dan McQuillan speaks to Computer Weekly about the top-down imposition of artificial intelligence on society.



Of course, creating policies and parameters around artificial intelligence is a necessary and important step. With AI already permeating everything we do, it is vital that global leaders come together to discuss the blueprint for success – and that these conversations occur at an international level.
Fortunately, governments are beginning to engage in discussions about what a regulatory environment looks like, with news that the UK is set to host the first global summit on AI regulation this autumn. It is exciting to see the UK at the forefront of these discussions, and I hope that as these conferences begin, we will focus our attention on creating responsible citizens - remembering that where we go from here, and how we apply the technology, is up to us.
Indeed, holding these conversations on a global level is likely to temper the doomsday talk around AI. Discussion around AI should not be used to give rise to scaremongering, but to identify the risks and dangers of the technology, and monitor them accordingly. We are facing a new industrial revolution. And while the advancements in AI may currently be creating more questions than answers, the debate must be welcomed as a step towards truly integrating this technology into our lives in the safest and most beneficial way possible for humanity.


Unanswered questions
AI exists not only for our convenience, but to help us perform better, speeding up processes and in turn leaving us with more time for high-value work, and perhaps even a better work-life balance.
While we must take the warnings around AI seriously, we should also be embracing and therefore refining the abundant ways in which it can enhance our lives. There are still many unanswered questions that need addressing, including the crucial question of global accessibility and bias in AI databases. The world is having these discussions in small rooms and behind tall walls, and we must urgently expand and open up these conversations at scale.
When I look ahead to our future world, I see medical and scientific breakthroughs, enhanced education systems, and economic growth.
Artificial intelligence can be a positive force if we keep a close eye on how we use it. It is there to work with us, not against us. And if we harness it in the right way, ensuring that humans are in the driving seat, it will open the door to opportunities we have never had before.

			From generating realistic images and videos to enhancing customer experiences, generative AI has proven to be a versatile tool across various industries. Here are 10 ways businesses are utilizing this game-changing technology to transform their operations and drive growth. 		


Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, and businesses are seeking innovative ways to maintain a competitive edge. Nowhere is this truer than in the realms of generative AI. From generating realistic images and videos to enhancing customer experiences, generative AI has proven to be a versatile tool across various industries. In this article, we explore 10 ways businesses are utilizing this game-changing technology to transform their operations and drive growth.

Content creation and design: Effective content creation and design are crucial for attracting and engaging customers.Generative AI enables businesses to create visually appealing and impactful content quickly and efficiently, helping them stand out in a crowded marketplace. Generative AI has revolutionized content creation by generating high-quality images, videos, and graphics. From designing logos and product visuals to creating engaging social media content, businesses are using generative AI algorithms to automate the creative process—saving time and resources.The company Typeface ingests information about the brand, including style guidelines, images, and product details. Then, with just a few clicks, customers can generate an assortment of suggested images and text—pre-defined in templates for different use cases—that employees can select and customize for use in an online campaign, marketing email, blog post, or anywhere the company wants to use it.
Accelerated automation: Automating IT tasks improves employee experiences, enhances customer interactions, and drives more efficiency within a company’s developer community.Providing employees with reliable automated support leads to increased efficiency, improved work life, and reduced operational costs.AT&T is using Azure OpenAI Service to enable IT professionals to request resources like additional virtual machines; migrate legacy code into modern code; and empower employees to complete common human resources tasks, such as changing withholdings, adding a dependent to an insurance plan, or requisitioning a computer for a new hire.
Personalized marketing: Personalization increases the chances of customer engagement and conversion and can significantly improve marketing ROI.Generative AI enables businesses to deliver hyper-personalized marketing campaigns. By analyzing customer data, generative algorithms can create dynamic content tailored to an individual’s preferences—optimizing engagement and conversion rates.Through the Take Blip platform and Azure OpenAI Service, brands can have one-on-one conversations that include an infinite flow of interactions with each customer. Interactions are digitized: customers’ requests, intentions, and desires can be recorded and used to tune the platform, making future interactions much more productive.
Chatbots and virtual assistants: Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by generative AI provide instant and accurate responses to customer queries.These intelligent systems can understand and respond to customer queries, provide recommendations, and offer personalized support—enhancing customer service, reducing wait times, improving operational efficiency, and boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.By using a common chatbot framework along with the Azure Bot Services, Johnson & Johnson employees without technical training can now build their own bots to serve their teams and customers at a fraction of the time and cost it took to develop previous chatbot projects.
Product and service innovation: Staying innovative and meeting evolving customer demands is essential for business success.Local reporters used to be specialists—they focused their time on investigation and writing. Today, they need to be generalists who can create both written and video content and who knows how to maximize viewership on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and potentially many other distribution channels.”Nota has used Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to build two AI-assisted tools—SUM and VID. These tools do a lot of the heavy lifting needed to optimize stories for distribution and turn written pieces into engaging videos that can produce up to 10 times as much revenue as written pieces.
Language translation and natural language processing: In a globalized world, language barriers can hinder communication and business growth.Generative AI has improved language translation and natural language processing capabilities. Businesses can use generative models to accurately translate content in real time, enabling seamless communication across borders and bridging language barriers.Microsoft Azure AI services augment HelloTalk’s AI learning tools and technical capabilities, allowing users to connect with the world through language and culture exchange.
Fraud detection and cybersecurity: Businesses face constant threats from fraudsters and cyberattacks.By analyzing patterns and anomalies in large datasets, businesses can leverage generative models to detect and prevent fraud, safeguard sensitive information, and protect their digital assets.Using federated learning techniques along with Azure Machine Learning and Azure confidential computing, Swift and Microsoft are building an anomaly detection model for transactional data—all without copying or moving data from secure locations.
Predictive analytics and forecasting: Accurate predictions and forecasting are vital for effective decision-making and operational efficiency.Generative AI models excel in predictive analytics and forecasting. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, businesses can leverage generative algorithms to make accurate predictions and informed decisions, optimizing supply chain management, inventory forecasting, and demand planning.Azure IoT helps Husky meet their system performance needs and maintain service levels for their customers. It scales quickly as they onboard new Advantage+Elite customers and reduces the time and resources spent on infrastructure maintenance.
Creative writing and content generation: Content generation can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Generative AI algorithms automate the content creation process, allowing businesses to generate articles, blog posts, and other written materials quickly.

Medical research and diagnosis: The healthcare industry can benefit from quickly diagnosing diseases—potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses—improving patient outcomes.Researchers can utilize generative models to analyze medical images, detect abnormalities, and aid in the development of new treatments. Additionally, generative AI algorithms can assist in diagnosing diseases by analyzing patient symptoms and medical records, potentially leading to more accurate and timely diagnoses.At Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, a single patient’s case notes could have up to 2,000 documents. In the past, if you needed information that was stored 1,600 documents ago, you weren’t going to find it. Now, using Azure Cognitive Search it takes as little as three seconds to search for a keyword across those 2,000 documents to find it.

How Can Bias Be Removed from Artificial Intelligence-Powered Hiring Platforms?



Harvard-led institute to pursue fairness in online systems

Cynthia Dwork, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science




SUNNYVALE, CALIF. – A Harvard-led group of experts from academia and industry will gather here this week to launch a new research initiative aimed at promoting greater fairness in artificial intelligence-powered hiring platforms.
Today, 70% of companies use automated applicant tracking systems to find and hire talent, according to industry estimates. However, many of the algorithms used by recruiters to manage their hiring process have been shown to reproduce, and sometime amplify, biases and human errors they are supposed to eliminate.
The new effort, the Hire Aspirations Institute, brings together more than a dozen leaders in algorithmic fairness, privacy, AI, law, critical race theory, organizational behavior, economics, and social networking. The researchers are from Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, University of Chicago, Boston University, MIT, Weizmann Institute, Northeastern University, Rutgers, Microsoft Research and Apple. It will be led by Cynthia Dwork, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
“Hiring is a crucible in which forces of preference, privilege, prejudice, law, and now, algorithms and data, interact to shape an individual’s future,” said Dwork, who has made pioneering contributions to private data analysis, cryptography, distributed computing, and the theory of algorithmic fairness. “We will investigate pathways to minimize the transfer of persistent patterns of hiring bias and discrimination onto electronic platforms, from data and algorithms to corrective transformations and law.”
Dwork’s research has demonstrated that systems composed of elements that are “fair” in isolation are not necessarily fair overall. The Hire Aspirations Institute’s multi-disciplinary team will undertake a holistic research agenda to identify concrete solutions to real-world problems across several areas of focus:

Poorly worded job descriptions can lead to the exclusion of qualified Job candidates, and applicants’ own language can contain cultural biases. The initiative will explore AI and other techniques hiring platforms could employ to enable even-handed comparisons between candidates.
Algorithms deployed by hiring platforms to score and rank candidates often exacerbate existing unfairness. The researchers will pursue algorithmic approaches that nullify that effect and improve their overall performance.
Prediction algorithms assign scores intended to calibrate an individual job seeker’s likelihood of success in a role if hired. Drawing on the theory of pseudo-randomness, the team will interrogate approaches to ensure that prediction models are as accurate as possible.
Success in a job depends on the workplace, and the nature of a workplace is, in turn, influenced by the people who work there. The group will explore evidence-based techniques for modeling a more equitable workplace environment.
In-person and digital networking and referrals play an oversized role in how people get jobs. But these informal structures reinforce inequality. The researchers will test ideas for how hiring platforms can level the networking playing field.
The institute will identify legal frameworks that, in tandem with the technical work, can advance the fairness of hiring platforms.

To kick off the effort, the researchers will convene at the offices of LinkedIn. With 930 million members worldwide, LinkedIn is the world’s most widely used hiring platform and professional network. It’s vision to “create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce” and its ongoing efforts to grapple with the meaning and operationalization of fairness, prepare the ground for a fruitful exchange of ideas and insights.
The Hire Aspirations Institute is supported in part by grants from the Sloan Foundation, Simons Foundation, and Harvard University. LinkedIn will supply data to assist with the research.

After all, with the right prompts, these platforms can perform a lot of work tasks, from coding and emailing to project management and customer service assistance.However, the technology is nothing if not controversial, with a wide range of critics wary of AI’s potential impact on the business world. Concerns about its accuracy are the driving factor, but there are plenty of other reasons why banning AI has become increasingly popular over the last few months.In this guide, we’ll show you which companies have started banning AI for their employees, as well as outlining why the tech is being banned in the first place. Companies That Have Banned AIThe tech industry has been abuzz since the launch of ChatGPT in November, with many businesses building AI alternatives to compete with the impressive platform. Still, this has not stopped certain companies from outright banning or limiting generative AI use for employees, at least until they figure out how it can work for them in a more regulated way. AppleWhile Apple is typically on the cutting edge of new technology, the tech giant is taking a firm stance on the employee use of ChatGPT, banning the technology for all workers.The primary concern fueling the ban from Apple is that upper management is concerned about employees unknowingly sharing confidential information, which could then in turn lead to a leak.It’s worth noting, by the way, that Apple banned employees from using AI on the same day it launched the ChatGPT app for iOS. SamsungApple’s decision to ban employee use of generative AI platforms like ChatGPT may have been spurred by Samsung’s decision to do the same, as their reasoning is surprisingly similar. The difference, however, being that Apple was afraid of employees sharing confidential information, whereas a Samsung employee actually did share confidential information on ChatGPT, which led to a potential leak of its code.Samsung didn’t just ban ChatGPT without consideration for its employees. In fact, the South Korea-based company surveyed employees about the decision and found that 65% are concerned about security risks when using generative AI platforms like ChatGPT. VerizonIn a public statement to employees in February, the telecommunications company Verizon made clear its opinions about employees using ChatGPT, and as you might have guessed, it’s not a positive one.“ChatGPT is not accessible from our corporate systems, as that can put us at risk of losing control of customer information, source code and more… as a company, we want to safely embrace emerging technology.”Verizon did note in the statement that “artificial intelligence is integral” to the company’s long-term strategy, but that ChatGPT was “not synonymous with AI,” and therefore not to be used by employees. Wall Street BanksTech companies aren’t the only businesses that are wary of employees utilizing generative AI platforms like ChatGPT to improve productivity. In fact, one of the first industries to really take issue with the technology was banking, which saw a myriad of big banks banning AI outright for employees before the majority of the tech industries.Here’s a list of big banks that have banned employees from using generative AI for work:Bank of America Corp.Citigroup Inc.Deutsche Bank AGGoldman Sachs Group Inc.Wells Fargo & Co.JPMorgan Chase & Co.To be fair, though, the banking industry is not necessarily opposed to the technology on principal. The reality is that the banking industry is heavily regulated, which means that unvetted, third-party software like ChatGPT simply isn’t permitted to manage the billions of dollars passing through these big banks.Considering the fact that ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms have been described as “convincingly inaccurate,” even by their creators, it’s safe to say that they shouldn’t be handling all of our money anyway. Still, once these platforms are a bit more developed, and more importantly regulated, you can rest assured that banks will likely get on the bandwagon. Countries That Have Banned AIIn addition to several companies making the choice to nix ChatGPT for employees, there are some countries that are taking extraordinary steps to ensure the technology does not disrupt everyday life for their citizens. Here’s a list of the countries where ChatGPT is banned:RussiaChinaIranNorth KoreaCubaSyriaItalyIn the countries listed above, you will not be able to access ChatGPT, unless you’ve got a VPN of some kind. Yes, the list is not exactly a ringing endorsement for banning ChatGPT, considering their collective reputation when it comes to unjust internet censorship. Why Is ChatGPT Getting Banned?With so many prominent companies and actual countries banning generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, it’s safe to wonder, why is the technology being banned in the first place?For starters, ChatGPT and its alternatives are very much in their infancy. Having just launched in November 2022, these platforms are far from perfect, relaying a lot of significant AI errors that could have a decidedly negative impact on a company or a country. The tech is also very susceptible to spreading misinformation, according to a 2023 study of the generative platform Google Bard.On top of that, employees and employers just aren’t on the same page when it comes to the use of generative AI in the workplace. 68% of employees reportedly use generative AI platforms at work without telling their bosses, and 47% of employers are considered AI use over new hires. Suffice to say, the impact of AI on the workplace is going to be more that substantial.All that to say, generative AI just isn’t ready for the big time yet. The potential errors, the disconnect on usage, and proclivity for misinformation is enough to turn big business away from the tech. However, you can bet your bottom dollar that once these issues are at least somewhat resolved, these companies will be first in line to get the productivity boost they’ll all but ensure.

Despite headlines warning that artificial intelligence poses a profound risk to society, workers are curious, optimistic, and confident about the arrival of AI in the enterprise, and becoming more so with time, according to a recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
For many, their feelings are based on sound experience. Although ChatGPT, the poster child for generative AI applications, only launched in November 2022, already 26% of workers say they use generative AI several times a week, while 46% have experimented with it at least once, BCG found.
BCG asked 12,898 frontline employees, managers, and leaders in large organizations around the world how they felt about AI: 61% listed curiosity as one of their two strongest feelings, 52% listed optimism, 30% concern, and 26% confidence. A smaller BCG survey five years ago saw 60% listing curiosity, 35% optimism, 40% concern, and 17% confidence. A lot has happened since that last survey on attitudes to AI in 2018. Back then, “AI was still emerging and was not something many people used or saw,” said Vinciane Beauchene, BCG’s global leader for talent and skills, on a recent conference call to discuss the survey findings. But after the pandemic shook up the world of work, generative AI has flourished. “It’s the new normal: 80% of leaders claim they are using it on a weekly basis,” she said. “What was striking for me was how ill-equipped companies still are to deal with that.”
 
 
 













 
 

Familiarity breeds content
The study further found that the more workers used AI tools, the less they were concerned and more optimistic about their impact. Just 22% of regular AI users and 27% of rare users said they were concerned, compared with 42% of non-users. On the other hand, 36% of non-users said they were optimistic about AI, compared with 55% of rare users and 62% of regular users.

Enterprises can help their employees make that transition from concern to optimism, according to Nicolas de Bellefonds, global leader of AI at BCG X, the company’s technology build and design unit.
“What we’ve seen—and we have been helping companies make the most of AI for the past eight years now—is that AI acceptance by workers is directly linked to their understanding of how it will improve and augment their job,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

There’s a lot of work still to be done on that score. So far, just 14% of frontline employees and 44% of leaders say they’ve received training on AI—but 86% of survey respondents believe they’ll need it.
“This is a massive number,” Bellefonds said. “We really have to address this upskilling issue.”
Change management
Helping workers understand what AI can do for them will be tricky, though, as they want to feel that AI is augmenting their work, and not just replacing the enjoyable parts, BCG found.
 
 
 













 
 

“The hardest part of AI acceptance is creating a space where employees can still add value and not feel they are competing with AI to create value,” Bellefonds added. “A lot of the work we do when it comes to change management and coaching is to help employees work with AI and at the same time, change the way they add value, so that a part of their job is taken by AI but their part refocuses on higher value-adding tasks.”

Exactly how those processes are rewired and the working methods changed will vary from one enterprise to another, he said.
There are other ways in which employees’ concerns about AI is unevenly distributed, too. Leaders are more likely to be optimistic, and frontline workers concerned, BCG found. And while 68% of leaders believe their companies have implemented adequate measures to ensure responsible use of AI, only 29% of their frontline employees feel that way.
 
 
 













 
 

Despite BCG’s findings of optimism in the workforce, there’s a darker side. Over one-third of respondents think their job is likely to be eliminated by AI, and almost four-fifths want governments to step in and deliver AI-specific regulations to ensure it’s used responsibly. That proportion was highest in India (89%), Spain (88%), Italy (84%), Brazil and France (both 83%), and lowest in Japan (64%), Germany (73%), the US (74%), and the Middle East and the Netherlands (both 76%).
Five-step program
While we wait for regulators to figure out what we can and can’t do, BCG’s chief AI ethics officer Steven Mills has some suggestions for CIOs on how to introduce generative AI into the workplace safely.
With familiarity with generative AI being a key factor for its successful adoption, employees must get a chance to test it themselves.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s important folks get a chance to interact with these technologies and use them; stopping experimentation is not the answer,” Mills said, noting that it’s also not practical. “AI is going to be developed across an organization by employees whether you know about it or not,” he added.
Instead, he suggested, “rather than trying to pretend it won’t happen, let’s put in place a quick set of guidelines that lets your employees know where the guardrails are, what they can and can’t do, and actually encourage responsible innovation and responsible experimentation.”
Investing in upskilling—continuous, not one-off—will also help, especially among front-line employees where familiarity with the technology is lower. “That disparity across levels is going to be really important for companies to understand as they think about this continuous change journey they’re on … to give them the right skills to be successful as an organization,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

Finally, he advised enterprises to build a responsible AI program to reassure employees that they use generative AI ethically.
In the abstract, there are five key pieces to such a program, Mills said: the overall principles setting out the enterprise’s strategy and risk tolerance; the governance structure setting out the organization and escalation paths; the processes for integrating AI into product development; the tooling needed to do all this; and the drive for cultural change.
Concretely, there are some immediate actions enterprises can take, he said, including handing responsibility and accountability for the program to a senior executive; ensuring that person and his or her team have the funding and resources to build the program; and quickly putting in place an initial set of guardrails and making sure they’re followed. 
 
 
 













 
 

That, he said, means “having an agile review process that teams experimenting with AI can work with and reach out to, to get their questions answered.”

Center launches as JFF releases preliminary survey data which finds a majority of workers feel they need new skills and training to prepare for AI's future impact. 
BOSTON, June 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Jobs for the Future (JFF), a national nonprofit that drives transformation in the U.S. education and workforce systems, today announced the launch of its new Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work. This center will play an integral role in JFF's mission and newly announced 10-year North Star goal to help 75 million people facing systemic barriers to advancement work in quality jobs. As AI's explosive growth reshapes every aspect of how we learn, work, and live, this new center will serve as a nexus of collaboration among stakeholders from every part of the education-to-career ecosystem to explore the most promising opportunities—and profound challenges—of AI's potential to advance an accessible and equitable future of learning and work. 
""While we have yet to realize the full impact of AI on the workforce, we must be proactive in harnessing its power and maximizing its potential to help people advance economically,"" said Maria Flynn, JFF's president and CEO. ""JFF's Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work will catalyze these efforts and ensure that workers of all backgrounds and experiences as well as businesses thrive in this rapidly emerging landscape."" 
In a forthcoming survey commissioned by JFF and conducted by Morning Consult, workers recognized the importance of skills related to AI. While only 1 in 10 workers said they are currently experiencing AI at work—receiving AI training, using it in their role, or seeing AI-related staffing changes—over half feel they need to gain new skills as a result of AI's impact (58%), but a majority do not trust their employer to support them in understanding AI (88%). JFF believes it is important to move quickly, responsibly leverage AI to accelerate progress toward achieving its North Star and identify concrete ways to support workers and learners in the near term. 
""No industry will be untouched by AI. Its potential is limitless and its power still to be seen, so it's essential for those of us who are committed to harnessing AI for good to ensure it is used ethically,"" said Howard Boville, JFF board member and head of IBM Cloud Platform. ""JFF has a tremendous track record in incubating cutting-edge innovations that drive economic advancement. As a JFF board member, I applaud this new center and I see a great opportunity for JFF to leverage their expertise in developing insights, connecting decision makers, and shaping policy around AI to empower workers and learners, employers, educators, and entrepreneurs for years to come."" 
JFF's new Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work's initial focus will include cross-sector convenings, research, and insights to identify best practices for leveraging AI to accelerate skill development, improvements in job quality, and economic advancement. The center will focus on connecting policy with practices that are grounded in equitable applications of AI so all learners and workers can gain access to and benefit from this fast-spreading technology. By deploying JFF's cross-sector networks and convening power, the center will facilitate knowledge sharing and scalable solutions that drive positive outcomes for people and businesses. 
The center will be incubated under JFFLabs, the innovation lab of JFF that provides the infrastructure to bring solutions from ideation to national-scale social impact. JFFLabs' proven model of insights, incubation, and investment provides robust market analysis, identifies emerging trends, and invests in promising innovators to create, test, and scale transformative models that drive equitable economic advancement. Other incubated practice lines within JFFLabs include climate innovation and lifelong learning. 
""Economic equity is, finally, about human potential—the opportunity for each and every one of us to thrive. It is our responsibility to harness AI with purpose and care,"" said Kristina Francis, executive director of JFFLabs. ""As we incubate new capabilities at JFFLabs, we will work across JFF and the field to discover, learn, iterate, and carefully integrate AI into existing systems while exploring how new models help realize AI's fullest potential."" 
Alex Swartsel, a managing director at JFFLabs, will lead the Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work. This builds on her current portfolio within JFFLabs including several extended reality (XR), immersive learning, and AI-related projects and partnerships with organizations such as Intel, Meta, and Unity. Swartsel will guide the center's foundational efforts, working closely with JFF's practice and center leaders to cultivate strategic partnerships and drive effective portfolio management. 
The launch of the Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work reaffirms JFF's commitment to fostering inclusive economic growth and preparing workers for the jobs of the future. By leveraging AI's potential and addressing its challenges, JFF and its partners aim to create a workforce and education ecosystem that thrives in the age of AI.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines"" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research ""under lock and key"", he added.What is AI and what risks does it pose?Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big riskPeople who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.""It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.""""Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,"" and the same would happen with AI he said.Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.Prof LeCun speaking to the press at Meta in ParisHe said there was ""no question"" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists ""get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes"", he said. ""That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.""In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued ""it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch"". He added: ""And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it"".Impact on jobsIt has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. Prof LeCun told the BBC: ""This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently"". But work would change because we have ""no idea"" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.Intelligent computers would create ""a new renaissance for humanity"" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe ""they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive"". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big riskMinister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warningsAI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's workAI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'Artificial intelligence",,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65886125,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1232B/production/_130093547_ai-index-meta.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are transforming HR jobs



By Dawn Kawamoto

June 14, 2023 

Generative AI tools including ChatGPT are infiltrating a wide range of industries—and HR is not immune from the impacts of the emerging technology. Nor are HR professionals free from concerns about AI eventually stealing their jobs. However, experts say that, while the technology could indeed eliminate some HR roles, HR leaders should be more focused on how AI could change the profession and even create new opportunities.

HR is among the leading professions experimenting with AI, particularly in the talent acquisition space, where it is being used to help generate job requisitions and create policy documents, company handbooks and other forms of relevant content. It can also assist recruiters with scheduling and communicating with candidates and even act as a personal digital assistant.
HR is also tapping generative AI like ChatGPT for its knowledge-sourcing capabilities, which is its top emerging use case according to research from the International Data Corporation, says Zachary Chertok, a workforce research analyst with IDC.
Generative AI tools, including ChatGPT, can provide HR leaders with the ability to extract real-time information based on query searches as well as help cast a wide net across systems and concept silos, Chertok says. And ultimately, the technology can enable an employer to offer the right resources to the right people at the right time, to drive a data-informed people strategy. 
But since that has long been the responsibility of human HR professionals, the shift may have some HR professionals skeptical of embracing the technology. It’s a concern fueled by recent reports: The World Economic Forum, for instance, forecasted a 2% decrease in employment in the coming years, in part because of AI; meanwhile, IBM leadership made waves when it announced a halt on hiring for jobs that could be automated, with a particular focus on HR roles that are non-customer-facing.

ChatGPT to steal HR jobs?

Generative AI and ChatGPT most likely will help HR teams reduce tasks, accelerate work and boost efficiency—not steal HR jobs, Chertok tells HRE.
But in reducing those tasks per HR role, the technology is likely to mean that organizations will need fewer people to do that job, he notes. Think of the evolution of checkout stands in the grocery business, where self-service kiosks reduce the number of cashiers needed—but do not eliminate the need for that role altogether.

Similarly, HR and IT help desks are expected to be the first departments hit with job losses because of generative AI, including ChatGPT, Chertok says. 
“Naturally, there’s still going to be a certain amount of complex answers that will need to be provided by those teams but answering the simple questions can be automated with generative AI,” he says.
He predicts the same will hold true for positions that require only basic writing skills, such as crafting a job description.
When companies hire fewer people as technology picks up the slack, job demand is inevitably affected, says Rebecca Wettemann, CEO and principal analyst with research firm Valoir. She suggests that HR leaders get ahead of any job losses by taking such steps as developing reskilling and training programs for HR teams and leaning into the creative problem-solving that they do. 

HR roles change, emerge with generative AI, ChatGPT
With fewer tasks required thanks to generative AI and ChatGPT, the odds are great that additional roles will be assigned to HR professionals, making those roles “multi-competency” ones, Chertok says.
“They may take on more dynamic responsibilities, depending on their skills and position,” Chertok says. “Any time you have a broadening of skills, competencies or responsibilities in one role, it diminishes the need for added headcount overall because one FTE can do more.”

For example, HR generalists and performance managers may be combined into one role, while talent market intelligence analysts may take on additional recruiting, interviewing and level one hiring functions under a merged role, Chertok says.
Wettemann hasn’t seen new HR job titles emerge because of generative AI yet, but don’t be surprised to see that, she says.
“I think we’ll see a real shift in talent management roles, not just the traditional talent tracking sort of thing that can be automated,” Wettemann tells HRE. “It will be thinking more creatively about what are the real opportunities within the organization, what are the skills, the gaps, and what should a training strategy look like to bring everyone along to be more productive with AI?”
What’s the generative AI adoption rate for HR?
Among the various industries and roles that are experimenting with generative AI, HR is among the most active users based on job roles, according to a report by Valoir. 
“HR has always been ahead of the curve and thinking about the ethical use of data within an organization, far ahead of the customer service people, marketing people and certainly salespeople,” Wettemann said. “No ding to salespeople, but HR has always, always taken the role of data steward very, very seriously.”
HR’s willingness to lean into technology could be affecting companywide perceptions of the impact of automation. When Valoir asked employees to estimate what percentage of their co-workers could be replaced by AI in the next two years, 62% pointed to HR.
However, any potential job losses will likely move at a much slower pace, says Chertok.

And although Wettemann acknowledges the reality that some HR professionals will be replaced because of the technology, the need for humans leading HR won’t completely fade.
“HR is uniquely positioned to be part of the game,” Wettemann says. “When you think of replacing part of the HR world, there’s no HR person who says, ‘Boy, I have nothing to do today.’ There are always things on their plate, so [HR should focus on] taking advantage of technology to automate menial parts of the work areas where AI can do some heavy lifting.”

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

For decades, advances in technology have changed the ways people work, and now artificial intelligence could be the next big disruptor.




Three professors from the University of Cincinnati's Carl H. Lindner College of Business discuss how artificial intelligence and automation will change the way people work, what types of jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence and the value human workers still provide.
The professors are:

Liwei Chen, PhD, assistant professor of operations, business analytics and information systems
Craig Froehle, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems
Michael Fry, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems and academic director of the Center for Business Analytics

How will artificial intelligence and automation affect the future of work?



Chen: In general, AI can be used in two ways. One is automation. That is, we use AI to replace some human beings for certain tasks. The other way is augmentation. We use AI to augment human beings’ intelligence and ability to finish some tasks. 
When we talk about augmentation, it is not to replace human beings. It is rather to complement. People and AI can collaborate together and do some tasks better. People often think these are two separate things: You can use AI either for automation or for augmentation. But in fact, when you zoom out across time and space, these two are not necessarily separated. They are actually intertwined with each other and interdependent.
Fry: What history suggests will happen is we’ll find a new equilibrium where in general people are more productive. However, that doesn’t mean it will be good for everyone. Because of automobiles, horse and buggy manufacturers, they had to find something different to do. There certainly will be certain people, certain job classes or industries that may be obsolete. There will be others where certain parts of their jobs will be aided by AI, so you can spend more time doing something that takes more thought whereas the routine things can be done with AI.
Froehle: Information automation, it’s a continuation of the mechanical automation that has transformed nearly every business that makes anything since the 1860s. The big difference is that we are starting to see it affect white-collar jobs, jobs that process information rather than physical goods … so-called “knowledge-work.”
Fry: We have a long history of disruption and automation, everything from [Johannes] Gutenberg and the printing press to the industrial revolution and the internet. What is different about this is that this does a much better job than previous attempts at generating what seems to be new content. You can ask a question that’s potentially never been asked before, and it gives you an answer that seems quite reasonable. 
The same with art; you can go to other places and say make a picture in this style, and it does it. I think that’s what people are really caught off guard by. Now it seems like AI can create, not just automate.

When we talk about artificial intelligence being able to “create,” how real is that?



Fry: We could talk to some philosophers about that: What does creation mean? The algorithms it’s using have been around for a while in some form but there definitely have been updates to the underlying algorithms it’s using. What has changed is the availability of data. It can scrape the web and get all sorts of stuff.
If you think about what it means to create, if you’re an artist, there are certain brushstrokes and things that you have seen, and you put it together. That’s basically what artificial intelligence is doing. Now does that make it intelligent like a human is intelligent? I don’t know because it is based on an algorithm, but it can access so much data, and it can pull things from so many places that it starts to learn, “OK, when I put this together with this, people think that is good.” That’s what it is. It’s all based on a scoring algorithm where it thinks through a lot of possible answers, and it has been trained to say that these types of answers people think are better than others. 
The underlying approach of what it’s doing is not brand new, but the ability to pull so much data, process so much data and some advances in the underlying algorithm lets it do some really cool stuff.



How will chatbots, like ChatGPT, affect how we work?








Craig Froehle, PhD, professor of Operations, Business Analytics and Information Systems








Froehle: The concern that tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E and other generative AI are going to eliminate jobs entirely are kind of overblown, I think. What I suspect is the primary effect is that it will augment or supplement parts of people’s jobs. But a lot of information-centric jobs, they’re doing value-added things that don’t necessarily fit the strengths of a generative AI. I also think it will reduce the time required for certain parts of our jobs, allowing us to spend more time on other parts of our jobs.
I read a story about a realtor who said she typically spent about two to three hours writing a listing for a new house. She can copy and paste some keywords and basic information into a generative AI tool, and it would spit out a first draft in about two minutes. Then she could spend 10 minutes editing it. So two to three hours goes to 15 minutes. What that does is allow her to spend a lot more time working with clients and less time sitting in front of a computer.
Fry: We’ve been playing with it to write code. As long as you are quite specific on the code you want it to write on a small block, it does a decent job which seems amazing. But very few coders these days start from a blank screen. If I know I need to write something, I do a Google search, and it’s out there. So that has already been partially automated for me. This automates it even further. And coders still have jobs; they just spend less time writing simple code and more time thinking about how to improve the efficiency and do fancier things. The job will change, but it doesn’t mean the job will go away, and that’s typically what we’ve seen when there’s been a technology disruption in the past.
Chen: AI plays increasingly important roles instead of being passive tools waiting to be used. They can work as colleagues with human beings. To use ChatGPT as an example, it is very helpful to generate some documents like reports. I can use ChatGPT to create an initial version of the document, and then I can utilize that template and add in additional insight to make it an effective report. It saves human beings time and can free up your time to focus on more challenging pieces of work, think more strategically, think more creatively.





Chatbots have been used by companies, such as for customer service for a while, correct?



Chen: Chatbots have existed for a long time. We talked with the chatbots, and they helped to identify the problems and direct us to the human beings as needed. ChatGPT, as a generative AI, has totally different capabilities. They can do much more challenging jobs.
Fry: The algorithm is simpler. What it’s been trained on is much simpler. Those are like a decision tree where it’s looking for keywords. If you say, “My internet is not working,” it hears certain things there and has been trained to give a verbatim response to that person. What ChatGPT can do, because it’s been trained on so much more data, it has a much better chance of understanding the nuances, so it can give you a better answer based on the context.



When might we see these new artificial intelligence tools become as ubiquitous as the internet?



Froehle: Like with most technologies, the progress isn’t even. You’ll go awhile then you’ll have a sudden big increase in quality or effective efficacy. We could see progress really, really fast, but I don’t know. But given the amount of money that’s being tossed into it and the amount of activity and excitement, we should see advances at least as fast as we saw advancements in the mid-’90s in terms of the internet. Probably faster than that given the amount of people, institutions and organizations and the amount of money that’s being thrown at it. I don’t think anyone wants to be left behind this time. I’ve told several people I think this is the next World Wide Web. Ignore it at your peril.
Fry: It will be interesting to see how they monetize these things. Right now ChatGPT is free. You can pay for premium access. But I assume it could go behind a paywall, which could stifle a little bit of the innovation and usefulness. But Google search is an amazing tool that I think has saved all of us an amazing amount of time, and it’s still free. So it’s possible these could be free, and they monetize it some other way. 
We’re in an interesting time right now thinking who are going to be the players in this, how open are they going to make it to people using it? Because the other interesting thing with this is they actually do get better the more they’re used. At least with ChatGPT, it allows you to give some feedback, and they can use that in improving the algorithm.



How are people going to respond to their increased interactions with artificial intelligence?








Liwei Chen, PhD, assistant professor of operations, business analytics and information systems








Chen: The AI can also be your boss, your manager. We have this term called “algorithmic management.” That means you work for an AI algorithm. You are monitored by an algorithm. For example, Uber drivers. When they drive, their tasks are assigned by the algorithms behind the platform. They are not assigned by human beings. So, essentially, they work for an algorithm as the boss. In that situation, how do you respond to a human being as your boss versus AI as your boss? Will that influence your interactions? Your work behaviors? Your interactions with your customers? Those social relationships will be changed because of this algorithm as your supervisor.
I have conducted research about this phenomenon. I looked at ATM service maintenance and how technicians work to fix the machines. This company implemented an AI to allocate tasks for those technicians. We noticed some very interesting tensions in this scenario. When the employees work with the AI, their motivations changed. Originally, either they were intrinsically motivated — they work because they love the job, the maintenance, their clients — or they work because they have to follow their supervisor’s guidance. After implementing this kind of system, we noticed a shift of their work motivation. They are more likely just to follow the instructions of the algorithm. They receive the message on their cell phone. The AI tells them to go to a location to fix that machine with certain tools to address pre-diagnosed problems. All of this guidance is provided by AI. Technicians just follow the instructions mechanically without even thinking about what’s going on, without utilizing their expertise or experiences.
Technicians also mentioned that they missed the old days when they had direct interactions with human being supervisors. They feel the warmth in the service process, and they enjoy the conversations with the customers when they work on site. In other words, the human intelligence and human touch pieces are decreasing after AI is introduced in the service process.
Froehle: Vanderbilt [University] had a situation where one of the colleges used ChatGPT to draft an email that went out to students and staff, kind of a heartfelt email about the shooting at Michigan State. And it was a pretty nice email, but then people found out that ChatGPT wrote it, and they kind of lost their minds. A majority of Americans are optimistic about the potential for AI, like the changes it’s going to create are more good than bad. But the pushback and the negative reactions we’ve seen in certain circumstances show that there’s a consistently negative reaction when it’s used in empathetic roles. Transparency is going to have to be part of it. If you try to hide the fact that you’re dealing with an AI from people and they find out, that’s going to be worse than if you just tell them upfront.





Can artificial intelligence be empathetic?



Fry: We’ve probably all faked emotions in certain circumstances. If you know in a business setting you’ve got to be nice to someone even though you don’t think you should, you can fake the emotion. Artificial intelligence can learn that. It may not be what we consider a genuine emotion, but I’m not convinced at some point artificial intelligence can’t do a decent job of replicating fake emotions. And will we be able to tell they’re fake? I’m not sure.



What types of tasks will people be able to do better than artificial intelligence?



Chen: Creativity and critical thinking are things people can do better. I demonstrated ChatGPT in my classroom for my undergraduate students. I let ChatGPT generate a paragraph of an essay and make critical comments about the paragraphs it just generated. We observed that the points it makes tend to be neutral, descriptive, informative, yet unoriginal, formulaic and not necessarily creative. If I ask my students to write a similar essay, their ideas might be more open-ended. I would expect more creative ideas with some really critical thoughts.
Froehle: They’re not good at being spontaneous, creative, quirky, having personality and adding the richness that humans do. Now sometimes human richness is not great; it’s not really what you want. But that’s going to be a factor in how we deploy these things. Is the richness of human involvement worth the cost of it being so slow? Because humans are slow, at least in comparison.
The analogy I make these days is a lot of generative AI tools right now are like really fast, low-paid or unpaid interns where you have to look at the output; you just can’t pass it along or stick it into a process without examining it first and adding some value for quality inspection. As we’ve seen, sometimes the pictures they generate aren’t quite right or the facts they write aren’t correct. We need someone peering over the shoulder of the AI right now to make sure that it’s producing usable content. As it gets better, it may need less oversight, but it’s really hard to tell how quickly it’s going to get better. I suspect in some ways it’s going to get pretty good really fast, but in other ways we’re going to find these challenging problems continuing to plague the output. But one thing I’ve never lost on is betting on the progress of technology.



What types of jobs are most likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence?








Michael Fry, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems and academic director of the Center for Business Analytics








Fry: I would say just like we’ve seen in other disruptions, automations, the things that are repetitive — and by repetitive, I mean if you can write out instructions to do it — those are things that we were pretty good at automating. I think about certain things people do in Excel spreadsheets. If I know you need to go here to get this data, click here, do this, do that, I can write a visual basic code to replace that very, very quickly. But if every day you don’t know what you’re going to be doing today in your job, that’s harder to automate.
Froehle: The most easily and directly influenced are those that process or transform information in a way that is fairly procedural, that can be scripted without a lot of creativity. We’re already seeing these generative AI tools creating content that is of fairly low quality but it just does it so quickly that it can make a difference.
What I suspect is going to happen is a lot of the fringe roles might have to change. For example, if a company can generate small pieces of artwork quickly and free, and low quality is adequate, then they might not need to hire an artist. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the artist is unemployable in general. It just means they might need to find a job in a different role or a different company.





Are there jobs that won't be affected by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: There’s a small percentage of jobs that aren’t going to be affected very much. A lot of manual labor jobs probably aren’t going to be affected very soon. Jobs that require a lot of personal, physical manipulation of things aren’t going to be affected by this as fast. But for anybody who's in an information job, they’re going to see this arrive on their desktops, on their watches, on their phones, if they haven’t already. Even most email clients right now have AI embedded in them to detect that, say, you received an email including some airline flight reservations, or for grammar checking.
Anytime you have a context that is purely information, the barriers to implementation, improvement and advancements are really, really low. Once you say you have to interact with the physical world, that’s when things become a lot more difficult. Roombas exist, but that’s about the only autonomous robot people have in their homes, and I don’t think that’s going to change much in the very near future.



Self-driving cars have received a lot of publicity. Will autonomous vehicles replace truck drivers?



Froehle: Given how we’ve been hearing promises for a decade now and we’re still in the limited on-road trials phase … Again, you’re interacting with the physical world. That’s really hard. Machine vision is getting better, processing of environmental stimuli is getting faster, but it’s a really hard nut to crack. It takes immense computing power to do it in real time with the level of reliability we expect of machines. What’s interesting is that the public tends to expect robots to be safer than people. If self-driving vehicles were only as safe as people, they would be legislated out of existence.
Fry: For that particular technology, insurance is probably a bigger barrier than the technology. If there is an accident, who’s at fault? Right now we say it’s the driver. If there’s not a driver, is it the car manufacturer, the software?



How can businesses use artificial intelligence to their benefit?



Chen: AI can help companies reduce costs. For example, companies use machines instead of human beings to reduce human resource costs. AI can also streamline the business process, to enhance the operational effectiveness and the efficiency. For example, in autonomous warehouses, robots can work faster and longer, and maintain the quality all the way through. The work processes will thus be standardized and streamlined; you don’t see a lot of deviations.



If more workers are replaced by robots, will we see more companies choose to remain in the United States rather than build factories in other countries?



Fry: It does open up a few things where labor costs could be less of an issue. This type of disruption certainly is not new. Since the ’80s we’ve talked about robots, and domestic manufacturers have reduced their labor costs by investing in robots. But at the same time, a lot of people, especially in the ’80s and ’90s talked about the “lights out factory.” That there would be no people, so you wouldn’t need any lights. It would just be all robots. There’s very, very few, if any, that are truly that. What we saw was this new equilibrium where a lot of routine tasks were done by robots and freed up humans to do other tasks that were not quite the same as [doing one action] every day, a million times a day. It did reduce labor costs, did reduce the labor force but also opened up some other jobs. Now we’re hiring skilled workers that actually work those computer-controlled machines. The company may need fewer of these workers because the computer-controlled machine is more efficient, but the workers may be paid more due to higher skill levels. It could potentially open up more companies to be willing to [stay] if labor is less of a cost, but we’ll have to see.



Will we see a time when a large percentage of people can’t get jobs because they’ve been replaced by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: I’m skeptical that it’s going to cause massive unemployment, at least anytime soon. The early indication seems to be that the net effect on jobs will probably be positive.
Fry: History suggests that’s not the most likely outcome. I would guess people have been having these same concerns, same discussions for centuries as every new technology came on. What tends to happen is efficiencies increase, new jobs are created, leisure time increases. But we do have to be careful to say that does not mean things are better for everyone. We have seen wealth inequality increase greatly. While average incomes may be up, that average income doesn’t represent everyone.
Froehle: Whether or not a specific person is capable of handling the revised version of a role is really up to that individual. But typically, jobs don’t go away as fast as they change. A classic example is most blacksmith jobs went away once we stopped riding horses, but a lot of the blacksmith-type jobs became auto mechanic jobs.
Chen: I believe the replacement happens at the task level. Jobs with tasks that can largely be automated will be at the high risk to be replaced by AI. Usually jobs that contain routine tasks and require a lot of repetitive work are very vulnerable to being replaced.
At this moment, I don’t think the technologies are ready to take the place of many jobs. But it definitely brings in a lot of changes in the organizations and how people finish their tasks. So people need to adapt to those changes and learn how to work with those technologies. In the long term, some job titles might disappear while new titles  emerge. This will require employees to acquire new skills and adapt to the changing job market.

Who is responsible for preparing individuals for the new reality of work that will be caused by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: It’s everybody. Schools, universities, trade schools, companies. Anybody who’s educating the workforce of tomorrow needs to be involved in establishing in students’ minds the fact that this stuff is here, it’s not going away and our most effective approach is to teach them how to use it, how to collaborate with it. How to do a job doesn’t end with school. There’s a lot of on-the-job training and experience gathering. Those have to also be invested in. Some companies are just going to leave it up to their employees; some are going to invest heavily. But a laissez-faire approach isn’t going to be nearly as competitive as one where you invest actively, develop your employees as well as invest in the technology.
We all talk about lifelong learning. That’s probably a minority of Americans who have that mindset. But as technology’s rate of change continues to increase, a lot more people are going to have to adopt that mindset in order to be employable.
With any technology that is increasingly ubiquitous, different roles have different responsibilities. A cab driver doesn’t need to know how the combustion happens in the engine. They don’t have to have a degree in mechanical engineering to drive a taxi. You shouldn’t need to have a computer science degree to interact with a generative AI. One of the exciting things is companies like OpenAI have put a lot of effort into making the tools accessible to the public.



How do we ensure bias isn't present in artificial intelligence?



Froehle: Ensuring that there isn’t bias is likely impossible, the same way finding a human without bias is likely impossible. Bias exists not only in the data we choose to train the AI on but also in how the AI is constructed. We need to have as much transparency as possible so that those who are concerned about it can look at it effectively.
Fry: There are certain things we can do to prevent that in terms of having a diverse training set and having what’s called “interpretable AI” or interpretable machine learning, so we can try to understand why it gave the output it did. It’s not easy to do, but it’s possible to do. But what we shouldn’t forget is if it was just a person making these decisions, they have biases. It’s sometimes unfair to say the AI or algorithm is less transparent than a person. I don’t always know why someone is making the decisions they make. They could lie to me when I ask them. Bias is inherent in any decision making, whether it’s a human or AI. But there are ways to try to make that AI potentially as transparent as a person.
Chen: We are still in the early stage of discussing AI bias. There are multiple ways we can potentially address this. In the development stage, we need to ensure transparency in AI. We can develop explainable AI, so AI not only provides the suggestions but also explains the rationale of how they came to this suggestion. Another way to address the potential bias is to include a more diverse set of people in the design group. If we could have developers from different ethnic groups, to represent different genders, to represent different minority groups, the algorithm might be designed and evaluated in a more diverse and neutral perspective. Since AI will not be perfect, we need to keep human beings in the loop when we maintain the algorithm. As we continually validate the performance of AI, we can check whether this is aligned with our core values. If there are any deviations, we will investigate the algorithms and fix the issues right away. Finally, government regulations and standards are necessary to make sure that AI is developed in an ethical manner. These regulations might include requirements of transparency and accountability, as well as guidelines for testing and validating AI systems. 
Froehle: One of the things I do worry about is: We’re going to be so excited about what these tools can do for us and how fast they do it that we’re going to spend more time building better tools and less time understanding how the tools actually work. Legislation will have to happen. With any technology, you can’t just let it govern itself because we’re going to quickly arrive at an unmanageable state.

It seems like the leadership of nearly every big company is excited about generative AI these days and rushing to announce or embrace new AI tools. But what impact will their moves have on the economy?
While it’s difficult to say for certain, global consulting leader McKinsey and Company — where GenAI is already in use by roughly half the workforce — has attempted to quantify the trend in a new report, The economic potential of generative AI.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



The report finds that GenAI could add “$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually” to the global economy, close to the economic equivalent of adding an entire new country the size and productivity of the United Kingdom to the Earth ($3.1 trillion GDP in 2021). 
To construct the report, McKinsey’s analysts examined 850 occupations and 2,100 detailed work activities across 47 countries, representing more than 80% of the global workforce. 
A bigger impact on an accelerated timeline
The $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion economic impact figure marks a huge increase over McKinsey’s previous estimates of the AI field’s impact on the economy from 2017, up 15 to 40% from before. This upward revision is due to the incredibly fast embrace and potential use cases of GenAI tools by large and small enterprises. 
Furthermore, McKinsey finds “current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70% of employees’ time today.”
Does this mean massive job loss is inevitable? No, according to Alex Sukharevsky, senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s in-house AI division and report co-author. 
“You basically could make it significantly faster to perform these jobs and do so much more precisely than they are performed today,” Sukharevsky told VentureBeat. 
What that translates to is an addition of “0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth” to the entire global economy, he said. 
However, as the report notes, “workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.” 
Also, the advent of accessible GenAI has pushed up McKinsey’s previous estimates for workplace automation: “Half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or roughly a decade earlier than in our previous estimates.” 
Jobs and tasks most likely to be automated by generative AI and AI, generally
While generative AI has captured the public interest and imagination, McKinsey believes other AI applications and technologies will also play a major role in reshaping the global economy.
“When people talk today about GenAI, they sometimes view it an interchangeable with AI and robotics, but it is important to be precise,” Sukharevsky said.advertisement
That’s because generative AI and the large language models (LLM) at the center of the uptake of this technology are well-suited for certain kinds of white-collar, so-called “knowledge worker” roles and tasks, as opposed to general AI, robotics, and automation technologies, which may be more useful for more physical tasks such as manufacturing, construction, engineering, transportation, mining and search and rescue. 
The former is already here and disrupting the white-collar workforce, while the latter is also here but takes longer to deploy due to the physical machinery required, and will likely have longer-tail impacts further down the road, especially with projections that much of the current workforce will age out over the coming half-century, and there won’t be enough younger people coming up to replace them.
“How do you create a better piece of art? How do you write a better book? How do you produce a better movie? How do you actually create the solution for the world to recover from the worst natural disasters?” Sukharevsky asked, rhetorically, citing some examples of tasks that could be “augmented” by all kinds of AI. 
“Many new tasks and jobs will be created,” he continued. “In the short term, we clearly see the prompt engineers [for LLMs], but then in the longer term, I think the full industries will be readjusted here.”
Four tasks with most value addadvertisement
Specifically, McKinsey’s report found that four types of tasks — customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and R&D — were likely to account for 75% of the value add of GenAI in particular.
“Examples include generative AI’s ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks.” 
For customer operations, McKinsey said its “research found that roughly half of customer contacts made by banking, telecommunications and utilities companies in North America are already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50%, depending on a company’s existing level of automation.”
For marketing and sales, McKinsey found that creating more personalized and intelligent content with GenAI “could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15% of total marketing spending,” and increase the productivity of sales spending 3 to 5% globally. 
In software engineering, McKinsey sees the technology speeding up the process of “generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis and generating new system designs,” resulting in a 20 to 45% increased productivity on software spending. 
When it comes to R&D, McKinsey believes generative AI will “help product designers reduce costs by selecting and using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to cost reductions in logistics and production.”
AI as a ‘technology catalyst’ for economic growth
Overall, McKinsey views GenAI as a “technology catalyst,” pushing industries further along toward automation journeys, but also freeing up the creative potential of employees.
“I do believe that if anything, we are getting into the age of creativity and the age of creator,” Sukharevsky said.
Asked what types of AI tools he used in particular, Sukharevsky declined to comment specifically, saying he liked to test new ones out nearly every day. 
He did confirm that while the data for the report was analyzed and fetched in part by AI, the entire 2023 McKinsey report on the economic impact of AI was written by human authors.

The firm explained that recent developments in generative AI has “accelerated” its “midpoint” prediction by nearly a decade from 2053 — its 2016 estimate — to 2045.McKinsey explained that its broad range of 2030-2060 was made to encompass a range of outcomes — such as the rate at which generative AI is adopted, investment decisions and regulation, among other factors.Its previous range for 50% of work being automated was 2035-2070.McKinsey’s new predicted “midpoint” time at which automation reaches 50% of time on work-related activities has accelerated by eight years to  2045.

The report also predicts that the generative AI market will add between $2.6 to $4.4 trillion to the world economy annually and be worth a whopping $15.7 trillion by 2030.This would provide enormous economic value on top of non-generative AI tools in mainstream use today, the firm said:“That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we now estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock.”Generative AI systems are capable of producing text, images, audio and videos in response to prompts by receiving input data and learning its patterns.

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has generated a lot of buzz, with some predicting it will lead to an idyllic utopia and others warning it will bring the end of humanity. But speculation about where AI technology is going, while important, can also drown out important conversations about how we should be handling the AI technologies available today.
One such technology is generative AI, which can create content including text, images, audio, and video. Popular generative AIs like the chatbot ChatGPT generate conversational text based on training data taken from the internet.
Today a group of 14 researchers from a number of organizations including MIT published a commentary article in Science that helps set the stage for discussions about generative AI’s immediate impact on creative work and society more broadly. The paper’s MIT-affiliated co-authors include Media Lab postdoc Ziv Epstein SM ’19, PhD ’23; Matt Groh SM ’19, PhD ’23; PhD students Rob Mahari ’17 and Hope Schroeder; and Professor Alex ""Sandy"" Pentland.
MIT News spoke with Epstein, the lead author of the paper.
Q: Why did you write this paper?
A: Generative AI tools are doing things that even a few years ago we never thought would be possible. This raises a lot of fundamental questions about the creative process and the human’s role in creative production. Are we going to get automated out of jobs? How are we going to preserve the human aspect of creativity with all of these new technologies?
The complexity of black-box AI systems can make it hard for researchers and the broader public to understand what’s happening under the hood, and what the impacts of these tools on society will be. Many discussions about AI anthropomorphize the technology, implicitly suggesting these systems exhibit human-like intent, agency, or self-awareness. Even the term “artificial intelligence” reinforces these beliefs: ChatGPT uses first-person pronouns, and we say AIs “hallucinate.” These agentic roles we give AIs can undermine the credit to creators whose labor underlies the system’s outputs, and can deflect responsibility from the developers and decision makers when the systems cause harm.
We’re trying to build coalitions across academia and beyond to help think about the interdisciplinary connections and research areas necessary to grapple with the immediate dangers to humans coming from the deployment of these tools, such as disinformation, job displacement, and changes to legal structures and culture.
Q: What do you see as the gaps in research around generative AI and art today?
A: The way we talk about AI is broken in many ways. We need to understand how perceptions of the generative process affect attitudes toward outputs and authors, and also design the interfaces and systems in a way that is really transparent about the generative process and avoids some of these misleading interpretations. How do we talk about AI and how do these narratives cut along lines of power? As we outline in the article, there are these themes around AI’s impact that are important to consider: aesthetics and culture; legal aspects of ownership and credit; labor; and the impacts to the media ecosystem. For each of those we highlight the big open questions.
With aesthetics and culture, we’re considering how past art technologies can inform how we think about AI. For example, when photography was invented, some painters said it was “the end of art.” But instead it ended up being its own medium and eventually liberated painting from realism, giving rise to Impressionism and the modern art movement. We’re saying generative AI is a medium with its own affordances. The nature of art will evolve with that. How will artists and creators express their intent and style through this new medium?
Issues around ownership and credit are tricky because we need copyright law that benefits creators, users, and society at large. Today’s copyright laws might not adequately apportion rights to artists when these systems are training on their styles. When it comes to training data, what does it mean to copy? That’s a legal question, but also a technical question. We’re trying to understand if these systems are copying, and when.
For labor economics and creative work, the idea is these generative AI systems can accelerate the creative process in many ways, but they can also remove the ideation process that starts with a blank slate. Sometimes, there’s actually good that comes from starting with a blank page. We don’t know how it’s going to influence creativity, and we need a better understanding of how AI will affect the different stages of the creative process. We need to think carefully about how we use these tools to complement people’s work instead of replacing it.
In terms of generative AI’s effect on the media ecosystem, with the ability to produce synthetic media at scale, the risk of AI-generated misinformation must be considered. We need to safeguard the media ecosystem against the possibility of massive fraud on one hand, and people losing trust in real media on the other.
Q: How do you hope this paper is received — and by whom?
A: The conversation about AI has been very fragmented and frustrating. Because the technologies are moving so fast, it’s been hard to think deeply about these ideas. To ensure the beneficial use of these technologies, we need to build shared language and start to understand where to focus our attention. We’re hoping this paper can be a step in that direction. We’re trying to start a conversation that can help us build a roadmap toward understanding this fast-moving situation.
Artists many times are at the vanguard of new technologies. They’re playing with the technology long before there are commercial applications. They’re exploring how it works, and they’re wrestling with the ethics of it. AI art has been going on for over a decade, and for as long these artists have been grappling with the questions we now face as a society. I think it is critical to uplift the voices of the artists and other creative laborers whose jobs will be impacted by these tools. Art is how we express our humanity. It’s a core human, emotional part of life. In that way we believe it’s at the center of broader questions about AI’s impact on society, and hopefully we can ground that discussion with this.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Workato, the leading Enterprise Automation platform, today announced AI@Work which includes significant product updates that enable enterprises to adopt AI for automations to drive business efficiency. The new capabilities are seamlessly integrated into the Workato platform and leverage OpenAI technologies.


“Today, the massive productivity, efficiencies, and innovations AI can bring to businesses are only limited by the scale with which companies adopt it”Post this

“Today, the massive productivity, efficiencies, and innovations AI can bring to businesses are only limited by the scale with which companies adopt it,” said Gautham Viswanathan, co-founder, and Chief Product Officer at Workato. “Workato’s AI@Work brings the power of AI, Automation, and Integration capabilities into a single platform to enable enterprises to rapidly adopt AI at scale. With AI@Work, we are making it easier for our customers to incorporate generative AI in their automations, introducing a copilot experience to build recipes and connectors, and, finally, a new way to converse with your applications and data to automate your work.”


With AI@Work, Workato users will have access to the following:



Workato Copilots: Workato Copilots are like a co-worker who is a Workato expert. It works with you to build Workato recipes and connectors using natural language. The Copilots are trained on millions of data points from Workato’s public recipe community, have a deep understanding of business entity relationships, logic, data mappings, and transformations, and use this knowledge to guide the builder. Workato Copilots adhere to the strictest data privacy standards and do not use customer data from these interactions to train any model.




AI Connectivity: Users can use Workato’s OpenAI Connector and other AI Connectors to infuse AI capabilities into their automations to build smarter business processes. Since May 2023, many customers have used the OpenAI connector to create automated processes that generate content for sales emails/sequences, respond intelligently based on feedback, create personalized reactivation and nurture campaigns, automate help desk operations, build QBR and sales decks, enhance employee engagement, create virtual assistants, and more.




WorkbotGPT (Coming soon): WorkbotGPT enables users to converse in natural language with applications and data to automate their work. Users can also chain their interactions to automate complex multi-step automations. For example, you can instruct WorkbotGPT to fetch deals over 100K and ask for an update from the AEs. WorkbotGPT will then fetch those opportunities from Salesforce, and send an email to the AEs requesting an update. No recipes to build, no code to write. Just conversation!




GEARSAI : As the operational framework to drive adoption across any organization, GEARS (Govern, Enable, Adopt, Run, Scale), is used by Workato customers to successfully drive democratization and adoption of automation throughout their business. This framework has now been enhanced to provide a framework and roadmap for the adoption of AI along with Automation.

Brace Yourself: The AI Jobs Panic Is About to Explode

Quote of the Issue
“AI is an amplifier of human intelligence and when people are smarter, better things happen: people are more productive, happier, and the economy thrives.” – Yann LeCun
The Essay


🤖 Brace yourself: The AI jobs panic is about to explode
While extreme AI doomers will no doubt continue to intensely focus on the supposed existential threat posed by generative AI, particularly large language models, I think concerns about job loss are ready to dominate the conversation on social media and coverage by traditional media outlets. My candidate for a key catalyst is a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute, “The economic potential of generative AI.” While The New York Times went with the upbeat “Generative A.I. Can Add $4.4 Trillion in Value to Global Economy, Study Says,” for a headline, this Bloomberg hed gives a hint of hysteria to come, “Biggest Losers of AI Boom Are Knowledge Workers, McKinsey Says.” I have a feeling that alarming angle is going to catch on. From Bberg:
The transformation will pile pressure on the labor force, especially for higher-wage knowledge workers whose activities “were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation,” the report said. A few years ago, McKinsey had estimated that about half of worker hours worldwide were spent on tasks that could be automated. Now it’s raising the figure to as high as 60-70%. Employees could find that their time is reallocated — or that their jobs disappear. “Workers will need support in learning new skills,” the report said. “Some will change occupations.”
Question: If new technologies can perform part of your current job (allowing you to do higher productivity and/or more creative tasks) or even your entire job — or to put it another way, tasks previously performed by labor to be produced by capital — are you a “loser?” Such framing equates any and all change with loss. If that were truly the case, workers have been losing for more than two centuries. Yet our current prosperity is built on disruption. Indeed, McKinsey estimates that the 63 use cases spanning 16 business functions for GenAI that it has identified could deliver $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global economic benefits. And that’s in addition to the $11 trillion to $18 trillion of economic value that McKinsey estimates nongenerative AI analytics could generate. 


Then there are the potentially massive productivity gains: “Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth.”


Industries rise and fall, jobs come and, the tasks performed in the production of products may change, sometimes favoring capital, other times labor. Such is economic history. But there’s a difference with generative AI, according to McKinsey, because of its ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of tasks … “particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation.”
Driving all of this is AI acceleration. MGI had previously identified 2027 as the earliest year when “median human performance for natural language understanding” might be achieved. But in this new analysis, the corresponding point is 2023. Now. From the report:
Previous generations of automation technology often had the most impact on occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. For lower-wage occupations, making a case for work automation is more difficult because the potential benefits of automation compete against a lower cost of human labor. Additionally, some of the tasks performed in lower-wage occupations are technically difficult to automate—for example, manipulating fabric or picking delicate fruits. Some labor economists have observed a “hollowing out of the middle,” and our previous models have suggested that work automation would likely have the biggest midterm impact on lower-middle-income quintiles. However, generative AI’s impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation.




Overall, McKinsey sees 75 percent of the value from businesses using GenAI coming from four business functions:
Customer operations. For example: Customers could interact with a humanlike chatbot that delivers an immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand voice regardless of customer language or location), Marketing and sales. For example: Sales and marketing professionals could efficiently gather market trends and customer information from unstructured data sources and draft effective marketing and sales communications).Software engineering For example: Software engineers and product managers use GenAI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market trends, and existing system logs, and research and development.Product R&D. For example: Researchers could use GenAI to generate prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them to iterate quickly with more design options.
And here’s a specific example about product R&D:
For example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others.
As it turns out, Goldman Sachs also just did a big report on the job impact of GenAI, focusing on the business and information services sector. So we’re talking about companies such as S&P Global, Moody’s, H&R Block, Manpower Group, and ADT among many others. In “Evaluating the impact of generative AI across Business & Info Services,” Goldman analysts scored companies on two dimensions; the subjectivity and creativity of their content or services, and the proprietary or commoditized nature of their content or services. The theory here is that GenAI can enhance subjective and proprietary content or services, but can disrupt rules-based and commoditized content or services. From the Goldman report
Based on our framework, we believe that generative AI can unlock a meaningful amount of opex savings in the Business & Info Services sector as headcount requirements for certain occupations go do down and productivities increase. Our analysis shows that 29-36% of labor costs in the sector could be eliminated by generative AI. Companies providing repetitive and rule-based services, such as tax preparation, background checks and staffing, could potentially benefit more from labor replacement than industry peers, with labor cost reduction potential totaling 35-36%.


Nothing in either of these reports necessarily means a faster growing and higher productivity economy will also mean one with higher unemployment, although there may be more job changing, more dynamism. If so, as MGI notes, “workers will need support in learning new skills.” But history suggests that general purpose technologies — and AI/machine learning/GenAI sure look like one — have a history of broadly improving human welfare even as they also unpredictably change what humans spend their days doing. Both of the recent periods of rapid productivity and economic growth, the 1960s and 1990s, were also ones of rapid job growth. There’s no reason yet to think another tech-driven boom will be any different.

▶ Artificial Artificial Artificial Intelligence: Crowd Workers Widely Use Large Language Models for Text Production Tasks – Veniamin Veselovsky, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, and Robert West, Arxiv | Large language models (LLMs) are remarkable data annotators. They can be used to generate high-fidelity supervised training data, as well as survey and experimental data. With the widespread adoption of LLMs, human gold standard annotations are key to understanding the capabilities of LLMs and the validity of their results. However, crowdsourcing, an important, inexpensive way to obtain human annotations, may itself be impacted by LLMs, as crowd workers have financial incentive to use LLMs to increase their productivity and income. To investigate this concern, we conducted a case study on the prevalence of LLM usage by crowd workers. We ran an abstract summarization task from the literature on Amazon Mechanical Turk and, through a combination of keystroke detection and synthetic text classification, estimate that 33–46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task. Although generalization to other, less LLM-friendly tasks is unclear, our results call for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human, perhaps using the methodology proposed here as a stepping stone.

“In my day,” began a voice endorsing a laissez-faire approach to police brutality, “no one would bat an eye” if a police officer killed 17 or 18 people. The voice in the video, which purportedly belonged to Chicago mayoral candidate Paul Vallas, went viral just before the city’s four-way primary in February.
It wasn’t a gaffe, a leak, or a hot-mic moment. It seemingly wasn’t even the work of a sly impersonator who had perfected his Paul Vallas impression. The video was a digital fabrication, a likely creation of generative artificial intelligence that was viewed thousands of times.
The episode heralds a new era in elections. Next year will bring the first national campaign season in which widely accessible AI tools allow users to synthesize audio in anyone’s voice, generate photo-realistic images of anybody doing nearly anything, and power social media bot accounts with near human-level conversational abilities — and do so on a vast scale and with a reduced or negligible investment of money and time. Due to the popularization of chatbots and the search engines they are quickly being absorbed into, it will also be the first election season in which large numbers of voters routinely consume information that is not just curated by AI but is produced by AI.
This change is already underway. In April, the Republican National Committee used AI to produce a video warning about potential dystopian crises during a second Biden term. Earlier this year, an AI-generated video showing President Biden declaring a national draft to aid Ukraine’s war effort — originally acknowledged as a deepfake but later stripped of that context — led to a misleading tweet that garnered over 8 million views. A deepfake also circulated depicting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) insisting that Republicans should be barred from voting in 2024. In the future, malign actors could deploy generative AI with the intent to suppress votes or circumvent defenses that secure elections.
The AI challenge to elections is not limited to disinformation, or even to deliberate mischief. Many elections offices use algorithmic systems to maintain voter registration databases and verify mail ballot signatures, among other tasks. As with human decisions on these questions, algorithmic decision-making has the potential for racial and other forms of bias. There is growing interest by some officials in using generative AI to aid with voter education, creating opportunities to speed up processes but also producing serious risks for inaccurate and inequitable voter outreach.
AI advances have prompted an abundance of generalized concerns from the public and policymakers, but the impact of AI on the field of elections has received relatively little in-depth scrutiny given the outsize risk. This piece focuses on disinformation risks in 2024. Forthcoming Brennan Center analyses will examine additional areas of risk, including voter suppression, election security, and the use of AI in administering elections.
AI since the 2022 elections 
While AI has been able to synthesize photo-quality “deepfake” profile pictures of nonexistent people for several years, it is only in recent months that the technology has progressed to the point where users can conjure lifelike images of nearly anything with a simple text prompt. Adept users have long been able to use Photoshop to edit images, but vast numbers of people can now create convincing images from scratch in a matter of seconds at a very low — or no — cost. Deepfake audio has similarly made enormous strides and can now clone a person’s voice with remarkably little training data. 
While forerunners to the wildly popular app ChatGPT have been around for several years, OpenAI’s latest iteration is leaps and bounds beyond its predecessors in both popularity and capability. Apps like ChatGPT are powered by large language models, which are systems for encoding words as collections of numbers that reflect their usage in the vast swaths of the web selected for training the app. The launch of ChatGPT just weeks after the 2022 midterm election on November 30, 2022, has precipitated a new era in which many people regularly converse with AI systems and read content produced by AI.
Since ChatGPT’s debut, our entire information ecosystem has begun to be reshaped. Search engines are incorporating this kind of technology to provide users with information in a more conversational format, and some news sites have been using AI to produce articles more cheaply and quickly, despite the tendency for it to produce misinformation. Smaller (for now) replicas of ChatGPT and its antecedents are not limited to the American tech giants. For instance, China and Russia have their own versions. And researchers have found ways of training small models from the output of large models that perform nearly as well — enabling people around the globe to run custom versions on a personal laptop. 
Unique vulnerability to disinformation
Elections are particularly vulnerable to AI-driven disinformation. Generative AI tools are most effective when producing content that bears some resemblance to the content in their training databases. Since the same false narratives crop up repeatedly in U.S. elections — as Brennan Center research and other disinformation scholars have found, election deniers do not reinvent the wheel — there is plenty of past election disinformation in the training data underlying current generative AI tools to render them a potential ticking time bomb for future election disinformation. This includes core deceptions around the security of voting machines and mail voting, as well as misinformation tropes regularly applied to innocent and fast-resolved glitches that occur in most elections. Visual-based misinformation is widely available as well — for example, pictures of discarded mail ballots were used to distort election narratives in both the 2020 and 2022 elections.
Different kinds of AI tools will leave distinct footprints in future elections, threatening democracy in myriad ways. Deepfake images, audio, and video could prompt an uptick in viral moments around faux scandals or artificial glitches, further warping the nation’s civic conversation at election time. By seeding online spaces with millions of posts, malign actors could use language models to create the illusion of political agreement or the false impression of widespread belief in dishonest election narratives. Influence campaigns could deploy tailored chatbots to customize interactions based on voter characteristics, adapting manipulation tactics in real time to increase their persuasive effect. And they could use AI tools to send a wave of deceptive comments from fake “constituents” to election offices, as one researcher who duped Idaho state officials in 2019 using ChatGPT’s predecessor technology showed. Chatbots and deepfake audio could also exacerbate threats to election systems through phishing efforts that are personalized, convincing, and likely more effective than what we’ve seen in the past.
One need not look far to witness the potential for AI to distort the political conversation around the world: A viral deepfake showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy surrendering to Russia. Pro-China bots sharing videos of AI-generated news anchors — at a sham outfit called “Wolf News” — promoting narratives flattering to China’s governing regime and critical of the United States, the first known example of a state-aligned campaign’s deployment of video-generation AI tools to create fictitious people. GPT-4 yielding to a request from researchers to write a message for a Soviet-style information campaign suggesting that HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS, was created by the U.S. government. Incidents like these could proliferate in 2024.
Dramatically enhanced disinformation tools
In 2016, state-affiliated organizations in Russia employed hundreds and possessed a monthly budget of more than a million dollars to conduct information warfare in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Today, with the benefit of generative AI, a similar effort — or even one on a much larger scale — could be executed with a fraction of the personnel and at less expense. Future state-aligned influence campaigns could cut out many intermediaries, relying on better automated systems.
AI tools could also increase the persuasive power of large-scale disinformation campaigns by better blending falsehoods with recipients’ information environments and exploiting voters’ racial, religious, and political identities en masse. Prior Russia-backed influence campaigns were often pockmarked with obvious errors and missteps, but recent AI tools could blunt those flaws by erasing or mitigating glitchy visuals, mistranslations, grammatical faux pas, and bungled idioms so deceptions do not attract as much suspicion. Automated conversations with voters that are designed to deceive could be multiplied ad infinitum with a model fine-tuned for that function. And as Poynter has shown, apps like ChatGPT can facilitate entire misinformation-filled fake news sites — a particular risk when they masquerade as local news in “news deserts” where millions of eligible voters live in counties with no remaining local newspaper. 
At the same time, voters interacting with language models on search engines and through chatbots will likely unwittingly encounter misinformation since these tools are known to periodically “hallucinate” and even fabricate authoritative-looking footnotes with links to nonexistent articles to support false claims.
Trust in accurate election information
The president of Gabon traveled overseas for several months in 2018 to receive medical assistance. At home, his lingering absence produced confusion and fostered conspiracies. When the Gabon government released a video to prove the president was alive, opponents claimed that it was a digital forgery. Even though the video was likely authentic, the potential to create realistic fakes made the claim plausible and fueled confusion. This is what is known as the “liar’s dividend”— the mere existence of generative AI creates an atmosphere of mistrust — and the dividend could be set to grow dramatically.
Beyond outright falsehoods, the proliferation of AI-generated content may accelerate the loss of trust in the overall election information ecosystem. In the future, voters could inhabit online spaces crowded with manipulated viral images and videos and AI-generated text. Widespread use of generative technology could create a fog of confusion that makes it even harder to tell truth from falsity — an express goal of Russia’s “Firehose of Falsehood” propaganda model. That, in turn, could erode trust in election information more broadly, making it harder for voters to have faith in any sources of election information — even ones that are accurate and authoritative. Content that spoofs election officials, for instance, could result in real officials losing the credibility they largely enjoy. 
The path forward to protect elections
Americans need safeguards to protect our elections from the many risks that AI technologies pose. Below are just a few of the actions that should be considered as part of a comprehensive governmental, civil society, and private sector response to the threats that AI poses to elections and democracy.
While defending against damage to democracy from AI will require an interagency effort, the executive branch should designate a lead agency to coordinate governance of AI issues in elections. On the disinformation front, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency should create and share resources to help election offices address disinformation campaigns that exploit deepfake tools and language models to undermine election processes. To reduce the risk of AI misuse by political campaigns, the Federal Election Commission should ensure that its political ad disclosure requirements cover the full range of online communications currently permitted under federal law. That includes ensuring its rules cover political communications from paid influencers, who may disseminate AI-generated content, and the paid online promotion of content, which may also make use of AI.
The federal government should ramp up efforts to promote and encourage innovation in deepfake detection and to nurture progress in the detection of voting disinformation campaigns and election cybersecurity threats fueled by language models and chatbots, including through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the new AI Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation. Among the menu of actions should be the development of high-accuracy detection and anti-phishing tools for use by state and local election offices. In the arms race between AI tools that can generate disinformation and tools that accurately detect content generated by AI, the government can offer a boost to detection efforts — including those focused on coordinated bot campaigns — to bolster their effectiveness.
AI developers and social media companies must play a role in mitigating threats to democracy. Among other steps, AI developers should implement and continuously refine filters for election falsehoods and impose interface limitations to make it more difficult to create disinformation campaigns at scale. Social media companies should develop policies that reduce harms from AI-generated content while taking care to preserve legitimate discourse. They should publicly verify election officials’ accounts and other authoritative sources of election information, such as the National Association of Secretaries of State, using unique icons. (Twitter’s complimentary gray checkmark label for government accounts does not clearly cover local election offices, for example.) Platforms should devote more resources and attention to identifying and removing coordinated bots and labeling deepfakes that could influence elections. They need to coordinate closely with AI developers to continuously improve detection practices as generative AI capabilities evolve. 
Finally, Congress and state legislatures need to act quickly to regulate AI. While the process of establishing the most prudent course of action will require further discussion and refinement, it is clear that lawmakers cannot afford to dawdle or allow themselves to become mired in partisan bickering. The stakes are simply too high. Among options that merit deliberation and debate are mandating watermarking and digital signatures to help identify AI-generated content, requiring companies to prove the safety of their products before releasing them to the public, and limiting the creation and transmission of the most harmful AI-generated content that can interfere with elections.
Generative AI tools whose source code is fully public — and consequently downloadable and manipulatable — pose particular challenges since users can remove safeguards and operate these models without moderation or scrutiny. But huge numbers of users will continue to rely on proprietary AI apps provided by tech firms, so regulation targeting the development and deployment of such apps in the private sector will have a large impact despite the open-source alternatives.
Voters need some level of transparency to promote safe AI use when it comes to elections. Lawmakers could compel AI developers to make public the categories of data and guiding principles used to train and fine-tune generative AI models, they could require algorithmic impact assessments for AI systems deployed in governance settings, they could mandate periodic third-party audits of AI systems used in election administration, and they could require that election offices disclose details about their use of AI systems in running elections. Congress should also require “paid for” disclaimers and other disclosures for a much wider range of online ads than the law currently mandates. While the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill, would accomplish this in part, it could be made even better by requiring the disclosure of information about the role of AI in generating certain political communications. These actions could help voters make informed choices and mitigate risks from AI use in election settings.
Any governmental use of generative AI to aid with educating voters or otherwise engage constituents in elections should be tightly regulated. We should also look beyond national borders to support a coordinated global response.
AI has the potential to dramatically change elections and threaten democracy. A whole-of-society response is needed.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Made with Microsoft Bing Image Creator. Prompt: “A robot helping a software engineer develop code.”
Generative AI is already changing the way software engineers do their jobs. 
GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT, Tabnine, and various other AI coding tools are quickly gaining traction, helping developers automate mundane tasks and freeing them up to work on more challenging problems. 
A new survey from GitHub found that 92% of U.S.-based developers are using AI coding tools both in and outside of work, and 70% say the tools will give them an advantage at work. A majority also believe AI tools will lead to better team collaboration and help prevent burnout.
Another survey from Stack Overflow showed similar adoption of AI coding tools, with 77% saying they feel favorable about using AI in their development workflow. 
In an interview with Wired published Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said he realized AI was going to be transformative when he saw its ability to code, which led to the company developing GitHub Copilot.
We caught up with engineering leaders at six Seattle tech companies to learn about how they’re using generative AI and how it’s changing their jobs. 
Diamond Bishop, CEO and co-founder at Augmend, a Seattle collaboration software startup

“AI is making it so small startups like ours can accelerate all aspects of the software development lifecycle. We’re a team of five devs, and we estimate productivity impact of almost 2X. 
Each of us leverage both Copilot and ChatGPT in day-to-day development, debugging, and learning. Knowing the right way to leverage these tools and how best to be an AI-augmented cybernetic developer is a skill in itself, as there are pitfalls (hallucinated APIs/functions) and prompt incantations to learn. But it’s quite valuable in areas you aren’t already an expert, which is many in a jack-of-all-trades situation at a new startup. 
Going back to coding without this augmentation feels a lot like working without the internet at your fingertips.”
Bridget Frey, CTO at Redfin, a Seattle-based real estate company

“We’ve already found a number of places where AI tools are making our engineers more efficient. For instance, we’ve used LLM models, including ChatGPT, with a fair amount of success to assist with internal tasks like migrating from one programming language to another, helping developers understand legacy code written by other colleagues, or writing functions for converting data formats. These are good examples of tasks that our engineers can do without the assistance of LLMs, but with these models, they can move much faster. Something that used to take an engineer 30 minutes to do can now be done by AI in one minute.
“Something that used to take an engineer 30 minutes to do can now be done by AI in one minute.”
We’ve also found ways to use these tools to help us serve customers more efficiently. For example, it’s not unusual for homeowners to contact Redfin’s customer service team and ask why the Redfin Estimate has priced their home the way it has. So we taught a LLM to explain to us in plain language why the Redfin Estimate may have priced a specific home in a particular way, and then we can pass those insights via our customer service team back to the customer to help them understand what’s going on.
In other cases, we’re still too early in the experimentation phase to see a significant impact but are running tests to see what benefit we might gain. One such example is with Copilot, from GitHub. We’re trying to determine if its ability to suggest predictive code might help make some of our more rote coding tasks a little faster and easier by helping with simple scripts.”

Jonathan Wiggs. (Outbound AI Photo)
Jonathan Wiggs, CTO and co-founder at Outbound AI, a Seattle-based conversational AI startup 
“We’ve recently leveraged GPT to write narrative summaries of phone calls made by our AI-powered virtual agents, and what we’ve found is that GPT is able to do this effectively the same, if not better, than an experienced human worker. It’s one of the things GPT does extremely well. We’re also using some generative processes to write code snippets, specifically for well-known API calls. Large language models are great at this kind of focused, pattern-based code building. 
This said, it’s important to emphasize that we still need experienced and skilled engineers for 90% of our work. I think the companies that remain flexible and adopt these tools in a practical and thoughtful way will win the day for themselves and their customers.”

Laura Butler. (Armoire Photo)
Laura Butler, CTO at Armoire, a Seattle clothing rental startup
“We recently started using GitHub Copilot. It’s helpful with generating much of the boilerplate for unit tests. The auto-complete and auto-suggestions in Visual Studio Code are pretty good, too, without being annoying. Intellisense and language plugins like Pylance have been around for a while. GitHub Copilot just takes it to the next level.
The biggest problem with generative AI and coding is that it works best with patterns and as a fancier copy-and-paste. But great engineering isn’t pumping out tons of code. It’s about less code, shared components, using APIs and services that already exist, quality, and maintainability. The world doesn’t need more Javascript files without comments. It doesn’t need more buggy code that wasn’t thought through, reviewed, or tested properly.
I think AI tools would be of real use for engineering in two areas: documentation and brainstorming.
Documentation and comments in code get out of date so easily or they are useless. Making it easy for busy programmers to write good docs and to keep them up to date would be wonderful.  
Brainstorming assistance, generating lots of images and options from words to speed up ideation — that would be awesome, too. Those of us who aren’t graphic artists need a lot of assistance to visualize and share what’s in our heads before we start prototyping.”

John Zhang. (Highspot Photo)
John Zhang, vice president of engineering at Highspot, a Seattle sales software startup 
“We’ve seen equal parts benefits and limitations using generative AI as a ‘co-pilot’ for engineering. It’s saving us time, especially for generic implementations or generating code for some testing scenarios. 
Of course, we always check what it provides and haven’t seen value for complex implementations yet. We have begun scaling out its use across a broader range of engineers and expect greater value as we use it more.” 

Kevin Leneway. (PSL Photo)
Kevin Leneway, principal software engineer at Pioneer Square Labs, a Seattle startup studio
“We started building apps using GPT during the GPT-3 private beta in 2020, and I was an early beta user of GitHub Copilot last year. Copilot was particularly helpful for many PSL tasks like prototyping around an unfamiliar API, or swiftly writing out boilerplate code or simple tests.
Once I got access to GPT-4 in March, I really started to explore how far I could push the AI to help me to build real working code. 
Just for fun, I started building an AI coding “intern” named Otto. The goal is to have Otto interact with my existing dev and communication workflows just like any other dev on my team. I can assign issues in GitHub, give feedback via Slack, and do an interactive code review via pull requests. Otto can take on various roles; for instance, acting as a project manager by converting project briefs into a detailed list of GitHub issues, and even as a designer through a Figma plugin that turns designs into working components in my app.
When I first conceived the idea for Otto, I recognized that one of the initial steps would be to write all the code to interface with the GitHub and Slack APIs. Ordinarily this would have been a lot of tedious work to learn these APIs and get the basics working, but with GPT-4, I managed to get the core code written in just a few hours instead of days. 
“It reinvigorated my joy of coding in a way that I haven’t felt since I was a kid tinkering with my Commodore 64.” 
I’ve found that GPT-4 can efficiently handle the mundane parts, allowing me to focus on the higher-level planning and prompt engineering to get the whole project up and running. It reinvigorated my joy of coding in a way that I haven’t felt since I was a kid tinkering with my Commodore 64. 
I should note, though, despite being a huge AI enthusiast, I also have some reservations about the future. I’ve dedicated the past 20 years of my career to software development and there’s definitely some fear that my amassed knowledge will become less relevant within the next 5-to-10 years. I’ve been building out my auto-coding bot slowly over the past few months and now that it’s mostly working, I’m realizing that I’m probably one of the first people in the world to truly understand how it feels when you have a customized, aligned AI agent who is capable of doing much of my day-to-day work. It’s thrilling, but also there’s a bit of sadness knowing that the skillset I’ve cultivated is gradually declining in usefulness.”

We have officially entered the era of generative AI with tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and DALL-E gaining more prominence everyday. And while some people are still asking, “What is generative AI?” there’s just as many asking, “How will this affect my job?” and “How do I get started with it?” And of course, there’s those who have already fully hopped on the bandwagon. At Infragistics, we currently have multiple ongoing experiments testing new features from OpenAI and ChatGPT.
3 Software Development Tasks Generative AI Can Help You With Right NowCode generation and completion: Generative AI tools can automatically suggest or generate sections of code.
Software testing: Generative AI is able to create tests and identify mistakes.
Code optimization: AI tools can recommend code modifications to boost performance or streamline the architecture.

At first glance, generative AI can seem like a beast. There’s so many features to access and different ways to use it, but you don’t have to do everything all at once. Here’s how software developers can get started with generative AI.
 
Introduction to Generative AI and Coding
Microsoft released GitHub Copilot two years ago. It’s an AI-based programming assistant that autocompletes code and helps developers accelerate hard tasks. It utilizes OpenAI Codex and GPT-3, which are large language models optimized to generate code in response to natural language questions. 
Microsoft also recently released a preview of GitHub Copilot Chat, which is more of a ChatGPT-like interface that lets developers ask questions about code, convert code from one language to another, explain code and more.
With GitHub Copilot, you have multiple options to accelerate your development:
AI-powered Intellisense.
Comment prompts and questions. 
Interactive Chat.
No matter what type of applications you are building, you’ll be able to find a Copilot-enabled feature that will help you write code easier and faster, driving efficiencies for your software developer team.

How to Use Generative AI to Automate Repetitive Tasks
With GitHub Copilot, developers can accelerate various development processes, and as a result, dial back their time spent on repetitive tasks. Developers using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Neovim or JetBrains can try Copilot directly in that IDE today. When GitHub Copilot is enabled, you get real-time autocomplete style suggestions for every aspect of your code that you are typing. In addition, using the comment prompt (//), you can ask GitHub Copilot for anything from help on syntax to writing entire code blocks or pages. 
For non-Visual Studio developers, ChatGPT is an excellent tool for the same accelerators. The only difference is that GitHub Copilot operates in-context with your code as you are typing, while ChatGPT is an interactive chat experience. This means you would ask ChatGPT questions about your code, for testing purposes or potential security issues, or just ask it to write entire functions for you. You can give ChatGPT information about your data schema, and then ask it to write a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) web API for you in Java or Python. It will do this in less than a minute, where it might take you several hours based on the complexity of your code. This is where generative AI shines, and where developer productivity can skyrocket. 


A tutorial on how to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT to write code. | Video: Fireship 
What Can You Use Generative AI Tools to Do? (With Examples).
Developers can use generative AI tools like Github Copilot to accelerate repetitive tasks like:
 
Code Generation and Completion 
As a developer types, software can automatically suggest or generate sections of code. This can cut down on errors and considerably speed up the development process. Microsoft reports that 46 percent of a developer’s code is created by GitHub Copilot, which is a significant number that will only increase with more adoption and more sophisticated models behind the AI.
 
Example
Ask GitHub Copilot questions by prefixing your question with //, like this:
// can you write a function that takes an array of CompanyName and loops through the array and returns a new array with the company names reversed
GitHub Copilot will return this as an example of the output:
 
// example: ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'] => ['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']


As you hit the “Tab” and “Enter” key, GitHub Copilot will continue to write the lines of code that you asked for. It generates the new code commented out so it won’t run and return errors as it types, just remove the // and run your new code.
// function reverseCompanyName(array) {
//   let newArray = [];
//   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
//     let reversed = array[i].split('').reverse().join('');
//     newArray.push(reversed);
//   }
//   return newArray;
// }

 
Software Testing
AI can increase the effectiveness of automated testing, a significant component of contemporary software development. AI is able to create tests, recognize when a system is doing improperly and give precise feedback on the types of mistakes that may have occurred.
 
Example
We’ll continue to ask GitHub Copilot to work with the code it just generated to create different types of unit tests.
// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']);
//   });
// });

// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName that fails
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG', 'test']);
//   });
// });

// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName that checks that the type of the return value is an array
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']);
//     expect(typeof result).toEqual('object');
//   });
// });

 
Code Optimization 
AI can also recommend code modifications or implement them automatically to optimize the code. This can involve anything from minor adjustments that boost performance to significant adjustments that streamline the code’s architecture, or simply cut down on the amount of code required.
 
Example 
In this example, we’ll switch gears to try something in ChatGPT. This code is a perfectly acceptable approach to count the number of items in an array:
function countNumbersPoorPerforming(arr, target) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

However, what if I have a very large number of items? This function is iterating over the array arr using a for loop, and then it increments the count variable whenever we find a match between the current element and the target value. The problem is as the size of the array increases, the function’s execution time will grow linearly.
Let’s ask ChatGPT how it can help. In the prompt, I asked:
If I have a very large array, is this the most optimized code to count numbers in the array? 

function countNumbersPoorPerforming(arr, target) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

ChatGPT replied with a comprehensive explanation with a new function to try:
“The code you provided is a straightforward approach to counting the occurrences of a specific number in an array. It iterates through each element of the array and increments the count if the element matches the target value. While this code will work correctly, its performance can be improved for very large arrays.
If you have a very large array, there are more efficient ways to count the numbers. One approach is to use a hash table or an object to store the counts of each number in the array. This way, you only need to iterate through the array once, and for each element, you can increment its count in the hash table. Here’s an example:”
function countNumbers(arr, target) {
  const countMap = {};
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const num = arr[i];
    countMap[num] = (countMap[num] || 0) + 1;
  }
  
  return countMap[target] || 0;
}

Advantages of Using Generative AI Tools in Software Development
When developers can automate their more repetitive tasks, they have more time to focus on complex and creative projects. Developers can go back to the projects that made them start as developers in the first place–with creativity leading the way. In fact, according to Github Copilot, 74 percent of developers using the tool reported that they felt less frustrated when coding and that they were able to focus on more satisfying work.
Some of the generative AI capabilities that developers can tap into for these more complex and creative projects, include:
 
Database Optimizations
AI tools can create data schemas, suggest schema improvements and generate data based on schema information. 
 
Advanced or Predictive Analytics 
AI tools like ChatGPT can very quickly answer analytics questions about your data. For example, if you pass it a data set, it can find outliers, correlations, regressions, future predictions and other deep data-related insights. A word of caution: Anything you upload to open tools like ChatGPT will be informing its model. Do not pass confidential information as you experiment.
 
Image Generation 
While some are better than others, developers that need images generated for projects can get them in a snap with AI tools. Building a website selling exotic surfboards? With the right prompts, you can get high-quality digital images that can be used in your applications. 
 
UX/UI Design 
AI can help in the UX design process by suggesting or creating user interface designs, predicting how users will interact with the design and suggesting improvements based on user feedback and usage data. While this is a very sophisticated expectation of AI, the more information you give the model, or the better the prompt, the more useful the outcome will be.
Instead of looking at AI as “taking” work away, look at it as a new partner in your workflow. Start experimenting with different AI tools that map to your needs, and work with your team on how to integrate them into your pipelines. While some of this is just individual accelerators (like GitHub Copilot to help write code faster), other AI capabilities like natural language processing (NLP) in custom Chatbots are enterprise-level capabilities that can be game changers for an organization and your customers.

Common Mistakes to Avoid While Using Generative AI
While generative AI is a game changer for productivity, there are caveats that every developer should be aware of. The code generated is based on what the model is aware of – it is learning from the millions of GitHub repositories and other public code repositories and sources. 
If there is not a large body of publicly available code using a library, Copilot may not be able to give meaningful code suggestions. Python, the world’s most popular language, has a very high (40 percent) accepted code rate using Copilot, along with other popular languages that have billions of lines of code publicly available like JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Go. You may not have as high of a success rate if you are using something newer that does not have a large body of work available to the models.
Other items to consider are:
Because neither GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are testing the code that they recommend, the results they suggest may not work or make sense.
The AI tooling does not necessarily know the latest versions of frameworks or libraries, so it may suggest code that is out of date.
Your prompt is the most important part of a successful output from the AI tools. Experiment by asking questions in different ways, and researching how others are getting results.
Non-English language prompts won’t always get the best results, as the majority of public repositories used are in English.
The best practice with any AI tool is to treat AI generated content just like you’d treat code from any public source that you did not create yourself. This means thoroughly testing for functionality and performance and ensuring there aren’t security vulnerabilities or maliciously generated code.

By Vikram R Singh, Founder and CEO, Antier
Blockchain and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are two disruptive technologies that can truly revolutionise businesses and various professional domains across the globe. The convergence of these technologies holds immense potential in creating secure, intelligent and adaptive systems even as they are together fuelling the demand for skilled professionals and consultancies in the tech landscape. To get a nuanced perspective, we need to understand what these technologies are and how they work and complement each other.
Understanding generative AI and blockchain
Generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on creating new content or data that is not present in the original input. Powered by deep neural networks like variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transformers, generative AI models learn from vast amounts of data and generate new outputs based on probabilistic models. Generative AI can be gainfully applied in content creation, data augmentation and driving innovation.
Blockchain, on the other hand, is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Having revolutionised domains like finance, supply chain and identity management by offering transparency, efficiency, and enhanced security, it stores data in blocks linked by cryptographic hashes and validated through consensus mechanisms.
Complementing each other’s strengths
The integration of blockchain and generative AI unlocks numerous benefits. Blockchain technology provides control and transparency to AI models by creating an audit trail of all AI model management activities. This integration enhances accountability, governance and trust. Additionally, blockchain improves generative AI by enhancing the quality of training data, ensuring diverse and representative inputs. It strengthens cybersecurity to provide robust and efficient systems for secure transactions.
Real-world examples show the way
One notable example of how blockchain and generative AI work together is Doppl, a platform that leverages both technologies to create realistic digital avatars. Doppl utilises generative AI to create natural language interfaces that interact with users through chatbots or voice assistants. Blockchain ensures the security and privacy of user data and transactions, preventing unauthorised access or manipulation. This integration showcases the potential of these technologies in delivering personalised services while maintaining security.
Benefits, challenges and future prospects
The integration of blockchain and generative AI brings efficiency, productivity and enhanced customer experience. Smart contracts automate transactions, saving time and resources. Tailored content and recommendations based on individual preferences foster engagement and loyalty. Furthermore, this integration fuels innovation and creativity, enabling the development of new products and business models.
However, challenges like technical complexity, scalability and human impact must be addressed. The demand for skilled professionals with expertise in blockchain and generative AI is growing rapidly, creating a talent gap in the market. This gap provides opportunities for consultancies to guide businesses in adopting these technologies and addressing associated challenges.
Personalised content creation, decentralised innovation, and ethical AI development are some future scenarios enabled by the integration of these technologies. Exploring these possibilities will unlock new avenues for personalisation, collaboration and responsible use of AI technologies.
Fuelling hiring expectations
The demand for blockchain and Web3 skills is growing rapidly due to the integration of AI into the tech landscape. This surge in demand is favoring specialists with niche skillsets, like data scientists, developers, cybersecurity engineers, and blockchain developers. However, the supply of talent with these skills is limited, which has created a talent gap in the market. According to a report by KPMG, 67% of CEOs face a challenge in sourcing talent with specialised skills in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. Moreover, the rapid evolution of these technologies requires constant upskilling and reskilling of existing talent.
Consultancies can pitch in here by helping businesses negotiate their digital transformation journey with backup support on strategy, design, implementation, testing, maintenance, change management, stakeholder engagement and regulatory compliance.
Enormous potential, possibilities galore
The integration of blockchain and generative AI is still in its infancy, but it has already shown promising results. As these technologies mature and evolve, we can expect to see more use cases and applications across various industries.
There are several potential future scenarios that can arise from the integration of blockchain and generative AI. Personalised content creation is one such scenario, enabling users to generate their own personalised content or data based on their needs. This may include creating digital avatars, music, videos, or texts through generative AI models that are stored securely on the blockchain.
Furthermore, the integration of these technologies can contribute to the advancement of ethical and responsible AI systems. Blockchain technology provides transparency, accountability and governance, which are crucial for ensuring the ethical development and use of AI. Users can track and audit the activities and outputs of generative AI models that are recorded on the blockchain, thus promoting responsible practices.
To sum it up, blockchain and generative AI are reshaping industries and driving hiring expectations. Their convergence creates systems that are secure, intelligent and adaptive. Businesses and society can benefit from increased efficiency, productivity, enhanced customer experience and innovation. However, challenges must be navigated and consultancies can play a crucial role in guiding businesses through this transformative journey. By harnessing the power of blockchain and generative AI, we can unlock new possibilities and shape a technology-driven future.

FNB is running an Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy programme aimed at equipping its workforce with skills and competencies they need to be able to use for the new world of work. The programme also equips employees to critically assess AI tools, understand their context and embedded principles, and question their design and implementation. This includes understanding the basics of what AI is, how it works, and what the strengths and limitations of the technologies are.
Financial institutions like FNB have had to reimagine ways of working and ways of engaging with their customers. We’ve had to rapidly scale up online channels used to engage customers. We’ve also had to accelerate digital transformation initiatives and embrace automation to meet complex customer needs and to drive digital operational efficiency.




We’re in the midst of an era in which emerging technologies are becoming commonplace, and ever more capable, shaking up numerous industries in the process. One of these technologies is AI, which enables computers to perform the sorts of tasks generally thought to require human intelligence, and which can “learn” and adapt, and financial services are going to be as affected by it as any other industry.
Our new reality is AI-driven, and FNB’s workforce should feel excited rather than threatened. Because instead of presenting an existential threat, AI is poised to help the Bank scale up digital channels, meet more of our customers’ evolving needs, and drive efficiency for less complex work which AI can often automate. Where AI can’t automate a task, it can often nonetheless augment people’s ability to complete it. That frees up employees to do more creative work better suited to their expertise and helps increase effectiveness throughout the organisation.
AI isn’t new, but the rate at which its changing industries is ramping up exponentially. McKinsey expects the AI industry for banking will become a trillion-dollar one in coming years. A third of that value is anticipated to come from advanced AI functions — predominantly in the risk space — with the other two-thirds stemming from traditional AI and analytics used by marketing, sales, risk, and human resource (HR) divisions.
A UBS Evidence Lab report shows that 80% of banks like ours are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI, and by the end of 2023, the aggregate potential cost savings for banks from Al applications is estimated at $447 billion.
While FNB continues to steer the data literacy programme to enable the organisation to “speak data”, it’s also necessary to empower our people with AI skills by ensuring a base level of AI literacy. AI helps employees become more competent by deepening their knowledge of the work they do and helps reduce the time spent doing menial tasks.
This AI literacy programme covers — among other topics — the history of AI and its potential for financial services, why organisations need an AI strategy, current AI trends and tools, aligning AI strategies with business goals, and how to use AI tools to improve your effectiveness.
It also covers how frontline staff can identify and assess the possibilities for AI in the organisation, how to justify your use of AI to top management, regulators, and their staff with performance-based evidence, and how to align AI with strategic business goals. By the end of the programme, they will understand AI use cases, how to assess and prioritise AI opportunities, how to master responsible AI principles, and the factors to consider when building or enhancing an AI infrastructure to support AI applications.
They will also understand how to create a suitable data strategy to support the organisational AI strategy, what the pre-requisites for mitigating AI failures are, and how decision intelligence connects AI, data, actions, and value creation.
This AI literacy programme will equip FNB employees with skills (e.g., how to leverage AI, data informed decision making etc.) needed to use AI technologies and applications as tools, and reimagine ways of working and ways of engaging with customers.
This programme will also enable FNB to build further and scale its AI capabilities, drive collaborative engagement, and position FNB as a leading force that is leveraging AI to continue driving the contextual banking value proposition through scaling up digital channels (e.g. AI bots, digital payment advisors and risk detection mechanisms lead to higher quality of services to a wider customer base), use AI to customize financial products and services by adding personalized features for customers, and improve customer experience by understanding and meeting their evolving needs.
Through this programme FNB will be able to accelerate the use of AI to keep up with complex, evolving, and emerging risks (including climate, cyber, financial crimes, and the like) and drive efficiency for work which AI can often automate allowing FNB to leverage human and machine capabilities optimally to drive operational and cost efficiencies and deliver personalized services.

Public call for government regulation of generative AI at work

                            1 June 2023                        








New polling by leading tech trade union Prospect has found that workers overwhelmingly believe government should set rules around the use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) to protect jobs, with 58% of workers supporting regulation.

58% of workers say the Government should set rules around the use of generative AI at work, according to polling in May 2023 by Prospect and Opinium
Just 12% of workers thought that the government should not interfere in the implementation of generative AI, believing that the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs.
Workers also reported a low level of confidence that they would be consulted by their employer on the introduction of new technology at work, with 45% believing they would not be involved in such decisions.
The polling also found workers are deeply uncomfortable with surveillance at work and the use of software to make automated hiring and promotion decisions.
Workers are deeply uncomfortable with surveillance at work and the use of software to make automated hiring and promotion decisions
71% of workers would be uncomfortable with their employer using wearable tracking devices to monitor where they were, with only 15% being comfortable with the use of such technology.
Use of cameras to monitor hybrid and remotes workers in their homes was similarly unpopular, with 69% of those polled being uncomfortable with this kind of surveillance, and just 14% comfortable with it.
Keystroke monitoring – assessing how often and quickly workers were using their keyboard at home – made 59% of workers feel uncomfortable, compared to 22% who would be content with its introduction.
Removing human oversight of crucial HR decisions was also unpopular. Only 17% of workers would be comfortable with decisions about who to hire and who to promote being made by algorithms rather than a person, compared to 62% who would be uncomfortable.
Mike Clancy, General Secretary of Prospect union, said: 
“With AI and tech already transforming how people work, governance and regulation has lagged behind despite strong public support for setting rules to prevent its abuse.
“Advances in technology have the potential to bring huge benefits to both employers and workers, but without government setting out clear rules, sinister surveillance and software supervisors could become the norm.
“As the way we work changes, workers should join a union to ensure they have a strong voice fighting for a future of work that is fair.”

Fears about AI and its impact on jobs have been exacerbated by all of the layoffs. At the precipice of any major industrial shift, fear is always attached to the impact on humans and the workforce. That fear is usually valid for a transitional period, as we recalibrate and as new jobs arise. It is important to be adaptable and learn what the new wave of jobs may look like.


Technological advances are inevitable. We can’t stop the momentum, but we can potentially slow it down with regulations and the thoughtfulness of how we balance technology adoption and job preservation. With the speed of innovation and disruption, we need to pause to make sure we are in control of how tech impacts society. It is important to reflect on what our core values; taking into consideration both how we treat people, as well as how we stay competitive in a global market.

Industry disruption from technical advancements has been happening since the beginning of time. At the precipice of any major shift, there is always a fear attached to the impact on humans and the workforce. In Rania Hoteit’s Future of Work Article, she gave the example that Queen Elisabeth denied a patent for an automated knitting machine because of the fear that automating knitting would reduce employment to the point of starvation. Factories still adopted the machine and by the end of the 19th century, there were four times as many factory weavers as there had been in 1830.

PROMOTED
With the Industrial Revolution, Britain feared that people would be replaced by machines and left permanently jobless. To date, these fears have been mostly wrong. However, in the short-term people were impacted. Those who were adaptable and quick to learn new technologies found themselves in better positions than others during transitional industry revolutions. To give some perspective to how fast the job market can change, A MIT study found that 60% of employment in 2018 was in roles that didn’t exist in 1940. With any industrial change new jobs arise. That is not to say that this wave of change will fit the pattern, but it is certainly worth considering.

Certainly, the integration of AI has not been without its challenges and negative impacts. One of the most significant concerns surrounding AI is the potential for job displacement, particularly in industries that rely heavily on repetitive or routine tasks that can be automated. As AI and machine learning become more sophisticated and capable of performing more complex tasks, there is a risk that more jobs will become obsolete, potentially leading to unemployment and economic disruption. There is no denying that technology is moving faster than ever before and there is the risk if humans can keep up with the technological evolution.

It is predicted by Goldman Sachs that 300 million jobs could be impacted. Although these numbers are alarming, the study showed that most jobs are only partially exposed to automation and have the possibility of being complementary and increasing workplace productivity. The most at-risk industries are “administrative support” estimated at 46% and “legal” estimated at 44%. The least at-risk roles will be within manual labor and hands-on jobs. The timeline of these estimates is unclear, but potentially within ten years.

As AI continues to advance and become more integrated into various industries, there have been many new job opportunities and other benefits resulting from its adoption. We will see that more mundane tasks will be delegated to AI and that humans will be needed for refining, quality checks, and more creative aspects of jobs. Jobs such as machine learning engineer, AI legal and ethics, data scientist, and AI researcher, require specialized skills and knowledge and are in high demand as more companies seek to develop and implement AI-driven solutions.

The question is how fast can people adapt to fill these roles. Having a core understanding of your innate abilities and how you can transfer your skills will be key to quick adaptability. Our society needs a workforce strategy that integrates AI and keeps jobs through modification of the roles. A combination of new job creation, reskilling programs, and AI-human collaboration would ensure a dynamic workforce, with humans and AI working together to maximize productivity and innovation.
Several experts believe that creatives will be less vulnerable to the forces of technology. The nonlinear, messiness of human emotion and thoughts that are conveyed through different artistic mediums very much exhibit uniquely human qualities. The biggest mistakes can at times end up being the best masterpieces. However, AI is also penetrating the creative space with applications such as image generators DALL-E 2. These applications won’t necessarily put talented creatives out of work, but more so will support humans to do the work they already perform with greater efficiency. There is the risk that a smaller group of established artists could dominate the market and leave less well-known artists with a smaller market share. On the other side of possibilities more artists will have access to technology and the global market to enhance their ability to sell and could even the playing field.
Jack Ma thinks that people will only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week, within the next 30 years…but getting there might be painful.
While the potential for job displacement is certainly a cause for concern, there are also potential solutions to address this issue. One such solution is the idea of universal basic income (UBI), which is a guaranteed income provided to every citizen regardless of their employment status. Proponents of UBI argue that it could serve as a safety net for workers who are displaced by automation and AI, allowing them to meet their basic needs while they seek new employment or pursue education and training opportunities. While UBI is still a controversial idea, there is growing interest and support for exploring it as a potential solution to job displacement caused by AI. It's important to note, however, that UBI is not a silver bullet and there are still many questions and challenges that need to be addressed in implementing such a system. One of the important pieces to UBI is making sure that people connect to their passion and purpose to live meaningful and engaged lives.
Legal and governmental policies will be important factors to mediate and integrate AI into many aspects of our society, including the workforce. We will need a much more robust set of policy responses to make sure that workers can adapt, so that the benefits of automation are broadly shared. In a more balanced future, AI technology would coexist with humans, enhancing our capabilities and improving our lives, while carefully managing risks and challenges to ensure a fair and inclusive society.
According to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report, 85 million jobs will be replaced by machines with AI by the year 2025. The same report states that 97 million new jobs will be created by 2025 due to AI. There is not an industry that may not be impacted in beneficial and/or detremential ways. Below is a list of potential replaceable tasks among some industries and a list of new jobs sparked from AI.

This article is part of WorkLife’s artificial intelligence special edition, which breaks through the hype around AI – both traditional and generative – and examines what its role will be in the future of work, for desk-based workers. More from the series →
Whether it’s fake photos of explosions that go viral, endless calls for regulation, or competitive product announcements from big tech companies, artificial intelligence is dominating the headlines on a daily basis. 
The disruptive role AI and automation will have in our future working lives has long been debated. But when the generative AI tool ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, burst into the mainstream at the end of 2022, it accelerated and compounded our deepest underlying fear about the tech: that AI will usurp our jobs. 
But beyond the hype, the reality is very different. It’s true that the generative AI genie is well and truly out of the bottle: it will transform the ways workers interact with each other and their employers or clients. But it won’t decimate all jobs. Rather, it will evolve them, and in some cases could even create more jobs. 
So what’s what? What should we worry about and what is mere hype? We have taken some of the most common AI misconceptions that have created a sense of panic and debunked them in the below myth buster. 
Myth: AI will take over my job. 

AI-driven anxiety is reaching new heights, with a third of workers worried about being replaced by tech in the next three years. Couple this with rapid AI advancements and Goldman Sachs’ claims that the latest wave of AI innovation could affect 300 million jobs, and this anxiety isn’t surprising. 
However, this is a concern experts want to alleviate.
There are some kinds of work – the mundane, repetitive, time-consuming kind – that are crying out for more automation. Determining where and how AI can best be used to free up human employees’ time so they can focus on other tasks that are, for example, more creative and require a human thinker, will give businesses a competitive edge, experts say. 

That’s why leaders are actually encouraging their employees to use AI to boost their productivity. In fact, some employers are even paying for ChatGPT Plus subscriptions for their employees to free up their time to do deeper work instead. 
While some people are worried that using AI will make their role redundant, it’s often not the case. Progressive business leaders see it as an opportunity for their employees to shift the kind of work they do, making them more efficient. 
Plus, the tech itself isn’t ready. Just check out what happened when a New York lawyer over-relied on ChatGPT for background research to help win his case in court. The chatbot actually made up fake legal cases, which the lawyer then used in court, landing himself in major hot water. 
Ultimately, it’s the harmony between humans and AI that matters the most.
“We have a belief that the AI’s job should be a copilot or companion,” said Scott Litman, founder and COO of Lucy, an AI-powered answer engine. “The individual needs to stay on the wheel. If an individual operates alone without the AI, or the AI operates alone without the individual, there is a huge missing piece. But the two together become very powerful.”







            “The individual needs to stay on the wheel. If an individual operates alone without the AI, or the AI operates alone without the individual, there is a huge missing piece. But the two together become very powerful.”

Lupe Colangelo, interim head of talent placements at technical and business education and career provider General Assembly, said that she’s seen tech candidates embrace the emergence of AI as they enter the workforce. 
“Like any technology, there can always be a fear of being replaced, but like any other technology that comes into play, it helps automate things but it’s not going to fully replace,” said Colangelo. “There is still so much space for the humans working on these tools to remain there and own the digital transformation.”
She anticipates more jobs emerging in the AI space, beyond prompt engineers, including AI trainers, AI ethicists, and machine managers. 
Myth: Companies are only using AI to cut costs. 
It’s true that using AI can help reduce some costs in the workplace. For example, it can automate routine tasks and allow that employee to work on something else that might have a higher return on investment. However, it’s certainly not the only reason companies are taking advantage of it. Some experts believe that if companies aren’t capitalizing on AI they could fall behind entirely. 
Litman said that the use cases for AI will depend on the business.
“In any given vertical application, there are going to be questions like what is the impact, is someone trying to save time, are they trying to increase capacity, are they trying to decrease wait times or increase customer satisfaction?,” said Litman. “It’s going to vary business to business and use case to use case.”
Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion, an automation solutions company for Fortune 500 enterprises, banks, insurance, and financial services, said that implementing this technology now can help companies set themselves apart from competitors, given it is still on the newer side.
“You’re always looking at keeping a competitive advantage in the marketplace,” said Famularo. “Adopting new technologies has always been a way to help set yourself up to be different in the marketplace and be more efficient and effective.”
Myth: AI and machine learning are the same thing. 
While the spotlight on AI over the past six months has been intensive, what experts refer to as “traditional” AI (focuses on detecting patterns, making decisions, honing analytics, classifying data and detecting fraud) has been rumbling along under the surface for years, with many businesses having adopted it for several years. As has machine learning, which is a type of AI. But the two terms are often used interchangeably, just like traditional AI and generative AI (produces new content, chat responses, designs, synthetic data or deep fakes, like ChatGPT, DALL-E) are. 
It can get confusing fast. (check out WorkLife’s AI glossary to help sort through the new AI lingo.)
Machine learning is a subset of AI which focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves training machines to recognize patterns and make better decisions. For example, ChatGPT uses machine learning techniques to understand and generate human-like language. But the terms should not be used interchangeably. 
“AI is really the broad category of machine intelligence,” said Litman. “Machine learning is a subset of how you train AI.”
Myth: AI won’t impact my sector. 
When it comes to AI, sticking your head in the sand entirely will backfire. Robots have long been associated with automating more manual, repetitive jobs, typically in blue-collar industries like manufacturing and logistics. For example, Amazon uses AI to handle millions of items in its warehouses. 
But it’s now having a significant impact in a wide range of industries, including corporate, desk-based jobs like financial services, where Morgan Stanley has a new OpenAI-powered chatbot. Meanwhile, management consultancy PwC will invest $1 billion to expand AI capabilities within its organization, to automate parts of its tax, audit and consulting services, and upskill its employees. 
“When email was first allowed at our jobs we could only email certain times of the day and then it was shut down because they didn’t want us to lose productivity,” said Famularo. “But if you think about what email and the internet has brought to our lives, it’s huge. It’s the same thing with AI. We’re all going to use it.”







            “Companies do need to take the time to think about ‘what is our AI strategy and direction,’ and make sure they put together what their plan is for adopting the technology.”        


 

                Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.            







Famularo believes the disruption AI causes will be mostly positive and it should be viewed as a technology that can help people do their jobs better.
“It’s where a marketing person will be able to do their job better than they were able to do it before, or a legal executive can write legal documents faster than they were able to do before,” said Famularo. “Each role and function will have their own twist on how they will use AI to make themselves more effective. I don’t see any industry not being impacted by it.”
Myth: Companies using AI don’t care about me. 
This somewhat common sentiment isn’t helped by some senior leaders’ public statements around how they plan to deploy AI. For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s comments to Bloomberg that he’ll use AI to slash IBM’s workforce, aren’t going to appease any anxiety around the topic. But they’re the exception rather than the norm. Most CEOs have been circumspect about how they plan to use AI to enhance their workforce’s capabilities, like PwC’s plan to upskill its workers to be proficient users of AI.
And one might argue that a company encouraging you to use AI cares about you even more than a company that doesn’t. For example, using AI allows employees to have more time to focus on deep work that they might not have had time for before if their calendar was filled with time-consuming tasks that could have been automated. Best case scenario, that could leave employees feeling more satisfied with their day-to-day work, free up mental strain and even potentially stave off future burnout.
That’s of course if the employer then doesn’t demand a significantly higher output of work every day from that employee, causing additional stress. 
In short, companies will largely use AI to improve the efficiency and productivity of workforces and the experience of their customers. But that doesn’t mean that the company doesn’t care about their workers. “There is constant disruption in the workplace with new tools,” added Litman. 
Myth: AI can be completely objective. 
If we take ChatGPT for example, there are a number of ways in which it is not totally objective. It can often hallucinate, like other AI-powered language processing tools. That means it can give an output that seems entirely right, but is actually inaccurate. It means that people using these sorts of tools need to be mindful of fact checking and verifying the answers given.
“One of the things we think is really critical is how important it is that it can cite the evidence of where the machine created the answer from so we can verify it’s truthful and accurate,” said Litman. 
AI systems may also hold bias if the training data used to develop the system contained biases or inaccuracies. We’ve already seen the fallout of when this happens, including Amazon’s recruitment system that automatically rejected CVs from women applicants, Google’s photo app which labeled a picture of a Black couple as “gorillas” and the racial disparities in the accuracy of facial detection systems exposed by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru.
These cases have highlighted the importance of responsible, ethical AI that doesn’t include bias or discrimination of any kind.
“People are concerned about the bias with generative AI, but the bias isn’t in the AI, it’s in the underlying data,” said Litman. “If the data is biased, the responses will be biased.”
Myth: My company doesn’t need an AI strategy.
If a company wants to be at the cutting edge of the future of work, experts say that an AI strategy should be a top priority if it’s not already in place. Currently, only 35% of businesses use AI, while 42% are considering implementing it in the near future, according to recent findings. 
“Companies do need to take the time to think about ‘what is our AI strategy and direction,’ and make sure they put together what their plan is for adopting the technology,” said Famularo.
He said that most of the current conversations are around where companies should place guardrails around the usage of AI to ensure that poor decisions aren’t made. It’s helpful for companies to share policies about how they should be using AI at work, he added. 
“You should think about how you’re going to enable your employees to use it without worry of compromise, and you should think about how you’re adopting new technologies to take on certain tasks,” said Famularo.
Colangelo agrees and stressed that being thoughtful about this digital transformation is critical. 
“It’s really important to make sure that we are keeping people first when it comes to your technology strategy,” said Colangelo. “Any company that is adopting AI, you want to make sure that you’re getting feedback from your employees to understand how it can make their roles more efficient, how it can be used to reskill or upskill, and how to invest in talent. My recommendation for organizations is to think long term.”

Share Generative AI to Become a $1.3 Trillion Market by 2032, Research Finds




								June 01, 2023							










Bloomberg Intelligence: New Report Finds That the Emerging Industry Could Grow at a CAGR of 42% Over the Next 10 Years
Rising demand for generative AI products could add about $280 billion of new software revenue
New York, June 01, 2023 — With the influx of consumer generative AI programs like Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022, according to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence (BI). Growth could expand at a CAGR of 42%, driven by training infrastructure in the near-term and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models (LLMs), digital ads, specialized software and services in the medium to long term, BI’s research finds.
Moreover, rising demand for generative AI products could add about $280 billion of new software revenue, driven by specialized assistants, new infrastructure products, and copilots that accelerate coding. Companies like Amazon WebServices, Microsoft, Google and Nvidia could be the biggest beneficiaries, as enterprises shift more workloads to the public cloud.
Fig1: Generative AI Revenue

BI estimates that generative AI is poised to expand its impact from less than 1% of total IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming market spending to 10% by 2032. The largest drivers of incremental revenue will be generative AI infrastructure as a service ($247 billion by 2032) used for training LLMs, followed by digital ads driven by the technology ($192 billion) and specialized generative AI assistant software ($89 billion). On the hardware side of this, revenue will be driven by AI servers ($132 billion), AI storage ($93 billion), computer vision AI products ($61 billion) and conversational AI devices ($108 billion).
Fig2: Generative AI Market Opportunity

Of particular note is the potential for generative AI to benefit life sciences and education, with BI’s analysis finding that early use cases of ChatGPT suggest that these are two areas that could see rapid growth from their position as a fraction of larger software segments today. The potential for specialized AI-based software assistants may be particularly transformative for search and other means of summarizing information that drive these two market segments.
Fig3: Generative AI Life Sciences, Education Spending

Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the report said, “The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spending, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.
This technology will not be a solely positive development for all players in the space, as this rapid growth opportunity for generative AI across technology may displace a number of incumbents across that vendors set to benefit from generative AI; including semiconductors, hardware, cloud software, IT services and ad companies.
The full 2023 Generative AI Growth report, including a series of reports focused on the individual market segments, is available to Bloomberg Terminal subscribers who can access the report via {BI}.

ChatGPT is a dialogue-based AI technology that provides textual responses to users’ natural language queries through an online chatbot interface. Although the technology is not new and varying degrees of AI have been present in our existing technologies for decades, AI research firm OpenAI made ChatGPT freely available for public use in late 2022 (and in March 2023 released a paid version powered by the improved algorithm GPT-4), showing the world the vast potential of state-of-the-art AI.ChatGPT does not actually understand human conversation. Rather, it is powered by a large language model (LLM). LLMs are trained on enormous quantities of text (many trillions of words), spanning a variety of sources, to assign probabilities to word sequences, enabling the technology to predict text. After the model is equipped with this ability, humans pose questions to the model and rank its responses to teach the model the difference between accurate and acceptable responses and inaccurate and improper responses (such as hate speech).LLMs are only as good as the data and training they receive. While the publicly accessible version of ChatGPT is impressive, its responses are often incorrect and unreliable, particularly when it comes to answering legal questions. However, the model continues to learn. Open AI has other, more powerful commercial offerings, and many competitive products are in development and rapidly emerging. In fact, AI-generated content is not limited to text. Other AI-generative technologies on the market are capable of creating images, music, and even video.The public release of ChatGPT has sparked an inflection point for AI technology, prompting companies and their officers to ask many different legal questions concerning the technology’s use. Unfortunately, the answers are few and far between, because courts are only now being asked to apply existing law to these new technologies.Practical Law The JournalRegister for FREE to continue readingFree and easy registration gives you unlimited access to Practical Law The Journal.RegisterAlready have an account?

Nearly half of people – 48 per cent – believe it is likely that humans will one day lose control of AI systems by surpassing human capabilities and start to act against human interests. Around a third of people think this scenario is unlikely.The poll findings were published ahead of Rishi Sunak’s visit to Washington this week, where he will urge President Biden to back a new system of global regulation to protect against potential threats from advanced AI, including national security and livelihoods.As i revealed last month, the Prime Minister is considering a new body for AI based on the International Atomic Energy Agency, which regulates nuclear material.Last week, more than 350 experts from the sector warned the human race faces an existential threat from the technology if it is not regulated properly.The BMG poll for i shows that 55 per cent think more jobs will be lost to AI than created by it, despite leading figures in the AI sector highlighting the opportunities from the technology.A quarter of people think their current type of work will be performed by robots or  other AI machines in 20 years’ time, while 47 per cent think it will still be conducted mainly by humans.A third of people think that it is likely that AI will be able to replicate human-like consciousness and feel emotions akin to human beings.Nearly a third of people are concerned that advances in AI will lead to a loss of human interaction, and a similar proportion think it will lead to a loss of human control. A quarter think it will fuel hacking and other security breaches, while 19 per cent fear increases in privacy breaches and data misuse.Just 12 per cent are concerned about a lack of proper laws and regulations to govern AI technology, while 10 per cent are worried that increasing reliance on AI will fuel bias and discrimination.The public are equally divided about recent advances in AI, with a net of 33 per cent seeing them as positive, 30 per cent negative and 31 per cent taking a neutral stance.More than half, or 52 per cent, of 18 to 24-year-olds view recent advances as positive, while just 15 per cent are negative about the rapid progress in the technology.Read NextPoliticsRishi Sunak to press Joe Biden for UK lead on international rules for artificial intelligenceRead MoreLess than  a third of people say they have used the ChatGPT chatbot or a similar AI-assisted language application, while 65 per cent have not yet used one. Of those who have tried it, 76 per cent found it useful, while 23 per cent said it was not useful.Robert Struthers, head of polling for BMG, said: “While there is growing public fascination with AI’s capabilities and potential benefits, there is also a lingering sense of unease. “Launched only six months ago, around 3 in 10 Britons already use chat GPT or similar technologies. And for those that did, the experience  has been positive; as many as three-quarters say they found the technology useful.“However, with almost as many feeling negatively about advancements in AI as feeling positive about it, some have reservations. Yes, people recognise AI’s potential to improve efficiency and simplify tasks but also harbour concerns about its consequences.”
AI ‘a major national risk’ says UK terror watchdog
Britain’s terrorism watchdog has warned that artificial intelligence pose a major national security risk.
Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said the technology could be used by extremists to groom vulnerable individuals.
He cited a potential risk around the increasing popularity of chatbots, which he suggested could  be used to persuade vulnerable people to launch terror attacks, and that the technology needed to be designed with this in mind.
Mr Hall told The Observer that AI creators had to abandon their “tech utopian” mindset, adding: “They need to have some horrible little 15-year-old neo-Nazi in the room with them, working out what they might do. You’ve got to hardwire the defences against what you know people will do with it.
“What worries me is the suggestibility of humans when immersed in this world. Use of language, in the context of national security, matters because ultimately language persuades  people to do things.”
He called for greater transparency from AI firms who were operating chat bots. He added: “We need absolute clarity about how many people are working on these things and their moderation.
“How many are actually involved when they say they’ve got guardrails in place? …If you’ve got a two-man company, how much time are they devoting to public safety? Probably little or nothing.”
The security services are also concerned about the misuse of AI chatbots for terrorism purposes, particularly among the young, the newspaper reported.

            Avery Ingram (AI), reportedly the UK's first AI employee and the world's first AI software developer, is now available for hire. 
        

Avery is an autonomous AI tool developed by software company February to assist existing software development teams by making their tasks easier, checking code and clearing any backlogs. 
Avery has been fully personified as an employee with a ChatGPT generated CV, an AI-drawn portrait and even a LinkedIn account.

She is available for hire by software development companies and is able to follow a traditional recruitment process. 
Speaking to HR magazine, February CEO Ash Lewis said: “We have a technical interview process, just like with a regular human employee.  
“Avery currently is completing four of these technical interviews per day and there are 2,000 businesses on our waiting list.” 
The bot’s contract is similar to an employment contract too and includes notice periods. 
She has already been appointed to generative AI software support roles as a senior full-stack developer in the development teams at Graze, Propello Cloud, Fabspot and Encode Health, and is currently working on 180 projects. 
Avery’s efficiency is unmatched by her human counterparts as she can handle more than 20 tickets a day compared with three for humans. 
Companies pay the equivalent of Living Wage to use Avery. 
The speed at which she works means that she can deliver the equivalent of a week’s work of a human for 10% of the cost. 
However, Lewis said that Avery does not create concerns for the job security of human employees. 
He said: “We've created Avery to work alongside a team of humans, and our clients so far are reporting that their work is more satisfying and they're having to deal with fewer repetitive tasks now that they're aided by an AI team member.” 
Lewis argued that AI tools should be viewed as a way to improve current roles by limiting repetitive tasks. 
He added: “Ultimately it's likely that with companies becoming so much more efficient thanks to AI tools and human employees will eventually be able to focus on more creative and less repetitive work.” 
Cassandra Hoermann, head of employer brand and experience at HR software company Personio, said AI will never replace human capabilities entirely. 
Speaking to HR magazine, she said: “It’s clear AI has a role to play in the workplace going forward and it is certainly a topic that’s generating a lot of debate and headlines.  
“But, while AI employees are a novel idea, they’re unlikely to take over the workforce soon. There is simply too much that humans can do that AI still can’t.  
“An organisation’s people are still, and likely always will be, its most important asset.” 
However, Simon Jones, founder of HR consultancy Ariadne Associates, said AI innovation is likely to result in some redundancies. 
In March, investment banking firm Goldman Sachs predicted 300 million jobs will be lost or degraded by AI. 
Speaking to HR magazine, Jones said: “In a sense, it’s not dissimilar to the situation in the 1980s/90s when a lot of factory jobs that could be done faster by robots disappeared. AI might also lead to justifiable and legal redundancies in certain areas. 
“But whether a task is undertaken by AI or a human, businesses will still need to maintain existing standards such as liability for decisions, meeting legal requirements, or expectations of ethical behaviour.” 
According to a survey from trade union Prospect released this week, the majority (58%) of people would like to see the UK government regulate the use of generative AI technologies in the workplace to help safeguard jobs. 
With the stakes around AI so high, Gosia Adamczyk, director of HR at 'advertising technology company Verve Group, said HR should prioritise communication when rolling out new AI systems. 
Speaking to HR magazine, she said: “What HR should continue doing is build an understanding among employees that AI helps them become more efficient, allowing them to focus on more strategic topics.  
“Employees usually value automation and are glad to see investments that take the burden of repetitive tasks.  
“HR professionals must focus the narrative on this approach and ensure communication is concise.”

(Taylor Glascock for The Washington Post)By  Pranshu Verma and Gerrit De VynckJune 2, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDTWhen ChatGPT came out last November, Olivia Lipkin, a 25-year-old copywriter in San Francisco, didn’t think too much about it. Then articles about how to use the chatbot on the job began appearing on internal Slack groups at the tech start-up where she worked as the company’s only writer.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeOver the next few months, Lipkin’s assignments dwindled. Managers began referring to her as “Olivia/ChatGPT” on Slack. In April, she was let go without explanation, but when she found managers writing about how using ChatGPT was cheaper than paying a writer, the reason for her layoff seemed clear.“Whenever people brought up ChatGPT, I felt insecure and anxious that it would replace me,” she said. “Now I actually had proof that it was true, that those anxieties were warranted and now I was actually out of a job because of AI.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSkip to end of carouselUnderstanding AIarrow leftarrow rightWhat is artificial intelligence?AI is an umbrella term for any form of technology that can perform “intelligent” tasks. For decades, AI has been mostly used for analysis — trawling huge sets of data to find patterns. But a boom in generative AI, which uses this pattern-matching to create words, images and sounds, has opened up new possibilities.What is generative AI?The technology backs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators, such as Dall-E, which can create words, sounds, images and video, sometimes at a level of sophistication that mimics human creativity. This technology can’t “think” like humans do; it can find patterns and imitate speech, but it can’t interpret meanings.How does AI learn?AI can “learn” without programmer to tell it each step, a process called machine learning. It uses neural networks, mathematical systems modeled after the human brain, to find connections in huge data sets. The poems or images it makes may seem creative, but it’s really pattern matching based on which word is most likely to come next.Is AI dangerous?The boom in generative AI brings many exciting possibilities — but also concerns that it might cause harm. Chatbots can sometimes spread misinformation or “hallucinate” by producing information that sounds plausible, but is irrelevant, nonsensical or entirely false. It can be used to make fake images of real people, called deepfakes.1/4End of carouselSome economists predict artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT could replace hundreds of millions of jobs, in a cataclysmic reorganization of the workforce mirroring the industrial revolution.💻Follow TechnologyFollowFor some workers, this impact is already here. Those who write marketing and social media content are in the first wave of people being replaced with tools such as chatbots, which are seemingly able to produce plausible alternatives to their work.Experts say that even advanced AI doesn’t match the writing skills of a human: It lacks personal voice and style, and it often churns out wrong, nonsensical or biased answers. But for many companies, the cost-cutting is worth a drop in quality.“We’re really in a crisis point,” said Sarah T. Roberts, an associate professor at the University of California in Los Angeles specializing in digital labor. “[AI] is coming for the jobs that were supposed to be automation-proof.”See why AI like ChatGPT has gotten so good, so fastArtificial intelligence has rapidly increased in quality over the past year, giving rise to chatbots that can hold fluid conversations, write songs and produce computer code. In a rush to mainstream the technology, Silicon Valley companies are pushing these products to millions of users and — for now — often offering them free.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI and algorithms have been a part of the working world for decades. For years, consumer-product companies, grocery stores and warehouse logistics firms have used predictive algorithms and robots with AI-fueled vision systems to help make business decisions, automate some rote tasks and manage inventory. Industrial plants and factories have been dominated by robots for much of the 20th century, and countless office tasks have been replaced by software.But the recent wave of generative artificial intelligence — which uses complex algorithms trained on billions of words and images from the open internet to produce text, images and audio — has the potential for a new stage of disruption. The technology’s ability to churn out human-sounding prose puts highly paid knowledge workers in the crosshairs for replacement, experts said.Reporter Danielle Abril tests columnist Geoffrey A.

(Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)“In every previous automation threat, the automation was about automating the hard, dirty, repetitive jobs,” said Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “This time, the automation threat is aimed squarely at the highest-earning, most creative jobs that … require the most educational background.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn March, Goldman Sachs predicted that 18 percent of work worldwide could be automated by AI, with white-collar workers such as lawyers at more risk than those in trades such as construction or maintenance. “Occupations for which a significant share of workers’ time is spent outdoors or performing physical labor cannot be automated by AI,” the report said.The White House also sounded the alarm, saying in a December report that “AI has the potential to automate ‘nonroutine’ tasks, exposing large new swaths of the workforce to potential disruption.”ChatGPT ""hallucinates."" Some researchers worry it isn’t fixable.But Mollick said it’s too early to gauge how disruptive AI will be to the workforce. He noted that jobs such as copywriting, document translation and transcription, and paralegal work are particularly at risk, because they include tasks that are easily done by chatbots. High-level legal analysis, creative writing or art may not be as easily replaceable, he said, because humans still outperform AI in those areas.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Think of AI as generally acting as a high-end intern,” he said. “Jobs that are mostly designed as entry-level jobs to break you into a field where you do something kind of useful, but it’s also sort of a steppingstone to the next level — those are the kinds of jobs under threat.”Eric Fein ran his content-writing business for 10 years, charging $60 an hour to write everything from 150-word descriptions of bath mats to website copy for cannabis companies. The 34-year-old from Bloomingdale, Ill., built a steady business with 10 ongoing contracts, which made up half of his annual income and provided a comfortable life for his wife and 2-year-old son.But in March, Fein received a note from his largest client: His services would no longer be needed because the company would be transitioning to ChatGPT. One by one, Fein’s nine other contracts were canceled for the same reason. His entire copywriting business was gone nearly overnight.“It wiped me out,” Fein said. He urged his clients to reconsider, warning that ChatGPT couldn’t write content with his level of creativity, technical precision and originality. He said his clients understood that, but they told him it was far cheaper to use ChatGPT than to pay him his hourly wage.Fein was rehired by one of his clients, who wasn’t pleased with ChatGPT’s work. But it isn’t enough to sustain him and his family, who have a little over six months of financial runway before they run out of money.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementNow, Fein has decided to pursue a job that AI can’t do, and he has enrolled in courses to become an HVAC technician. Next year, he plans to train to become a plumber.“A trade is more future-proof,” he said.The debate over whether AI will destroy us is dividing Silicon ValleyCompanies that replaced workers with chatbots have faced high-profile stumbles. When the technology news site CNET used artificial intelligence to write articles, the results were riddled with errors and resulted in lengthy corrections. A lawyer who relied on ChatGPT for a legal brief cited numerous fictitious cases. And the National Eating Disorders Association, which laid off people staffing its helpline and reportedly replaced them with a chatbot, suspended its use of the technology after it doled out insensitive and harmful advice.Story continues below advertisementRoberts said that chatbots can produce costly errors and that companies rushing to incorporate ChatGPT into operations are “jumping the gun.” Because they work by predicting the most statistically likely word in a sentence, they churn out average content by design. That provides companies with a tough decision, she said: quality vs. cost.Advertisement“We have to ask: Is a facsimile good enough? Is imitation good enough? Is that all we care about?” she said. “We’re going to lower the measure of quality, and to what end? So the company owners and shareholders can take a bigger piece of the pie?”Lipkin, the copywriter who discovered she’d been replaced by ChatGPT, is reconsidering office work altogether. She initially got into content marketing so that she could support herself while she pursued her own creative writing. But she found the job burned her out and made it hard to write for herself. Now, she’s starting a job as a dog walker.“I’m totally taking a break from the office world,” Lipkin said. “People are looking for the cheapest solution, and that’s not a person — that’s a robot.”Share2483 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

A new survey conducted by Salesforce and YouGov has found that marketers see generative AI as a “game-changer” that can save them about five hours of work every week — that’s more than a month every year, assuming eight-hour work days.
As part of their Generative AI Snapshot series, the companies polled more than 1,000 full-time marketers in the United States, UK and Australia in May. The results show most marketers are bullish on the technology, with many already using it in their workflow.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
However, even as a majority of marketers see generative AI as transformative to their role, many have also raised concerns about the quality and accuracy of generative AI outputs and the lack of skills needed to get the most out of these tools.
Nearly 75% say ‘yes’ to generative AI
Out of the 1,029 full-time marketers surveyed, 51% said they are already in the process of using or experimenting with generative AI at work, while 22% said they plan to bring it into their workforce very soon. The general benefits, most of them said, would be eliminating gruntwork, allowing more time to focus on strategic work and increasing productivity.
Among those using generative AI at present, the most popular use case is basic content creation and writing marketing copy, with as many as 76% handling those tasks with LLM-driven apps like ChatGPT. The next popular use cases are inspiring creative thinking (71%), analyzing market data (63%) and generating image assets (62%). 
More broadly, the surveyed marketers suggested that generative AI is expected to help with multiple tasks in their job, starting from creating groups for marketing campaigns and producing those campaigns and journey plans, and progressing to personalizing content, conducting copy testing, and building and optimizing SEO strategy.
“Generative AI has the potential to transform how marketers connect with their customers by powering more personalized, automated and effective campaigns — quickly and at scale,” Stephen Hammond, EVP and GM for marketing cloud at Salesforce, said in a statement.
It can also help with analyzing campaign performance data, 58% of the respondents said.
Yet concerns remain
While the general consensus remained that generative AI is or will be transforming marketing hustles, the survey respondents also highlighted certain roadblocks that can easily hinder the technology’s adoption in their field.

The top concernsadvertisement
The biggest challenge, the marketers said, is the accuracy and quality of generative AI tools’ output, with 73% noting that the technology lacks human-specific creativity and contextual knowledge and 66% worrying that its results can be biased. Beyond this, many suggested they feel underprepared to make the most of the technology in their workflows.
Forty-three percent of respondents said they don’t know how to get the most value out of generative AI, while more than a third said they do not know how to use the technology safely (39%) and effectively (34%). This highlights a major gap that can often lead to data leak blunders, much like what happened at Samsung.
To address these problems and successfully use generative AI in their roles, the marketers called for three key improvements: human oversight (66%), the use of trusted customer data for the models (63%), and adequate training (54%) to leverage the said models in the workflow.
The human oversight and trusted data will ensure on-point, use case-specific outputs, while training will ensure marketers are getting maximum value from the tools without compromising on security or efficiency.

Used responsibly, he believes it could free us from drudgery and help businesses of all shapes and sizes raise their game. Thousands of Sage customers are already benefiting from using AI services, and the tech giant aims to become a leader in this fast growing space. “We must see AI as something that can elevate the work of every human,’’ he said.  “Every single customer I speak to tells me how difficult it can be to hire staff, particularly to do repetitive tasks. ""People want to add value right from the start of their careers,’’ he said. “The birth rate is declining and you have an aging population. I see a big opportunity for AI to transform lots of repetitive tasks and make us all more productive. It will allow us to elevate the work of craftsmen who have real skills. What's important is that we retain the ability to question what is presented to us by AI. It's important that we as humans make the final decisions.” Mr Hare believes his grounded approach to corporate life can be traced back to his childhood in Withernsea, the seaside resort in the East Riding of Yorkshire. “I have travelled around the world but I believe my Yorkshire background keeps my feet on the ground,’’ he said. “In Yorkshire, it's important to be humble and knuckle down and get things done."" This fierce work ethic helped Mr Hare become one of the FTSE 100’s youngest ever chief financial officers. He took on leading financial  roles at three other listed UK companies before moving on to  a senior operational role in private equity. He believes his experience as an accountant gives him the edge as Sage's CEO. He  wants technology to be the  servant of accountants and entrepreneurs who must keep their eye on the balance sheet.  The company he leads, Sage, was started by businessman David Goldman, with support from a team of Newcastle University students, in the early 1980s. It now reaches millions of customers across 21 countries. It employs  3,200 staff across the UK and Ireland with around  2,000 of these based in the global HQ in Cobalt in Newcastle. Mr Hare believes businesses must embrace the digital revolution.    ""Digital does remove friction,’’ he said. “ I was chatting to an electrician recently and I explained to him that if, for example, he uses an app on his phone bills could potentially be paid in hours, instead of a paper-based process where it could all go on for weeks. ""The Government is pushing towards getting more and more transactions done digitally. Artificial intelligence could make payment flow seamless, so it frees up SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)  to run their business. Time is the most precious thing for small businesses and our mission is to knock down barriers and get rid of friction. The Government can help by treating investment in technology like an investment in capital and infrastructure.” There have been long-standing concerns about the need to boost the UK’s productivity. “The best way to tackle this is to make the UK the best place to set up and run a business and technology can play a leading role in this,’’ said Mr Hare.   ""Technology, for example, can help retailers do a much better job of cash flow forecasting. A lot of businesses still do their accounts manually.   With technology, you don't need to write up your books, you can capture each transaction as it happens. ""The same process can apply to payroll. If people have a mobile workforce and expenses all these things can be brought into a digital environment.  "" Instead of handing your accountant a shoebox of invoices, technology can remove friction from the process and people can make much better decisions. It's important to be very thoughtful about all your stakeholders.  Small and medium-sized businesses are integrated into the local community and it's really important to be seen to embrace them.”  Since the launch of its apprenticeship scheme in 2012, Sage has taken on around 400 apprentices and Mr Hare believes the UK needs to be  more supportive of young people from a wide variety of backgrounds who have chosen a different path to going to university. Last year, Sage invested £1.4m in developing the skills of young people across the North of England by  working with the Institute of Engineering and Technology, the Newcastle United Foundation and the National Innovation Centre for Data. Sage’s investment is also focused on rethinking the role of education, particularly around the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects. Investment in STEM can drive long-term economic growth, while helping young people into sustainable careers, according to Sage.   ""One of the worst problems facing Britain is digital inequality,’’ said Mr Hare. “We should aspire to everyone having access to superfast broadband. Between six and seven per cent of the population don't have access to superfast broadband, that's around 2m people. ""We wouldn't tolerate 2m people not having access to adequate healthcare. Although we are a commercial business, first and foremost, we believe that everyone thrives when we create greater equality and inclusion. It can be easier to set up a business than people think. People often overestimate how much access to capital they need to get started. You can often get a business started for as little as £1,000. You can start start small and experiment initially. People often talk about the lack of UK technology success stories. We are very much a sustainable, global UK success story, with 40 per cent of our revenue in the US. We take great pride in that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x7df8zp,https://schema.org/ItemListOrderDescending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ChatGPT Revolution | CBS Reports 











The ChatGPT Revolution | CBS Reports
22:38

For those wondering when AI will start replacing human jobs, the answer is it already has.Artificial intelligence contributed to nearly 4,000 job losses last month, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, as interest in the rapidly evolving technology's ability to perform advanced organizational tasks and lighten workloads has intensified. The report released Thursday by the outplacement firm shows that layoff announcements from U.S.-based employers reached more than 80,000 in May — a 20% jump from the prior month and nearly four times the level for the same month last year. Of those cuts, AI was responsible for 3,900, or roughly 5% of all jobs lost, making it the seventh-highest contributor to employment losses in May cited by employers. 






The job cuts come as businesses waste no time adopting advanced AI technology to automate a range of tasks — including creative work, such as writing, as well as administrative and clerical work. The AI industry is expected to grow to more than $1 trillion fueled by major technological advancements that became apparent last fall with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT bot, a report by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts shows. These jobs are most likely to be replaced by chatbots like ChatGPTChatGPT bot passes law school examThis is the first time AI was included on the Challenger report, but not the first time the rapidly advancing technology has made headlines for replacing humans.


ChatGPT enters the newsroomThe Washington Post reported this week on two copywriters who lost their livelihoods because employers (or clients) decided that ChatGPT could perform the job at a cheaper price. Media companies such as CNET have already laid off reporters while using AI to write articles, which later had to be corrected for plagiarism. Earlier this year, an eating disorder helpline used a chatbot to replace human staff members who had unionized. It recently had to pull the plug on the bot after it gave people problematic dieting advice.In March, investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted in a report that AI could eventually replace 300 million full-time jobs globally and affect nearly one-fifth of employment — with a particular hit to white-collar jobs often considered automation-proof, such as administrative and legal professions.AI is also a concern in the TV and entertainment writers' strike that began in May, with writers demanding better pay and job security in addition to a near-total ban on the use of AI to produce written entertainment content.But analysts note that as with previous technology that has replaced human workers, generative AI is already creating new jobs, and the burgeoning industry is just getting started.


""Generative AI is expected to become a monster employment generator because of estimates of a mushrooming $1.3 trillion AI market that will boost sales and ad spending for the Tech industry,"" Ben Emons, a principal at NewEdge Wealth, said Friday in a note.

Transparency in AI refers to the ability to peer into the workings of an AI model and understand how it reaches its decisions. There are many facets of AI transparency, including the set of tools and practices used to understand the model, the data it is trained on, the process of categorizing the types and frequency of errors and biases, and the ways of communicating these issues to developers and users.







The multiple facets of AI transparency have come to the forefront as machine learning models have evolved. A big concern is that more powerful or efficient models are harder -- if not impossible -- to understand since the inner workings are buried in a so-called black box.
""Basically, humans find it hard to trust a black box -- and understandably so,"" said Donncha Carroll, partner and chief data scientist at business transformation advisory firm Lotis Blue Consulting. ""AI has a spotty record on delivering unbiased decisions or outputs.""

What is AI transparency?
Like any data-driven tool, AI algorithms depend on the quality of data used to train the AI model. Therefore, they are subject to bias or have some inherent risk associated with their use. Transparency is therefore essential to securing trust from the user, influencers or those influenced by the decision.

""AI transparency is about clearly explaining the reasoning behind the output, making the decision-making process accessible and comprehensible,"" said Adnan Masood, chief AI architect at UST, a digital transformation consultancy. ""At the end of the day, it's about eliminating the black box mystery of AI and providing insight into the how and why of AI decision-making.""
Trust, auditability, compliance and understanding potential biases are some of the fundamental reasons why transparency is becoming a requirement in the field of AI. ""Without transparency, we risk creating AI systems that could inadvertently perpetuate harmful biases, make inscrutable decisions or even lead to undesirable outcomes in high-risk applications,"" Masood said.


Working with explainability and interpretability
AI transparency works hand in hand with related concepts like AI explainability and interpretability, but they are not the same.
AI transparency helps ensure that all stakeholders can clearly understand the workings of an AI system, including how it makes decisions and processes data. ""Having this clarity is what builds trust in AI, particularly in high-risk applications,"" Masood said.
By contrast, explainability focuses on providing understandable reasons for the decisions made by an AI system. Interpretability refers to the predictability of a model's outputs based on its inputs. So, while explainability and interpretability are crucial in achieving AI transparency, they alone don't wholly encompass it.
AI transparency also involves being open about data handling, the model's limitations, potential biases and the context of its usage.
Ilana Golbin Blumenfeld, responsible AI lead at PwC, noted that process transparency and data and system transparency can complement interpretability and explainability.
Process transparency entails providing documentation and logging of significant decisions made throughout the development and implementation of a system. And it includes the structure of governance and testing practices.
Data and system transparency entails communicating to users or relevant parties that an AI or automated system will use their data. It also alerts users when they directly engage with an AI like a chatbot.








Why is AI transparency needed?
AI transparency, as noted, is vital to fostering trust between AI systems and users. Manojkumar Parmar, CEO and CTO at AIShield, an AI security platform, said some of the top benefits of AI transparency include the following:

Builds trust with customers and employees.
Ensures fair and ethical AI systems.
Detects and addresses potential data biases.
Enhances the accuracy and performance of AI systems.
Ensures compliance with new AI regulations like the EU AI Act.



Tradeoffs of black box AI
AI is typically measured in percentages of accuracy -- i.e., to what degree the system gives correct answers. Depending on the task at hand, the minimum accuracy required might vary, but accuracy, even if it is 99%, cannot be the only measure of AI's value. Organizations must also account for a major shortcoming of AI, especially when applying AI in business: An AI model with near-perfect accuracy can be problematic. As the accuracy of the model goes up, AI's ability to explain why it arrived at a certain answer goes down, raising an issue companies must confront: the lack of AI transparency of the model and, therefore, our human capacity to trust its results.
The black box problem was acceptable to some degree in the early days of AI technology, but lost its merit when algorithmic bias was spotted. For example, AI that was developed to sort resumes disqualified people for certain jobs based on their race, and AI used in banking disqualified loan applicants based on their gender. The data the AI was trained on was not balanced to include sufficient data of all kinds of people, and the historical bias that lived in the human decisions was passed to the models.
A near-perfect AI model can still make alarming mistakes, such as classifying a stop sign as a speed limit sign.
While these are some of the more extreme cases of misclassification -- and include some purposely designed adversarial inputs to fool the AI model -- they still underline the fact that the algorithm has no clue or understanding of what it is doing. AI follows a pattern to arrive at the answer, and the magic is that it does so exceptionally well, beyond human power. For the same reason, unusual alterations in the pattern make the model vulnerable, and that's why AI transparency is needed -- to know how AI reaches a conclusion.
When using AI for critical decisions, understanding the algorithm's reasoning is imperative. An AI model designed to detect cancer, even if it is only 1% wrong, could threaten a life. In cases like these, AI and humans need to work together, and the task becomes much easier when the AI model can explain how it reached a certain decision. Transparency in AI makes it a team player.
Sometimes, transparency is necessary from a legal perspective.
""Some of the regulated industries, like banks, have model explainability as a necessary step to get compliance and legal approval before the model can go into production,"" said Piyanka Jain, president and CEO at data science consultancy Aryng.
Other cases involve GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act, where AI deals with private information. ""An aspect of GDPR is that, when an algorithm using an individual's private data makes a decision, the human has the right to ask for the reasons behind that decision,"" said Carolina Bessega, innovation lead, Office of the CTO at Extreme Networks.


Weaknesses of AI transparency
As it seems evident that AI transparency has many benefits, why aren't all algorithms transparent? Because AI has the following fundamental weaknesses:

Vulnerable to hacking. Transparent AI models are more susceptible to hacks, as threat actors have more information on their inner workings and can locate vulnerabilities. To mitigate these challenges, developers must build their AI models with security top of mind and test their systems.
Can expose proprietary algorithms. Another concern with AI transparency is protection of proprietary algorithms, as researchers have demonstrated that entire algorithms can be stolen simply by looking at their explanations.
Difficult to design. Lastly, transparent algorithms are harder to design, in particular for complex models with millions of parameters. In cases where transparency in AI is a must, it might be necessary to use less sophisticated algorithms.
Governance challenges. Another fundamental weakness is assuming any transparency method out of the box will satisfy all needs from a governance perspective, Blumenfeld cautioned. ""We need to consider what we require for our systems to be trusted, in context, and then design systems with transparency mechanisms to do so,"" she explained. For example, it's tempting to focus on technical methods of transparency to enforce interpretability and explainability. But these models might still rely on users to identify biased and inaccurate information. If an AI chatbot cites a source, it's still up to the human to determine whether the source is valid. This takes time and energy and leaves room for error.
Lack of standardized methods to assess transparency. Another issue is that not all transparency methods are reliable. They may generate different results each time they are performed. This lack of reliability and repeatability might reduce trust in the system and hinder transparency efforts.


As AI models continuously learn and adapt to new data, they must be monitored and evaluated to maintain transparency and ensure that AI systems remain trustworthy and aligned with intended outcomes.



AI transparency can bring companies many benefits, but it is hard to achieve -- and there are tradeoffs.







How to reach a balance
As with any other computer program, AI needs optimization. To do that, we look at the specific needs of a problem and then tune our general model to fit those needs best.
When implementing AI, an organization must pay attention to the following four factors:

Legal needs. If the work requires explainability from a legal and regulatory perspective, there may be no choice but to provide transparency. To reach that, an organization might have to resort to simpler but explainable algorithms.
Severity. If the AI is used in life-critical missions, transparency is a must. It is most likely that such tasks are not dependent on AI alone, so having a reasoning mechanism improves teamwork with human operators. The same applies if AI affects someone's life, such as algorithms used for job applications. On the other hand, if the AI task is not critical, an opaque model would suffice. Consider an algorithm that recommends the next prospect to contact come from a database of thousands of leads -- cross-checking the AI's decision would simply not be worth the time.
Exposure. Depending on who has access to the AI model, an organization might want to protect the algorithm from unwanted reach. Explainability can be good even in the cybersecurity space if it helps experts reach a better conclusion. But if outsiders can gain access to the same source and understand how the algorithm works, it might be better to go with opaque models.
Data set. No matter the circumstances, an organization must always strive to have a diverse and balanced data set, preferably from as many sources as possible. AI is only as smart as the data it is trained on. By cleaning the training data, removing noise and balancing the inputs, we can help to reduce bias and improve the model's accuracy.



Best practices for implementing AI transparency
Implementing AI transparency -- including finding a balance between competing organizational aims -- requires ongoing collaboration and learning between leaders and employees. It calls for a clear understanding of the requirements of a system from a business, user and technical point of view. Blumenfeld said that by providing training to boost AI literacy, organizations can prepare employees to actively contribute to identifying flawed responses or behaviors in AI systems.
The tendency in AI development is to focus on features, utility and novelty, rather than safety, reliability, robustness and potential harm, Masood said. He recommends prioritizing transparency from the inception of the AI project. It's helpful to create datasheets for data sets and model cards for models, implement rigorous auditing mechanisms and continuously study the potential harm of models.


Key use cases for AI transparency
AI transparency has many facets, so teams must identify and examine each of the potential issues standing in the way of transparency. Parmar finds it helpful to consider the following use cases:

Data transparency. This encompasses understanding the data feeding AI systems, a crucial step in identifying potential biases.
Development transparency. This involves illuminating the conditions and processes in AI model creation.
Model transparency. This reveals how AI systems function, possibly by explaining decision-making processes or by making the algorithms open source.
Security transparency. This assesses the AI system's security during development and deployment.
Impact transparency. This evaluates the effect of AI systems, which is achieved by tracking system usage and monitoring results.



The future of AI transparency
AI transparency is a work in progress as the industry discovers new problems and better processes to mitigate them.
""As artificial intelligence adoption and innovation continues its surge, we'll see greater AI transparency, especially in the enterprise,"" Blumenfeld predicted. But the approaches to AI transparency will vary depending on the needs of a given industry or organization.
Carroll predicts that insurance premiums in domains where AI risk is material could also shape the adoption of AI transparency efforts. These will be based on an organization's overall system risk and evidence that best practices have been applied in model deployment.
Masood believes regulatory frameworks likely will play a vital role in the adoption of AI transparency. For example, the EU AI Act highlights transparency as a critical aspect. This is indicative of the shift toward more transparency in AI systems to build trust, facilitate accountability and ensure responsible deployment.
""For professionals like myself, and the overall industry in general, the journey toward full AI transparency is a challenging one, with its share of obstacles and complications,"" Masood said. ""However, through the collective efforts of practitioners, researchers, policymakers and society at large, I'm optimistic that we can overcome these challenges and build AI systems that are not just powerful, but also responsible, accountable and, most importantly, trustworthy.""

‘The last frontier of disruption’: With its new AI chatbot, EY teams seek to take the pain out of payroll questions

An employee in Hungary asked if having twins would impact his parental leave. A worker in Spain wondered whether the bonus of $20,000 euros she received would be taxed. Another employee asked what requirements he would have to abide by if he went to work in a United Arab Emirates country as a foreign national.
Those queries, received by clients of multinational professional services organization EY, underscore the complexity organizations worldwide face in trying to answer employees’ payroll questions. To address that challenge, the EY organization (previously named Ernst & Young) worked with Microsoft to create a generative AI chatbot that will be developed to answer payroll questions from employees across the 159 countries and 49 languages that EY clients encompass.
The chatbot, which leverages the Microsoft Cloud and ChatGPT in Azure OpenAI Service, uses a large language model (LLM) that analyzes information from pay slips, tax regulations and employer policies to provide answers to complex payroll questions — with the goal of increasing employee satisfaction and reducing costs for employers.
Sheri Sullivan.
“Payroll touches employees more than any other function,” says Sheri Sullivan, EY global payroll operate leader. “Employees around the globe currently have a very poor experience when it comes to getting answers to their payroll questions. And employers struggle with that.”
Research has shown that employee attraction and retention are directly proportional to workers’ experiences on the job, Sullivan says. And pay is central to that, she says — not only the amount, but also employees’ perception that they are being paid fairly and understand payroll policies.
Payroll issues are complicated by myriad factors ranging from tax regulations that vary between countries and even local municipalities to employer policies and individual circumstances. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those complexities, Sullivan says, with the growth of remote work and its resulting impacts on payroll. 
Organizations have traditionally handled payroll queries in several ways — through a designated individual, basic chatbots that can usually handle only rudimentary questions, traditional call centers, or in some cases, not at all, Sullivan says. The result is often an inefficient and costly system that leads to frustration for employees, who may simply give up before getting answers to their questions.
“Payroll is really, I like to say, the last frontier of disruption,” Sullivan says. “There’s been lots of investment in human capital management systems and finance systems and other back systems. But with payroll, there’s been limited investment for the past 20 years, because the technology hasn’t had the capabilities to deal with all the deviations and complexities within payroll.”

That’s changing with the emergence of generative AI capabilities. EY teams have been working closely with Microsoft for several years to help EY’s clients implement cloud-based solutions across various sectors. Addressing payroll questions has long been a challenge for EY member firms, Sullivan says, and as Microsoft moved to make ChatGPT available in Azure OpenAI Service in March 2023, EY teams saw an opportunity to address the issue.
EY teams began developing a proof of concept for the organization’s chatbot, uploading data from a range of sources into the bot and asking its payroll consultants in various countries to share questions employees had recently asked, then using that information to train its model.
“That is really at the heart of our IP,” says Ken Priyadarshi, EY global tax prompt engineering leader. “It’s going inside the heads of our practitioners and asking, ‘What are some of the really interesting ways clients might ask payroll questions that require a little bit more reasoning and thinking?’”
Ken Priyadarshi.
Azure OpenAI Service allows customers to run the same models as OpenAI, but with Azure’s security protocols. That will enable EY teams to deploy the chatbot across countries and regulatory environments, Priyadarshi says.
“For us, the differentiator was not only security but also tooling to work in a user-friendly, fast way,” he says. “Our developers were able to use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service capabilities to build what I would call a private ChatGPT for payroll in collaboration with Microsoft very quickly.”
In internal testing, Sullivan says, the chatbot quickly answered questions in over 27 languages. EY teams are currently piloting the chatbot with clients to gauge employee satisfaction, cost to employers and the bot’s ability to accurately address questions in a single interaction. EY teams anticipate that the technology will be able to answer more than 80% of payroll questions and save employers over half the current costs of addressing those queries.
“There is interest from clients in the largest countries to be part of this pilot,” Sullivan says. “The interest is through the roof, because this is such a pain point for them.”
EY professionals and the organization’s clients are also excited when they see what the bot can do, Sullivan says. While some professionals are cautious about the technology or concerned about its possible impact on their jobs, she says the bot won’t replace them but instead free them up to review data, trends and outcomes, and make recommendations, “instead of doing the manual work to compile and process the data.”
Priyadarshi sees the promise of generative AI chatbots in what he terms “intelligent co-sourcing” — merging deep subject matter experience with large language models to provide information in a human, conversational way. 
“We can train an LLM using a practice’s knowledge, and then help surface deep insights, and also support knowledge discovery using bots and copilots,” he says. “And that’s, I think, the future of this capability, not just for payroll, but for all kinds of knowledge worker practices.”

The 15 Biggest Risks Of Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

AI does present some significant dangers — from job displacement to security and privacy concerns — and encouraging awareness of issues helps us engage in conversations about AI's legal, ethical, and societal implications.

Here are the biggest risks of artificial intelligence:

1. Lack of Transparency
PROMOTED
Lack of transparency in AI systems, particularly in deep learning models that can be complex and difficult to interpret, is a pressing issue. This opaqueness obscures the decision-making processes and underlying logic of these technologies.

When people can’t comprehend how an AI system arrives at its conclusions, it can lead to distrust and resistance to adopting these technologies.

3. Privacy Concerns
AI technologies often collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising issues related to data privacy and security. To mitigate privacy risks, we must advocate for strict data protection regulations and safe data handling practices.

4. Ethical Dilemmas
Instilling moral and ethical values in AI systems, especially in decision-making contexts with significant consequences, presents a considerable challenge. Researchers and developers must prioritize the ethical implications of AI technologies to avoid negative societal impacts.
5. Security Risks
As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated, the security risks associated with their use and the potential for misuse also increase. Hackers and malicious actors can harness the power of AI to develop more advanced cyberattacks, bypass security measures, and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
The rise of AI-driven autonomous weaponry also raises concerns about the dangers of rogue states or non-state actors using this technology — especially when we consider the potential loss of human control in critical decision-making processes. To mitigate these security risks, governments and organizations need to develop best practices for secure AI development and deployment and foster international cooperation to establish global norms and regulations that protect against AI security threats.
6. Concentration of Power
The risk of AI development being dominated by a small number of large corporations and governments could exacerbate inequality and limit diversity in AI applications. Encouraging decentralized and collaborative AI development is key to avoiding a concentration of power.
7. Dependence on AI
Overreliance on AI systems may lead to a loss of creativity, critical thinking skills, and human intuition. Striking a balance between AI-assisted decision-making and human input is vital to preserving our cognitive abilities.
8. Job Displacement
AI-driven automation has the potential to lead to job losses across various industries, particularly for low-skilled workers (although there is evidence that AI and other emerging technologies will create more jobs than it eliminates).
As AI technologies continue to develop and become more efficient, the workforce must adapt and acquire new skills to remain relevant in the changing landscape. This is especially true for lower-skilled workers in the current labor force.
9. Economic Inequality
AI has the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionally benefiting wealthy individuals and corporations. As we talked about above, job losses due to AI-driven automation are more likely to affect low-skilled workers, leading to a growing income gap and reduced opportunities for social mobility.
The concentration of AI development and ownership within a small number of large corporations and governments can exacerbate this inequality as they accumulate wealth and power while smaller businesses struggle to compete. Policies and initiatives that promote economic equity—like reskilling programs, social safety nets, and inclusive AI development that ensures a more balanced distribution of opportunities — can help combat economic inequality.
10. Legal and Regulatory Challenges
It’s crucial to develop new legal frameworks and regulations to address the unique issues arising from AI technologies, including liability and intellectual property rights. Legal systems must evolve to keep pace with technological advancements and protect the rights of everyone.
11. AI Arms Race
The risk of countries engaging in an AI arms race could lead to the rapid development of AI technologies with potentially harmful consequences.
Recently, more than a thousand technology researchers and leaders, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, have urged intelligence labs to pause the development of advanced AI systems. The letter states that AI tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.”
In the letter, the leaders said:
""Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an 'AI summer' in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt.""
12. Loss of Human Connection
Increasing reliance on AI-driven communication and interactions could lead to diminished empathy, social skills, and human connections. To preserve the essence of our social nature, we must strive to maintain a balance between technology and human interaction.
13. Misinformation and Manipulation
AI-generated content, such as deepfakes, contributes to the spread of false information and the manipulation of public opinion. Efforts to detect and combat AI-generated misinformation are critical in preserving the integrity of information in the digital age.
In a Stanford University study on the most pressing dangers of AI, researchers said:
“AI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage.”
14. Unintended Consequences
AI systems, due to their complexity and lack of human oversight, might exhibit unexpected behaviors or make decisions with unforeseen consequences. This unpredictability can result in outcomes that negatively impact individuals, businesses, or society as a whole.
Robust testing, validation, and monitoring processes can help developers and researchers identify and fix these types of issues before they escalate.
15. Existential Risks
The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intelligence raises long-term concerns for humanity. The prospect of AGI could lead to unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences, as these advanced AI systems may not be aligned with human values or priorities.
To mitigate these risks, the AI research community needs to actively engage in safety research, collaborate on ethical guidelines, and promote transparency in AGI development. Ensuring that AGI serves the best interests of humanity and does not pose a threat to our existence is paramount.

AI and LLM (large language models - such as ChatGPT) will disrupt education in major ways and the educational industry is not prepared. Education systems are slow to adapt and full of bureaucracies. However, text-generating applications will forever shift education and innovation will be needed sooner than later to embrace this new era of learning. A survey of 1,000 U.S. college students found that nearly a third of them had used the AI chatbot ChatGPT to complete written homework assignments, and close to 60 percent use it on more than half of their work. This number will increase exponentially as students learn more about using this loophole for assignments in the coming months (not years) and educational institutes are not ready. There are websites that can check if automated written documents, such as ChatGPT, were used. However, there needs to be at least 1,000 words and the accuracy of detection is not fully reliable.


It is crucial for educational systems to integrate AI into teaching and learning, much like how the calculator was seamlessly incorporated into math classrooms. The calculator, once a revolutionary tool, is now a staple in classrooms, enhancing students' understanding and efficiency in mathematics. Similarly, AI must be viewed as an essential tool, vital for fostering a future-ready workforce, and used in the same way.

This week the U.S. Department of Education released insights and recommendations for Artificial Intelligence. The report spotlights the benefits of AI for education, such as assisting with language barriers in the classroom, as well as cautions such as algorithm discrimination. They also emphasize that AI will not replace teachers, but moreso enhance a teacher's ability to teach. Integrating AI into education can enrich the learning experience for students of all ages and help prepare them for the future job market. Here are some ways AI can be introduced at various age levels:

PROMOTED
Early Childhood Education:



AI-powered educational toys and games can help develop cognitive and motor skills.
AI-driven language learning tools can facilitate early language acquisition and pronunciation.
AI-based adaptive learning systems can provide personalized learning experiences that cater to individual needs and learning styles.


Elementary and Middle School Education:


AI can be used in teaching core subjects like math, science, and language arts through interactive learning platforms that adapt to students' progress and learning styles.
AI-driven virtual tutors can provide personalized feedback, guidance, and support, supplementing the efforts of human teachers.
AI can be employed to facilitate collaborative learning experiences, connecting students with diverse backgrounds and encouraging global citizenship.

High School Education:


AI can be used to develop more advanced learning tools for subjects like programming, data science, and robotics, inspiring students to explore STEM careers.
AI-driven analytics can help teachers identify students' strengths, weaknesses, and learning preferences, enabling targeted interventions and support.
This generation will have to become much more critical thinkers. Given that AI can generate essays, it may be that students should be evaluating the content that was created. This will be a crucial skill as there will be more and more misinformation generated by AI.

Insights from the BfDI on how to navigate Privacy Challenges in the Era of Generative AI 


The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, also known as BfDI (Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit), recently published an opinion on the topic of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a previous article, we discussed Generative AI, which refers to artificial intelligence applications capable of generating new content, rather than simply recognizing patterns. Examples of Generative AI applications include well-known chatbot ChatGPT and the image generator MidJourney, among others. While this technology is fascinating from a technological standpoint, it poses significant challenges in terms of regulation, particularly in the field of personal data protection.
In this article, we will discuss some key points raised by the Commissioner that we believe are most relevant from a data protection perspective.
Use of Generative AI in the workplace
Generative AI is gradually finding its way into everyday work applications such as word processors, code copilots, and search engines. This integration lowers the barrier for the use of Generative AI, making it increasingly commonplace. In this regard, employers have a responsibility to:

Always adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Avoid indiscriminate use of personal data when utilizing Generative AI, even if it simplifies work processes.
Only process personal data through Generative AI applications when there is a legal basis for such processing.

The Commissioner also emphasizes that employers have a duty to ensure that employees are trained and educated on these matters.
Children’s data
Children are particularly vulnerable in terms of their personal data processing since they often lack awareness of the risks and consequences involved and may struggle to exercise their data subject rights effectively. As a general rule, the personal data of minors should not be included as a training base for generative AI systems. It is the responsibility of developers to implement measures to ensure this, for example, by filtering training data to exclude minors‘ personal data.
Regarding the type of content children can access via generative AI applications, it could be beneficial to establish appropriate limits within the AI system, similar to how inappropriate content is handled through features like Safe Search, which is a Google Search feature that filters out potentially pornographic and offensive content. However, the BfDI mentions that imposing strict limits, such as mandatory identification requirements for use, should be avoided as it eliminates the possibility for users to keep their anonymity.
As the use of generative AI becomes the norm via its integration into everyday applications, the priority should be educating and raising awareness among minors about the risks, as well as the opportunities and potentials of the technology. Parents, guardians, and teachers must actively participate in this education process by teaching minors about the critical and responsible use of generative AI systems.
Image generators
Generative AI applications specialized in generating images pose a great risk from a data protection point of view since they can be used to generate deepfakes and spread false information about natural persons. Furthermore, images generated by AI can be very difficult to discern from real images, increasing the difficulty to correct misinformation. Even if the false images are stated as false post-facto, the correction rarely has as much range as the original lie, making it almost impossible to undo the damage.
While marking and recognition tools that signal when an image is an AI product may be implemented to address social problems, they are not a comprehensive solution, particularly in cases where generative AI is intentionally used for propaganda or reputation-damaging purposes and the creators have no intention of disclosing the means. Watermarks or digital signatures are also not an ideal solution since they can lead to privacy concerns. For example, in the case of whistleblowers who wish to maintain their anonymity, a digital signature may come as a hindrance.
The primary focus should be on educating and raising awareness among the population about these issues. Individuals must be motivated to engage with fact-checking mechanisms and always confirm sources of information. Organizational measures should also be considered, such as the labeling of AI-generated media, similar to how copyright attribution is practiced. Additionally, education and awareness initiatives are crucial in promoting the responsible use of AI-generated media and mitigating its negative effects.
Conclusion
The rapid advancement of generative AI technology has prompted public authorities worldwide to take notice and address its implications. The recently published opinion by the BfDI sheds light on the critical data protection considerations surrounding generative AI. As this technology becomes increasingly integrated into everyday applications, it is crucial to strike a balance between its potential benefits and the need to protect personal data. As we navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI, public awareness and comprehensive educational initiatives must remain at the forefront.

5 Workflow Generative AI Tools That Could Soon Help Make Your Job Easier








Poca Wander Stock/Shutterstock

By Tharindu Dias/June 3, 2023  2:32 pm EST


Generative AI has taken the world by storm, beginning with the boom in popularity sparked by ChatGPT. Since then, every company that could possibly integrate AI functionality into its product offering has done so – from Google to Adobe, generative AI tools have been flourishing.

When used correctly and responsibly, generative AI tools can shave minutes, if not hours, off your workflow, allowing you to devote your energy to refining its output or even working on entirely different projects altogether. It can also be a massive stress reliever, giving you some respite from crushing workloads and tight timelines.
However, with all of these options comes a lot of noise that will clutter your search for time-saving tips with unhelpful advice and pontification, making it that much more important to identify what can actually be useful. The sooner you get to know some of the best tools available and master them, the sooner you will see improvements in your workflow and output. With that in mind, we've identified five generative AI tools that could make your job a little bit easier.





GrammarlyGO






Grammarly



Even if you aren't already a Grammarly user you have likely heard of their service thanks to their ubiquitous YouTube ads. Grammarly goes over whatever you are writing on pretty much any platform, be it Gmail, LinkedIn, or even WhatsApp, and gives you suggestions on how to improve your writing. This can range from fixing spelling and grammar mistakes outright to suggesting changes in wording to improve tone and clarity. Either way, it takes your writing and does what it can to improve it.

However, Grammarly has introduced a new service that uses generative AI to go one step further and complete the most challenging part — the writing — for you. Dubbed GrammarlyGO, this service is available for Grammarly Free users in select countries (including the U.S.) and global users on Premium, Business, and Education accounts.
As an AI tool, GrammarlyGO shouldn't be used to automate all of your writing. Instead, it is more effective in helping to create first drafts, which you then review and rewrite if necessary. GrammarlyGO can also be tweaked to align with your preferences to create drafts, outlines, and email replies that are in the proper context and have the required level of formality. You can further tweak the style to match the platform you are writing for, as GrammarlyGO can be used in a host of platforms, including Gmail, LinkedIn, and Medium.





Canva Pro






Canva



Canva is already an incredibly powerful and well-regarded content creation platform known for democratizing basic graphic design with its easy-to-use templates and surprisingly-powerful image editing tools. The platform has now taken things a few steps further with the integration of several AI-powered tools that make creating compelling, high-quality images easier than ever before.

Accessible to Canva Pro users, all of the AI-powered tools in Canva Create have Magic in their name and provide users with a wide range of functions. Magic Design will take an image you upload and create a series of templates to match it, giving you a good jumping-off point for your next creation. Magic Design can also generate entire presentations, saving you hours that would have otherwise been spent on content and layouts that can now be handled by Canva itself.
However, if you can't get it just right and want to add or remove something from the image, Magic Edit will allow you to simply describe what you want to have added to your image and have it generated with text-to-image technology. In contrast, Magic Eraser will remove distracting elements from your image. Canva's AI tools aren't limited to images, though, with the inclusion of a text generator called Magic Write, which can give you a boost when coming up with image captions, blog outlines, and more.





Microsoft 365 Copilot

While Bing Chat may have gotten a lot of attention, it isn't the only Microsoft product that has had its functionality enhanced by the addition of AI. Microsoft 365 Copilot integrates AI across the Microsoft 365 suite, allowing it to pull information from multiple sources and significantly improve your productivity. 

Copilot can now be used for creative purposes in Word, Powerpoint, Outlook, Teams, and even Viva Engage. It can be used to write, edit and otherwise generate documents, reports, presentations, emails, questions, messages, and more. Furthermore, with its integration into Excel, Copilot can also be used as a powerful data analysis tool, giving you deep insights into your data in response to simply-worded questions, even generating models and visualizations as needed.
These implementations significantly increase the capabilities of each of the Microsoft 365 programs they have been added to. However, what really sets Copilot apart from many other implementations of generative AI is its ability to draw information from across Microsoft 365 and combine it for whatever you may require. This feature is called Business Chat and allows you to pull information from multiple sources, such as your email, calendar, and chats, all at once. You can have it generate updates, overviews, reports, and more so you can stay up to speed while keeping your team similarly informed.





Google Duet AI

Google Duet AI has two broad areas where it can improve workflows and productivity – Google Workspace and Google Cloud. The Google Cloud integration is significantly more specialized, as it mainly provides code assistance, answers technical questions, and helps users implement apps. Acting as another collaborator in your workflow, Duet AI greatly increases your capabilities within Google Cloud, regardless of your level of expertise.

When it comes to Google Workspace, the implementation of generative AI is far more widespread and accessible to a wide variety of users. With its addition to Docs and Gmail, Duet can generate text for whatever purposes you may have, be it drafting an email response or refining a document your team created. It can also be used to create responsive documents with smart chips for location and status information included from the get-go.
Meanwhile, Duet AI has been integrated into Slides with the primary goal of creating images from simple text descriptions, allowing even the least artistic of us put together stunning presentations. Duet serves an image-based purpose in Meet as well, where it can be used to generate unique backgrounds for video calls. Finally, it can be used to analyze, organize and utilize data entered into Sheets.

Chat by Copy.ai






Copy.ai



Copy.ai was already an AI-based copy-generation service built specifically for sales and marketing professionals. So rather than introducing a massive selection of new features and capabilities like other tech companies have, Copy.ai has used the integration of AI to allow users to interact with their platform with greater ease while also adding new functionality.

The biggest benefit Chat by Copy.ai offers users — beyond ease of interaction with existing features — is the ability to generate text, such as emails, using data that exists elsewhere online. For instance, it can be used to write an email to someone using data pulled from their LinkedIn profile to personalize the language therein.
Copy also has the ability to create briefs and outlines for online content based on data pulled from the results pages of search engines in real-time. This allows content created with SEO in mind to be as impactful and up-to-date as possible, as in addition to these briefs and outlines, it can also generate content with current data, unlike certain models provided by ChatGPT, which are limited to data that could be found online in 2021. It will also provide sources and citations for the information it gives you, so you can be confident that it hasn't just made up crucial information.

(ABC News: Chris Taylor)""The area of AI that we're looking at is more on the automation space at this stage,"" Ms Dixon said.The great productivity conPhoto shows a cafe worker serves customersAustralia's industrial relations system is like Catch-22. You can't have a pay rise until productivity improves. And productivity can't improve until you get a pay rise, writes business editor Ian Verrender.""We do have plans in the next six to 12 months to move more into the AI and the machine learning, but for now, we've just been looking at the automation, which has allowed us to save a significant number of hours.""She said the AI work had not led to any job cuts but it had allowed her team to use their time differently.""One of the tasks that we've created was preparing a quarterly report package for our clients,"" she explained.""Previously, that was prepared over two weeks, every quarter, by three or four staff members, that now gets run overnight, so in less than a day.""Then [the staff] are able to start reviewing it pretty much straight away, so it's freed them up quite considerably in that process.""This is the kind of change proponents of AI say will benefit workers, by allowing them to focus on other, more meaningful tasks.Automating simple tasks with AI is one way the technology can benefit workers. (Supplied: Unsplash)Jobs we haven't even heard ofGlobal investment firm Goldman Sachs predicts AI will improve the world's GDP by 7 per cent during the next 10 years, worth about $10 trillion.Goldman Sachs economist Joseph Briggs believes about two-thirds of existing occupations could be partially automated by AI.Goldman Sachs Research indicates a majority of jobs will be partially automated by AI.

(Supplied: Statista)Analysing data from IBM, it found three-quarters of companies worldwide were looking to adopt AI technologies into their workplaces in the next five years.China is world-leading when it comes to deploying AI, with about 60 per cent of IT professionals stating their organisations are actively implementing it.Australia is below the global average rate of adopting or looking into AI, but on par with the US and South Korea.China and India are leading the way for countries already using AI in business. (Supplied: Statista)Could AI lead to widespread job losses?A survey by Microsoft revealed almost half (46 per cent) of Australian workers were concerned AI could take over their jobs.But at the same time, 65 per cent of workers said they would willingly hand over some of their more menial tasks to AI.Microsoft's director of surface and modern work in Australia, Jane Mackarell, said the impact of AI on jobs would not be cut and dried.Jane Mackarell believes there will be a net benefit to using AI in the workplace. (ABC News: John Gunn)""I think it's twofold,"" she argued.""We've all got to acknowledge the fact that there will be roles that shift and morph, but there will be roles where you will be able to focus on what you're supposed to do and really enhance the creativity and innovation component.""The survey of more than 30,000 employers and employees globally, including 1,000 in Australia, found most bosses did not think AI would lead to widespread job cuts.Microsoft research suggests bosses believe AI will increase productivity more than it will reduce the number of employees they have. (Supplied: Microsoft)""Among both employees and employers there is a concern about the restructuring of certain roles, which, you know, let's face it, we see every time there's a major impact of technology, and this is a major impact,"" Ms Mackarell noted.""This is a game changer.""But we also saw that for the most part, employers, for example, in Australia were twice as much interested in AI for productivity gains, rather than reducing headcount.""So that, top of mind for an employer in Australia, is not necessarily how can I use this to sort of automate people's roles.""'We have a productivity problem in our economy'Australia's rate of productivity, what we produce for a given amount of hours worked, fell 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to March this year.A fall in productivity has a direct impact on the economic wellbeing of a country.""Declines in productivity growth result in a rise in unit labour costs, which is inflationary and negative for living standards in the long run,"" explained AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina in a recent note.The lower productivity growth is, the more expensive it is for businesses to pay employees for their work. ""We have a productivity problem in our economy,"" added Amit Singh, a partner at economics research firm, Mandala.""Ninety per cent of people work in the services sector. The Productivity Commission has said that that sector has lagged in productivity performance for over two decades.""Mr Singh's firm has modelled the top jobs it thinks are likely to be impacted by AI in Australia.Amit Singh says productivity in the services sector has been low for years.

(ABC News: Rachel Pupazzoni)You might already be speaking to AIThe typical role of people working in call, also known as contact, centres is set to be revolutionised by AI — and the change has already started.Speaking to a chatbot, instead of long wait times on the phone to speak to someone, is one method already favoured by some businesses and their customers.""Voice for now still remains the most important channel because it's the most natural way for people to communicate with each other,"" said Josh McAdam, the chief product officer at SecureCo, a company working to bridge the gap between chat and audio AI.Josh McAdam says AI is already being used in customer service roles. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)""But there are advantages to being able to move between channels. For example, you might be on the train, you can't talk, so you've started messaging with an organisation, when it's your turn to actually speak to them, you switch over and you start talking to them on the phone.""There are a lot of experiences like that, that start to be enabled, because AI can actually understand and help communicate across all of those different interaction mediums, rather than just being tied to one.""Australian cities are falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to productivity. Here's whyPhoto shows A picture of pedestrians walking over a bridge in MelbourneOne of the world's foremost experts on cities has warned Australia risks ""sleepwalking into a long-term loss of productivity""  but not everyone agrees.He added AI could also answer the phone when customers get in touch with contact centres, before handing customers on to a real person if they can not resolve a caller's query.""Rather than calling up and speaking to one of the old menus, which is press one for this, press two for that, that type of stuff, you're actually starting to interact with a bot that says 'Hey, welcome to X company, what can I help you with today?'"" Mr McAdam said.""That's one of the biggest things we're seeing increased adoption of, because with recent advances in AI, where it can now understand you better, it can sound more natural, when it speaks back to you, you may not even know it's a robot anymore.""Posted Sun 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pmSunday 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pmSun 4 Jun 2023 at 3:14pm, updated Sun 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmSunday 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmSun 4 Jun 2023 at 7:13pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBiden's legacy will extend beyond his one term in office.

OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, and Google and Microsoft launched their own AI tools Bard and Bing in February this year. The three AI tools have been the talk of the tech world ever since their inception and today, more and more companies are using AI to the best of their advantage. And in May, nearly 4,000 people lost their jobs to the emerging tech. 4,000 people lost jobs because of AIA Business Insider report originally attributed to a monthly report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas revealed that in May this year, around 4,000 people lost their jobs to artificial intelligence. The report added that in total, around 80,000 people were laid off of their jobs last month. From these, 3,900 job cuts were because of AI. The reasons behind other job cuts could be economic conditions, cost cutting, restructuring at the company, or mergers and acquisitions. The report also shared insights on total job cuts in 2023 till now. From January to May, around 4 lakh people lost their jobs. A spokesperson also told Insider that this was the first time that job cuts were being attributed to AI. The spokesperson added that all the layoffs were from the tech sector.ChatGPT replacing humans in the workplaceIn February this year, another survey conducted by job advice platform Resumebuilder.com revealed that some US-based companies had started deploying ChatGPT instead of human workers.1,000 business leaders participated in the survey and almost half of the US companies that participated said that they are using ChatGPT and that the chatbot has replaced workers at their companies.Resumebuilder, in a statement back then, said that business leaders were &#039;impressed&#039; by the viral chatbot&#039;s work. The company said, &quot;Overall, most business leaders are impressed by ChatGPT&rsquo;s work. Fifty-five percent say the quality of work produced by ChatGPT is excellent, while 34 percent say it&rsquo;s very good.&quot;A Business Today report quoted Resumebuilder.com&rsquo;s Chief Career Advisor Stacie Haller saying in a statement, &quot;There is a lot of excitement regarding the use of ChatGPT. Since this new technology is just ramping up in the workplace, workers surely need to be thinking of how it may affect the responsibilities of their current job. The results of this survey shows that employers are looking to streamline some job responsibilities using ChatGPT.&quot;Moreover, ChatGPT creator Sam Altman also said in an interview in March that one job that could be replaced by ChatGPT was customer service.

SALT LAKE CITY — Alan Fuller plugged in a request in an AI app.""I just did a simple query: Who are some of the key leaders in the state of Utah legislature?"" the state's head of technology services said in an interview with FOX 13 News. The response he got was certainly interesting.""It first brought up Governor Cox, which, although he is a state leader, he's not in the legislature, correct? Then it brought up Stuart Adams, good,"" he said, referring to the Utah State Senate President. ""Brad Wilson is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, good. But then it said Jennifer Seelig is the Minority Leader in the Utah House of Representatives. No, she's not."" That's when things got even more bizarre.

I can't find anyone named Don Ippolito... and if you take a close look at the picture? It has Bill Clinton in the picture. So a completely fictitious, made up answer.""It was an example Fuller used during a discussion on Friday about the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and opportunities to use it as well as potential risks. As FOX 13 News reported earlier this week, the Utah State Legislature has convened a special work group to look at AI and whether it needs regulation.On Friday, the Utah Policy Innovation Lab hosted a discussion among tech company CEOs and policymakers about AI. Many spoke about the benefits to productivity, education and how it can dramatically change the workforce.""Some people are predicting it cures cancer in the next 5-10 years using AI to help solve different forms of disease,"" said Matthew Poll, the CEO of GTF. ""I think cancer is definitely on the list. I also think from a geopolitical standpoint, this may be our saving grace.""Nick Pelikan, the CEO of Piste.AI, said he is already using it with some of his company's clients.""You can use a chatbot to personalize, especially these chatbots that are very human seeming, you can use that chatbot to personalize the customer experience to a point it’s indistinguishable for the person where it’s a person talking to them or a robot,"" he told the crowd.Pelikan noted a ""hype cycle"" right now surrounding AI, pointing out that the technology has been used for years now but what has changed is the quality of it and responses that are more ""human."" But others warned of risks for misinformation, ""deepfake"" hoaxes and an over-reliance on the technology with a lack of human oversight.""The machines are going to become a lot smarter and people are going to become a lot stupider,"" joked Barclay Burns, the CEO of GenerativeImpact.AI. Margaret Woolley Busse, the executive director of Utah's Department of Commerce, said AI could be helpful with support services. But she expressed concern about being unable to tell what is real and is created by an artificial intelligence.""If you don’t trust anything now because there’s so many things that are fake?

  The use of artificial intelligence for day-to-day tasks has increased rapidly over the last decade. The May 2023 CfM-CEPR survey asked the members of its European panel to predict the impact of AI on global economic growth and unemployment rates in high-income countries over the upcoming decade. Most panellists think that AI is likely to boost global growth to 4–6% per annum (relative to an average of 4% over the past few decades). Most of the panel also believes that AI is unlikely to affect employment rates in high-income countries, with the remainder split between predicting an increase and a decrease in unemployment rates. Notably, most panellists indicate a great degree of uncertainty regarding their predictions, because AI is still in its infancy.

Sarah O’Connor, Christopher Grimes and Cristina CriddleJune 18 202360Print this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.A revolution that will free workers from gruelling tasks or the destroyer of millions of jobs? New artificial intelligence capabilities have simultaneously prompted huge excitement around workplace productivity and dire warnings for employees. The Financial Times has selected three industries that are among the first to adopt the technology to analyse how it is being used in everyday work.Professional servicesAI tools enhanced so they are easy to access and can assist practical legal case work Biggest time savings on tasks assigned to junior staffAdoption has been swift but has limitations — it is not always correctRather than replacing jobs, AI could intensify work It has been a strange year for lawyers such as Alex Shandro and Karishma Brahmbhatt. All around them, economists, technologists and journalists have been making predictions about what new advances in AI might mean for professional workers. Headlines warning that “AI is coming for lawyers” have been everywhere. But Shandro and Brahmbhatt have a different vantage point — not from the top down but from the shop floor. As lawyers at Allen & Overy in London, they are already using the new generative AI tools in their everyday work. Roughly 3,500 employees at A&O have access to Harvey, an AI platform built on a version of OpenAI’s latest models, which have been enhanced for legal work. Shandro, a commercial intellectual property lawyer, says he used Harvey recently to prepare for a transaction that involved property rights in the metaverse. “So, what are the advertising regulations in the UK that might apply in augmented reality? I asked Harvey and got a really nice list. Before, I would have asked my trainee or a junior lawyer to go and find that out, and it would have taken that much longer.” Brahmbatt, too, says she and her juniors use the technology regularly — albeit with mixed results. “I actually asked it a question last night and it completely made up the cases,” she laughs. “If you approach it from the basis of, ‘I’m going to have to read through and check it all anyway’ then it’s useful. I don’t think it’s quite something you can just take and run with.”Alex Shandro and Karishma Brahmbhatt, lawyers at Allen & Overy, are already using the new generative AI tools in their work  David Wakeling, head of A&O’s markets innovation group, says the workforce has adopted Harvey fairly quickly since the law firm began trials in November, although it is not yet being used by everyone every day. “I checked last night — roughly 800 people used it in the last 24 hours, and they asked three to four questions each on average, in different languages and different practice groups,” he says. For Wakeling, one of the most important things is not to allow staff to believe the tool is more capable than it really is. “We say Harvey is like a very confident, very articulate 13-year-old. It doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. It has some fabulous knowledge, but incomplete knowledge. You wouldn’t trust a 13-year-old to do your tax return.” Rather than a black box with “magic” written on the lid, the law firm considers the technology “a boring productivity gain. We know it has issues, we know it makes errors, we know it will be out of date. But that’s OK, because we’re trying to save an hour or two a week across 3,500 people who have access today.”Across London, the young workforce at PwC (the average age is about 31) has also started to use new AI tools, including Harvey, in their work. One system allows them to drop in documents — a pile of legal contracts or a company’s articles of association, for example — and ask questions about them. The fluently written answers come with source notes that link back to the precise parts of the documents from which the AI drew its conclusions.Euan Cameron, PwC’s UK AI leader, says the biggest difference with these new tools is that they democratise access. “Previously . . . it was like being in a world of horses and having a car with a one litre engine, but controls like a Boeing 747. So you needed to get really smart, specialist people to make it go. Now, you have tools that can be integrated into the sidebar of Office 365 or the Google Suite.”He likens the latest AI technology to a Swiss army knife with 500 tools. “If you want to work out all the places you can use that in your organisation, you can either create a small team and put them in an ivory tower and they can come up with ideas, or you can give everyone a Swiss army knife and they’ll find their own use cases, as long as you’ve got guardrails around it.” Those guardrails include “first draft only; humans in the loop; use it for cases with a low cost of failure”.It is still early days, but so far the biggest time-savings for professional firms appear to be on tasks that would usually be assigned to more junior staff. Does that mean law and consultancy firms will not need those roles any more, and if so, who will train the senior professionals of the future, and how? Bivek Sharma, PwC’s chief technology officer for the tax, legal and people business, insists the firm will still want — and need — to train people to be “subject matter experts”, but the way they do that and how quickly will soon change. “The expectations for them are going to grow,” he predicts.For the law sector, there is also the question of whether it makes sense to economise on human labour, given many firms charge for lawyers’ time by the hour. But by that logic, argues Wakeling, “we could have kept going with fax machines” and typewriters. “It’s coming anyway so we’re thinking embrace it and do it safely.” As for the fears that AI will replace a swath of professions such as lawyers and accountants completely, the people who have started to use the tools seem sanguine for now. Shandro talks about the “context heavy” art of negotiating a contract that relies as much on “instinct” and “experience” as knowledge of the law. At KPMG, global head of people Nhlamu Dlomu is more worried that work could intensify. “What is it that can help us not fall into that trap? What are the real guardrails we need to put around work so we can actually ensure we get the benefit [from AI], not just for organisations but for individuals as well?”PwC’s Sharma has the same prediction. “What’s going to happen in a year’s time is that our clients . . . are going to expect us to deliver higher value insights in much much shorter timeframes. If we were to meet again in a year’s time, I think you could find an even older looking version of me.”FilmmakingScreenwriters striking over fears AI could reduce available workDubbing technology could expand reach of foreign-language filmsPotential upsides for actors include hiring out “digital doubles”Hollywood directors’ tentative deal with movie studios this month included a clause that would have flummoxed golden age filmmakers such as Billy Wilder or Frank Capra. Artificial intelligence, the two sides declared, “cannot replace the duties” performed by directors.The statement was a landmark in the annals of Hollywood labour agreements, even if few were worried about directors being replaced by AI anytime soon. “I don’t think anyone can say we’re really at a point where a robot can direct,” notes a veteran Hollywood dealmaker.The concerns are more pressing for others in Hollywood, from screenwriters — who have been on strike since May 1 — to actors and voice artists. Screenwriters fear there will be less well-paid work for them in a world where book adaptations or first drafts can be written by AI. Actors worry they will lose control of their images, while voice dubbers are concerned new AI technologies that match mouth movements to different languages will eliminate their jobs.The TV and film writers’ strike outside Paramount Studios in LA in May. Screenwriters fear there will be less well-paid work for them when book adaptations or first drafts can be written by AI © Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesSome hot AI start-ups have already introduced dubbing technology that they say saves time and money on set — without killing jobs. Flawless, for example, has produced a tool that enables filmmakers to use generative AI to insert new dialogue into already captured scenes, eliminating the need for rebuilding sets and flying actors in for a reshoot. The actor will record the new dialogue in a studio and the AI technology will adapt the actor’s “mouth shape” from the original shot in a way that makes the words look natural.Join AI editor, Madhumita Murgia, and colleagues as they answer your questions on the opportunities and risks of AI in this webinar exclusively for FT subscribers. Register to attend on 22 June at 15:30 GMT+ 1Flawless has developed a tool that solves the problem of dubbed films in which mouth movements do not match the voiceover. Last month Flawless launched a partnership with XYZ Films and Tea Shop Productions to buy rights to foreign-language films, convert them to English using AI and distribute them in English-speaking markets. UK-based AI start-up Papercup is also using AI to automate the translation and dubbing process. Such deals have the potential to greatly expand the reach of foreign language films, but some actors may worry it could cost them work. “The concern there is . . . are you taking jobs from voiceover actors who dub foreign language films?” said the Hollywood dealmaker.People close to the company say such fears are unfounded, since they use professional voice artists and actors for the dubbing and the AI technology matches the mouth movements to the new language.Hilary Krane, chief legal officer at Creative Artists Agency, said she believes AI creates more opportunity than risk for Hollywood. The trick, she says, will be to “favour the creative thinkers and humans who actually put out the work without constraining the use of the new tool”.Hollywood labour unions had initially been focused on the effects of a different technological disruption: streaming.But the Hollywood veteran noted that AI was “the issue that caught fire in the zeitgeist”. “If a producer can use AI to shoot out a 100-page script, then they can go to the writer and say, ‘I’ll pay you $50,000 to rewrite this instead of the $200,000 for you to write it on the page’.”Under the Writers Guild of America’s proposals, such a scenario would be forbidden. The union wants to prevent AI programmes from being used to write scripts or to rewrite work created by a human. The only acceptable use for AI at this point, the WGA says, is for research purposes.The technology does have some potential benefits for screenwriters: AI could make them more efficient, allowing them to write more screenplays in a year. Such opportunities may be offset by cost-conscious studios that use the technology to hire fewer writers, however.The upsides to AI technology may be more apparent for actors, who could hire out their “digital doubles” to, for example, act in an advertisement while they were shooting a feature film.The key to making this work is for the industry to enforce basic ethical concepts, including that “people own their name, image and likeness and that they should be in control of when and how it is used,” says Krane.CodingGenerative AI can suggest lines of code that programmers can run and testTechnology can analyse existing code and search for vulnerabilities AI can boost productivity but struggles with complex softwareCoders have benefited from developments in generative AI to drive efficiencies and save time, using tools such as ChatGPT to help write software.If given specific instructions, generative AI chatbots can suggest lines of code that programmers can run and test. But data experts warn there are still clear limitations.“It is very helpful and does speed things up a lot, but you should know what an answer should look like for it to work,” says Edward Rushton, data scientist and co-founder of the Efficient Data Group consultancy.He says there is a lot of trial and error, so understanding how to fix what the AI has generated is crucial. “It does just get stuff wrong, and it does just make stuff up. It will invent a function that doesn’t exist, it all looks perfectly plausible, but it is not correct and won’t work,” he warns.Archana Vaidheeswaran, a data product manager at the non-profit Women Who Code, used ChatGPT to build a Google Chrome extension tool that helps non-native English speakers translate text and adjust the tone to a more natural conversational style. OpenAI’s chatbot generated the code for the front end of the product, the part that users can see and interact with, while Vaidheeswaran wrote the background technology.“ChatGPT can write something very specific, then you have to work with it,” she says.Matt Shumer, chief executive and co-founder of Otherside AI, a start-up with a product for writing emails, says his staff use AI to assist with programming and that a large portion of the company’s code has been written this way. “It’s not technically a requirement, but I doubt anyone who wasn’t using it would be able to keep up with the rest of the team,” he says.RecommendedFT SeriesAI in the workplaceHowever, he highlights the need for experienced engineers to judge and validate the AI’s results and “coax” out the correct answers. “AI has profoundly transformed the role of coders. Instead of focusing solely on manual coding, they now spend more time defining the problem, designing the structure and directing AI to do the heavy lifting,” he says, adding that it frees up staff from “mundane tasks”.The British Computing Society says that as well as using generative AI tools to write code, it can be used to analyse existing code and search for errors or vulnerabilities hackers might exploit. It echoes the need for developers to review responses critically and consider how data input into generative AI systems may be used.“The professionals have to understand the level of competence needed [when using AI] because they’re taking on a huge responsibility,” says Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computing Society. “They need to understand the ethics of what they’re doing and have accountability if this thing screws up.”As the needs of the code become more complex, the limitations of generative AI increase. A top executive at one large Silicon Valley-based company says they are looking closely at the potential for AI to boost its developers’ productivity, but it is “not efficient yet”. While it works well for simple coding, this executive says, it struggles with the complicated software architecture inside a large company. Still, coding is one of the top areas in which companies are looking to implement generative AI.“For many developers, generative AI will become the most valuable coding partner they will ever know,” according to KPMG.This article has been changed to clarify that Papercup uses AI to automate the translation and dubbing process. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

Comments",,,,,,,,,AI shakes up way we work in three key industries,,,,,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financial Times', 'productID': 'ft.com:subscribed'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A revolution that will free workers from gruelling tasks or the destroyer of millions of jobs? New artificial intelligence capabilities have simultaneously prompted huge excitement around workplace productivity and dire warnings for employees. The Financial Times has selected three industries that are among the first to adopt the technology to analyse how it is being used in everyday work.

It has been a strange year for lawyers such as Alex Shandro and Karishma Brahmbhatt. All around them, economists, technologists and journalists have been making predictions about what new advances in AI might mean for professional workers. Headlines warning that “AI is coming for lawyers” have been everywhere.

But Shandro and Brahmbhatt have a different vantage point — not from the top down but from the shop floor. As lawyers at Allen & Overy in London, they are already using the new generative AI tools in their everyday work. Roughly 3,500 employees at A&O have access to Harvey, an AI platform built on a version of OpenAI’s latest models, which have been enhanced for legal work.

Shandro, a commercial intellectual property lawyer, says he used Harvey recently to prepare for a transaction that involved property rights in the metaverse. “So, what are the advertising regulations in the UK that might apply in augmented reality? I asked Harvey and got a really nice list. Before, I would have asked my trainee or a junior lawyer to go and find that out, and it would have taken that much longer.”

Brahmbatt, too, says she and her juniors use the technology regularly — albeit with mixed results. “I actually asked it a question last night and it completely made up the cases,” she laughs. “If you approach it from the basis of, ‘I’m going to have to read through and check it all anyway’ then it’s useful. I don’t think it’s quite something you can just take and run with.”

David Wakeling, head of A&O’s markets innovation group, says the workforce has adopted Harvey fairly quickly since the law firm began trials in November, although it is not yet being used by everyone every day. “I checked last night — roughly 800 people used it in the last 24 hours, and they asked three to four questions each on average, in different languages and different practice groups,” he says.

For Wakeling, one of the most important things is not to allow staff to believe the tool is more capable than it really is. “We say Harvey is like a very confident, very articulate 13-year-old. It doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. It has some fabulous knowledge, but incomplete knowledge. You wouldn’t trust a 13-year-old to do your tax return.”

Rather than a black box with “magic” written on the lid, the law firm considers the technology “a boring productivity gain. We know it has issues, we know it makes errors, we know it will be out of date. But that’s OK, because we’re trying to save an hour or two a week across 3,500 people who have access today.”

Across London, the young workforce at PwC (the average age is about 31) has also started to use new AI tools, including Harvey, in their work. One system allows them to drop in documents — a pile of legal contracts or a company’s articles of association, for example — and ask questions about them. The fluently written answers come with source notes that link back to the precise parts of the documents from which the AI drew its conclusions.

Euan Cameron, PwC’s UK AI leader, says the biggest difference with these new tools is that they democratise access. “Previously . . . it was like being in a world of horses and having a car with a one litre engine, but controls like a Boeing 747. So you needed to get really smart, specialist people to make it go. Now, you have tools that can be integrated into the sidebar of Office 365 or the Google Suite.”

He likens the latest AI technology to a Swiss army knife with 500 tools. “If you want to work out all the places you can use that in your organisation, you can either create a small team and put them in an ivory tower and they can come up with ideas, or you can give everyone a Swiss army knife and they’ll find their own use cases, as long as you’ve got guardrails around it.” Those guardrails include “first draft only; humans in the loop; use it for cases with a low cost of failure”.

It is still early days, but so far the biggest time-savings for professional firms appear to be on tasks that would usually be assigned to more junior staff. Does that mean law and consultancy firms will not need those roles any more, and if so, who will train the senior professionals of the future, and how?

Bivek Sharma, PwC’s chief technology officer for the tax, legal and people business, insists the firm will still want — and need — to train people to be “subject matter experts”, but the way they do that and how quickly will soon change. “The expectations for them are going to grow,” he predicts.

For the law sector, there is also the question of whether it makes sense to economise on human labour, given many firms charge for lawyers’ time by the hour. But by that logic, argues Wakeling, “we could have kept going with fax machines” and typewriters. “It’s coming anyway so we’re thinking embrace it and do it safely.”

As for the fears that AI will replace a swath of professions such as lawyers and accountants completely, the people who have started to use the tools seem sanguine for now. Shandro talks about the “context heavy” art of negotiating a contract that relies as much on “instinct” and “experience” as knowledge of the law.

At KPMG, global head of people Nhlamu Dlomu is more worried that work could intensify. “What is it that can help us not fall into that trap? What are the real guardrails we need to put around work so we can actually ensure we get the benefit [from AI], not just for organisations but for individuals as well?”

PwC’s Sharma has the same prediction. “What’s going to happen in a year’s time is that our clients . . . are going to expect us to deliver higher value insights in much much shorter timeframes. If we were to meet again in a year’s time, I think you could find an even older looking version of me.”

Hollywood directors’ tentative deal with movie studios this month included a clause that would have flummoxed golden age filmmakers such as Billy Wilder or Frank Capra. Artificial intelligence, the two sides declared, “cannot replace the duties” performed by directors.

The statement was a landmark in the annals of Hollywood labour agreements, even if few were worried about directors being replaced by AI anytime soon. “I don’t think anyone can say we’re really at a point where a robot can direct,” notes a veteran Hollywood dealmaker.

The concerns are more pressing for others in Hollywood, from screenwriters — who have been on strike since May 1 — to actors and voice artists. Screenwriters fear there will be less well-paid work for them in a world where book adaptations or first drafts can be written by AI. Actors worry they will lose control of their images, while voice dubbers are concerned new AI technologies that match mouth movements to different languages will eliminate their jobs.

Some hot AI start-ups have already introduced dubbing technology that they say saves time and money on set — without killing jobs. Flawless, for example, has produced a tool that enables filmmakers to use generative AI to insert new dialogue into already captured scenes, eliminating the need for rebuilding sets and flying actors in for a reshoot. The actor will record the new dialogue in a studio and the AI technology will adapt the actor’s “mouth shape” from the original shot in a way that makes the words look natural.

Flawless has developed a tool that solves the problem of dubbed films in which mouth movements do not match the voiceover. Last month Flawless launched a partnership with XYZ Films and Tea Shop Productions to buy rights to foreign-language films, convert them to English using AI and distribute them in English-speaking markets. UK-based AI start-up Papercup is also using AI to automate the translation and dubbing process.

Such deals have the potential to greatly expand the reach of foreign language films, but some actors may worry it could cost them work. “The concern there is . . . are you taking jobs from voiceover actors who dub foreign language films?” said the Hollywood dealmaker.

People close to the company say such fears are unfounded, since they use professional voice artists and actors for the dubbing and the AI technology matches the mouth movements to the new language.

Hilary Krane, chief legal officer at Creative Artists Agency, said she believes AI creates more opportunity than risk for Hollywood. The trick, she says, will be to “favour the creative thinkers and humans who actually put out the work without constraining the use of the new tool”.

Hollywood labour unions had initially been focused on the effects of a different technological disruption: streaming.

But the Hollywood veteran noted that AI was “the issue that caught fire in the zeitgeist”. “If a producer can use AI to shoot out a 100-page script, then they can go to the writer and say, ‘I’ll pay you $50,000 to rewrite this instead of the $200,000 for you to write it on the page’.”

Under the Writers Guild of America’s proposals, such a scenario would be forbidden. The union wants to prevent AI programmes from being used to write scripts or to rewrite work created by a human. The only acceptable use for AI at this point, the WGA says, is for research purposes.

The technology does have some potential benefits for screenwriters: AI could make them more efficient, allowing them to write more screenplays in a year. Such opportunities may be offset by cost-conscious studios that use the technology to hire fewer writers, however.

The upsides to AI technology may be more apparent for actors, who could hire out their “digital doubles” to, for example, act in an advertisement while they were shooting a feature film.

The key to making this work is for the industry to enforce basic ethical concepts, including that “people own their name, image and likeness and that they should be in control of when and how it is used,” says Krane.

Coders have benefited from developments in generative AI to drive efficiencies and save time, using tools such as ChatGPT to help write software.

If given specific instructions, generative AI chatbots can suggest lines of code that programmers can run and test. But data experts warn there are still clear limitations.

“It is very helpful and does speed things up a lot, but you should know what an answer should look like for it to work,” says Edward Rushton, data scientist and co-founder of the Efficient Data Group consultancy.

He says there is a lot of trial and error, so understanding how to fix what the AI has generated is crucial. “It does just get stuff wrong, and it does just make stuff up. It will invent a function that doesn’t exist, it all looks perfectly plausible, but it is not correct and won’t work,” he warns.

Archana Vaidheeswaran, a data product manager at the non-profit Women Who Code, used ChatGPT to build a Google Chrome extension tool that helps non-native English speakers translate text and adjust the tone to a more natural conversational style. OpenAI’s chatbot generated the code for the front end of the product, the part that users can see and interact with, while Vaidheeswaran wrote the background technology.

“ChatGPT can write something very specific, then you have to work with it,” she says.

Matt Shumer, chief executive and co-founder of Otherside AI, a start-up with a product for writing emails, says his staff use AI to assist with programming and that a large portion of the company’s code has been written this way. “It’s not technically a requirement, but I doubt anyone who wasn’t using it would be able to keep up with the rest of the team,” he says.

However, he highlights the need for experienced engineers to judge and validate the AI’s results and “coax” out the correct answers. “AI has profoundly transformed the role of coders. Instead of focusing solely on manual coding, they now spend more time defining the problem, designing the structure and directing AI to do the heavy lifting,” he says, adding that it frees up staff from “mundane tasks”.

The British Computing Society says that as well as using generative AI tools to write code, it can be used to analyse existing code and search for errors or vulnerabilities hackers might exploit. It echoes the need for developers to review responses critically and consider how data input into generative AI systems may be used.

“The professionals have to understand the level of competence needed [when using AI] because they’re taking on a huge responsibility,” says Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computing Society. “They need to understand the ethics of what they’re doing and have accountability if this thing screws up.”

As the needs of the code become more complex, the limitations of generative AI increase. A top executive at one large Silicon Valley-based company says they are looking closely at the potential for AI to boost its developers’ productivity, but it is “not efficient yet”. While it works well for simple coding, this executive says, it struggles with the complicated software architecture inside a large company.

Still, coding is one of the top areas in which companies are looking to implement generative AI.

“For many developers, generative AI will become the most valuable coding partner they will ever know,” according to KPMG.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.""I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,"" he said.The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.More technology of business:Can Amsterdam make the circular economy work?The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumpsThe chip maker that became an AI superpowerWhy car parks are the hottest space in solar powerProtein's power is being uncovered and unleashedEarlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.There is some evidence of that already. Getty ImagesIKEA has retrained thousands of call centre workers as design advisersThis month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. ""When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.""But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.Alejandro GraueAlejandro Graue lost voiceover work to an AI systemFor three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.""I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,"" he says.But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.""When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?"" he says.A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.""If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,"" he says.If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.""I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,"" he says.You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

We’ve also been studying other media organisations’ statements and approaches with interest.So today we’re publishing three broad principles setting out how we will and won’t use GenAI tools, as follows:For the benefit of readersGenAI tools are exciting but are currently unreliable. There is no room for unreliability in our journalism, nor our marketing, creative and engineering work. At a simple level, this means that the use of genAI requires human oversight. We will seek to use genAI tools editorially only where it contributes to the creation and distribution of original journalism. We will guard against the dangers of bias embedded within generative tools and their underlying training sets. If we wish to include significant elements generated by AI in a piece of work, we will only do so with clear evidence of a specific benefit, human oversight, and the explicit permission of a senior editor. We will be open with our readers when we do this.For the benefit of our mission, our staff and the wider organisationThe Guardian has always been a fast adopter of emerging technologies that support our mission, our journalism and our staff, and we are more than the sum of our parts. When we use genAI, we will focus on situations where it can improve the quality of our work, for example by helping journalists interrogate large data sets, assisting colleagues through corrections or suggestions, creating ideas for marketing campaigns, or reducing the bureaucracy of time-consuming business processes. Any use of these tools will focus on what is valuable and worth protecting at the Guardian: “serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments”.With respect for those who create and own contentMany genAI models are opaque systems trained on material that is harvested without the knowledge or consent of its creators. Our investment in journalism generates revenues as we license that material for reuse around the world. A guiding principle for the tools and models we consider using will be the degree to which they have considered key issues such as permissioning, transparency and fair reward. Any use we make of genAI tools does not mean a waiver of any rights in our underlying content.The Guardian was born 202 years ago in a world of huge technological change and innovation and has prospered since through a series of fundamental changes to the way we produce and distribute our journalism. We don’t yet know the full impact that these new technologies will have on our society, but we feel sure that trusted media organisations which prioritise intelligent original reporting, uncovering facts, holding the powerful to account, and interrogating ideas will be as important as ever before.Explore more on these topicsInside the GuardianShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among those who do not use AI, 78% said their activity was incompatible with the technology. Another one-third of the employers not using it said they lacked the skills to do so, and nearly one in three said they did not have the financial means for it. Some 15% of employers who are not using AI said they were afraid of the technology. Meanwhile, roughly 35% of employers said they were already using artificial intelligence or were in the middle of rolling it out in the workplace, the poll, conducted for the government agency by the BVA institute, also found. It surveyed 3,000 companies with ten or more employees by telephone in May 2023. Which companies are more likely to use AI? The sectors most likely to use artificial intelligence included agriculture, industry, finance, and commerce. Companies with more than 200 employees were more likely to be using the technology, the poll showed. While around 34% of companies with fewer than 100 employees used the technology, some 45% of companies with more than 200 employees did. What is its impact on these companies? Those who use AI were positive about its impact, with around 74% saying there was a positive effect on the evolution of people\'s skill sets. Some 73% of employers using the technology said there was a positive effect on employees\' performance, while 66% said it had a positive effect on staff health and safety. Around 63% of these employers said it reduced tedious tasks. Tools capable of answering questions or performing diagnostics to support decision-making were the most used by employers using AI. This was followed by language processing and robotics. Voice or visual recognition tools were the least used by companies. AI was most often used in accounting, communication and human resources, the poll showed. Two-thirds of the companies using AI said they had trained staff within their companies, while 22% recruited those in AI-related jobs. Two-thirds of the companies using AI also said that it had increased employees\' autonomy. AI technology has experienced a recent boom since the chatbot ChatGPT, released last November, reportedly became the fastest-growing application. Experts, including AI developers, have  recently issued stark warnings  including that regulating AI should be a ""global priority"" to mitigate the ""risk of extinction"". Many have also expressed concerns that the technology could replace jobs.

Since joining The Verge in 2014, he’s won a Loeb Award for feature writing, among others.Illustrations by Richard Parry for The Verge Jun 20, 2023, 8:05 AM EDTShare this story23 Comments / 23 NewThis article is a collaboration between New York Magazine and The Verge.A few months after graduating from college in Nairobi, a 30-year-old I’ll call Joe got a job as an annotator — the tedious work of processing the raw information used to train artificial intelligence. AI learns by finding patterns in enormous quantities of data, but first that data has to be sorted and tagged by people, a vast workforce mostly hidden behind the machines. In Joe’s case, he was labeling footage for self-driving cars — identifying every vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist, anything a driver needs to be aware of — frame by frame and from every possible camera angle. It’s difficult and repetitive work. A several-second blip of footage took eight hours to annotate, for which Joe was paid about $10.Then, in 2019, an opportunity arose: Joe could make four times as much running an annotation boot camp for a new company that was hungry for labelers. Every two weeks, 50 new recruits would file into an office building in Nairobi to begin their apprenticeships. There seemed to be limitless demand for the work. They would be asked to categorize clothing seen in mirror selfies, look through the eyes of robot vacuum cleaners to determine which rooms they were in, and draw squares around lidar scans of motorcycles. Over half of Joe’s students usually dropped out before the boot camp was finished. “Some people don’t know how to stay in one place for long,” he explained with gracious understatement. Also, he acknowledged, “it is very boring.”This article is a collaboration between New York Magazine and The Verge.But it was a job in a place where jobs were scarce, and Joe turned out hundreds of graduates. After boot camp, they went home to work alone in their bedrooms and kitchens, forbidden from telling anyone what they were working on, which wasn’t really a problem because they rarely knew themselves. Labeling objects for self-driving cars was obvious, but what about categorizing whether snippets of distorted dialogue were spoken by a robot or a human? Uploading photos of yourself staring into a webcam with a blank expression, then with a grin, then wearing a motorcycle helmet? Each project was such a small component of some larger process that it was difficult to say what they were actually training AI to do. Nor did the names of the projects offer any clues: Crab Generation, Whale Segment, Woodland Gyro, and Pillbox Bratwurst. They were non sequitur code names for non sequitur work.As for the company employing them, most knew it only as Remotasks, a website offering work to anyone fluent in English. Like most of the annotators I spoke with, Joe was unaware until I told him that Remotasks is the worker-facing subsidiary of a company called Scale AI, a multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley data vendor that counts OpenAI and the U.S. military among its customers. Neither Remotasks’ or Scale’s website mentions the other.Much of the public response to language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has focused on all the jobs they appear poised to automate. But behind even the most impressive AI system are people — huge numbers of people labeling data to train it and clarifying data when it gets confused. Only the companies that can afford to buy this data can compete, and those that get it are highly motivated to keep it secret. The result is that, with few exceptions, little is known about the information shaping these systems’ behavior, and even less is known about the people doing the shaping.For Joe’s students, it was work stripped of all its normal trappings: a schedule, colleagues, knowledge of what they were working on or whom they were working for. In fact, they rarely called it work at all — just “tasking.” They were taskers.The anthropologist David Graeber defines “bullshit jobs” as employment without meaning or purpose, work that should be automated but for reasons of bureaucracy or status or inertia is not. These AI jobs are their bizarro twin: work that people want to automate, and often think is already automated, yet still requires a human stand-in. The jobs have a purpose; it’s just that workers often have no idea what it is.The current AI boom — the convincingly human-sounding chatbots, the artwork that can be generated from simple prompts, and the multibillion-dollar valuations of the companies behind these technologies — began with an unprecedented feat of tedious and repetitive labor.In 2007, the AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, then a professor at Princeton, suspected the key to improving image-recognition neural networks, a method of machine learning that had been languishing for years, was training on more data — millions of labeled images rather than tens of thousands. The problem was that it would take decades and millions of dollars for her team of undergrads to label that many photos.Li found thousands of workers on Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform where people around the world complete small tasks for cheap. The resulting annotated dataset, called ImageNet, enabled breakthroughs in machine learning that revitalized the field and ushered in a decade of progress.Annotation remains a foundational part of making AI, but there is often a sense among engineers that it’s a passing, inconvenient prerequisite to the more glamorous work of building models. You collect as much labeled data as you can get as cheaply as possible to train your model, and if it works, at least in theory, you no longer need the annotators. But annotation is never really finished. Machine-learning systems are what researchers call “brittle,” prone to fail when encountering something that isn’t well represented in their training data. These failures, called “edge cases,” can have serious consequences. In 2018, an Uber self-driving test car killed a woman because, though it was programmed to avoid cyclists and pedestrians, it didn’t know what to make of someone walking a bike across the street. The more AI systems are put out into the world to dispense legal advice and medical help, the more edge cases they will encounter and the more humans will be needed to sort them. Already, this has given rise to a global industry staffed by people like Joe who use their uniquely human faculties to help the machines.Is that a red shirt with white stripes or a white shirt with red stripes? Is a wicker bowl a “decorative bowl” if it’s full of apples? What color is leopard print?Over the past six months, I spoke with more than two dozen annotators from around the world, and while many of them were training cutting-edge chatbots, just as many were doing the mundane manual labor required to keep AI running. There are people classifying the emotional content of TikTok videos, new variants of email spam, and the precise sexual provocativeness of online ads. Others are looking at credit-card transactions and figuring out what sort of purchase they relate to or checking e-commerce recommendations and deciding whether that shirt is really something you might like after buying that other shirt. Humans are correcting customer-service chatbots, listening to Alexa requests, and categorizing the emotions of people on video calls. They are labeling food so that smart refrigerators don’t get confused by new packaging, checking automated security cameras before sounding alarms, and identifying corn for baffled autonomous tractors.“There’s an entire supply chain,” said Sonam Jindal, the program and research lead of the nonprofit Partnership on AI. “The general perception in the industry is that this work isn’t a critical part of development and isn’t going to be needed for long. All the excitement is around building artificial intelligence, and once we build that, it won’t be needed anymore, so why think about it? But it’s infrastructure for AI. Human intelligence is the basis of artificial intelligence, and we need to be valuing these as real jobs in the AI economy that are going to be here for a while.”The data vendors behind familiar names like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft come in different forms. There are private outsourcing companies with call-center-like offices, such as the Kenya- and Nepal-based CloudFactory, where Joe annotated for $1.20 an hour before switching to Remotasks. There are also “crowdworking” sites like Mechanical Turk and Clickworker where anyone can sign up to perform tasks. In the middle are services like Scale AI. Anyone can sign up, but everyone has to pass qualification exams and training courses and undergo performance monitoring. Annotation is big business. Scale, founded in 2016 by then-19-year-old Alexandr Wang, was valued in 2021 at $7.3 billion, making him what Forbes called “the youngest self-made billionaire,” though the magazine noted in a recent profile that his stake has fallen on secondary markets since then.This tangled supply chain is deliberately hard to map. According to people in the industry, the companies buying the data demand strict confidentiality. (This is the reason Scale cited to explain why Remotasks has a different name.) Annotation reveals too much about the systems being developed, and the huge number of workers required makes leaks difficult to prevent. Annotators are warned repeatedly not to tell anyone about their jobs, not even their friends and co-workers, but corporate aliases, project code names, and, crucially, the extreme division of labor ensure they don’t have enough information about them to talk even if they wanted to. (Most workers requested pseudonyms for fear of being booted from the platforms.) Consequently, there are no granular estimates of the number of people who work in annotation, but it is a lot, and it is growing. A recent Google Research paper gave an order-of-magnitude figure of “millions” with the potential to become “billions.”Automation often unfolds in unexpected ways. Erik Duhaime, CEO of medical-data-annotation company Centaur Labs, recalled how, several years ago, prominent machine-learning engineers were predicting AI would make the job of radiologist obsolete. When that didn’t happen, conventional wisdom shifted to radiologists using AI as a tool. Neither of those is quite what he sees occurring. AI is very good at specific tasks, Duhaime said, and that leads work to be broken up and distributed across a system of specialized algorithms and to equally specialized humans. An AI system might be capable of spotting cancer, he said, giving a hypothetical example, but only in a certain type of imagery from a certain type of machine; so now, you need a human to check that the AI is being fed the right type of data and maybe another human who checks its work before passing it to another AI that writes a report, which goes to another human, and so on. “AI doesn’t replace work,” he said. “But it does change how work is organized.”You might miss this if you believe AI is a brilliant, thinking machine. But if you pull back the curtain even a little, it looks more familiar, the latest iteration of a particularly Silicon Valley division of labor, in which the futuristic gleam of new technologies hides a sprawling manufacturing apparatus and the people who make it run. Duhaime reached back farther for a comparison, a digital version of the transition from craftsmen to industrial manufacturing: coherent processes broken into tasks and arrayed along assembly lines with some steps done by machines and some by humans but none resembling what came before.Worries about AI-driven disruption are often countered with the argument that AI automates tasks, not jobs, and that these tasks will be the dull ones, leaving people to pursue more fulfilling and human work. But just as likely, the rise of AI will look like past labor-saving technologies, maybe like the telephone or typewriter, which vanquished the drudgery of message delivering and handwriting but generated so much new correspondence, commerce, and paperwork that new offices staffed by new types of workers — clerks, accountants, typists — were required to manage it. When AI comes for your job, you may not lose it, but it might become more alien, more isolating, more tedious.Earlier this year, I signed up for Scale AI’s Remotasks. The process was straightforward. After entering my computer specs, internet speed, and some basic contact information, I found myself in the “training center.” To access a paying task, I first had to complete an associated (unpaid) intro course.The training center displayed a range of courses with inscrutable names like Glue Swimsuit and Poster Macadamia. I clicked on something called GFD Chunking, which revealed itself to be labeling clothing in social-media photos.The instructions, however, were odd. For one, they basically consisted of the same direction reiterated in the idiosyncratically colored and capitalized typography of a collaged bomb threat.“DO LABEL items that are real and can be worn by humans or are intended to be worn by real people,” it read.“All items below SHOULD be labeled because they are real and can be worn by real-life humans,” it reiterated above photos of an Air Jordans ad, someone in a Kylo Ren helmet, and mannequins in dresses, over which was a lime-green box explaining, once again, “DO Label real items that can be worn by real people.”Remotasks instructions for labeling clothing.I skimmed to the bottom of the manual, where the instructor had written in the large bright-red font equivalent of grabbing someone by the shoulders and shaking them, “THE FOLLOWING ITEMS SHOULD NOT BE LABELED because a human could not actually put wear any of these items!” above a photo of C-3PO, Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, and a cartoon shoe with eyeballs.Feeling confident in my ability to distinguish between real clothes that can be worn by real people and not-real clothes that cannot, I proceeded to the test. Right away, it threw an ontological curveball: a picture of a magazine depicting photos of women in dresses. Is a photograph of clothing real clothing? No, I thought, because a human cannot wear a photograph of clothing. Wrong! As far as AI is concerned, photos of real clothes are real clothes. Next came a photo of a woman in a dimly lit bedroom taking a selfie before a full-length mirror. The blouse and shorts she’s wearing are real. What about their reflection? Also real! Reflections of real clothes are also real clothes.After an embarrassing amount of trial and error, I made it to the actual work, only to make the horrifying discovery that the instructions I’d been struggling to follow had been updated and clarified so many times that they were now a full 43 printed pages of directives: Do NOT label open suitcases full of clothes; DO label shoes but do NOT label flippers; DO label leggings but do NOT label tights; do NOT label towels even if someone is wearing it; label costumes but do NOT label armor. And so on.There has been general instruction disarray across the industry, according to Milagros Miceli, a researcher at the Weizenbaum Institute in Germany who studies data work. It is in part a product of the way machine-learning systems learn. Where a human would get the concept of “shirt” with a few examples, machine-learning programs need thousands, and they need to be categorized with perfect consistency yet varied enough (polo shirts, shirts being worn outdoors, shirts hanging on a rack) that the very literal system can handle the diversity of the real world. “Imagine simplifying complex realities into something that is readable for a machine that is totally dumb,” she said.Once, Victor stayed up 36 hours straight labeling elbows and knees and heads in photographs of crowds — he has no idea why.The act of simplifying reality for a machine results in a great deal of complexity for the human. Instruction writers must come up with rules that will get humans to categorize the world with perfect consistency. To do so, they often create categories no human would use. A human asked to tag all the shirts in a photo probably wouldn’t tag the reflection of a shirt in a mirror because they would know it is a reflection and not real. But to the AI, which has no understanding of the world, it’s all just pixels and the two are perfectly identical. Fed a dataset with some shirts labeled and other (reflected) shirts unlabeled, the model won’t work. So the engineer goes back to the vendor with an update: DO label reflections of shirts. Soon, you have a 43-page guide descending into red all-caps.“When you start off, the rules are relatively simple,” said a former Scale employee who requested anonymity because of an NDA. “Then they get back a thousand images and then they’re like, Wait a second, and then you have multiple engineers and they start to argue with each other. It’s very much a human thing.”The job of the annotator often involves putting human understanding aside and following instructions very, very literally — to think, as one annotator said, like a robot. It’s a strange mental space to inhabit, doing your best to follow nonsensical but rigorous rules, like taking a standardized test while on hallucinogens. Annotators invariably end up confronted with confounding questions like, Is that a red shirt with white stripes or a white shirt with red stripes? Is a wicker bowl a “decorative bowl” if it’s full of apples? What color is leopard print? When instructors said to label traffic-control directors, did they also mean to label traffic-control directors eating lunch on the sidewalk? Every question must be answered, and a wrong guess could get you banned and booted to a new, totally different task with its own baffling rules.Most of the work on Remotasks is paid at a piece rate with a single task earning anywhere from a few cents to several dollars. Because tasks can take seconds or hours, wages are hard to predict. When Remotasks first arrived in Kenya, annotators said it paid relatively well — averaging about $5 to $10 per hour depending on the task — but the amount fell as time went on.Scale AI spokesperson Anna Franko said that the company’s economists analyze the specifics of a project, the skills required, the regional cost of living, and other factors “to ensure fair and competitive compensation.” Former Scale employees also said pay is determined through a surge-pricing-like mechanism that adjusts for how many annotators are available and how quickly the data is needed.According to workers I spoke with and job listings, U.S.-based Remotasks annotators generally earn between $10 and $25 per hour, though some subject-matter experts can make more. By the beginning of this year, pay for the Kenyan annotators I spoke with had dropped to between $1 and $3 per hour.That is, when they were making any money at all. The most common complaint about Remotasks work is its variability; it’s steady enough to be a full-time job for long stretches but too unpredictable to rely on. Annotators spend hours reading instructions and completing unpaid trainings only to do a dozen tasks and then have the project end. There might be nothing new for days, then, without warning, a totally different task appears and could last anywhere from a few hours to weeks. Any task could be their last, and they never know when the next one will come.This boom-and-bust cycle results from the cadence of AI development, according to engineers and data vendors. Training a large model requires an enormous amount of annotation followed by more iterative updates, and engineers want it all as fast as possible so they can hit their target launch date. There may be monthslong demand for thousands of annotators, then for only a few hundred, then for a dozen specialists of a certain type, and then thousands again. “The question is, Who bears the cost for these fluctuations?” said Jindal of Partnership on AI. “Because right now, it’s the workers.”“I really am wasting my life here if I made somebody a billionaire and I’m earning a couple of bucks a week.”To succeed, annotators work together. When I told Victor, who started working for Remotasks while at university in Nairobi, about my struggles with the traffic-control-directors task, he told me everyone knew to stay away from that one: too tricky, bad pay, not worth it. Like a lot of annotators, Victor uses unofficial WhatsApp groups to spread the word when a good task drops. When he figures out a new one, he starts impromptu Google Meets to show others how it’s done. Anyone can join and work together for a time, sharing tips. “It’s a culture we have developed of helping each other because we know when on your own, you can’t know all the tricks,” he said.Because work appears and vanishes without warning, taskers always need to be on alert. Victor has found that projects pop up very late at night, so he is in the habit of waking every three hours or so to check his queue. When a task is there, he’ll stay awake as long as he can to work. Once, he stayed up 36 hours straight labeling elbows and knees and heads in photographs of crowds — he has no idea why. Another time, he stayed up so long his mother asked him what was wrong with his eyes. He looked in the mirror to discover they were swollen.Annotators generally know only that they are training AI for companies located vaguely elsewhere, but sometimes the veil of anonymity drops — instructions mentioning a brand or a chatbot say too much. “I read and I Googled and found I am working for a 25-year-old billionaire,” said one worker, who, when we spoke, was labeling the emotions of people calling to order Domino’s pizza. “I really am wasting my life here if I made somebody a billionaire and I’m earning a couple of bucks a week.”Victor is a self-proclaimed “fanatic” about AI and started annotating because he wants to help bring about a fully automated post-work future. But earlier this year, someone dropped a Time story into one of his WhatsApp groups about workers training ChatGPT to recognize toxic content who were getting paid less than $2 an hour by the vendor Sama AI. “People were angry that these companies are so profitable but paying so poorly,” Victor said. He was unaware until I told him about Remotasks’ connection to Scale. Instructions for one of the tasks he worked on were nearly identical to those used by OpenAI, which meant he had likely been training ChatGPT as well, for approximately $3 per hour.“I remember that someone posted that we will be remembered in the future,” he said. “And somebody else replied, ‘We are being treated worse than foot soldiers. We will be remembered nowhere in the future.’ I remember that very well. Nobody will recognize the work we did or the effort we put in.”Identifying clothing and labeling customer-service conversations are just some of the annotation gigs available. Lately, the hottest on the market has been chatbot trainer. Because it demands specific areas of expertise or language fluency and wages are often adjusted regionally, this job tends to pay better. Certain types of specialist annotation can go for $50 or more per hour.A woman I’ll call Anna was searching for a job in Texas when she stumbled across a generic listing for online work and applied. It was Remotasks, and after passing an introductory exam, she was brought into a Slack room of 1,500 people who were training a project code-named Dolphin, which she later discovered to be Google DeepMind’s chatbot, Sparrow, one of the many bots competing with ChatGPT. Her job is to talk with it all day. At about $14 an hour, plus bonuses for high productivity, “it definitely beats getting paid $10 an hour at the local Dollar General store,” she said.Also, she enjoys it. She has discussed science-fiction novels, mathematical paradoxes, children’s riddles, and TV shows. Sometimes the bot’s responses make her laugh; other times, she runs out of things to talk about. “Some days, my brain is just like, I literally have no idea what on earth to ask it now,” she said. “So I have a little notebook, and I’ve written about two pages of things — I just Google interesting topics — so I think I’ll be good for seven hours today, but that’s not always the case.”Each time Anna prompts Sparrow, it delivers two responses and she picks the best one, thereby creating something called “human-feedback data.” When ChatGPT debuted late last year, its impressively natural-seeming conversational style was credited to its having been trained on troves of internet data. But the language that fuels ChatGPT and its competitors is filtered through several rounds of human annotation. One group of contractors writes examples of how the engineers want the bot to behave, creating questions followed by correct answers, descriptions of computer programs followed by functional code, and requests for tips on committing crimes followed by polite refusals. After the model is trained on these examples, yet more contractors are brought in to prompt it and rank its responses. This is what Anna is doing with Sparrow. Exactly which criteria the raters are told to use varies — honesty, or helpfulness, or just personal preference. The point is that they are creating data on human taste, and once there’s enough of it, engineers can train a second model to mimic their preferences at scale, automating the ranking process and training their AI to act in ways humans approve of. The result is a remarkably human-seeming bot that mostly declines harmful requests and explains its AI nature with seeming self-awareness.Put another way, ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.This circuitous technique is called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, and it’s so effective that it’s worth pausing to fully register what it doesn’t do. When annotators teach a model to be accurate, for example, the model isn’t learning to check answers against logic or external sources or about what accuracy as a concept even is. The model is still a text-prediction machine mimicking patterns in human writing, but now its training corpus has been supplemented with bespoke examples, and the model has been weighted to favor them. Maybe this results in the model extracting patterns from the part of its linguistic map labeled as accurate and producing text that happens to align with the truth, but it can also result in it mimicking the confident style and expert jargon of the accurate text while writing things that are totally wrong. There is no guarantee that the text the labelers marked as accurate is in fact accurate, and when it is, there is no guarantee that the model learns the right patterns from it.This dynamic makes chatbot annotation a delicate process. It has to be rigorous and consistent because sloppy feedback, like marking material that merely sounds correct as accurate, risks training models to be even more convincing bullshitters. An early OpenAI and DeepMind joint project using RLHF, in this case to train a virtual robot hand to grab an item, resulted in also training the robot to position its hand between the object and its raters and wiggle around such that it only appeared to its human overseers to grab the item. Ranking a language model’s responses is always going to be somewhat subjective because it’s language. A text of any length will have multiple elements that could be right or wrong or, taken together, misleading. OpenAI researchers ran into this obstacle in another early RLHF paper. Trying to get their model to summarize text, the researchers found they agreed only 60 percent of the time that a summary was good. “Unlike many tasks in [machine learning] our queries do not have unambiguous ground truth,” they lamented.When Anna rates Sparrow’s responses, she’s supposed to be looking at their accuracy, helpfulness, and harmlessness while also checking that the model isn’t giving medical or financial advice or anthropomorphizing itself or running afoul of other criteria. To be useful training data, the model’s responses have to be quantifiably ranked against one another: Is a bot that helpfully tells you how to make a bomb “better” than a bot that’s so harmless it refuses to answer any questions? In one DeepMind paper, when Sparrow’s makers took a turn annotating, four researchers wound up debating whether their bot had assumed the gender of a user who asked it for relationship advice. According to Geoffrey Irving, one of DeepMind’s research scientists, the company’s researchers hold weekly annotation meetings in which they rerate data themselves and discuss ambiguous cases, consulting with ethical or subject-matter experts when a case is particularly tricky.There are people classifying the emotional content of TikTok videos, new variants of email spam, and the precise sexual provocativeness of online ads.Anna often finds herself having to choose between two bad options. “Even if they’re both absolutely, ridiculously wrong, you still have to figure out which one is better and then write words explaining why,” she said. Sometimes, when both responses are bad, she’s encouraged to write a better response herself, which she does about half the time.Because feedback data is difficult to collect, it fetches a higher price. Basic preferences of the sort Anna is producing sell for about $1 each, according to people with knowledge of the industry. But if you want to train a model to do legal research, you need someone with training in law, and this gets expensive. Everyone involved is reluctant to say how much they’re spending, but in general, specialized written examples can go for hundreds of dollars, while expert ratings can cost $50 or more. One engineer told me about buying examples of Socratic dialogues for up to $300 a pop. Another told me about paying $15 for a “darkly funny limerick about a goldfish.”OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic did not comment about how many people contribute annotations to their models, how much they are paid, or where in the world they are located. Irving of DeepMind, which is a subsidiary of Google, said the annotators working on Sparrow are paid “at least the hourly living wage” based on their location. Anna knows “absolutely nothing” about Remotasks, but Sparrow has been more open. She wasn’t the only annotator I spoke with who got more information from the AI they were training than from their employer; several others learned whom they were working for by asking their AI for its company’s terms of service. “I literally asked it, ‘What is your purpose, Sparrow?’” Anna said. It pulled up a link to DeepMind’s website and explained that it’s an AI assistant and that its creators trained it using RLHF to be helpful and safe.Until recently, it was relatively easy to spot bad output from a language model. It looked like gibberish. But this gets harder as the models get better — a problem called “scalable oversight.” Google inadvertently demonstrated how hard it is to catch the errors of a modern-language model when one made it into the splashy debut of its AI assistant, Bard. (It stated confidently that the James Webb Space Telescope “took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system,” which is wrong.) This trajectory means annotation increasingly requires specific skills and expertise.Last year, someone I’ll call Lewis was working on Mechanical Turk when, after completing a task, he received a message inviting him to apply for a platform he hadn’t heard of. It was called Taskup.ai, and its website was remarkably basic: just a navy background with text reading GET PAID FOR TASKS ON DEMAND. He applied.The work paid far better than anything he had tried before, often around $30 an hour. It was more challenging, too: devising complex scenarios to trick chatbots into giving dangerous advice, testing a model’s ability to stay in character, and having detailed conversations about scientific topics so technical they required extensive research. He found the work “satisfying and stimulating.” While checking one model’s attempts to code in Python, Lewis was learning too. He couldn’t work for more than four hours at a stretch, lest he risk becoming mentally drained and making mistakes, and he wanted to keep the job.“If there was one thing I could change, I would just like to have more information about what happens on the other end,” he said. “We only know as much as we need to know to get work done, but if I could know more, then maybe I could get more established and perhaps pursue this as a career.”I spoke with eight other workers, most based in the U.S., who had similar experiences of answering surveys or completing tasks on other platforms and finding themselves recruited for Taskup.ai or several similarly generic sites, such as DataAnnotation.tech or Gethybrid.io. Often their work involved training chatbots, though with higher-quality expectations and more specialized purposes than other sites they had worked for. One was demonstrating spreadsheet macros. Another was just supposed to have conversations and rate responses according to whatever criteria she wanted. She often asked the chatbot things that had come up in conversations with her 7-year-old daughter, like “What is the largest dinosaur?” and “Write a story about a tiger.” “I haven’t fully gotten my head around what they’re trying to do with it,” she told me.Taskup.ai, DataAnnotation.tech, and Gethybrid.io all appear to be owned by the same company: Surge AI. Its CEO, Edwin Chen, would neither confirm nor deny the connection, but he was willing to talk about his company and how he sees annotation evolving.“I’ve always felt the annotation landscape is overly simplistic,” Chen said over a video call from Surge’s office. He founded Surge in 2020 after working on AI at Google, Facebook, and Twitter convinced him that crowdsourced labeling was inadequate. “We want AI to tell jokes or write really good marketing copy or help me out when I need therapy or whatnot,” Chen said. “You can’t ask five people to independently come up with a joke and combine it into a majority answer. Not everybody can tell a joke or solve a Python program. The annotation landscape needs to shift from this low-quality, low-skill mind-set to something that’s much richer and captures the range of human skills and creativity and values that we want AI systems to possess.”Last year, Surge relabeled Google’s dataset classifying Reddit posts by emotion. Google had stripped each post of context and sent them to workers in India for labeling. Surge employees familiar with American internet culture found that 30 percent of the labels were wrong. Posts like “hell yeah my brother” had been classified as annoyance and “Yay, cold McDonald’s. My favorite” as love.Surge claims to vet its workers for qualifications — that people doing creative-writing tasks have experience with creative writing, for example — but exactly how Surge finds workers is “proprietary,” Chen said. As with Remotasks, workers often have to complete training courses, though unlike Remotasks, they are paid for it, according to the annotators I spoke with. Having fewer, better-trained workers producing higher-quality data allows Surge to compensate better than its peers, Chen said, though he declined to elaborate, saying only that people are paid “fair and ethical wages.” The workers I spoke with earned between $15 and $30 per hour, but they are a small sample of all the annotators, a group Chen said now consists of 100,000 people. The secrecy, he explained, stems from clients’ demands for confidentiality.Surge’s customers include OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic. Surge specializes in feedback and language annotation, and after ChatGPT launched, it got an influx of requests, Chen said: “I thought everybody knew the power of RLHF, but I guess people just didn’t viscerally understand.”The new models are so impressive they’ve inspired another round of predictions that annotation is about to be automated. Given the costs involved, there is significant financial pressure to do so. Anthropic, Meta, and other companies have recently made strides in using AI to drastically reduce the amount of human annotation needed to guide models, and other developers have started using GPT-4 to generate training data. However, a recent paper found that GPT-4-trained models may be learning to mimic GPT’s authoritative style with even less accuracy, and so far, when improvements in AI have made one form of annotation obsolete, demand for other, more sophisticated types of labeling has gone up. This debate spilled into the open earlier this year, when Scale’s CEO, Wang, tweeted that he predicted AI labs will soon be spending as many billions of dollars on human data as they do on computing power; OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, responded that data needs will decrease as AI improves.“I mean, what it can do is amazing,” she said of the chatbot. “But it still does some really weird shit.”Chen is skeptical AI will reach a point where human feedback is no longer needed, but he does see annotation becoming more difficult as models improve. Like many researchers, he believes the path forward will involve AI systems helping humans oversee other AI. Surge recently collaborated with Anthropic on a proof of concept, having human labelers answer questions about a lengthy text with the help of an unreliable AI assistant, on the theory that the humans would have to feel out the weaknesses of their AI assistant and collaborate to reason their way to the correct answer. Another possibility has two AIs debating each other and a human rendering the final verdict on which is correct. “We still have yet to see really good practical implementations of this stuff, but it’s starting to become necessary because it’s getting really hard for labelers to keep up with the models,” said OpenAI research scientist John Schulman in a recent talk at Berkeley.“I think you always need a human to monitor what AIs are doing just because they are this kind of alien entity,” Chen said. Machine-learning systems are just too strange ever to fully trust. The most impressive models today have what, to a human, seems like bizarre weaknesses, he added, pointing out that though GPT-4 can generate complex and convincing prose, it can’t pick out which words are adjectives: “Either that or models get so good that they’re better than humans at all things, in which case, you reach your utopia and who cares?”As 2022 ended, Joe started hearing from his students that their task queues were often empty. Then he got an email informing him the boot camps in Kenya were closing. He continued training taskers online, but he began to worry about the future.“There were signs that it was not going to last long,” he said. Annotation was leaving Kenya. From colleagues he had met online, he heard tasks were going to Nepal, India, and the Philippines. “The companies shift from one region to another,” Joe said. “They don’t have infrastructure locally, so it makes them flexible to shift to regions that favor them in terms of operation cost.”One way the AI industry differs from manufacturers of phones and cars is in its fluidity. The work is constantly changing, constantly getting automated away and replaced with new needs for new types of data. It’s an assembly line but one that can be endlessly and instantly reconfigured, moving to wherever there is the right combination of skills, bandwidth, and wages.Lately, the best-paying work is in the U.S. In May, Scale started listing annotation jobs on its own website, soliciting people with experience in practically every field AI is predicted to conquer. There were listings for AI trainers with expertise in health coaching, human resources, finance, economics, data science, programming, computer science, chemistry, biology, accounting, taxes, nutrition, physics, travel, K-12 education, sports journalism, and self-help. You can make $45 an hour teaching robots law or make $25 an hour teaching them poetry. There were also listings for people with security clearance, presumably to help train military AI. Scale recently launched a defense-oriented language model called Donovan, which Wang called “ammunition in the AI war,” and won a contract to work on the Army’s robotic-combat-vehicle program.Anna is still training chatbots in Texas. Colleagues have been turned into reviewers and Slack admins — she isn’t sure why, but it has given her hope that the gig could be a longer-term career. One thing she isn’t worried about is being automated out of a job. “I mean, what it can do is amazing,” she said of the chatbot. “But it still does some really weird shit.”When Remotasks first arrived in Kenya, Joe thought annotation could be a good career. Even after the work moved elsewhere, he was determined to make it one. There were thousands of people in Nairobi who knew how to do the work, he reasoned — he had trained many of them, after all. Joe rented office space in the city and began sourcing contracts: a job annotating blueprints for a construction company, another labeling fruits despoiled by insects for some sort of agricultural project, plus the usual work of annotating for self-driving cars and e-commerce.But he has found his vision difficult to achieve. He has just one full-time employee, down from two. “We haven’t been having a consistent flow of work,” he said. There are weeks with nothing to do because customers are still collecting data, and when they’re done, he has to bring in short-term contractors to meet their deadlines: “Clients don’t care whether we have consistent work or not. So long as the datasets have been completed, then that’s the end of that.”Rather than let their skills go to waste, other taskers decided to chase the work wherever it went. They rented proxy servers to disguise their locations and bought fake IDs to pass security checks so they could pretend to work from Singapore, the Netherlands, Mississippi, or wherever the tasks were flowing. It’s a risky business. Scale has become increasingly aggressive about suspending accounts caught disguising their location, according to multiple taskers. It was during one of these crackdowns that my account got banned, presumably because I had been using a VPN to see what workers in other countries were seeing, and all $1.50 or so of my earnings were seized.“These days, we have become a bit cunning because we noticed that in other countries they are paying well,” said Victor, who was earning double the Kenyan rate by tasking in Malaysia. “You do it cautiously.”Another Kenyan annotator said that after his account got suspended for mysterious reasons, he decided to stop playing by the rules. Now, he runs multiple accounts in multiple countries, tasking wherever the pay is best. He works fast and gets high marks for quality, he said, thanks to ChatGPT. The bot is wonderful, he said, letting him speed through $10 tasks in a matter of minutes. When we spoke, he was having it rate another chatbot’s responses according to seven different criteria, one AI training the other.Comments23 Comments / 23 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung’s new folds, flips, and Apple clones | The Vergecast

A few months after graduating from college in Nairobi, a 30-year-old I’ll call Joe got a job as an annotator — the tedious work of processing the raw information used to train artificial intelligence. AI learns by finding patterns in enormous quantities of data, but first that data has to be sorted and tagged by people, a vast workforce mostly hidden behind the machines. In Joe’s case, he was labeling footage for self-driving cars — identifying every vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist, anything a driver needs to be aware of — frame by frame and from every possible camera angle. It’s difficult and repetitive work. A several-second blip of footage took eight hours to annotate, for which Joe was paid about $10.

Then, in 2019, an opportunity arose: Joe could make four times as much running an annotation boot camp for a new company that was hungry for labelers. Every two weeks, 50 new recruits would file into an office building in Nairobi to begin their apprenticeships. There seemed to be limitless demand for the work. They would be asked to categorize clothing seen in mirror selfies, look through the eyes of robot vacuum cleaners to determine which rooms they were in, and draw squares around lidar scans of motorcycles. Over half of Joe’s students usually dropped out before the boot camp was finished. “Some people don’t know how to stay in one place for long,” he explained with gracious understatement. Also, he acknowledged, “it is very boring.”

But it was a job in a place where jobs were scarce, and Joe turned out hundreds of graduates. After boot camp, they went home to work alone in their bedrooms and kitchens, forbidden from telling anyone what they were working on, which wasn’t really a problem because they rarely knew themselves. Labeling objects for self-driving cars was obvious, but what about categorizing whether snippets of distorted dialogue were spoken by a robot or a human? Uploading photos of yourself staring into a webcam with a blank expression, then with a grin, then wearing a motorcycle helmet? Each project was such a small component of some larger process that it was difficult to say what they were actually training AI to do. Nor did the names of the projects offer any clues: Crab Generation, Whale Segment, Woodland Gyro, and Pillbox Bratwurst. They were non sequitur code names for non sequitur work.

As for the company employing them, most knew it only as Remotasks, a website offering work to anyone fluent in English. Like most of the annotators I spoke with, Joe was unaware until I told him that Remotasks is the worker-facing subsidiary of a company called Scale AI, a multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley data vendor that counts OpenAI and the U.S. military among its customers. Neither Remotasks’ or Scale’s website mentions the other.

Much of the public response to language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has focused on all the jobs they appear poised to automate. But behind even the most impressive AI system are people — huge numbers of people labeling data to train it and clarifying data when it gets confused. Only the companies that can afford to buy this data can compete, and those that get it are highly motivated to keep it secret. The result is that, with few exceptions, little is known about the information shaping these systems’ behavior, and even less is known about the people doing the shaping.

For Joe’s students, it was work stripped of all its normal trappings: a schedule, colleagues, knowledge of what they were working on or whom they were working for. In fact, they rarely called it work at all — just “tasking.” They were taskers.

The anthropologist David Graeber defines “bullshit jobs” as employment without meaning or purpose, work that should be automated but for reasons of bureaucracy or status or inertia is not. These AI jobs are their bizarro twin: work that people want to automate, and often think is already automated, yet still requires a human stand-in. The jobs have a purpose; it’s just that workers often have no idea what it is.

The current AI boom — the convincingly human-sounding chatbots, the artwork that can be generated from simple prompts, and the multibillion-dollar valuations of the companies behind these technologies — began with an unprecedented feat of tedious and repetitive labor.

In 2007, the AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, then a professor at Princeton, suspected the key to improving image-recognition neural networks, a method of machine learning that had been languishing for years, was training on more data — millions of labeled images rather than tens of thousands. The problem was that it would take decades and millions of dollars for her team of undergrads to label that many photos.

Li found thousands of workers on Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform where people around the world complete small tasks for cheap. The resulting annotated dataset, called ImageNet, enabled breakthroughs in machine learning that revitalized the field and ushered in a decade of progress.

Annotation remains a foundational part of making AI, but there is often a sense among engineers that it’s a passing, inconvenient prerequisite to the more glamorous work of building models. You collect as much labeled data as you can get as cheaply as possible to train your model, and if it works, at least in theory, you no longer need the annotators. But annotation is never really finished. Machine-learning systems are what researchers call “brittle,” prone to fail when encountering something that isn’t well represented in their training data. These failures, called “edge cases,” can have serious consequences. In 2018, an Uber self-driving test car killed a woman because, though it was programmed to avoid cyclists and pedestrians, it didn’t know what to make of someone walking a bike across the street. The more AI systems are put out into the world to dispense legal advice and medical help, the more edge cases they will encounter and the more humans will be needed to sort them. Already, this has given rise to a global industry staffed by people like Joe who use their uniquely human faculties to help the machines.

""Is that a red shirt with white stripes or a white shirt with red stripes? Is a wicker bowl a “decorative bowl” if it’s full of apples? What color is leopard print?""

Over the past six months, I spoke with more than two dozen annotators from around the world, and while many of them were training cutting-edge chatbots, just as many were doing the mundane manual labor required to keep AI running. There are people classifying the emotional content of TikTok videos, new variants of email spam, and the precise sexual provocativeness of online ads. Others are looking at credit-card transactions and figuring out what sort of purchase they relate to or checking e-commerce recommendations and deciding whether that shirt is really something you might like after buying that other shirt. Humans are correcting customer-service chatbots, listening to Alexa requests, and categorizing the emotions of people on video calls. They are labeling food so that smart refrigerators don’t get confused by new packaging, checking automated security cameras before sounding alarms, and identifying corn for baffled autonomous tractors.

“There’s an entire supply chain,” said Sonam Jindal, the program and research lead of the nonprofit Partnership on AI. “The general perception in the industry is that this work isn’t a critical part of development and isn’t going to be needed for long. All the excitement is around building artificial intelligence, and once we build that, it won’t be needed anymore, so why think about it? But it’s infrastructure for AI. Human intelligence is the basis of artificial intelligence, and we need to be valuing these as real jobs in the AI economy that are going to be here for a while.”

The data vendors behind familiar names like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft come in different forms. There are private outsourcing companies with call-center-like offices, such as the Kenya- and Nepal-based CloudFactory, where Joe annotated for $1.20 an hour before switching to Remotasks. There are also “crowdworking” sites like Mechanical Turk and Clickworker where anyone can sign up to perform tasks. In the middle are services like Scale AI. Anyone can sign up, but everyone has to pass qualification exams and training courses and undergo performance monitoring. Annotation is big business. Scale, founded in 2016 by then-19-year-old Alexandr Wang, was valued in 2021 at $7.3 billion, making him what Forbes called “the youngest self-made billionaire,” though the magazine noted in a recent profile that his stake has fallen on secondary markets since then.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tzXNAIWOaBlv7KbHabZQPNgOKvU=/0x0:2048x1500/2048x1500/filters:focal(1024x750:1025x751)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24738135/236709_ai_data_notation_labor_scale_surge_remotasks_openai_chatbots_RParry_003_2.jpg]

This tangled supply chain is deliberately hard to map. According to people in the industry, the companies buying the data demand strict confidentiality. (This is the reason Scale cited to explain why Remotasks has a different name.) Annotation reveals too much about the systems being developed, and the huge number of workers required makes leaks difficult to prevent. Annotators are warned repeatedly not to tell anyone about their jobs, not even their friends and co-workers, but corporate aliases, project code names, and, crucially, the extreme division of labor ensure they don’t have enough information about them to talk even if they wanted to. (Most workers requested pseudonyms for fear of being booted from the platforms.) Consequently, there are no granular estimates of the number of people who work in annotation, but it is a lot, and it is growing. A recent Google Research paper gave an order-of-magnitude figure of “millions” with the potential to become “billions.”

Automation often unfolds in unexpected ways. Erik Duhaime, CEO of medical-data-annotation company Centaur Labs, recalled how, several years ago, prominent machine-learning engineers were predicting AI would make the job of radiologist obsolete. When that didn’t happen, conventional wisdom shifted to radiologists using AI as a tool. Neither of those is quite what he sees occurring. AI is very good at specific tasks, Duhaime said, and that leads work to be broken up and distributed across a system of specialized algorithms and to equally specialized humans. An AI system might be capable of spotting cancer, he said, giving a hypothetical example, but only in a certain type of imagery from a certain type of machine; so now, you need a human to check that the AI is being fed the right type of data and maybe another human who checks its work before passing it to another AI that writes a report, which goes to another human, and so on. “AI doesn’t replace work,” he said. “But it does change how work is organized.”

You might miss this if you believe AI is a brilliant, thinking machine. But if you pull back the curtain even a little, it looks more familiar, the latest iteration of a particularly Silicon Valley division of labor, in which the futuristic gleam of new technologies hides a sprawling manufacturing apparatus and the people who make it run. Duhaime reached back farther for a comparison, a digital version of the transition from craftsmen to industrial manufacturing: coherent processes broken into tasks and arrayed along assembly lines with some steps done by machines and some by humans but none resembling what came before.

Worries about AI-driven disruption are often countered with the argument that AI automates tasks, not jobs, and that these tasks will be the dull ones, leaving people to pursue more fulfilling and human work. But just as likely, the rise of AI will look like past labor-saving technologies, maybe like the telephone or typewriter, which vanquished the drudgery of message delivering and handwriting but generated so much new correspondence, commerce, and paperwork that new offices staffed by new types of workers — clerks, accountants, typists — were required to manage it. When AI comes for your job, you may not lose it, but it might become more alien, more isolating, more tedious.

Earlier this year, I signed up for Scale AI’s Remotasks. The process was straightforward. After entering my computer specs, internet speed, and some basic contact information, I found myself in the “training center.” To access a paying task, I first had to complete an associated (unpaid) intro course.

The training center displayed a range of courses with inscrutable names like Glue Swimsuit and Poster Macadamia. I clicked on something called GFD Chunking, which revealed itself to be labeling clothing in social-media photos.

The instructions, however, were odd. For one, they basically consisted of the same direction reiterated in the idiosyncratically colored and capitalized typography of a collaged bomb threat.

“DO LABEL items that are real and can be worn by humans or are intended to be worn by real people,” it read.

“All items below SHOULD be labeled because they are real and can be worn by real-life humans,” it reiterated above photos of an Air Jordans ad, someone in a Kylo Ren helmet, and mannequins in dresses, over which was a lime-green box explaining, once again, “DO Label real items that can be worn by real people.”

I skimmed to the bottom of the manual, where the instructor had written in the large bright-red font equivalent of grabbing someone by the shoulders and shaking them, “THE FOLLOWING ITEMS SHOULD NOT BE LABELED because a human could not actually put wear any of these items!” above a photo of C-3PO, Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, and a cartoon shoe with eyeballs.

Feeling confident in my ability to distinguish between real clothes that can be worn by real people and not-real clothes that cannot, I proceeded to the test. Right away, it threw an ontological curveball: a picture of a magazine depicting photos of women in dresses. Is a photograph of clothing real clothing? No, I thought, because a human cannot wear a photograph of clothing. Wrong! As far as AI is concerned, photos of real clothes are real clothes. Next came a photo of a woman in a dimly lit bedroom taking a selfie before a full-length mirror. The blouse and shorts she’s wearing are real. What about their reflection? Also real! Reflections of real clothes are also real clothes.

After an embarrassing amount of trial and error, I made it to the actual work, only to make the horrifying discovery that the instructions I’d been struggling to follow had been updated and clarified so many times that they were now a full 43 printed pages of directives: Do NOT label open suitcases full of clothes; DO label shoes but do NOT label flippers; DO label leggings but do NOT label tights; do NOT label towels even if someone is wearing it; label costumes but do NOT label armor. And so on.

There has been general instruction disarray across the industry, according to Milagros Miceli, a researcher at the Weizenbaum Institute in Germany who studies data work. It is in part a product of the way machine-learning systems learn. Where a human would get the concept of “shirt” with a few examples, machine-learning programs need thousands, and they need to be categorized with perfect consistency yet varied enough (polo shirts, shirts being worn outdoors, shirts hanging on a rack) that the very literal system can handle the diversity of the real world. “Imagine simplifying complex realities into something that is readable for a machine that is totally dumb,” she said.

""Once, Victor stayed up 36 hours straight labeling elbows and knees and heads in photographs of crowds — he has no idea why.""

The act of simplifying reality for a machine results in a great deal of complexity for the human. Instruction writers must come up with rules that will get humans to categorize the world with perfect consistency. To do so, they often create categories no human would use. A human asked to tag all the shirts in a photo probably wouldn’t tag the reflection of a shirt in a mirror because they would know it is a reflection and not real. But to the AI, which has no understanding of the world, it’s all just pixels and the two are perfectly identical. Fed a dataset with some shirts labeled and other (reflected) shirts unlabeled, the model won’t work. So the engineer goes back to the vendor with an update: DO label reflections of shirts. Soon, you have a 43-page guide descending into red all-caps.

“When you start off, the rules are relatively simple,” said a former Scale employee who requested anonymity because of an NDA. “Then they get back a thousand images and then they’re like, Wait a second, and then you have multiple engineers and they start to argue with each other. It’s very much a human thing.”

The job of the annotator often involves putting human understanding aside and following instructions very, very literally — to think, as one annotator said, like a robot. It’s a strange mental space to inhabit, doing your best to follow nonsensical but rigorous rules, like taking a standardized test while on hallucinogens. Annotators invariably end up confronted with confounding questions like, Is that a red shirt with white stripes or a white shirt with red stripes? Is a wicker bowl a “decorative bowl” if it’s full of apples? What color is leopard print? When instructors said to label traffic-control directors, did they also mean to label traffic-control directors eating lunch on the sidewalk? Every question must be answered, and a wrong guess could get you banned and booted to a new, totally different task with its own baffling rules.

Most of the work on Remotasks is paid at a piece rate with a single task earning anywhere from a few cents to several dollars. Because tasks can take seconds or hours, wages are hard to predict. When Remotasks first arrived in Kenya, annotators said it paid relatively well — averaging about $5 to $10 per hour depending on the task — but the amount fell as time went on.

Scale AI spokesperson Anna Franko said that the company’s economists analyze the specifics of a project, the skills required, the regional cost of living, and other factors “to ensure fair and competitive compensation.” Former Scale employees also said pay is determined through a surge-pricing-like mechanism that adjusts for how many annotators are available and how quickly the data is needed.

According to workers I spoke with and job listings, U.S.-based Remotasks annotators generally earn between $10 and $25 per hour, though some subject-matter experts can make more. By the beginning of this year, pay for the Kenyan annotators I spoke with had dropped to between $1 and $3 per hour.

That is, when they were making any money at all. The most common complaint about Remotasks work is its variability; it’s steady enough to be a full-time job for long stretches but too unpredictable to rely on. Annotators spend hours reading instructions and completing unpaid trainings only to do a dozen tasks and then have the project end. There might be nothing new for days, then, without warning, a totally different task appears and could last anywhere from a few hours to weeks. Any task could be their last, and they never know when the next one will come.

This boom-and-bust cycle results from the cadence of AI development, according to engineers and data vendors. Training a large model requires an enormous amount of annotation followed by more iterative updates, and engineers want it all as fast as possible so they can hit their target launch date. There may be monthslong demand for thousands of annotators, then for only a few hundred, then for a dozen specialists of a certain type, and then thousands again. “The question is, Who bears the cost for these fluctuations?” said Jindal of Partnership on AI. “Because right now, it’s the workers.”

""“I really am wasting my life here if I made somebody a billionaire and I’m earning a couple of bucks a week.”""

To succeed, annotators work together. When I told Victor, who started working for Remotasks while at university in Nairobi, about my struggles with the traffic-control-directors task, he told me everyone knew to stay away from that one: too tricky, bad pay, not worth it. Like a lot of annotators, Victor uses unofficial WhatsApp groups to spread the word when a good task drops. When he figures out a new one, he starts impromptu Google Meets to show others how it’s done. Anyone can join and work together for a time, sharing tips. “It’s a culture we have developed of helping each other because we know when on your own, you can’t know all the tricks,” he said.

Because work appears and vanishes without warning, taskers always need to be on alert. Victor has found that projects pop up very late at night, so he is in the habit of waking every three hours or so to check his queue. When a task is there, he’ll stay awake as long as he can to work. Once, he stayed up 36 hours straight labeling elbows and knees and heads in photographs of crowds — he has no idea why. Another time, he stayed up so long his mother asked him what was wrong with his eyes. He looked in the mirror to discover they were swollen.

Annotators generally know only that they are training AI for companies located vaguely elsewhere, but sometimes the veil of anonymity drops — instructions mentioning a brand or a chatbot say too much. “I read and I Googled and found I am working for a 25-year-old billionaire,” said one worker, who, when we spoke, was labeling the emotions of people calling to order Domino’s pizza. “I really am wasting my life here if I made somebody a billionaire and I’m earning a couple of bucks a week.”

Victor is a self-proclaimed “fanatic” about AI and started annotating because he wants to help bring about a fully automated post-work future. But earlier this year, someone dropped a Time story into one of his WhatsApp groups about workers training ChatGPT to recognize toxic content who were getting paid less than $2 an hour by the vendor Sama AI. “People were angry that these companies are so profitable but paying so poorly,” Victor said. He was unaware until I told him about Remotasks’ connection to Scale. Instructions for one of the tasks he worked on were nearly identical to those used by OpenAI, which meant he had likely been training ChatGPT as well, for approximately $3 per hour.

“I remember that someone posted that we will be remembered in the future,” he said. “And somebody else replied, ‘We are being treated worse than foot soldiers. We will be remembered nowhere in the future.’ I remember that very well. Nobody will recognize the work we did or the effort we put in.”

Identifying clothing and labeling customer-service conversations are just some of the annotation gigs available. Lately, the hottest on the market has been chatbot trainer. Because it demands specific areas of expertise or language fluency and wages are often adjusted regionally, this job tends to pay better. Certain types of specialist annotation can go for $50 or more per hour.

A woman I’ll call Anna was searching for a job in Texas when she stumbled across a generic listing for online work and applied. It was Remotasks, and after passing an introductory exam, she was brought into a Slack room of 1,500 people who were training a project code-named Dolphin, which she later discovered to be Google DeepMind’s chatbot, Sparrow, one of the many bots competing with ChatGPT. Her job is to talk with it all day. At about $14 an hour, plus bonuses for high productivity, “it definitely beats getting paid $10 an hour at the local Dollar General store,” she said.

Also, she enjoys it. She has discussed science-fiction novels, mathematical paradoxes, children’s riddles, and TV shows. Sometimes the bot’s responses make her laugh; other times, she runs out of things to talk about. “Some days, my brain is just like, I literally have no idea what on earth to ask it now,” she said. “So I have a little notebook, and I’ve written about two pages of things — I just Google interesting topics — so I think I’ll be good for seven hours today, but that’s not always the case.”

Each time Anna prompts Sparrow, it delivers two responses and she picks the best one, thereby creating something called “human-feedback data.” When ChatGPT debuted late last year, its impressively natural-seeming conversational style was credited to its having been trained on troves of internet data. But the language that fuels ChatGPT and its competitors is filtered through several rounds of human annotation. One group of contractors writes examples of how the engineers want the bot to behave, creating questions followed by correct answers, descriptions of computer programs followed by functional code, and requests for tips on committing crimes followed by polite refusals. After the model is trained on these examples, yet more contractors are brought in to prompt it and rank its responses. This is what Anna is doing with Sparrow. Exactly which criteria the raters are told to use varies — honesty, or helpfulness, or just personal preference. The point is that they are creating data on human taste, and once there’s enough of it, engineers can train a second model to mimic their preferences at scale, automating the ranking process and training their AI to act in ways humans approve of. The result is a remarkably human-seeming bot that mostly declines harmful requests and explains its AI nature with seeming self-awareness.

Put another way, ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJ1voW9GJtnRC0ZSvYAl9KHBH-c=/0x0:2048x1514/2048x1514/filters:focal(1024x757:1025x758)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24738136/236709_ai_data_notation_labor_scale_surge_remotasks_openai_chatbots_RParry_004_2.jpg]

This circuitous technique is called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, and it’s so effective that it’s worth pausing to fully register what it doesn’t do. When annotators teach a model to be accurate, for example, the model isn’t learning to check answers against logic or external sources or about what accuracy as a concept even is. The model is still a text-prediction machine mimicking patterns in human writing, but now its training corpus has been supplemented with bespoke examples, and the model has been weighted to favor them. Maybe this results in the model extracting patterns from the part of its linguistic map labeled as accurate and producing text that happens to align with the truth, but it can also result in it mimicking the confident style and expert jargon of the accurate text while writing things that are totally wrong. There is no guarantee that the text the labelers marked as accurate is in fact accurate, and when it is, there is no guarantee that the model learns the right patterns from it.

This dynamic makes chatbot annotation a delicate process. It has to be rigorous and consistent because sloppy feedback, like marking material that merely sounds correct as accurate, risks training models to be even more convincing bullshitters. An early OpenAI and DeepMind joint project using RLHF, in this case to train a virtual robot hand to grab an item, resulted in also training the robot to position its hand between the object and its raters and wiggle around such that it only appeared to its human overseers to grab the item. Ranking a language model’s responses is always going to be somewhat subjective because it’s language. A text of any length will have multiple elements that could be right or wrong or, taken together, misleading. OpenAI researchers ran into this obstacle in another early RLHF paper. Trying to get their model to summarize text, the researchers found they agreed only 60 percent of the time that a summary was good. “Unlike many tasks in [machine learning] our queries do not have unambiguous ground truth,” they lamented.

When Anna rates Sparrow’s responses, she’s supposed to be looking at their accuracy, helpfulness, and harmlessness while also checking that the model isn’t giving medical or financial advice or anthropomorphizing itself or running afoul of other criteria. To be useful training data, the model’s responses have to be quantifiably ranked against one another: Is a bot that helpfully tells you how to make a bomb “better” than a bot that’s so harmless it refuses to answer any questions? In one DeepMind paper, when Sparrow’s makers took a turn annotating, four researchers wound up debating whether their bot had assumed the gender of a user who asked it for relationship advice. According to Geoffrey Irving, one of DeepMind’s research scientists, the company’s researchers hold weekly annotation meetings in which they rerate data themselves and discuss ambiguous cases, consulting with ethical or subject-matter experts when a case is particularly tricky.

""There are people classifying the emotional content of TikTok videos, new variants of email spam, and the precise sexual provocativeness of online ads.""

Anna often finds herself having to choose between two bad options. “Even if they’re both absolutely, ridiculously wrong, you still have to figure out which one is better and then write words explaining why,” she said. Sometimes, when both responses are bad, she’s encouraged to write a better response herself, which she does about half the time.

Because feedback data is difficult to collect, it fetches a higher price. Basic preferences of the sort Anna is producing sell for about $1 each, according to people with knowledge of the industry. But if you want to train a model to do legal research, you need someone with training in law, and this gets expensive. Everyone involved is reluctant to say how much they’re spending, but in general, specialized written examples can go for hundreds of dollars, while expert ratings can cost $50 or more. One engineer told me about buying examples of Socratic dialogues for up to $300 a pop. Another told me about paying $15 for a “darkly funny limerick about a goldfish.”

OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic did not comment about how many people contribute annotations to their models, how much they are paid, or where in the world they are located. Irving of DeepMind, which is a subsidiary of Google, said the annotators working on Sparrow are paid “at least the hourly living wage” based on their location. Anna knows “absolutely nothing” about Remotasks, but Sparrow has been more open. She wasn’t the only annotator I spoke with who got more information from the AI they were training than from their employer; several others learned whom they were working for by asking their AI for its company’s terms of service. “I literally asked it, ‘What is your purpose, Sparrow?’” Anna said. It pulled up a link to DeepMind’s website and explained that it’s an AI assistant and that its creators trained it using RLHF to be helpful and safe.

Until recently, it was relatively easy to spot bad output from a language model. It looked like gibberish. But this gets harder as the models get better — a problem called “scalable oversight.” Google inadvertently demonstrated how hard it is to catch the errors of a modern-language model when one made it into the splashy debut of its AI assistant, Bard. (It stated confidently that the James Webb Space Telescope “took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system,” which is wrong.) This trajectory means annotation increasingly requires specific skills and expertise.

Last year, someone I’ll call Lewis was working on Mechanical Turk when, after completing a task, he received a message inviting him to apply for a platform he hadn’t heard of. It was called Taskup.ai, and its website was remarkably basic: just a navy background with text reading GET PAID FOR TASKS ON DEMAND. He applied.

The work paid far better than anything he had tried before, often around $30 an hour. It was more challenging, too: devising complex scenarios to trick chatbots into giving dangerous advice, testing a model’s ability to stay in character, and having detailed conversations about scientific topics so technical they required extensive research. He found the work “satisfying and stimulating.” While checking one model’s attempts to code in Python, Lewis was learning too. He couldn’t work for more than four hours at a stretch, lest he risk becoming mentally drained and making mistakes, and he wanted to keep the job.

“If there was one thing I could change, I would just like to have more information about what happens on the other end,” he said. “We only know as much as we need to know to get work done, but if I could know more, then maybe I could get more established and perhaps pursue this as a career.”

I spoke with eight other workers, most based in the U.S., who had similar experiences of answering surveys or completing tasks on other platforms and finding themselves recruited for Taskup.ai or several similarly generic sites, such as DataAnnotation.tech or Gethybrid.io. Often their work involved training chatbots, though with higher-quality expectations and more specialized purposes than other sites they had worked for. One was demonstrating spreadsheet macros. Another was just supposed to have conversations and rate responses according to whatever criteria she wanted. She often asked the chatbot things that had come up in conversations with her 7-year-old daughter, like “What is the largest dinosaur?” and “Write a story about a tiger.” “I haven’t fully gotten my head around what they’re trying to do with it,” she told me.

Taskup.ai, DataAnnotation.tech, and Gethybrid.io all appear to be owned by the same company: Surge AI. Its CEO, Edwin Chen, would neither confirm nor deny the connection, but he was willing to talk about his company and how he sees annotation evolving.

“I’ve always felt the annotation landscape is overly simplistic,” Chen said over a video call from Surge’s office. He founded Surge in 2020 after working on AI at Google, Facebook, and Twitter convinced him that crowdsourced labeling was inadequate. “We want AI to tell jokes or write really good marketing copy or help me out when I need therapy or whatnot,” Chen said. “You can’t ask five people to independently come up with a joke and combine it into a majority answer. Not everybody can tell a joke or solve a Python program. The annotation landscape needs to shift from this low-quality, low-skill mind-set to something that’s much richer and captures the range of human skills and creativity and values that we want AI systems to possess.”

Last year, Surge relabeled Google’s dataset classifying Reddit posts by emotion. Google had stripped each post of context and sent them to workers in India for labeling. Surge employees familiar with American internet culture found that 30 percent of the labels were wrong. Posts like “hell yeah my brother” had been classified as annoyance and “Yay, cold McDonald’s. My favorite” as love.

Surge claims to vet its workers for qualifications — that people doing creative-writing tasks have experience with creative writing, for example — but exactly how Surge finds workers is “proprietary,” Chen said. As with Remotasks, workers often have to complete training courses, though unlike Remotasks, they are paid for it, according to the annotators I spoke with. Having fewer, better-trained workers producing higher-quality data allows Surge to compensate better than its peers, Chen said, though he declined to elaborate, saying only that people are paid “fair and ethical wages.” The workers I spoke with earned between $15 and $30 per hour, but they are a small sample of all the annotators, a group Chen said now consists of 100,000 people. The secrecy, he explained, stems from clients’ demands for confidentiality.

Surge’s customers include OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic. Surge specializes in feedback and language annotation, and after ChatGPT launched, it got an influx of requests, Chen said: “I thought everybody knew the power of RLHF, but I guess people just didn’t viscerally understand.”

The new models are so impressive they’ve inspired another round of predictions that annotation is about to be automated. Given the costs involved, there is significant financial pressure to do so. Anthropic, Meta, and other companies have recently made strides in using AI to drastically reduce the amount of human annotation needed to guide models, and other developers have started using GPT-4 to generate training data. However, a recent paper found that GPT-4-trained models may be learning to mimic GPT’s authoritative style with even less accuracy, and so far, when improvements in AI have made one form of annotation obsolete, demand for other, more sophisticated types of labeling has gone up. This debate spilled into the open earlier this year, when Scale’s CEO, Wang, tweeted that he predicted AI labs will soon be spending as many billions of dollars on human data as they do on computing power; OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, responded that data needs will decrease as AI improves.

""“I mean, what it can do is amazing,” she said of the chatbot. “But it still does some really weird shit.”""

Chen is skeptical AI will reach a point where human feedback is no longer needed, but he does see annotation becoming more difficult as models improve. Like many researchers, he believes the path forward will involve AI systems helping humans oversee other AI. Surge recently collaborated with Anthropic on a proof of concept, having human labelers answer questions about a lengthy text with the help of an unreliable AI assistant, on the theory that the humans would have to feel out the weaknesses of their AI assistant and collaborate to reason their way to the correct answer. Another possibility has two AIs debating each other and a human rendering the final verdict on which is correct. “We still have yet to see really good practical implementations of this stuff, but it’s starting to become necessary because it’s getting really hard for labelers to keep up with the models,” said OpenAI research scientist John Schulman in a recent talk at Berkeley.

“I think you always need a human to monitor what AIs are doing just because they are this kind of alien entity,” Chen said. Machine-learning systems are just too strange ever to fully trust. The most impressive models today have what, to a human, seems like bizarre weaknesses, he added, pointing out that though GPT-4 can generate complex and convincing prose, it can’t pick out which words are adjectives: “Either that or models get so good that they’re better than humans at all things, in which case, you reach your utopia and who cares?”

As 2022 ended, Joe started hearing from his students that their task queues were often empty. Then he got an email informing him the boot camps in Kenya were closing. He continued training taskers online, but he began to worry about the future.

“There were signs that it was not going to last long,” he said. Annotation was leaving Kenya. From colleagues he had met online, he heard tasks were going to Nepal, India, and the Philippines. “The companies shift from one region to another,” Joe said. “They don’t have infrastructure locally, so it makes them flexible to shift to regions that favor them in terms of operation cost.”

One way the AI industry differs from manufacturers of phones and cars is in its fluidity. The work is constantly changing, constantly getting automated away and replaced with new needs for new types of data. It’s an assembly line but one that can be endlessly and instantly reconfigured, moving to wherever there is the right combination of skills, bandwidth, and wages.

Lately, the best-paying work is in the U.S. In May, Scale started listing annotation jobs on its own website, soliciting people with experience in practically every field AI is predicted to conquer. There were listings for AI trainers with expertise in health coaching, human resources, finance, economics, data science, programming, computer science, chemistry, biology, accounting, taxes, nutrition, physics, travel, K-12 education, sports journalism, and self-help. You can make $45 an hour teaching robots law or make $25 an hour teaching them poetry. There were also listings for people with security clearance, presumably to help train military AI. Scale recently launched a defense-oriented language model called Donovan, which Wang called “ammunition in the AI war,” and won a contract to work on the Army’s robotic-combat-vehicle program.

Anna is still training chatbots in Texas. Colleagues have been turned into reviewers and Slack admins — she isn’t sure why, but it has given her hope that the gig could be a longer-term career. One thing she isn’t worried about is being automated out of a job. “I mean, what it can do is amazing,” she said of the chatbot. “But it still does some really weird shit.”

When Remotasks first arrived in Kenya, Joe thought annotation could be a good career. Even after the work moved elsewhere, he was determined to make it one. There were thousands of people in Nairobi who knew how to do the work, he reasoned — he had trained many of them, after all. Joe rented office space in the city and began sourcing contracts: a job annotating blueprints for a construction company, another labeling fruits despoiled by insects for some sort of agricultural project, plus the usual work of annotating for self-driving cars and e-commerce.

But he has found his vision difficult to achieve. He has just one full-time employee, down from two. “We haven’t been having a consistent flow of work,” he said. There are weeks with nothing to do because customers are still collecting data, and when they’re done, he has to bring in short-term contractors to meet their deadlines: “Clients don’t care whether we have consistent work or not. So long as the datasets have been completed, then that’s the end of that.”

Rather than let their skills go to waste, other taskers decided to chase the work wherever it went. They rented proxy servers to disguise their locations and bought fake IDs to pass security checks so they could pretend to work from Singapore, the Netherlands, Mississippi, or wherever the tasks were flowing. It’s a risky business. Scale has become increasingly aggressive about suspending accounts caught disguising their location, according to multiple taskers. It was during one of these crackdowns that my account got banned, presumably because I had been using a VPN to see what workers in other countries were seeing, and all $1.50 or so of my earnings were seized.

“These days, we have become a bit cunning because we noticed that in other countries they are paying well,” said Victor, who was earning double the Kenyan rate by tasking in Malaysia. “You do it cautiously.”

Another Kenyan annotator said that after his account got suspended for mysterious reasons, he decided to stop playing by the rules. Now, he runs multiple accounts in multiple countries, tasking wherever the pay is best. He works fast and gets high marks for quality, he said, thanks to ChatGPT. The bot is wonderful, he said, letting him speed through $10 tasks in a matter of minutes. When we spoke, he was having it rate another chatbot’s responses according to seven different criteria, one AI training the other.

One of the many topics involving generative AI that is receiving a lot of attention is its potential effects on Hollywood and the entertainment industry. It’s an obvious concern because generative AI can create the types of outputs that the industry uses — text (in the form of stories, scripts, ad copy, and reviews), marketing campaigns, and moving and static images. Segments of the industry are facing economic pressures, which increases the demand for productivity and less-expensive “product.” And a high percentage of current entertainment is derivative of past content, which makes it well suited for generative technologies that are trained on … past content. 
It’s still early days for generative AI-created entertainment, but it’s clear that something big is happening. A recent Wall Street Journal article noted that widely available AI tools can suggest storylines, character arcs, and dialogue; it even includes an interactive module that lets readers see for themselves how easily ChatGPT can write a basic script when given a few prompts. The article also raises questions about image intellectual property: “If a user prompts an AI tool to build a new character influenced by say, SpongeBob, should the original creators have to grant permission? Who owns it? Can the new work itself be copyrighted?”

Generative AI was used in making the 2022 film Everything Everywhere All at Once, and we know how that turned out. Tom recently wrote about the use of generative AI to create movie and TV backdrop images. There are already generative AI systems that can create videos, although they are short and relatively primitive. AI is being used to provide data-driven predictions about how unusual storylines will land with viewers.
So, what does this mean for the industry? There are many different components to this question, as a new report from Variety Intelligence Platform suggests. In May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike, primarily over film and TV writers’ income from streaming services programming, but it also demanded that production companies “regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies.” Because there are so many uncertainties about what will happen when and how with the technology, we spoke with two experts on the topic. Both are based in — not surprisingly — Los Angeles, and both are involved with centers at the University of Southern California (USC). However, they don’t work together, and they have very different approaches to the technology. 









Resolutely Against Generative AI
Jonathan Taplin is director emeritus at the Annenberg Innovation Lab at USC. He’s had a long career in the entertainment industry and was previously a tour manager for musicians, including Bob Dylan and The Band. In addition, he’s been a film producer, a banker, and a writer. His latest book, The End of Reality: How Four Billionaires Are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto, will be released in September. As you might infer from the title, he’s not a fan of how big tech firms’ generative AI tools are being developed or promulgated. 
“The way they train their models is by ingesting everything on the internet, with no concern for copyright,” Taplin told us. “Google has a music-generation AI trained on every audio file on YouTube. You can issue a prompt like ‘Write me a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, sad ending, up-tempo,’ and the resulting song sounds somewhat like her. Someone could include it in a video game or a bar scene in a movie for free.” Generative AI could do the same kind of repurposing with video content owned by the studios, he added. 
Taplin’s primary concern is that generative AI will replace some of the work done by human writers, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals in the arts and entertainment industry. He also believes that it will exacerbate problems that are already bringing the film and TV industry down. “The biggest problem in the movies is too many formulas. There is a lack of originality, and that’s why the industry isn’t performing,” he said. Generative AI, he added, is only capable of producing even more formulaic content and will make the predictability worse. “Entertainment relies on new ideas, and this technology can’t produce them,” Taplin added.
He said he’s concerned that generative AI will continue to reduce the number of performers who can make a living in their fields. The majority of entertainment revenue already goes to a very small percentage of artists. This is the reality for musicians, especially on streaming services, and is echoed in Hollywood in the huge box office revenues generated by a handful of leading actors in blockbuster films. When you get an “algorithmic economy,” Taplin said, “the algorithms narrow the funnel, with outsize paychecks for a few.” He’s hopeful that a collective licensing regime — similar to what’s in place for music sampling — will emerge to protect artists when their content is used to train generative AI. 
Embracing Generative AI, With Some Concerns
Yves Bergquist is director of the AI & Neuroscience in Media Project at USC’s Entertainment Technology Center, which is funded by Hollywood studios. You can guess that his opinion of generative AI is probably much more favorable than Taplin’s. It is, although he said he does have some concerns about AI’s potential effects on the media and entertainment industry: “It’s a completely revolutionary technology” characterized by misinformation and “some insanity.” 
We asked Bergquist whether movie studios would embrace generative AI. Parts of them are already doing so, he said. “Some groups within the studios are highly technologically savvy, such as the chief technology officers and all of the visual effects artists and technicians. They are very sophisticated and are already working with generative AI companies. The studios do a lot of the postproduction work in films — particularly in animation — and there is a lot of pressure to bring costs down. The postproduction companies have a software development culture, so they will embrace generative AI.”
He also believes that many production companies will embrace the technology because they are already shooting on large LED-based screens and will need generative images for them. Bergquist said he expects that tools offering virtual actors and voice synthesis will be most aggressively adopted by short-form creators who distribute their work on TikTok or YouTube and by video game producers. “Streaming channels, digital ads, games — that’s what kids watch these days,” he noted. “The media industry no longer has a monopoly on entertainment.” Makers of hardware (such as cameras) are experimenting with generative in-camera visual effects as well.

The business side of traditional movie studios is sometimes more reluctant to embrace AI, Bergquist observed, simply because they don’t have the same kind of culture of data or software. “It’s being bolted onto organizations and people who aren’t ready,” he said. Even the new streaming studios, like Netflix and Prime Video, have experienced a lot of growing pains in their AI journeys. 
Bergquist said that before the WGA strike started in May, many screenwriters told him that they view the likes of ChatGPT as a “great creative assistant tool” but not something that will replace human writers. “It’s good at brainstorming ideas, but it will output only average content,” Bergquist asserted. “It’s nowhere near capable of the symbolic abstraction necessary for script development, and it can’t output a script with narrative structure and character arcs.” At least not now. Future language models with higher levels of intelligence and new paradigms for AI might be able to do so.

Davenport and Randy Bean     
Bergquist thinks generative AI will have enormous effects not only on entertainment but also on education. He believes that schools, including the School of Cinematic Arts at USC, need to quickly ramp up their teaching to keep pace with the frenzy of new generative AI tools that are released nearly every week. Bergquist is preparing courses himself on the technology for the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers, an organization that represents technologists in media.
Are Both Experts Right?
Although Taplin and Bergquist seem to have very different views on generative AI, they might both be right about its impacts. Economic pressures may entice the industry — at least some sectors of it — to embrace these new tools. Generative AI will lead to dramatic changes in production and postproduction, distribution, and intellectual property ownership. The technology may not be good for traditional artists and the companies that employ them, but it is likely to lead to significant changes in the industry over the next few years — hopefully some for the better along with some for the worse. Perhaps the only purely good news is that neither expert expects that humans will be entirely replaced anytime soon.

Generative AI could have the biggest workplace impacts on high earners, per a McKinsey report.
This is because recent iterations have focused on improving cognitive skills, the analysts wrote.
They said AI could substantially boost labor productivity but workers would need help retraining.

Generative AI could have the biggest workplace impacts on high earners, and especially people in knowledge work with activities involving decision-making and collaboration, research by consultancy giant McKinsey has found.Because of improvements in generative AI's ability to understand natural language and advances in technical automation potential, generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that consume between 60% and 70% of employees' time, McKinsey analysts wrote in the report. At some point between 2030 and 2060, half of today's work activities could be automated, they wrote.

Generative AI creates content, which can include text, audio, images, and videos, based on a user prompt. The technology has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its AI chatbot ChatGPT in November.People have been using generative AI for personal, professional, and academic purposes including writing letters, drafting work emails, and summarizing research for college assignments, but some critics fear it could spread misinformation, be used for malicious purposes, and take away jobs.

Previous generations of automation technology often had the biggest mid-term impact on occupations with lower-middle wages, the McKinsey analysts wrote. Lower-wage occupations were more immune from automation because their employers paid them lower salaries in the first place. In those cases, the cost savings of automation wouldn't be as big, whereas the skills required for higher-wage roles were harder to automate.With recent generative AI developments, however, the focus has shifted away from automating physical work activities to cognitive tasks such as decision-making and collaboration, the McKinsey analysts wrote. ""Thus, generative AI has more impact on knowledge work associated with occupations that have higher wages and educational requirements than on other types of work,"" the analysts wrote.

One way generative AI could help workers is by acting as a ""virtual expert"" who helps them quickly access internal information, the analysts wrote. One study found that when customer-service agents in the Philippines were given AI assistants, they became happier, more productive, and less likely to quit.The McKinsey analysts said AI could substantially increase labor productivity but that workers could need help moving to different work activities or even retraining to another job. ""The era of generative AI is just beginning,"" they wrote.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically large language models (LLMs), will change how organizations design jobs, resource tasks and allocate responsibilities across the enterprise. However, LLMs come with a unique set of risks when compared with other AI implementations. 
Generative microapps are an emerging technology that can enable organizations to demonstrate the value of generative AI while minimizing the business’s risk exposures. Generative microapps are applications that act as a proxy between a user and an LLM, such as ChatGPT or Bard.
We spoke with Nader Henein, VP Analyst at Gartner, to learn how enterprises can leverage microapps to augment knowledge workers using generative AI and boost employee productivity.
Q: How could generative microapps augment the human workforce? 
A: Gartner predicts that by 2026, 50% of office workers in Fortune 100 companies will be AI-augmented in one form or another, either to boost productivity or to raise the average quality of work.
For example, consider an LLM that is supplemented with a proprietary research database. As an author drafts a new piece of research, a microapp embedded in the word processing program would read each section and use its prebuilt prompt library to ask the LLM for examples of supporting research and data, as well as examples of contradicting research. Responses would be verified for accuracy by the microapp and then provided in the form of suggestions or comments in the word processor.
This augment would boost the author’s capabilities beyond what is humanly possible. No one person could be aware of every piece of published research in the database, but an LLM supplemented with enterprise data can provide that capability.
General-purpose microapps will become commonplace within the applications used every day in the workforce, such as word processors, email and conferencing tools. Organizations will develop specialized microapps, initially as augments for their high-value employees. These will become commoditized for all knowledge workers within a few years. A new industry focused on developing specialized generative microapps will grow and thrive. 
Q: Can you provide a bit more insight into generative microapps?
A: Rather than a user interfacing directly with an LLM, a microapp has a preprogrammed set of prompts that address a focused number of tasks on behalf of the user. There is no conversational/chat interface. The prompts are used to query the model and receive responses in a predefined format. This makes it easier for the logic within the microapp to validate each response before passing it back to the user. 
Generative microapps can be stand-alone, but in most instances, they will be embedded as extensions to productivity platforms commonly used by knowledge workers. 
Q: How do generative microapps mitigate key risks of LLMs? 
A: There are three key risks that are unique to LLMs: access control, accuracy and devaluation. Microapps address each of these:

Access control: Organizations have come to rely on access control, in which an access rule is created and applied 100% of the time. If the rule fails, the system simply denies access. However, if an LLM is supplemented with different types of enterprise data, there is no guarantee that access rules will be followed. Generative microapps act as a proxy for the enterprise LLM, so they do not allow the user to directly interact with the model through chat. As such, they cannot be coerced into exposing restricted data.


Accuracy: “Hallucinations” is the term describing how models will occasionally provide fictitious – yet confident and convincing – answers. Through rigorous prompt engineering, the preset prompts embedded in microapps can limit hallucinations. Furthermore, the microapp can enforce that the answers provided are in a format that the app can validate before passing onto the user.


Devaluation: Organizations may not be willing to pay the same amount for products and services provided by an LLM rather than a group of trained and seasoned professionals. Purpose-built microapps are developed to act as augments for knowledge workers. This will improve the average quality of the work and boost productivity, thereby helping mitigate skills shortages. Since the work is still carried out by professionals, the business model is shielded from devaluation risks. 


Additional analysis on enterprise use of generative AI will be presented during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, the world's most important conferences for CIOs and other IT executives.

AI job interviews becoming more common 











AI job interviews are becoming more common. Here's how to ace them.
05:02

Looking for a job? You may find yourself ""face to face"" with an artificial intelligence bot, rather than a person.Corporate recruiters have long used AI to quickly scan job applications and whittle down the number of applicants. Now, companies are increasingly using the technology to conduct the job interview itself. This presents job candidates with a range of new challenges in what can often be a stressful situation, not the least of which is this emerging consideration: How exactly do you impress a bot?""Employers understand that using AI can save them time, so we expect to see more of them using it in some way in the pre-screening interview process,"" Keith Spencer, a career expert at FlexJobs, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""From the candidate's perspective it can be intimidating. You're not interacting with a human — you're interacting with AI, which can feel kind of strange."" 






A recent survey from Resume Builder projected that by 2024, roughly four in 10 companies will use AI for job interviews. Of that number, 15% of employers said they will rely on AI to make hiring decisions without any human input.What is an AI job interview?Although virtual job interviews were used before the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health crisis made the process a necessity. Now that they are more commonplace, businesses are increasingly using AI to screen candidates.


""For years human resources departments have been using AI to automatically screen for resumes and applications. Now that virtual interviews have taken center stage, it's being used as a first screening, especially in non-complex jobs where you have clear parameters,"" Zahira Jaser, associate professor at the University of Sussex Business School, who focuses on how humans experience technology, told CBS MoneyWatch. There are different types of  AI interviews. In an AI-assisted interview,  a job candidate is presented with questions on screen in text form that they answer and submit via either text or video. A recruiter or other company staffer involved in hiring then evaluates the submission to assess if the applicant is a good fit.""Some have just an element of artificial intelligence so the candidate is recorded and someone watches their video,"" Jaser said. In that scenario, AI might help cull an applicant pool and recommend standout candidates. Notably, the technology could also inadvertently nix highly qualified job applicants, experts noted.


""The truth is it is still eliminating some candidates before a human makes the final decision,"" said Stacie Haller, career adviser at Resume Builder.""Existential dread""Then there are those interviews that are AI-led and ""completely automated,"" according to Jaser. The experience is a little bit like videoconferencing with yourself. In CBS MoneyWatch's test of AI interview software, the platform presented text-based questions on a screen above a live video box into which the candidate spoke. Their answers were recorded and submitted for review by AI. 
CBS News reporter Megan Cerullo submitted to a AI job interview without a human on the other end of the videoconference.

In practice, an algorithm reviews and judges the candidate's video submission based on verbal data, including the words they use, and vocal data, including a person's manner of speech and delivery. In most instances, by contrast, privacy laws prohibit companies from collecting facial data. ""The candidate is in front of a screen that has questions that appear and the candidate has limited time to answer these questions,"" Jaser explained, adding that the experience can be jarring. ""People who have sat in these interviews find it difficult because they almost all fall into an existential dread when, at a very important time in your life, you're not facing a human and you're not seeing cues coming to you.""How to impress a botUnlike a personal interaction with a human hiring manager either in the flesh or on a computer screen, conversational bots don't give interviewees on-the-spot feedback or other cues on how they're doing. ""The beauty of having an in-person interview, which is already a stressful experience, is that there is a human encounter. You meet a human, then you have an exchange, and if you sense a good emotion in the other person it's a way to measure ourselves,"" Jaser said. ""We're always looking for positive cues, and in this case you're not getting any. So you have to be confident you're saying the right thing without any cues.""That said, experts offer some tips on how to ace an AI job interview.


1. Pretend you're talking to a human. Spencer of FlexJobs recommends that candidates pretend they are interacting with a human, while acknowledging that can be difficult while responding to digital prompts.""It's like having a videoconferencing conversation with someone, but there's no one there. You don't see another face,"" he said of the AI interview experience. As a result, candidates sometimes inadvertently end up mimicking the software and can become robotic in their responses, which is something to avoid.

""They get more rigid, their facial expressions become more stoic and they aren't conscious of their non-verbals as much as their verbals. And AI programs are assessing non-verbals,"" Spencer said.Instead, pretend you're interviewing with a person. ""Maintain eye contact [with the camera], dress professionally, smile, and project confidence and friendliness,"" he added.2. Mine the job description for key words — and use them. Companies instruct AI to assess job applicants based on predefined criteria related to their overall goals or a particular role they're trying to fill. So as with any job interview, it's wise to research the company and read the job description closely beforehand. In an AI interview, though, it's even more important to use words and phrases that correspond to the duties and qualifications of the job.""There is a good chance the AI-interview tool will be ranking you based on your use of keywords and phrases from the job description,"" Spencer explained. ""If you're gregarious, don't rely completely on your charm. You want to have your facts straight and also have a clear understanding of the industry position, and be able to provide solid, tangible examples of your work.""


3. Practice, practice, practice. The best way to become more at ease interviewing while speaking to a screen is to practice. Jaser recommends a three-step approach. Start by practicing by videoconferencing with another person. Have them ask you generic as well as tailored interview questions.It can also be useful to use a tool like Prepper from job search site Adzuna, billed as an ""AI interview coach,"" that generates questions related to whatever job description you feed it. ""It's incredibly helpful to have someone — or some thing — chuck you a bunch of questions to get you thinking,"" said James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna and one of the developers behind Prepper. ""You'll know if you're prepared if you can answer those questions in a confident and accurate manner."" Next, have your interviewer turn their camera off to simulate interviewing while addressing a blank screen. Then eliminate the human factor altogether and record yourself using a videoconferencing tool. Watch and review the recording. Keep a script in mind that includes key words you want to use. ""If you learn keywords, you'll have quicker mental shortcuts to get to the info you want when the screen asks you the information,"" Jaser said.

So as with any job interview, it's wise to research the company and read the job description closely beforehand. In an AI interview, though, it's even more important to use words and phrases that correspond to the duties and qualifications of the job.""There is a good chance the AI-interview tool will be ranking you based on your use of keywords and phrases from the job description,"" Spencer explained. ""If you're gregarious, don't rely completely on your charm. You want to have your facts straight and also have a clear understanding of the industry position, and be able to provide solid, tangible examples of your work.""3. Practice, practice, practice. The best way to become more at ease interviewing while speaking to a screen is to practice. Jaser recommends a three-step approach. Start by practicing by videoconferencing with another person. Have them ask you generic as well as tailored interview questions.It can also be useful to use a tool like Prepper from job search site Adzuna, billed as an ""AI interview coach,"" that generates questions related to whatever job description you feed it. ""It's incredibly helpful to have someone — or some thing — chuck you a bunch of questions to get you thinking,"" said James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna and one of the developers behind Prepper. ""You'll know if you're prepared if you can answer those questions in a confident and accurate manner."" Next, have your interviewer turn their camera off to simulate interviewing while addressing a blank screen. Then eliminate the human factor altogether and record yourself using a videoconferencing tool. Watch and review the recording. Keep a script in mind that includes key words you want to use. ""If you learn keywords, you'll have quicker mental shortcuts to get to the info you want when the screen asks you the information,"" Jaser said. ",,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ai-job-interviews-are-becoming-more-common-heres-how-to-ace-them/'}, 'name': ""AI job interviews are becoming more common.

By Brian Buntz | June 16, 2023FacebookXLinkedInShare[Image credit: Seventyfour/Adobe Stock]Generative AI stands to add trillions of dollars of value to the world economy, according to a recent McKinsey report. The consultancy noted that about three-quarters of the value of generative AI spans four areas — customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and R&D. The latter could see a 12% annual lift in global functional spending as a result of generative AI, representing an approximately $328 billion windfall annually.
An evolution or revolution: UBS and McKinsey’s take on generative AI in biopharma
The investment bank UBS recently reached more muted conclusions, noting that generative AI would represent more of an evolution than a revolution for biopharma.
Conversely, McKinsey bets the technology could deliver productivity gains that account for 10% to 15% of overall R&D costs. This potential largely stems from the application of generative AI foundation models in what is known as generative design.
In the face of such perspectives, Adityo Prakash, CEO of Verseon, agrees with the transformative potential of AI but cautions against oversimplification. He underscores the need for a holistic approach to AI, taking into account the limitations of data. He points out a critical example in the conversion of chemical structure data. “If a lot of this data is just 2D chemical structures for a small molecule structure, what you’re supposed to do is turn that into 3D using tools that can generate a realistic 3D representation,” Prakash said. “The problem is that many people in this space often miss the details required for deploying AI.”
Beyond drug development: Generative AI’s impact on various industries
Indeed, many of McKinsey’s pronouncements extend beyond the pharma sector. The firm, for instance, projects the technology could automate tasks that now occupy about 60% to 70% of employees’ time across various industries. Ultimately, McKinsey estimates that “half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060,” roughly a decade earlier than in its earlier models suggested.
Prakash stressed that solving thorny drug development hurdles will require a cross-disciplinary approach. “To really solve the problem well, you need people who speak all of these languages fluently,” he said, referring to the various domains of expertise required in drug development – including data science, biology, chemistry, and AI. He suggests that a team combining a physicist, a mathematician and other backgrounds can potentially solve the problem better than siloed teams.
The aim is to expand what Lilly refers to as its “digital worker-equivalent workforce,” an idea intended to measure the time saved by employing technology in place of human labor. In an interview with Insider, Lilly CEO David Ricks stated that its initiatives, initiated in 2022 and encompassing more than 100 projects, are comparable to nearly 1.4 million hours of human effort, or roughly 160 years of round-the-clock work.
In response to the pharma giants’ embrace of AI, Prakash suggested that while these steps are commendable, it’s vital not to underestimate the challenges ahead or overstate the capabilities of AI alone. “We need to get there, and it’s a completely non-trivial task. AI is only one of many tools that are going to help,” Prakash said. “Just chanting ‘AI’ doesn’t get you there,” he stated.

These numbers could double if the technology is embedded into software used for other tasks beyond the studied use cases, it added.The technology will impact all industries, but banking and life sciences will see the most disruption. By integrating the technology, banking alone could record $340 billion in added value annually.Generative AI will transform the workspace, with McKinsey estimating it will automate over half of today’s work by 2045. This prediction has been reduced by nearly a decade from the 2016 estimate by the rapid growth in usage and investment in the technology over the past few years.AI has previously been touted to be more detrimental to low-level workers whose output can easily be automated. However, according to McKinsey, those in the higher ranks will face the most disruption. The company predicts that “knowledge work associated with occupations that have higher wages and educational requirements” will see the most impact.McKinsey joins other global institutions that predict a big shift in work as we integrate generative AI. Goldman Sachs (NASDAQ: GS) predicted that over 300 million workers could lose their jobs to AI-powered automation, while the World Economic Forum (WEF) projected 83 million jobs would be lost to AI in the next five years. Already, AI was blamed for 4,000 job losses in the U.S. in May.Some are still skeptical of the impact generative AI will have. David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says the technology is “not going to be as miraculous as people claim.”Watch: Does AI know what it’s doing? width=""562"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">New to blockchain?

Alarm over AI has been growing, with leaders from various sectors voicing concerns about both the increasing power of AI and its role in society.







Thousands of CEOs, technologists, researchers, academics and others signed an open letter in early 2023 calling for a pause in AI deployments, even as millions of people start using ChatGPT and other generative AI systems.
More specifically, they called on ""all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.""
The March letter starts by calling out AI's ""profound risks to society and humanity"" and chastising AI labs for engaging in ""an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one -- not even their creators -- can understand, predict, or reliably control.""
They're not the only ones worried about AI: Forty-six percent of respondents to a February 2023 Monmouth University poll said AI would do equal amounts of harm and good, while 41% believe the technology would do more harm. Only 9% of respondents believe computer scientists can develop AI that would benefit society.

A guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise 

Which also includes:
10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024
10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024
The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years




The reality is that AI has many potential advantages and disadvantages. In fact, the open letter signatories acknowledged both the technology's negatives and positives, stating that ""Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI.""




Top 5 advantages of AI
The benefits of AI include the following:
1. 24/7 availability
One of AI's biggest, and most cited, advantages is its 24/7 availability. Other computer technologies operate around the clock, and companies have benefited from the high availability of such systems -- but only insomuch as humans have been available to work with them. AI's ability to make decisions and take actions independent of human involvement in many business circumstances means the technology can work independently, ensuring continuous operations, said Jordan Rae Kelly, senior managing director and head of cybersecurity for the Americas at FTI Consulting.
2. Scalability
AI not only works continuously, it scales almost infinitely, said Sreekar Krishna, principal and national leader for AI at KPMG US. He cited the personalized recommendations companies such as Amazon and Netflix offer to their customers. While a salesclerk who works often enough with a customer might be able to extend such services to that same individual after enough interactions, AI can do so for hundreds of thousands of customers at the same time. AI similarly demonstrates this scalability in the financial industry, where institutions use the technology to instantly verify and validate millions of transactions and monitor for potential fraud every day. ""You can't scale to that degree with humans alone. You need automation, and AI is integral to that automation,"" Krishna said.
3. Improved accuracy and reduced rate of error
Unlike humans, AI systems don't get tired or become distracted. They're able to process infinitely more information, and consistently follow the rules to analyze data and make decisions -- all of which make them far more likely to deliver accurate results nearly all the time. ""That's not to say these platforms are perfect,"" Kelly warned. To deliver such accuracy, AI models must be built on good algorithms that are free from unintended bias, trained on enough high-quality data and monitored to prevent drift.



Forty-six percent of respondents to a February 2023 Monmouth University poll said AI would do equal amounts of harm and good, while 41% believe the technology would do more harm.




4. Enhanced safety
An example of AI's ability to improve safety is General Motors' Super Cruise feature that ensures a driver pays attention to the road. According to information on the company's website, ""When it is engaged, Super Cruise uses a Driver Attention System that monitors the system status and works to detect your head and eye positioning, reminding you to pay attention to the road and steer manually when needed."" Other automotive makers also offer AI-powered capabilities, such as lane-departure warnings, aimed at boosting driver safety.
But AI's safety contributions extend beyond the roadways. It's also used in manufacturing production lines to keep workers safe by, for example, stopping machinery when they get too close to certain areas. And it's used within robots to handle dangerous tasks ranging from defusing bombs to accessing burning buildings, sparing humans from performing those life-threatening jobs.
5. Performs mundane and repetitive tasks
Experts also credit AI for handling repetitive tasks for humans -- both in their jobs and in their personal lives. ""It unburdens the grunt work that humans have had to do,"" Krishna said. As more and more computer systems incorporate AI into their operations, they can perform an increasing amount of lower-level and often boring jobs that can bite into individual's time. Everyday examples of AI's handling of mundane work includes robotic vacuums in the home and data collection in the office. That, in turn, leaves humans with more time for higher-value tasks.


Top 5 disadvantages of AI
Frequently cited drawbacks of AI include the following:
1. A lack of creativity
Although AI has been tasked with creating everything from computer code to visual art, it lacks original thought. ""It can only know what it knows. It can't think outside the box, no pun intended,"" Kelly said. ""It's limited by what it can ingest.""
AI essentially makes predictions based on algorithms and the training data it has been fed; and although machine learning algorithms help the machine learn over time, it doesn't have the capacity humans have for creativity, inspiration and new ways of thinking. ""It's not going to replace critical thinking; it's just going to be another arrow in our quiver,"" said Chaim Mazal, chief security officer at Gigamon, a maker of cybersecurity technology. A Feb. 2023 report from the World Economic Forum states that even though AI can support and enable human creativity, the ""leading opinion is that AI cannot generate fundamentally new ideas on its own."" Whether AI could develop those capabilities is a subject of discussion and debate, even as Microsoft researchers in an April 2023 paper assert that AI has evolved to reason like humans.
2. The absence of empathy
AI can be taught to recognize human emotions such as frustration, but a machine cannot empathize and has no ability to feel. Humans can, giving them a huge advantage over unfeeling AI systems in many areas, including the workplace. Consider the fact that the service sector dominates the U.S. economy, with the Brookings Institute calculating that in 2023 ""four out of five American workers in the private sector are employed in the service economy, doing everything from delivering care in hospitals and nursing homes to making and serving food to ensuring products make it from ports to store shelves and into consumers' hands."" Although some positions -- and aspects of others -- can be automated using AI, Krishna said many of those roles ""require empathy and touchpoints.""
3. Skill loss in humans
Although experts typically list AI's ability to free people from repetitive and mundane tasks as a positive, some believe this particular benefit comes with a downside: a loss of skills in people. People often advance their knowledge, as well as their personal and professional crafts, by first learning and mastering easy repetitive tasks, allowing them to understand how those tasks fit into the bigger chunks of work they must accomplish to complete an objective. But as AI takes over those entry-level jobs, some have voiced concerns that people could lose their ability to know and understand how to perform those tasks. That could stymie their ability to truly master a profession or trade; it could also leave them without the necessary capabilities to step in and perform the work should the AI fail.
4. Possible overreliance on the technology and increased laziness in humans
Similarly, a contingent of thought leaders have said they fear AI could enable laziness in humans. ""We're all concerned about whether it will make us less mindful or thoughtful or thinking,"" said Bill Wong, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group. He and others noted that some users seem to use AI without double-checking the results, assuming the technology works flawlessly when it does not. AI is far from perfect, with the online site AI Incident Database ""indexing the collective history of harms or near harms realized in the real world by the deployment of artificial intelligence systems.""
5. Job loss and displacement
The equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to automation, according to an April 2023 report from Goldman Sachs Research. The authors also estimated ""that roughly two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI."" The story is complicated, though. Economists and researchers have said many jobs will be eliminated by AI, but they've also predicted that AI will shift some workers to higher-value tasks and generate new types of work. Existing and upcoming workers will need to prepare by learning new skills, including the ability to use AI to complement their human capabilities, experts said. ""Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,"" wrote the Goldman Sachs Research authors.


Examples of good AI use cases
AI has enabled significant advances in many areas of society, according to experts. The following use cases illustrate the positive side of this technology:

Newer model cars use AI-enabled systems to ensure safety on the road by monitoring blind spots, alerting drivers when their attention wanes and taking preventative measures such as braking automatically to avoid crashes.
Swiss researchers announced in spring 2023 that they used AI as part of a medical treatment plan to help a paralyzed man walk for the first time in 12 years.
Scientists have always used the latest tools to help them advance their research, and that was certainly the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Case in point: Researchers created an AI model to help them predict which COVID variants would become dominant, as well as when and where surges in cases would occur.



Examples of bad AI use cases
Although AI itself is a neutral entity, its use in some circumstances demonstrates its limits and potential to harm others. These real-world examples demonstrate how AI can be inappropriately used:

In late spring 2023, a New York lawyer faced judicial scrutiny for submitting court filings citing fictious cases that had been made up by ChatGPT. The lawyer acknowledged using ChatGPT to draft the document and told a federal judge that he didn't realize the tool could make such an error.
In 2019, a video of an apparently drunk Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who was then U.S. House Speaker, circulated online. The video was a deepfake, a form of media that has been altered using AI. The believability of that Pelosi video, and others that followed, set off alarms about how AI-generated content could be used to distort truth and spread misinformation.
Another well-publicized example of a poorly executed AI use case happened in 2016, when Microsoft released a chatbot on Twitter. Microsoft engineers designed the bot to act like a female teenager and expected Tay -- the name given to the bot -- to learn to be more like other teens as she engaged online. However, Tay apparently did not have guardrails to block racist, misogynistic and antisemitic language and it became an offensive and hostile bot that Microsoft had to shut down.

Madhumita Murgia and Anjli RavalJune 18 2023162Print this pageStay informed with free updatesSimply sign up to the Artificial intelligence myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.Students applying for graduate jobs this summer can take advantage of a new personal interview coach. If they send over a specific job description they can receive tailored interview questions and answers — and feedback on their own responses — all for free.The coach, offered by the job search engine Adzuna, is not human but an artificial intelligence bot known as Prepper. It can generate interview questions for more than 1mn live roles at large companies, in industries ranging from technology and financial services to manufacturing and retail.For a graduate job in PwC’s actuarial practice, the chatbot spits out questions such as: “What skills do you think an actuarial consultant should have?” and “How would you explain actuarial concepts to a client who is not from a finance background?”. When a user answers a question, Prepper generates a score out of 100, and tells them which parts worked well and what was missing.Prepper is part of a new wave of chatbots powered by generative AI — from ChatGPT to Bard and Claude. Chatbots are trained on large swaths of text drawn from the internet, including from books, newspapers, blogs, videos and image captions. They can produce plausible and sophisticated text that is largely indistinguishable from human writing.“In the recent 12-18 months, it’s gone bananas,” says Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna. “It’s of course very hyped at the moment, but there are lots of clever tools [to aid] recruitment, and help people find jobs more easily.”AI is not a new tool in hiring and job-seeking. Over the past decade, it has been used primarily to make processes more efficient and cheaper for employers — from searching for key words in CVs, to filtering video interviews of candidates.But generative AI tools are rebalancing the power dynamic towards applicants. “A lot of the recent improvements we have seen in AI are on the candidate’s side,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, an organisational psychologist and expert in hiring technologies. “A few years ago, hirers were pretending to use AI to look cool even if they weren’t. Now they are pretending not to use AI.”When Chamorro-Premuzic recently tried to hire for a role, he asked a candidate if they had experimented with generative AI. “They said, ‘If it wasn’t for ChatGPT, I wouldn’t be sat in front of you right now.’” Their CV, cover letter and application had all been written by AI.These systems are powerful, but can also be wrong. How can we implement it with care and an ethical focus?Lindsey Zuloaga, chief data officer, HireVueChamorro-Premuzic, who respected the honesty and decided it was worth taking on someone who was technologically savvy, hired the person. Others are less enthused, warning AI may signal an end to the traditional job application process.“Generative AI can create very good profiles — there may be a few mistakes but only the individual will recognise them, not the employer,” says Matt Jones, from the recruitment technology company Cielo. “This raises the question about the relevance of reviewing CVs, cover letters and applications, particularly at the early career stage. I wonder if this is the death knell of the CV.”For graduates in an increasingly competitive job market, chatbots are a way to cope with a potentially overwhelming process. Ayushman Nath, a second-year undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, says many of his peers have played with ChatGPT, the public chatbot released by the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, asking it to write cover letters for specific companies. He knows people who have advanced through early rounds or secured internships using ChatGPT-written cover letters and applications.“From what I’ve experienced, it’s good at jumping through the initial barriers.

",,,,,,,,,AI in recruitment: the death knell of the CV?,,,,,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financial Times', 'productID': 'ft.com:subscribed'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Students applying for graduate jobs this summer can take advantage of a new personal interview coach. If they send over a specific job description they can receive tailored interview questions and answers — and feedback on their own responses — all for free.

The coach, offered by the job search engine Adzuna, is not human but an artificial intelligence bot known as Prepper. It can generate interview questions for more than 1mn live roles at large companies, in industries ranging from technology and financial services to manufacturing and retail.

For a graduate job in PwC’s actuarial practice, the chatbot spits out questions such as: “What skills do you think an actuarial consultant should have?” and “How would you explain actuarial concepts to a client who is not from a finance background?”. When a user answers a question, Prepper generates a score out of 100, and tells them which parts worked well and what was missing.

Prepper is part of a new wave of chatbots powered by generative AI — from ChatGPT to Bard and Claude. Chatbots are trained on large swaths of text drawn from the internet, including from books, newspapers, blogs, videos and image captions. They can produce plausible and sophisticated text that is largely indistinguishable from human writing.

“In the recent 12-18 months, it’s gone bananas,” says Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna. “It’s of course very hyped at the moment, but there are lots of clever tools [to aid] recruitment, and help people find jobs more easily.”

AI is not a new tool in hiring and job-seeking. Over the past decade, it has been used primarily to make processes more efficient and cheaper for employers — from searching for key words in CVs, to filtering video interviews of candidates.

But generative AI tools are rebalancing the power dynamic towards applicants. “A lot of the recent improvements we have seen in AI are on the candidate’s side,” says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, an organisational psychologist and expert in hiring technologies. “A few years ago, hirers were pretending to use AI to look cool even if they weren’t. Now they are pretending not to use AI.”

When Chamorro-Premuzic recently tried to hire for a role, he asked a candidate if they had experimented with generative AI. “They said, ‘If it wasn’t for ChatGPT, I wouldn’t be sat in front of you right now.’” Their CV, cover letter and application had all been written by AI.

Chamorro-Premuzic, who respected the honesty and decided it was worth taking on someone who was technologically savvy, hired the person. Others are less enthused, warning AI may signal an end to the traditional job application process.

“Generative AI can create very good profiles — there may be a few mistakes but only the individual will recognise them, not the employer,” says Matt Jones, from the recruitment technology company Cielo. “This raises the question about the relevance of reviewing CVs, cover letters and applications, particularly at the early career stage. I wonder if this is the death knell of the CV.”

For graduates in an increasingly competitive job market, chatbots are a way to cope with a potentially overwhelming process. Ayushman Nath, a second-year undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, says many of his peers have played with ChatGPT, the public chatbot released by the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, asking it to write cover letters for specific companies. He knows people who have advanced through early rounds or secured internships using ChatGPT-written cover letters and applications.

“From what I’ve experienced, it’s good at jumping through the initial barriers. The initial filtering rounds are unpersonalised, they feel very remote and dehumanised. Everything is so automated,” Nath says of today’s recruitment processes.

Nath and his peers have also been subject to automated video interviews run by recruitment technology providers such as HireVue, which records applicants answering pre-determined questions, usually with a time limit for each answer. The recordings are sometimes watched by the employer’s hiring managers; or the platform’s AI algorithms will assess each candidate’s performance, looking for various keywords from the job description.

The company has not launched any generative AI products yet, but its chief data scientist, Lindsey Zuloaga, says her team is testing tools such as interview prep chatbots and new ways to draw information from video interviews. “These systems are powerful, but can also be wrong. How can we implement it with care and an ethical focus?” she says.

Grace Lordan, an economist at the London School of Economics and director of The Inclusion Initiative, which studies diversity in corporate settings, says companies, particularly technology groups, are experimenting with generative AI to conduct initial interviews.

“One of the biggest areas of bias is actually the interview,” she says. “This is when people’s affinity bias, or representative bias, which means choosing people who look like others in the organisation, comes in.”

AI-conducted interviews could go some way to removing that bias, she says. “Generative AI is quite convincing as an avatar. Using AI as another serious data point will allow pushback from the machines [against human bias].”

More employers are also using new assessment methods to broaden the pool of candidates they hire from, amid a global skills and labour shortage and as they push to improve diversity. Automated systems designed for hiring a more diverse workforce can find candidates who may otherwise be overlooked due to health issues, gaps in employment or because they lack a degree or are from a non-traditional background.

But although ChatGPT is a useful starting point for a cover letter or for learning the background of a potential employer, recruiters say it is not a replacement for writing an application yourself.

Nath, the Cambridge university student, says: “Companies are looking for a relationship with people there, like reaching out to somebody at the firm or a nugget of information that isn’t on the website. And these things can only be cultivated by personal interactions, not AI models.”

Automation and generative artificial intelligence (AI) will mean smaller, yet more capable, advertising agencies, according to analysis by global consultancy Forrester.
The disruption to the industry will mean the destruction and rebirth of creativity. 
The Agency AI-Powered Workforce Forecast, 2030 reveals US advertising agencies and related services companies will lose 32,000 jobs to automation.
Creative problem-solving roles will thrive but process-oriented jobs will shrink due to the influence of automation, machine learning and generative AI. 
The global advertising groups are in a frenzy, a form of arms race, to adopt AI (artificial intelligence) in what’s been described as a new industrial revolution.
""The meteoric rise of generative AI marks both a beginning and ending for marketing creativity as we know it,"" says Jay Pattisall, VP, principal analyst at Forrester.
""These technologies bring tremendous computing power, speed, and scale to the human act of creativity and ideation.""AdChoicesADVERTISING
He says the benefits of generative AI to marketing are: Enhancing human intuition with machine intelligence; Amplifying creators’ work; Adding scale and speed to creative quality.
""Yet artificial intelligence is also burdensome,"" he says.
""It forces us to rethink the nonlinear creative process to meet brands’ exponential needs for volumes of efficient, fit-for-format content and advertising.
""It forces us to unlearn and relearn creativity. It presents challenges such as inaccuracy, bias, ethical, and legal liability for both brands and agencies.
""In effect, it’s the destruction and rebirth of creativity — as we know it. When AI is combined with your brand’s creative process, what emerges is intelligent creativity."" 
The latest Forrester report, which focuses on the US market, also says generative AI will both account for nearly a third of automated advertising jobs and increase the productivity of higher-wage skillsets in agencies.
""Forrester assumes job losses from generative AI over the next two years will be modest — until questions around intellectual property rights, copyright, plagiarism, model refresh rate, bias, ethics, and accuracy are resolved,"" the study says.

Forrester also assumes that generative AI job loss potential is low for jobs that require a physical presence, such as a chief executive or manager, even if generative AI influence is high.
""The marketing mindset on AI turns from fear to fascination as the post-pandemic services boom winds down and enthusiasm for generative AI kicks into overdrive,"" says Forrester.
By 2030, agency jobs most at risk from generative AI include clerical, secretarial, and administrative roles (28% of job losses); sales and connected roles (22% of job losses); and market research and connected roles (18% of job losses).
Despite automation potential, the share of agency jobs in management, public relations, creative roles, market research, software (including web and digital interface designers), and data science will grow.
And jobs for clerical, sales, finance, administrative and labor-intensive roles will decline.
Globally, digital marketing and strategy specialists will see more than 20% headcount growth in the next five years.
Fundraising and public relations will grow faster than the job market, and there will be double-digit growth to 2030 for market research and marketing specialists, computer and information system managers, editors and art directors.
Generative AI increases the productivity of higher-wage skill sets. Image generation software add speed and scale to the marketing process to lower the cost of creating content and reconfigure agency skill sets.
Higher-paid jobs most influenced by generative AI technology include editors, writers and authors, technical writers   and programmers.
""This suggests a coming inversion of the agency workforce composition, from legions of less-costly junior talent matched with senior managers to highly paid creator skill sets paired with generative AI assistants,"" says Forrester.
Aaron Kwittken, CEO of PRophet, and AI-driven SaaS platform for the PR community, says the fear and loathing phase has passed into curiosity and adoption. 
According to Forrester’s 2023 data, 56% of US B2C marketing and advertising decision-makers (vice president or above) have already used generative AI in marketing, and another 40% are intrigued or exploring uses.
As a result, advertising and marketing use cases for AI and automation abound with, Forrester says, generative AI turbocharging creators and the creative development process.
The common uses include brainstorming creative concepts, authouring copy for campaigns, SEO keyword optimisation, versioning content designs and production assets, coding and script authouring.
AI-powered intelligence also sharpens media planning and activation.
Agency audience activation platforms, such as DEPT’s Ada, GroupM Nexus, Havas Media Group’s Converged, Omnicom Group’s Omni, Publicis Groupe’s Epsilon PeopleCloud, PMG’s Alli, and Tinuiti’s Bliss Point, each leverage machine learning models and (soon) generative AI authoring and knowledge management to power the audience-intelligence-based approach to media strategy and execution.

What jobs are safe from AI? 











What jobs are safe from AI?
04:18

The boom in ""generative"" artificial intelligence may usher in the ""next productivity frontier"" in the workplace, but it could also cause job losses and disruption for some knowledge-based workers such as software developers and marketers, according to McKinsey. Integrating generative AI tools into the workplace could theoretically automate as much as 70% of the time an employee spends completing tasks on the job, the consulting firm estimated. That could help many workers save time on routine tasks, which in turn will boost profitability for businesses, McKinsey said in a recent report.For the U.S. economy as a whole, meanwhile, the gains could be considerable, adding $4.4 trillion annually to the nation's GDP. 






But such productivity gains could come with a downside, as some companies may decide to cut jobs since workers won't need as many hours to complete their tasks. Most at risk from advanced forms of AI are knowledge-based workers, who tend to be employed in jobs that traditionally have had higher wages and more job security than blue-collar workers. As a result, most knowledge workers will be changing what they do over time, McKinsey Global Partner Michael Chui told CBS MoneyWatch. 


Generative AI will ""give us superpowers"" by allowing workers to be more productive, but employees will need to adapt, Chui said. This ""will require reskilling, flexibility and learning how to learn new things."" AI could replace half of workers' daily work activities by 2045, which McKinsey said is eight years earlier than it had previously forecast. Where AI will thriveTo be sure, AI won't transform every job, and it could impact some corporate fields more than others. At the top of the list are software development, customer service operations and marketing, according to Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner at McKinsey. Software engineering teams are likely to rely on generative AI to reduce the time they spend generating code. Already, big tech firms are selling AI tools for software engineering, which is being used by 20 million coders, the firm found.


Customer service operations could also undergo a transformation, with AI-powered chatbots creating quick, personalized responses to complex customer questions. Because generative AI can quickly retrieve data for a specific customer, it can reduce the time human sales representatives need to respond. Marketers also could tap AI to help with creating content and assist in interpreting data and with search engine optimization. Workers who are concerned about their jobs should stay on top of emerging technologies like generative AI and understand its place in their respective fields,the McKinsey experts recommended. ""Be on the early edge of adoption"" to stay ahead in the job market, Zemmel advised.

Still, most jobs won't be transformed overnight, Zemmel said.""It's worth remembering in customer service and marketing just how early this technology is and how much work needs to be put in to get it to work safely, reliably, at scale, and the way that most human professional enterprises are going to want to use it,"" he noted. Examining past technological advances provides a hint of how AI is likely to impact workers.


""How many jobs were lost when Google came out?"" Zemmel asked. ""I'm sure the answer wasn't zero, but companies didn't dramatically restructure because of all the work that was no longer needed in document retrieval.""Zemmel said that when he asks corporate managers how they use AI technologies, the common answer is ""writing birthday poems and toasts."" So AI ""still has a way to go before it's really transforming businesses,"" he added.

From content creation to customer engagement through chatbots, generative AI tools help businesses deepen customer connections while dramatically reducing the time for marketing research, data analysis, and reporting. Three in five (61%) sales professionals and marketers in Singapore say their organisation has invested in generative AI tools and they plan to continue investing (46%). The survey results showed that 66% of total respondents and 71% in small and medium businesses (SMBs) are already using generative AI tools in their role. Although productivity benefits of generative AI are being realised in sales and marketing roles, respondents also expressed a clear sentiment of responsible use. Over seven in ten (72%) said people should use generative AI tools in their jobs, including one in seven (14%) saying people should leverage gen AI as much as possible and nearly three in five (58%) saying people should use gen AI, but avoid becoming overly reliant on them. With spending on AI in Asia Pacific expected to grow rapidly, Singapore is striding ahead in its advancement of transparency and governance in AI, as well as the application of disruptive technologies across industries. Amongst the respondents who adopt generative AI tools for their role, over nine in ten (92%) say that these are important for their day-to-day work &mdash;but gaps in knowledge (60%) are creating challenges to unleashing their full potential.The shortfall in awareness was revealed by 35% of respondents who face the challenge of not knowing where to begin with generative AI tools and require education and training to realise the value of the technology. For over two-fifths (42%) of respondents, inaccurate information from generative AI poses a concern, while 31% say the content produced by generative AI is too surface-level or vague. 28% of respondents also believe that generative AI cannot create truly unique or original content; this was followed by 36% saying the content generative AI produces isn't always relevant to their desired goal, while nearly the same number (35%) find it difficult to know how to prompt generative AI tools to achieve desired results.&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s customers are increasingly desensitised with templated marketing and sales outreach and are looking for the next level of relevance and personalisation. Businesses must rise to meet these expectations by changing tactics to engage customers more effectively. That's where generative AI comes in; enabling businesses to focus on quality connections over quantity,&rdquo; said Dan Bognar, Vice President &amp; Managing Director, JAPAC, at HubSpot.&ldquo;At a time when budgets are under greater scrutiny, generative AI is transforming work for Singaporean organisations across both sales and marketing functions&mdash; from conducting customer research to prospecting more effectively, generative AI is redefining productivity. We are moving away from getting the same outcome for less to getting even better results, with less. However, for businesses to fully benefit from this technology, improving literacy and empowering employees to use generative AI effectively and responsibly is essential to unlock its potential,&rdquo; he added.Also, AI is proving to be the slingshot for growth and success for SMBs to compete against large enterprises without the need for bigger budgets or teams. AI is levelling the playing field for SMBs to compete like never before. It&rsquo;s helping to drive marketing efforts through smarter ways of working, so sales and marketing teams can focus efforts on more strategic and creative outcomes. In fact, three in five (61%) survey respondents believe that generative AI tools will boost the creativity of those who use them. Survey results showed that smaller businesses are indeed more receptive to AI-enabled innovation and transformation of work processes through generative AI: 71% of sales professionals and marketers in SMBs say they are using generative AI tools in their role, compared to 57% in large enterprises.Further, respondents from businesses with a lower turnover (&ldquo;The old formula for achieving business growth was to increase headcount or add more tools to drive productivity,&rdquo; said Bognar. &ldquo;In the age of AI disruption, activities that once required substantial time and resources no longer will, opening up new pathways for growth and improving customer experiences for SMBs.&rdquo;",,,,,,,,,,,contactus@etcio.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Commentary: Why generative AI is a minefield for copyright law
  

In 2022, an AI-generated work of art won the Colorado State Fair’s art competition. The artist, Jason Allen, had used Midjourney — a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system trained on art scraped from the internet — to create the piece.

In 2022, an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated work of art won the Colorado State Fair’s art competition. The artist, Mr Jason Allen, had used Midjourney — a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system trained on art scraped from the internet — to create the piece.
The process was far from fully automated: Mr Allen went through some 900 iterations over 80 hours to create and refine his submission.Advertisement 












Yet his use of AI to win the art competition triggered a heated backlash online, with one Twitter user claiming, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.”
As generative AI art tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have been thrust into the limelight, so too have questions about ownership and authorship.
These tools’ generative ability is the result of training them with scores of prior artworks, from which the AI learns how to create artistic outputs.

      An AI-generated picture won an art prize. Artists aren’t happy.
  







Should the artists whose art was scraped to train the models be compensated? Who owns the images that AI systems produce? Is the process of fine-tuning prompts for generative AI a form of authentic creative expression?
On one hand, technophiles rave over work like Mr Allen’s. But on the other, many working artists consider the use of their art to train AI to be exploitative.Advertisement 












We’re part of a team of 14 experts across disciplines that just published a paper on generative AI in Science magazine. In it, we explore how advances in AI will affect creative work, aesthetics and the media.
One of the key questions that emerged has to do with United States copyright laws, and whether they can adequately deal with the unique challenges of generative AI.
Copyright laws were created to promote the arts and creative thinking. But the rise of generative AI has complicated existing notions of authorship.
PHOTOGRAPHY SERVES AS A HELPFUL LENS
Generative AI might seem unprecedented, but history can act as a guide.

      Commentary: Tapping AI tools like ChatGPT for investment decisions? Here are some things to take note of
  







Take the emergence of photography in the 1800s. Before its invention, artists could only try to portray the world through drawing, painting or sculpture. Suddenly, reality could be captured in a flash using a camera and chemicals.Advertisement 












As with generative AI, many argued that photography lacked artistic merit.
In 1884, the US Supreme Court weighed in on the issue and found that cameras served as tools that an artist could use to give an idea visible form; the “masterminds” behind the cameras, the court ruled, should own the photographs they create.
From then on, photography evolved into its own art form and even sparked new abstract artistic movements.
AI CAN NOT OWN OUTPUTS
Unlike inanimate cameras, AI possesses capabilities — like the ability to convert basic instructions into impressive artistic works — that make it prone to anthropomorphisation.
Even the term “artificial intelligence” encourages people to think that these systems have humanlike intent or even self-awareness.Advertisement

This led some people to wonder whether AI systems can be “owners”. But the US Copyright Office has stated unequivocally that only humans can hold copyrights.
So who can claim ownership of images produced by AI?
Is it the artists whose images were used to train the systems? The users who type in prompts to create images? Or the people who build the AI systems?
INFRINGEMENT OR FAIR USE?
While artists draw obliquely from past works that have educated and inspired them in order to create, generative AI relies on training data to produce outputs.
This training data consists of prior artworks, many of which are protected by copyright law and which have been collected without artists’ knowledge or consent. Using art in this way might violate copyright law even before the AI generates a new work.
For Mr Allen to create his award-winning art, Midjourney was trained on 100 million prior works.
Was that a form of infringement? Or was it a new form of “fair use”, a legal doctrine that permits the unlicensed use of protected works if they’re sufficiently transformed into something new?
While AI systems do not contain literal copies of the training data, they do sometimes manage to recreate works from the training data, complicating this legal analysis.
Will contemporary copyright law favour end users and companies over the artists whose content is in the training data?
To mitigate this concern, some scholars propose new regulations to protect and compensate artists whose work is used for training.
These proposals include a right for artists to opt out of their data being used for generative AI or a way to automatically compensate artists when their work is used to train an AI.
MUDDLED OWNERSHIP
Training data, however, is only part of the process. Frequently, artists who use generative AI tools go through many rounds of revision to refine their prompts, which suggests a degree of originality.
Answering the question of who should own the outputs requires looking into the contributions of all those involved in the generative AI supply chain.
The legal analysis is easier when an output is different from works in the training data. In this case, whoever prompted the AI to produce the output appears to be the default owner.
However, copyright law requires meaningful creative input — a standard satisfied by clicking the shutter button on a camera. It remains unclear how courts will decide what this means for the use of generative AI. Is composing and refining a prompt enough?
Matters are more complicated when outputs resemble works in the training data. If the resemblance is based only on general style or content, it is unlikely to violate copyright, because style is not copyrightable.
The illustrator Hollie Mengert encountered this issue firsthand when her unique style was mimicked by generative AI engines in a way that did not capture what, in her eyes, made her work unique.
Meanwhile, the singer Grimes embraced the tech, “open-sourcing” her voice and encouraging fans to create songs in her style using generative AI.
If an output contains major elements from a work in the training data, it might infringe on that work’s copyright.
Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr Andy Warhol’s drawing of a photograph was not permitted by fair use.
That means that using AI to just change the style of a work — say, from a photo to an illustration — is not enough to claim ownership over the modified output.
While copyright law tends to favour an all-or-nothing approach, scholars at Harvard Law School have proposed new models of joint ownership that allow artists to gain some rights in outputs that resemble their works.
In many ways, generative AI is yet another creative tool that allows a new group of people access to image-making, just like cameras, paintbrushes or Adobe Photoshop.
But a key difference is this new set of tools relies explicitly on training data, and therefore creative contributions cannot easily be traced back to a single artist.
The ways in which existing laws are interpreted or reformed — and whether generative AI is appropriately treated as the tool it is — will have real consequences for the future of creative expression. THE CONVERSATION

New Grammy rule addresses artificial intelligence, says ""only human creators"" eligible for awards

Grammys approve new rules on use of artificial intelligence
00:20

The Recording Academy are making several changes to the Grammy Awards, including a rule that stipulates ""only human creators"" can win the music industry's highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music.""A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any category,"" they said, under new ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) Protocols"" released Friday.The rule was set following the semiannual academy's board of trustees meeting last month, where it was determined that work that features elements of AI are eligible, as long as a human creator is responsible for a ""meaningful"" contribution to the music and/or lyrics. 






""The human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful,"" the new requirements read in part.The news arrives shortly after Paul McCartney announced on Tuesday that a forthcoming ""last Beatles record"" had been composed using artificial intelligence by extracting John Lennon's voice from an old demo. At the time, he described AI as ""kind of scary but exciting,"" adding: ""We will just have to see where that leads.""


In addition to the AI rule, the Recording Academy announced that there have been swift changes made to other categories: now, to win a nomination for the album of the year category, a music creator has to account for at least 20% of the work. That includes all credited artists, featured artists, songwriters, producers, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers, and differs from a decision made in 2021, which allowed anyone who worked on the album to receive a nomination.The number of those eligible in the ""Big Four"" categories — best new artists as well as album, song, and record of the year — has been decreased from 10 to eight nominees.Previously, to be nominated for the ""best music film"" category, 50% of the documentary footage had to be performance based. The Recording Academy has lifted that requirement.The change better reflects the evolution of the music doc format, often a collection of verité and archival footage, like Apple TV's ""Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry"". Biopics and dramatic feature films are still ineligible.


Also eligible: ""Music-focused and individual music videos that together create a visual album (if videos are packaged and entered together as one cohesive film),"" evidence of a trend spearheaded by Beyoncé's 2016 ""Lemonade"" film, and explored across genres, like in Halsey's 2021 ""If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power.""The Recording Academy also announced that the best improvised jazz solo award has been renamed best jazz performance, and best regional Mexican music album (including Tejano) has been renamed best música Mexicana album (including Tejano). To qualify in the latter category, 50% of the lyrics must be sung in Spanish, or the majority of the musical content must reflect a traditional style of Mexican music, like banda, norteño, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, rancheros, sierreño, jarocho, huasteco and huapango.Those changes follow the addition of three new categories, announced on Tuesday: best pop dance recording, best African music performance, and best alternative jazz album.

That includes all credited artists, featured artists, songwriters, producers, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers, and differs from a decision made in 2021, which allowed anyone who worked on the album to receive a nomination.The number of those eligible in the ""Big Four"" categories — best new artists as well as album, song, and record of the year — has been decreased from 10 to eight nominees.Previously, to be nominated for the ""best music film"" category, 50% of the documentary footage had to be performance based. The Recording Academy has lifted that requirement.The change better reflects the evolution of the music doc format, often a collection of verité and archival footage, like Apple TV's ""Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry"". Biopics and dramatic feature films are still ineligible.Also eligible: ""Music-focused and individual music videos that together create a visual album (if videos are packaged and entered together as one cohesive film),"" evidence of a trend spearheaded by Beyoncé's 2016 ""Lemonade"" film, and explored across genres, like in Halsey's 2021 ""If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power.""The Recording Academy also announced that the best improvised jazz solo award has been renamed best jazz performance, and best regional Mexican music album (including Tejano) has been renamed best música Mexicana album (including Tejano). To qualify in the latter category, 50% of the lyrics must be sung in Spanish, or the majority of the musical content must reflect a traditional style of Mexican music, like banda, norteño, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, rancheros, sierreño, jarocho, huasteco and huapango.Those changes follow the addition of three new categories, announced on Tuesday: best pop dance recording, best African music performance, and best alternative jazz album.",,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/grammys-approve-new-rules-on-use-of-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'name': 'Grammys approve new rules on use of artificial intelligence', 'description': 'The Recording Academy announced Friday new rules which stipulate that ""only human creators are eligible"" for Grammy awards, a response to the growing use of artificial intelligence.
