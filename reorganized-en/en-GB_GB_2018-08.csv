Post after post, it sometimes seems like everyone is wearing the same skirt, doing the same pose and writing the same generic captions. It’s almost as if they’re robots. Well, in fact, some of them are.Step forward Miquela (@liliquela), an artificial intelligence 'influencer'. With 1.3 million Instagram followers, she’s just like any other fashion blogger with perfectly planned posts, a themed feed and a penchant for sharing useful advice. But what makes her different? She’s entirely fake.Miquela might be artificial, but that hasn’t stopped the fashion world from embracing her. In February this year, she collaborated with Prada for Milan Fashion Week, by posting 3D-generated gifs of herself at the Milan show venue wearing the spring/summer 2018 collection. Over on Prada's Instagram account, she gave their followers a mini tour of the space, just like any influencer would for a brand. Prada isn't the only brand that's embracing the virtual world. Balmain announced yesterday that it now has a ""Balmain Army"" that features CGI models Margot, Shudu and Zhi who showcase the latest designs from its BBox line. There's even a dedicated modelling agency for digital models, including the faux face who started it all, the world's first digital supermodel, Shudu. She has featured on the cover of Hypebeast, in the pages of V Magazine wearing cool It-brands like Balenciaga and Kenzo, and has most recently made an appearance in Vogue. She even has a record out. With all of these achievements, it's unsurprising that she was named one of the most influential people on the internet by Time.The concept of artificial intelligence is still regarded as daunting, having long been associated with bleak dystopia. Films such as the Matrix and Stanley Kubrick’s A Space Odyssey, and books including Mary Shelley’s classic Frankenstein, all explore how AI could threaten and devalue humanity.That’s not the message Miquela wants to give when people come across her. “I read comments every day about fearing me, plus people toss around phrases like 'robots are taking over',” she told us via email. (Or did she? It's admittedly hard to ascertain the authenticity of a virtual reality model communicating with you via email.)“At the end of the day, I just want to be kind, uplift others, spread acceptance and share my story.”Miquela wants to quell any worries about virtual models replacing real-life models by highlighting their similarities. “You know, Instagram curation is so important,” she says. “I think a lot of humans and robots like to present the best possible version of themselves on social media.”She has a point and despite not actually existing, Miquela uses Instagram in the way we all do. It's easy to forget that the majority of posts we see are meticulously edited and don't represent the reality of life. Giving all your attention to the on-screen world instead of the real one can be toxic. Instagram was voted the worst app last year for negatively impacting issues such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image. Miquela says that even robots get trolled sometimes.“People write a lot of really messed up stuff.  I guess they’re called Internet trolls?  I used to take it to heart,  but now I've learned how to take that energy, frustration, and anger and put it into my music.”That said, when social media is used in the right way it can evoke change, create powerful messages and connect people all over the world.“Social media can be influential in a positive and inspiring way,"" Miquela agrees. ""I'm connected with people from all over the world that I would never be able to meet. It’s extraordinary how social media can bring all of us together.”So what’s next for Instagram's most famous robot influencer? It's clear that the fashion world loves her. “With so many fashion innovators out there, I hope I can work with more designers I love to help express their vision,” she says.She's even hoping to make an appearance at Fashion Week this September. ""I hope so [to attend]. Everything tends to be last minute, so until then I'll be on my laptop refreshing my Gmail account.""Miquela is much more than a passing fad. She makes us question what’s real and what’s not, a pertinent issue in today’s social media climate. She's a reminder that we shouldn’t take everything we see on Instagram as aspirational, because chances are, it’s probably fake.",743.0,Fashion,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 1200, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 900, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.7498666666666667xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 675, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.9998222222222223xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}]","{'@id': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/', '@type': 'WebPage'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': ""Harper's BAZAAR"", 'sameAs': ['https://twitter.com/BazaarUK', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/harpersbazaaruk/', 'https://www.facebook.com/harpersbazaaruk', 'http://instagram.com/bazaaruk/', 'https://www.pinterest.com/bazaaruk/'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/logo-jsonld.3f593bd.png', 'width': 312, 'height': 60}, 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Hearst Corporation'}}",https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/,"{'name': 'Jessica Davis', 'url': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/author/209070/jessica-davis/', '@type': 'Person', 'description': ""<p>Jessica Davis is <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> UK's digital writer.

But music-making AI software has advanced so far in the past few years that it’s no longer a frightening novelty; it’s a viable tool that can and is being used by producers to help in the creative process. This raises the question: could artificial intelligence one day replace musicians? For the second episode of The Future of Music, I went to LA to visit the offices of AI platform Amper Music and the home of Taryn Southern, a pop artist who is working with Amper and other AI platforms to co-produce her debut album I AM AI.

Using AI as a tool to make music or aid musicians has been in practice for quite some time. In the ‘90s, David Bowie helped develop an app called the Verbasizer, which took literary source material and randomly reordered the words to create new combinations that could be used as lyrics. In 2016, researchers at Sony used software called Flow Machines to create a melody in the style of The Beatles. This material was then turned over to human composer Benoît Carré and developed into a fully produced pop song called “Daddy’s Car.” (Flow Machines was also used to help create an entire album’s worth of music under the name SKYGGE, which is Danish for “shadow.”) On a consumer level, the technology is already integrated with popular music-making programs like Logic, a piece of software that is used by musicians around the world, and it can auto-populate unique drum patterns with the help of AI.

""AI is already integrated with consumer music-making programs like Logic""

Now, there’s an entire industry built around AI services for creating music, including the aforementioned Flow Machines, IBM Watson Beat, Google Magenta’s NSynth Super, Jukedeck, Melodrive, Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab, and Amper Music.

Most of these systems work by using deep learning networks, a type of AI that’s reliant on analyzing large amounts of data. Basically, you feed the software tons of source material, from dance hits to disco classics, which it then analyzes to find patterns. It picks up on things like chords, tempo, length, and how notes relate to one another, learning from all the input so it can write its own melodies. There are differences between platforms: some deliver MIDI while others deliver audio. Some learn purely by examining data, while others rely on hard-coded rules based on musical theory to guide their output. 

However, they all have one thing in common: on a micro scale, the music is convincing, but the longer you listen, the less sense it makes. None of them are good enough to craft a Grammy Award-winning song on their own... yet.

Of all the music-making AI platforms I’ve tried out, Amper is hands down the easiest to use. IBM and Google’s projects require some coding knowledge and unpacking of developer language on GitHub. They also give you MIDI output, not audio, so you also have to have a bit more knowledge about music production to shape the output into an actual song.

Amper, on the other hand, has an interface that is ridiculously simple. All you have to do is go to the website and pick a genre of music and a mood. That’s it. You don’t have to know code or composition or even music theory in order to make a song with it. It builds tracks from prerecorded samples and spits out actual audio, not MIDI. From there, you can change the tempo, the key; mute individual instruments, or switch out entire instrument kits to shift the mood of the song its made. This audio can then be exported as a whole or as individual layers of instruments (known as “stems”). Stems can then be further manipulated in DAWs like Ableton or Logic.

I had Amper generate the clip of music below while cruising around LA in the back seat of my friend’s car. Using my phone, I picked rock as the genre, and then, appropriately, “driving” as the mood. It spent about a minute churning away before delivering 30 seconds of audio. The result isn’t radio-ready, but it has chords, a little structure, and it sounds... pleasant. It could easily sit in the back of a YouTube video or an advertisement and no one would guess it was coded, not written.

As someone who makes music, the idea that code can do what I do is freaky. It’s unnerving to think that an algorithm can make a not-terrible song in minutes and that AI is getting in on creative turf we categorize as distinctly human. If AI is currently good enough to make jingly elevator music like the clip above, how long until it can create a number one hit? And if it gets to that point, what does it mean for human musicians?

These aren’t questions that Taryn Southern is concerned with. Southern is an online personality who you might know from her YouTube channel or when she was a contestant on American Idol. These days, Southern is interested in emerging tech, which has led to her current project: recording a pop album. Those two things don’t sound like they could be related, but her album has a twist: instead of writing all the songs herself, Southern used artificial intelligence to help generate percussion, melodies, and chords. This makes it one of the first albums of its kind, a collaboration of sorts between AI and human.

Amper was the first AI platform Southern used when beginning her album, and now she also works with IBM Watson Beat and Google Magenta. She views AI as a powerful tool and partner, not a replacement for musicians. 

“Using AI, I’m writing my lyrics and my vocal melodies to the actual music and using that as a source of inspiration,” Southern tells me. “I find that really fun, and because I’m able to iterate with the music and give it feedback and parameters and edit as many times as I need, it still feels like it’s mine in a sense.”

""AI isn’t good enough to craft a hit radio song on its own... yet""

To get an idea of how a human can work with AI, look at Southern’s 2017 single, “Break Free.” The SoundCloud audio below is an early export of material from Amper. Compare that to the YouTube video that has the final, released version of the song. Bits of the AI-composed original peek through here and there, but it’s more like seasoning, not the main dish. To transform it into a pop song, Southern made a lot of creative decisions, including switching instruments, changing the key, and, of course, writing and performing the vocals.

[Media: https://soundcloud.com/tarynsouthern/break-free-pre-arranged-no-vocals-only-ai/s-MlqhD]

[Media: https://youtu.be/XUs6CznN8pw]

Southern originally turned to AI because even though she was a songwriter, she knew “very, very little about music theory.” It was a roadblock that frustrated her to no end. “I’d find a beautiful chord on the piano,” Southern says, “and I’d write an entire song around that, but then I couldn’t get to the next few chords because I just didn’t know how to play what I was hearing in my head. Now I’m able to iterate with the music and give it feedback and parameters and edit as many times as I need. It still feels like it’s mine in a sense.”

This feeling of empowerment is exactly what Amper Music is trying to deliver. “I don’t look at it like artificial intelligence,” Amper co-founder Michael Hobe says. “It’s more of intelligence augmentation. We can facilitate your creative process to cut a lot of the bullshit elements of it. For me, it’s allowing more people to be creative and then allowing the people who already have some of these creative aspects to really further themselves.”

When Hobe says “bullshit elements,” he’s talking about a guitarist not knowing how to orchestrate an instrument they’ve never worked with before, the time spent crafting the velocity of individual drum hits, or simply being faced with writer’s block. Amper isn’t meant to create the next AI superstar; it’s meant to enable musicians. Of course, using AI also has the added benefit of allowing Southern and others with no formal music background to participate in making music. It democratizes the creative playing field so anyone can play what they hear in their head, just like Southern.

""it’s not about creating the next AI superstar; it’s about enabling musicians""

I ask Southern what she would say to people who think using AI is cheating. “Great,” she says. “Yes, we are totally cheating. If music is concretely defined as this one process that everyone must adhere to in order to get to some sort of end goal, then, yes, I’m cheating. I am leading the way for all the cheaters.” She laughs, and then pointedly says, “The music creation process can’t be so narrowly defined.”

It’s something to think about. Every time a new technology is introduced and that tectonically shifts the way we create music, there are naysayers. Things like AutoTune, the use of samples and loops, and Digital Audio Workstations were all “disruptors” that we adapted to and are now commonplace tools and methods. AI will probably be next.

The technology’s impact on the music industry as a whole remains to be seen. Will it destroy jobs? How will it affect musical copyright? Will it ever be able to work without a human? But people like Hobe and Southern believe it will ultimately reap positive benefits. Sure, an algorithm making music sounds scary because it mirrors human capabilities that we already find mysterious, but it’s also a compelling tool that can enhance said human capabilities. AI as a collaborator increases access to music-making, it can streamline workflows, and it provides the spark of inspiration needed to craft your next hit single.

“You’re collaborating and working with the AI to achieve your goal,” Hobe says. “It’s not that the AI is just doing its own little thing. It’s all about the process between it and you to achieve that final artistic vision.”

For me, it’s allowing more people to be creative and then allowing the people who already have some of these creative aspects to really further themselves.”When Hobe says “bullshit elements,” he’s talking about a guitarist not knowing how to orchestrate an instrument they’ve never worked with before, the time spent crafting the velocity of individual drum hits, or simply being faced with writer’s block. Amper isn’t meant to create the next AI superstar; it’s meant to enable musicians. Of course, using AI also has the added benefit of allowing Southern and others with no formal music background to participate in making music. It democratizes the creative playing field so anyone can play what they hear in their head, just like Southern.it’s not about creating the next AI superstar; it’s about enabling musiciansI ask Southern what she would say to people who think using AI is cheating. “Great,” she says. “Yes, we are totally cheating. If music is concretely defined as this one process that everyone must adhere to in order to get to some sort of end goal, then, yes, I’m cheating. I am leading the way for all the cheaters.” She laughs, and then pointedly says, “The music creation process can’t be so narrowly defined.”It’s something to think about. Every time a new technology is introduced and that tectonically shifts the way we create music, there are naysayers. Things like AutoTune, the use of samples and loops, and Digital Audio Workstations were all “disruptors” that we adapted to and are now commonplace tools and methods. AI will probably be next.The technology’s impact on the music industry as a whole remains to be seen. Will it destroy jobs? How will it affect musical copyright? Will it ever be able to work without a human? But people like Hobe and Southern believe it will ultimately reap positive benefits. Sure, an algorithm making music sounds scary because it mirrors human capabilities that we already find mysterious, but it’s also a compelling tool that can enhance said human capabilities. AI as a collaborator increases access to music-making, it can streamline workflows, and it provides the spark of inspiration needed to craft your next hit single.“You’re collaborating and working with the AI to achieve your goal,” Hobe says. “It’s not that the AI is just doing its own little thing. It’s all about the process between it and you to achieve that final artistic vision.”Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

Since 1953, when the term Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy in the  Dartmouth Conference, we have achieved unthinkable highs: we have taught machines to see, to recognize images or text; we have taught them to read, to listen, speak, or translate. In spite of all of that, they are not even close to achieving full human-capacities; they don’t comprehend, they don’t understand or learn further beyond the environment in which they are placed. They have unmatched computing power, but little to none true creativity; a superb ability to combine and analyze probabilities, but not a single spark of unsupervised creativity. If someone tells you that the “singularity”, the moment in which Artificial Intelligence achieves a definitive human-like character and overpasses our own biological limits on intelligence, is around the corner they are a bit too optimist -the consensus among experts in that we are still decades away from a singularity point, and some think we might never get to a true human-like intelligence-.
Regardless of the time to a future in which we have to address machines as intellectually equal or superior, the revolution of AI is unstoppable in so many other ways. The amount of resources and talent devoted by the largest global corporations is accelerating a new industrial revolution in which the speed of adoption is increasingly faster than the pace of adaptation.

The fact that increasingly complex automation is applied to problems that were solved entirely by humans opens the door to great opportunities but also to fallouts and shortcomings. According to consulting firm Accenture, American companies are expected to invest 35 trillion dollars in cognitive technologies before 2035, and that does not take into account other big players, such us Europe, China or Japan. Governments, such the French, are recognizing the importance of AI for the economy and the society. In Spain, the Ministry of Digital Agenda (Minetad) has created a group of experts that is working on a White Paper on AI.
The fact that an increasingly more complex automation is applied to problems that not long ago were part of a human task opens the door to many opportunities, but also to risks, threats and misunderstandings. In this scenario we should be more concerned about the human bias introduced in AI that about self-conscious killing machines. To avoid misuse, ethical norms have to be in the core of AI development and answer questions such as “how” and “what for”. 

An ethical development, must help to fight biases and discrimination, provide transparency, audits of models and a strict respect for privacy.
The new AI could be used to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to win a war. The disparity of dilemmas that these technologies bring to the table are well beyond the engineering domain, even though knowledge of the intricacies of the technology is necessary to deconstruct the problem.


There are initiatives that are creating a trail of principles and rules, such as the 23 principles of Asilomar. In fact, more voices ask for a global consensus of minimum rules for the role of AI in society; something the European Union is starting to explore.
Killer Machines
As early as 1942, Isaac Asimov was able to envision a world in which Artificial Intelligence needed to be governed by basic laws. An AI that makes life and death decisions requires clear ethical norms that limit the possibility of AI negligence or weaponized AI (see Project Maven and Google), as explained in the dystopian short film ‘Slaughterbots’, by Stuart Russell. 
In part, to correct the perception on the role of AI in the company’s future, Google recently released  a new set of principles that will guide them in the application of new AI capabilities, including a rejection of lethal applications of AI.
Intelligent machines are going to be embedded in every infrastructure, from air traffic, the electric grid or urban planning. The imminence of self-driving cars, trucks or passenger planes generates understandable public concern and requires solid safeguards to avoid hacking, unfair decision-making or proper response to unexpected events.
Government, civil society, academia, and businesses have to establish communication channels to implement measures that reduce the impact and occurrence of errors. Furthermore, they have to create platforms in which to measure and correct algorithmic-based decision that perpetuate or widen inequality. In this early stage of human-taught machines there is a high possibility that machine learning designers transmit on purpose or inadvertently biases that make society more unfair instead of moving us forward in the opposite direction.

To correct these problems increased transparency will be essential. The use of “black boxes” in the creation of machine learning models could worsen if intelligent machines are trusted with decision-making. The ability of these machines to “explain” the reasoning behind such a decision will improve accountability, supervision and avoid giving full control to artificial agents.
Unemployed by machines
The next challenge is how to integrate AI in a world where different levels of economic development, political priorities and skilled workforces coexist. The G20 is already working on measures to mitigate the impact of work automation in developed countries and in certain sectors that are likely to be highly automated in the next few decades. Ideas such as basic income or “taxing robots” should be, at least, considered by policy makers in order to correct extreme inequalities, and send a large number of citizens to the fringes of society and without the necessary resources to be incorporated in the AI economy.

As Economists Anton Korinek and Joseph Stiglitz put it: “innovation could lead to a few very rich individuals, whereas the vast majority of ordinary workers may be left behind, with wages far below what they were at the peak of the industrial age”.

Augmented by machines
But the creative potential of AI is much greater and offsets any other. AI in the workplace could equip workers with almost superhuman abilities to perform complex tasks, that take advantage of vasts amounts of information, personalizing services to a level that even the customer deems impossible today.
An “augmented” AI worker can complete better distributed and fairer transactions or services, that could bring the world to a new era of development and inclusion. Not only tedious tasks will be eventually eliminated, humans will have more time to reflect on the true purpose of new technologies or have greater impact in their communities.
Medical diagnosis could be almost flawless, the process of preventing or finding solutions in possible advert scenarios could be analyzed in record time. Education, healthcare or financial services (key components in an AI-driven economy) would become more accessible, even for those that have had unequal access up until today, because a personalized path for inclusion could be built for each one. At the same time humans won’t have to be exposed to dangerous or eroding jobs, creating a services-only type of workforce.

The use of AI for social good help us identify hidden needs in vulnerable parts of the population, find insights in the way wealth is transmitted and circulates through the economic system, fight corruption, fraud and crime. AI can also facilitate channels for a more direct, participatory democracy, speed up bureaucratic processes, and improve budgetary prioritization. For all these goals to be achievable these AI tools should incorporate elements that are increasingly present in the debate of the development of automation: “Privacy by Design”, “Ethics by Design”, “Fairness by Design”, “Sustainable by Design”, “Transparent by Design”, etc.

In conclusion: the augmented capacities that AI is going to add to our capacity to process information and make decisions should improve our lives in general, should eliminate tedious tasks in the workplace, will increase productivity in the medium to long run, and, most likely, will free us to undertake more creative tasks or simply to reduce the workload per capita. The shortcomings that could be originated during this complex transition have to be tackled not only from a technological perspective, but also from a socioeconomic or ethical point of view. The design of effective political frameworks and accountability should be a necessary component if we want to extract the full potential of AI technologies.

The benefits and downfalls of AI in the construction industry

 August 31, 2018  5079 




New research by Powertools2U has outlined the benefits and negatives of artificial intelligence and what the technology can bring to the construction industry
The use of artificial intelligence has significantly increased over the last few years and has been implemented into the construction sector to bring about advancements in risk mitigation, safety and generative design processes.
Risk Mitigation
By using Construction Language Analysis, from tools such as Autodesk BIM 360 software, algorithms are able to understand complex data and predict potential problems.
Safety
Researchers from Waterloo University in Canada have discovered that by using AI technology in the construction industry and scanning software, they can track the body movement of bricklayers to analyse their form in order to reduce the amount of injuries on-site.
In addition, AI lends itself to face recognition to ensure complete safety and to authorise qualified professionals.


Generative design process
AI can be used to measure a project’s parameters which is then fed into a computer which understands the data and requirements of their physical location.
Design options are then generated and sent to the architect to match the needs of the client.
Drawbacks
Alternatively, the technology’s ability to replicate human work has also led to a dramatic job loss which has impacted the sector’s current workforce.
According to leading design and consultancy firm, Arcadis, a shortfall in human workers has led to an increase of AI in the construction industry.
Arcadis have said that the construction sector needs to recruit over 400,000 workers each year between now and 2021 to keep up with demand. They added that this figure does not include the amount of workers the UK will lose out on due to Brexit.
Research conducted by international construction company Mace, predicts that 600,000 jobs could be lost within the construction industry out of the 2.2 million positions currently held, all of which will be lost to automation by 2040.
Unfortunately, brick layers are set to be hit the most with 73,000 workers expected to drop to 4,300
With the amount of AI in the construction industry, many have predicted when we will see a human-free construction force.
The following estimations include:
2018 – Saas Solutions permeate the industry
2019 – AR and IoT go mainstream
2020 – Pre-fabrication and 3D productions soar
2021 – Regulations allow 24/7 drone monitoring of projects
2022  – self-guided machines appear on-site
2023 – AI allowed to manage first project
2024 – Autonomous machine takes over
2025 – Decline in human workforce – rise of tech

An unhealthy, dangerous or otherwise toxic workspace is known to deter workers from innovation and damage a company's reputation. Entrepreneurs have a responsibility to ensure that working environments keep employees safe, satisfied and positive so they can remain productive and innovative on the job.With the focus on workplace health management programs, along with the emergence of AI technologies, it's crucial to understand how these disruptive tools will affect the health -- mental, social and physical -- of workers across various sectors.AI is promising to change the way workplaces operate, but will it be a force for good or disrupt workplace culture in negative ways? With the expectation that AI will create a $190.6 billion market by 2025, it could be a tool used to provide healthier, more productive, and accessible work environments for all employees.



From hazardous to healthyToxic work environments, whether physically or mentally toxic, can take a toll on workers' well-being and productivity. It's estimated that companies lose up to $300 billion annually because of absentee workers with high stress levels, according to the American Institute of Stress.Surveys and workplace trends have pointed to the fact that emerging technologies, like AI, can play a significant role over the next several years and beyond. For example, they can effectively adopt meditative practices into the workplace, employee support, and improvements to communication to name a few. Strategic health-focused strategies can align employees' well-being and the company's mission, vision, and core values.


Companies are beginning to implement more health initiatives to retain employees and revenue. Surveys and research including a 2017 study from the American Psychological Association Center found that 61 percent of working Americans experience chronic work-related stress.Related: This Is How to Get Started With AI When the Only Thing You Know Is the AcronymWell-being technology in the workplaceAlready, well-being technology is upending the way workplaces run. A series of workplace innovations are integrated with workforce monitoring, trackers, digital platforms, and occupational health and safety technologies. Cloud platforms integrate an organization's wellness programming into the company's digital infrastructure, all while capturing data that engages with employees across the business, and actively communicating information with them. Platforms, trackers and workforce monitoring tools are interconnected via wearable or app-based activity tracking devices and, with the help of AI, they're about to get even better. Emotional well-being technology is also on the rise in workplaces. Apps like Ginger.io provide emotional counseling with the help of AI pattern recognition platforms.These device capture employee information through employee input or an automated tracker, but some e-health companies now offer metrics and action plans on combined outputs with real-time advice and guidance through big data and machine learning. Companies like Glint use AI and natural language processing to capture and analyze qualitative data from various sources.


According to a report on The Future of Technology in Workplace Wellbeing from Uprise founder Dr. Jay Spence, early evidence suggests that tech is acceptable and positively affects outcomes in the workplace.However, companies still have a long way to go to make technology an enabler of office health. A recent Colliers study has found that only 26 percent of companies subsidize the cost of fitness-tracking tools to support employee health and fitness such as Fitbit trackers, but this number is expected to increase significantly by 2020.In other areas, for example, AI-enabled wearable tools imbued with machine learning algorithms and natural language processing can help identify workers who struggle with productivity or happiness in the office with the following approaches:Cognitive insightsAI metrics can also identify patterns, referred to as cognitive insights. They can accurately process large troves of highly detailed employee data, while improving upon their predictive analytics for work behaviors and patterns as time goes on. Types of machine learning, deep learning specifically, can attempt to mimic human brain activity to recognize these patterns, even identifying images and speech. It configures higher probable matches in behavior amongst data associated with the same person or company, even if it's in different formats.


For example, GE has utilized this tool to incorporate supplier data, saving $80 million with the elimination of redundancies and negotiating contracts as part of an employee business task. Overall, cognitive insights can target its insights for job performance when paired with wellness technology to identify behavior speech patterns and modes or working that are either unhealthy or dangerous to others.Related: Think Twice About a Company When You Keep Hearing These 4 AI BuzzwordsCognitive engagements The Harvard Business Review also reports that companies surveyed in their study report using cognitive engagements to interact with employees even more so than with customers. Cognitive engagement provides employees with:Intelligent agents that can answer questions and provide support in an employee's natural languageInternal sites for answering employee questions on topics including IT, employee benefits, and HR policyPersonalized and engaging communications between higher-ups and other employeesHealth treatment recommendation systems that allow companies to create customized care plans that considers the patients' health status of workers and their previous treatments (which still remain confidential to the employer)Workplace relationshipsIn terms of HR and employee relationships, AI can help provide smoother insights to create cohesive and innovative team dynamics. HR pros and CEOs, for instance, can use Etch, an AI-led contact manager that provides insights to identify the progress, roles, and projects for each employee through a data-filtered system. A unified database can be searched and filtered to offer intelligent information on an entrepreneur's contacts and employees.


AI can also track and assess how well team members collaborate with each other. Humanyze, a startup, provides smart ID badges that track employees throughout the office, reporting data to employers on how well employees interact and collaborate during the day. Overall, AI can help increase the predictive power used in team collaboration and innovation. Although this may sound a bit intrusive, employers have been monitoring employees habits on their work computers since computers became popular. Besides, employees often passively consent to workplace surveillance when they sign their contracts.With AI insights, employees and HR can build more trusting and smoother relationships that allow for improved transparency and innovation in the workplace, offering a healthier work culture.Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide.Office designIn addition to workplace relationships and wearable tech, AI can also help improve physical and mental health through office design. Buildings that take advantage of AI provide an opportunity to personalize and create spaces that feel open and limitless for better productivity, transparency and safety.


For example, research finds that the human mind's need to connect to nature increases productivity by 15 percent. But how does AI help? AI can assess mood through personalized, input data or emotional well-being technology to determine if employees should need physical or environmental stimuli. Automated sensors systems built into offices could adjust the natural lighting of the building throughout the day.AI can even remember to water plants. Autonomous internal watering systems like the Arudino Powered Watering System can give offices control over keeping their sustainable environments. And since the biophilic craze has become part of modern office design, Gensler's Office Workplace Productivity survey suggests that including technology like AI is an essential tool to help workers determine how they're working in these spaces with real-time data and updates advising when they need to move into different workspaces or take a break.When it comes to safety, AI can also monitor and recognize movements and speech patterns that are considered dangerous or hazardous to employee safety. If there is an emergency, devices like Orion Lab's Panic Bot will automatically notify teammates of emergencies or hazards. Benevolent intelligence software from the likes of One Concern can map an environment like a city or office so first responders know how to assess a natural disaster or emergency situation.


A healthy employee is a happy employee and with AI's assistance and the workplace could become a solutions-driven environment that brings together the best qualities of each worker. A study conducted by The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated found that four out of five surveyed employees think there is a significant opportunity for AI to create more engaging and empowering workspaces and experiences. While some may be unsure about AI's place in the workplace, ultimately, it will be a tool used to reshape the way workers feel, operate, and produce quality work. AI could finally help us like work again.

If you are still taking a ""wait and see"" approach to artificial intelligence, you may already be falling behind your peers in IT. Although just 15 percent of enterprises are using AI, 31 percent said that it was on the agenda for the next 12 months, according to Adobe's February 2018 “Digital Trends” report. That number will only go up as machine learning and AI technology continues to change how we work, live, and think. Along these lines, Mary Meeker's 2018 Internet trends report cited AI as a hot growth area for IT spending.
There is plenty of hype-filled speculation about what the future of AI will look like. But most leaders just want to know what they can do now to better prepare themselves, their teams, and their businesses for what lies ahead.

A new piece of software adapts the facial expressions of people in videos to match an audio track dubbed over the film

Dubbing films could become significantly easier in the future. A team led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken has developed a software package that can adapt actors’ mouth movements and whole facial expressions to match the film’s translation. The technique uses methods based on artificial intelligence and could save the film industry a considerable amount of time and money when it comes to dubbing films. The software can also correct the gaze and head pose of participants in a video conference to boost the impression of a natural conversation setting.

Film translators and dubbing actors work within a set of rigid limitations. After all, they must ensure that the words they put into actors’ mouths not only accurately reproduce what was said but also correspond to the actors’ lip movements and facial expressions. Now, an international team led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics has presented a technique known as Deep Video Portraits at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in Vancouver. This technique does away with the need to synchronize the translated audio track with the facial expressions in the video footage. Instead, the software can adapt the actors’ facial expressions – and above all their lip movements – to match the translation.
The software was developed by a team involving not only the Max Planck researchers in Saarbrücken but also scientists from the University of Bath, Technicolor, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and Stanford University. In contrast to existing methods, which can only animate the facial expressions found in videos, the new technique also adapts the head pose, gaze, and eye blinking. It can even synthesize a plausible static video background if the head moves.
The technique could transform the visual entertainment industry
In order to reproduce features realistically, the researchers use a model of the face in conjunction with methods based on artificial intelligence. “We work with model-based 3D face performance capture to record the detailed movements of the eyebrows, mouth, nose, and head position of the dubbing actor in a video,” explains Hyeongwoo Kim, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. ""It works by using model-based 3D face performance capture to record the detailed movements of the eyebrows, mouth, nose, and head position of the dubbing actor in a video.""
For the time being, the research merely demonstrates a new concept, and the method has yet to be put into practice. However, the researchers believe that the technique could completely transform sections of the visual entertainment industry. “Despite extensive post-production manipulation, dubbing films into foreign languages always presents a mismatch between the actor on screen and the dubbed voice,” says Christian Theobalt, who leads a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and played a key role in the current work. “Our new Deep Video Portraits approach enables us to modify the appearance of a target actor by transferring head pose, facial expressions, and eye motion with a high level of realism.”
More natural conversation settings in video conferencing
As well as a realistic rendering of films into other languages, the method also has a range of other applications in film production. “This technique could also be used for post-production in the film industry, where computer graphics editing of faces is already widely used in today’s feature films,” says Christian Richardt, who participated in the project on behalf of the University of Bath’s motion capture research centre CAMERA. One example of this type of editing is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt’s face was replaced with a modified computer graphics version in nearly every frame of the film. Until now, interventions such as this often required many weeks of work by trained artists. “Deep Video Portraits shows how such a visual effect could be created with less effort in the future,” says Richardt. With the new approach, the positioning of an actor’s head and their facial expression could easily be edited in order to subtly alter the camera angle or framing of a scene and thus to tell the story better.
In addition, the new technique could also be used in video and VR teleconferencing, for example, where people typically look at the screen and not into the camera. As a result, they don’t appear to be looking into the eyes of their conversation partners on the other end of the video link. With Deep Video Portraits, the gaze and head pose could be corrected to create a more natural conversation setting.
Neuronal networks detect videos that have been edited
The software paves the way for a host of new creative applications in visual media production, but the authors are also aware of the potential for misuse of modern video editing technology. Whereas the media industry has been editing photos for many years, it is now increasingly easy to edit videos – and with increasingly convincing results. Given the constant improvements in video editing technology, we must also start being more critical about video content, just as we already are about photos, especially if there is no proof of origin, says Michael Zollhöfer from Stanford University. “We believe that the field of digital forensics should and will receive a lot more attention in the future to develop approaches that can automatically prove the authenticity of a video clip.”
Zollhöfer is convinced that, with better methods, it will be possible to spot modifications of this kind in future, even if we humans might not be able to spot them with our own eyes. This issue is also being addressed by the researchers who presented the new video editing software. They are developing neuronal networks that are trained to detect synthetically generated or edited video with high precision in order to make it much easier to spot forgeries.
The scientists currently have no plans to make the video modification software publicly available. Moreover, they say that any such software should leave watermarks in videos in order to clearly mark modifications.

With about 1 million robots in use in Asia, robotics and automation mean economic risks and growth opportunities for the region. For Asia to fully reap this digital opportunity as the world’s main engine of growth, countries need to revamp their education systems and invest in innovation to support a workforce for humans and robots alike.
As digital technologies like artificial intelligence transform business models, the rise of industrial robot usage—robotics used for manufacturing, for example in welding—in Asia signals a change is underway.
As our chart of the week from the last Regional Economic Outlook: Asia Pacific shows, Asia is at the forefront of automation with an estimated 65 percent of the world’s total industrial robot usage for 2017. In Asia, China is now the single biggest user of these robots with an estimated 50 percent of the region’s total industrial robot usage, followed by Korea and Japan. 

It comes as no surprise then that Asia, with all these robots, has the highest robot density, which is the number of industrial robots per 10,000 workers. Korea and Singapore are global leaders in robot density, followed by Germany and Japan.
Further, Asia may be the global leader in employing industrial robots, but it is also the region with the highest robot production—Japan and Korea are the world’s top two producers, with market shares of 52 and 12 percent, respectively.
Robot takeover
With more than half of the world’s estimated stock of industrial robots in use, Asia’s investments in robotics show how crucial the automation of production is for the region’s economies.
Yet, automation and digitalization are not new. Recent advances in computing power and powerful data generation equip robotics with more cognitive capability, such as the latest generation of robots that can collect data to adapt their movements in real time. This means that more complex work that could only be done by humans can now be done by machines. 
This trend could mean trouble for workers in Asia where relatively low-cost and low-skilled labor has been the basis for the region’s role as “the factory to the world.” More robots than humans doing technical work may bring down the cost of business, including labor costs, significantly. As a result, workers are displaced as producers are more likely to employ robots that cost less and perform more effectively, rather than having to pay wages.
Digital divide vs. digital dividend
The movement towards more automation and digitalization may bring global economic challenges, but it also provides opportunities for Asia to bolster its economy and reap the digital dividend—the economic benefits that come from going digital. 
To maintain its global competitiveness and to keep the world’s main engine of growth running, Asia’s policymakers need to tackle disruptions caused by automation and robots by supporting job creation without stifling innovation. This fine balance is easier said than done, but policies that can help include:

Equipping job seekers with globally competitive skillsets by revamping education
Investing in physical and regulatory infrastructure that supports entrepreneurship, innovation, and competition; and
Addressing labor-market and social challenges, including income redistribution and safety nets.

Stay tuned for more details on policies to accomplish this shift in the upcoming October 2018 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia Pacific. The report focuses on the digital economy and the economic impact of digitalization and automation developments in Asia, and policies to reap digital dividends.

Which Cities are Hiring the Most A.I. and Machine Learning Experts?

Machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.) are two of the most-hyped concepts in technology at the moment. Even businesses without the budget to afford a platoon of subject-matter experts want to leverage machine learning to make their processes “smarter.” Meanwhile, tech giants such as Google hope that A.I. can remake the world, or at least change how we drive to work every day. But where are the actual A.I. jobs? According to a new study by Indeed, the highest concentration of these positions is in New York City, with 11.6 percent of the site’s job postings. San Francisco came in second, with 9.6 percent, followed by San Jose with 9.2 percent. Washington D.C. (7.9 percent) and Boston (6.1 percent) rounded out the top five. These results aren’t surprising. New York, San Francisco, San Jose, and Boston are huge tech hubs; Washington D.C. features government agencies, defense contractors, and consulting firms that are all attempting to figure out how to best make A.I. work for them. In an accompanying blog posting, Indeed suggested that New York’s variety of “industry centers,” including “media, fashion, and banking,” were responsible for its impressive showing. Despite its second-place showing, Silicon Valley clearly remains dedicated to exploring A.I. “San Jose has the most job postings for algorithm engineers, computer vision engineers and machine learning engineers, which are all in the top four for jobs that most frequently require A.I. or machine learning skills,” that posting added. “San Jose also had the most job postings for research engineers.” Those tech pros with the right combination of A.I.-related skills can make incredible amounts of money. Earlier this year, for example, The New York Times analyzed a tax filing by OpenAI, a nonprofit that specializes in A.I. work, and found that its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, made nearly $2 million in 2016. Another researcher earned $800,000. Nor is that the ceiling: At a conference in mid-2017, Tom Eck, CTO of industry platforms at IBM, said that “top-tier A.I. researchers are earning the same salaries as NFL quarterbacks.” Many quarterbacks make many millions of dollars per year, so you can imagine what those tech pros make. These high salaries at least partially stem from scarcity: A recent analyst report from McKinsey & Company estimated the number of qualified A.I. experts in the world at fewer than 10,000. And companies know that the A.I. and machine learning market will only get bigger, with the report estimating that the practical applications of artificial intelligence could add a staggering $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in value across various industries over the next several years. We can infer that even those A.I.-trained tech pros who aren’t operating at “NFL quarterback level” can comfortably pull down a six-figure salary—no matter where they live. No matter what the future may hold, learning at least some A.I. skills has some clear benefits on your career.

“You have to deal with robots as part of your workforce,” says Singaporean civil servant June Koh.

She is the Cluster Director of Human Capital at the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Part of her job is to identify skills in demands in the industry and “find emerging skills, emerging demand even before they appear”, she says. This comes from observing trends, analysing data, and a deep understanding of industries. “It’s not just what the companies want today, but what they think they will also need tomorrow.”

Koh shares how her team are working with colleagues and companies to ensure people have the right skills for these jobs.
Skills in AI
 




 
One of the key skills areas IMDA have identified is in artificial intelligence. “That requires you to upskill and rethink the skills that jobs required,” Koh says. For instance, maintenance and cleaning jobs are increasingly being automated.

Along with some jobs changing, “there will also be new jobs that will be created”, she adds, and this will require people to learn new skills. “There will be probably optimisation of jobs - I don't think we will be shy with that.”

The government set up a national programme, AI Singapore (AI.SG), to enhance Singapore’s AI capabilities and drive the future digital economy. IMDA has partnered with AI.SG to run apprenticeships with AI experts in the industry.

Apprentices solve real-world business problems, getting hands-on experience while at it. “We want to work with them to see how we can build in opportunities for Singaporeans to be part of that learning experience,” Koh explains.

[blockquote]“We want to build more in those specific new areas where the existing workforce can also apply and level up and switch careers.”[/blockquote]
Besides government-led programmes, IMDA is lending expertise to various big firms across sectors - banking and telecommunications among them - to help them run various training programmes in areas such as cybersecurity. This is meant to help established professionals in particular: “They pull in mid-careers and enable them to switch,” Koh explains. “We want to build more in those specific new areas where the existing workforce can also apply and level up and switch careers.”
Tomorrow’s skills demand

Two other skills areas that IMDA has identified are in IoT and immersive media, Koh says. IoT will present opportunities in manufacturing or even cyber security, as it has much to do with physical and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, immersive media - augmented and virtual reality - are entirely new ways to communicate stories and concepts to people, and correspondingly require different methods of production than traditional media.

These may not translate into a great deal more new jobs - rather, “it could be a current job, it's just an extension of skill”, Koh says. IMDA’s role here is to help in “deepening courses available in those fields in order to assist that extension of the current job”.

Koh works closely with various ministries, private sector, business associations and academia to identify what types of ICT skills will be in demand in the coming years. Once she has a clear sense of emerging areas, the next step is to work with industry to see how IMDA can support them in training people in these skills.

IMDA’s teams crunch the numbers, looking at growth projections, internal data, and historical trends to predict skills that will be in demand. The agency has a yearly research survey that helps here. “We also then look at job ads and study the patterns and what kind of job roles they are asking for,” Koh says. Key hirers weigh in through various platforms to give a clearer view of what is going on in industries and “validate some of our hypotheses”, she adds.

The agency holds forums to get feedback from companies on talent recruitment and ICT manpower. “It’s a good way to review and improve the programmes and support available for ICT professionals as well as hirers to narrow any gaps or challenges they may face in ICT talent and skills development,” says Koh.

As Singapore’s industries adapt to AI and other new technologies shaking things up, it is important for any professional to have avenues to learn skills that will hold them in good stead. It might even be possible to pivot mid-career and make the switch to something new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Durban school kids now have chance to learn about Artificial Intelligence 
by Tyler Leigh Vivier@tylerleighvAugust 31, 2018 712 0 
















 


Grade 3 to 7 learners from RA Padayachee Primary in Durban are learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) during an after-school STEM education programme
 
Technology is growing at a rapid rate and children these days need to have the skills that will enable them to work in a world that is technilogically more advanced than right now. Learning the basics of computational thinking, electrical engineering, mobile computing and robotics will greatly benefit a child today, as they become the adults of tomorrow.
I-Innovate has partnered with U.S. developers, Curiosity Machine to bring the AI Family Challenge to South Africa with aim of ultimately reaching 20 000 learners in disadvantaged communities around the world.  Learners, teachers and family members get together to explore fascinating facets of AI technologies such as machine learning, speech recognition, prediction models, autonomous vehicles and neural networks.  
As learners learn and apply AI concepts, they are inspired to use them to find solutions to pressing community problems when it comes to food, agriculture, health, transportation and energy.  
The ‘learn by doing’ approach to mastering the series of design challenges presented by I-Innovate are aimed at igniting creativity, problem-solving, collaboration and innovation.   The learning experience fosters a strong and valuable sense of empowerment, confidence and inclusion in the learners.
Grade 3 to 7 learners from RA Padayachee Primary and their teachers have stepped into the astounding world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) during an after-school STEM education programme called the AI Family Challenge. Other programmes like this one have been successful in Cape Town.
“With these hands-on design challenges, we make complex AI concepts tangible,” says I-Innovate CEO, Trisha Crookes.  
“For instance, participants understand how autonomous vehicles process different signals by building a system of circuits to simulate sensors and rapid decision-making.   More importantly, over the course of the challenge, participants develop a learner mindset that gives them a lifelong ability to innovate and problem-solve.”
 
“The AI Family Challenge is another inspiring and highly relevant way of showing children in our communities that they can have a meaningful impact today and in the future,” concludes Crookes.Related StoryGood Things Guy and OneCart Bring Mandela Day Joy to 67 Deserving Readers

The prospects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are thrilling not only for high income economies but also for small ones like Mauritius which are marching towards a transformative journey. AI is expected to permeate every major industry from healthcare to finance, education and transportation. However, in African countries including Mauritius, this technology carries with it a fear of loss of employment. Will AI prove to be more of boon or a bane? Experts shed lights on its impact, consequences and vast opportunities.
Dr Bhavish Jugurnath.In the previous Budget 2018-2019, the Government has put much emphasis on fostering the development of a new growth pole revolving around AI. Worldwide experts predict that AI could contribute up to 15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Similarly, Accenture research states that AI would double annual economic growth rates in 2035 as well as bring various changes in the nature of work between human and machine.
According to the McKinsey Global Institute, AI is contributing to a transformation of society “happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale or at roughly 3,000 times the impact” of the Industrial Revolution. AI is not a new concept; in fact, this concept was coined in 1956 by the scientist John McCarthy at Dartmouth College, USA. Now after 60 years, this concept has taken a new dimension. Thus, Mauritius cannot lag behind in this rapid transformation.
Loganaden Velvindron.Nevertheless, the main issue has been raised by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which predicts a loss of around five million jobs by 2020 in fields like BPOs, which has been a major pillar for middle class economies like African countries.
Dr. Heman Mohabeer, who is currently Head of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at BIRGER, argues that right now, in Mauritius, there is a significant turmoil in the technological aspect as everyone wants to race toward AI. “AI promises to deliver in terms of opportunities and the way we do business. However, there seem to be some confusion as to how to embark into the so called ‘industry 4.0’, as there are no significant guidelines on how to proceed with the adoption of AI. Natural language processing, Computer vision and blockchain promises to change the technological facet but we need to be cautious since all these revolves around data. Unless we can consolidate our local laws regarding data privacy and transparency, people will either reject or be cautious of AI. After all, much of AI is still a black box and lots of people fail to understand the mechanism behind the wonders of AI/machine learning.” 
Dr Oomesh Gukhool.Dr. Ramesh Caussy, CEO and Founder Partnering Robotics, on his part,  underlines that Mauritius, like most of the countries in Africa, is nowhere as almost nothing has been done during the past 20 years. “We have a lack of leadership in Mauritius and Africa in the fields of technology and AI. Our decision makers and investors do not believe in our potential and explore the usual patterns that build of future chains.”
Impact on Mauritian society
As per the report of the Economist Intelligence Unit, it is expected that AI has a positive impact on growth (90%), productivity (86%), innovation (84%) and job creation (69%) in their countries and industry. In Mauritius, the impact is multifold.
Dr. Oomesh Gukhool, Senior Lecturer at the University of Mauritius, states the small size of the country offers significant challenges. “Our human resource and know-how are major assets which are conducive to an acceptable degree of economic resilience. However, sustaining such resilience necessitates the development of new strategies. One factor that may increase the degree of our economic resilience is through digital transformation. AI will lead to the digital transformation of our island. It can be a major avenue to enhance economic development as well as to improve our quality of life.”
Dr Heman Mohabeer.The Senior Lecturer also adds that AI may help to strengthen national competitiveness. “AI will help to accelerate the pace of innovation in Mauritius. With the right framework, AI can ensure a better democracy with the advent of deep fake detection, by promoting direct democracy, and by reducing the distortion of information.”
For Dr Heman Mohabeer, the impact of AI will be huge as it will bring unprecedented opportunities if we are able to fully harness it. “Mauritius is geographically well positioned to become a technological hub and an incubator for the sub-Saharan African region. The most important contribution that AI will bring is efficiency and transparency in the various sectors. AI will allow a much closer integration of the ‘human-technology’ relationship and will enable people to perform more efficiently. Contrary to speculations, new jobs will be created.”
Dr. Ramesh Caussy highlights that like in every country, AI will progressively modify the industries, markets, and the value chains. “This will give rise to players and change to positioning of the existing incumbent actors. Whether people like it or not, this means transformation and need to embrace this new technology and use case dissemination.”
Economic impact
Economist Dr Bhavish Jugurnath evokes fundamental economic issues. “AI creates a new way of thinking about technology, business development and strategic execution. Overall, we can expect to see a spike in the frequency, flexibility and immediacy of data analysis across industries and applications to drive business decisions.”
Prospects
Referring to the Budget 2018-2019, Dr Gukhool avers that the introduction of the Mauritius Artificial Intelligence Council will scale opportunities in this field. “The Government will be setting up a task force to develop a road map for Mauritius in order to measure the socio-economical impacts of the promotion of AI. It is also important to boost research with the aim to pioneer advance AI research in order to bring innovation and attract foreign investment.” The Senior Lecturer highlights that the formulation of an AI policy is mandatory to sustain an ethical and effective integration of AI in our local context.
Already, lots of opportunities are being created by the impact of AI across the world. Mauritius is no different, says Dr Heman Mohabeer. “There is a major scarcity in talents in the field of AI. If we manage to fit the right curriculum in our educational system, then the opportunities and impact will be big. Data scientist, Machine learning engineer are among the few job skills that will be required. Adoption of AI in different sectors will bring its fair share of contribution toward making those sectors more efficient. However, we need to invest heavily and start developing the relevant to avoid job mismatch once AI takes over the so called ‘traditional technologies’.”
Loganaden Velvindron recalls that it is an opportunity for a small country to make a major impact on the world map. “People are unaware that Mauritius has contributed to Internet Security already by working on new internet protocols such as TLS 1.3. Same can be done with AI if we have the right people, the right environment and the right business model. However, the private sector needs to work together with the public sector to retain our brains which will build those opportunities.”

Major contribution across sectors
From transport to finance, health, insurance or SMEs, AI will bring remarkable transformation in the short and long term. Some of the major contributions have been summarized as follows by experts.
Reduce road congestion
For the Senior Lecturer, the introduction of road sensors and cameras will be essential in the collection of data regarding traffic flow. He believes that machine learning can be useful to identify traffic patterns and anomalies, while complex algorithms may help in road decongestion. AI can be a crucial element in altering the behaviour of road users in view of mitigating road accidents.
Increase productivity  
Dr Oomesh Gukhool argues that the use of AI (Big data and Analytics) will optimise business processes and increase productivity. AI will improve the accuracy of product/service demand estimation, provide predictive maintenance, foster personalised manufacturing, and bring efficiency to product supply chains. AI will be beneficial to the agriculture sector since it will improve efficiency, for instance, using AI and image processing techniques to identify crop diseases and to monitor soil productivity
Dr. Ramesh Caussy argues that AI will bring more fluid coordination mechanisms of the country as well as the bureaucracy process. “It will also create new opportunity for the industrial and institutions to reduce costs and create new jobs. This is what Schumpeter called ‘the creative destruction’.”
Build smarter cities
The Senior Lecturer firmly believes AI will be able to learn how people use cities. “Data from ticket sales, tax information, police reports, sensors and cameras can be significantly important for pattern recognition. AI can count and track movement of vehicles as well as pedestrians, read license plates and recognise faces, in order to reduce drive time, improve security, and make better use of smart grids to streamline power and water usage in our cities.”
Improve the efficacy of the Government-to-Citizen system
AI will provide personalised services for the Government-to-Citizen system, thus reducing delays and effort required as well as scaling citizen satisfaction, says the Senior Lecturer. “Chatbots can be used as digital representatives for selective citizen services. Sentiment analysis can be helpful to better perceive citizen inquires and feedback.”
Position Mauritius as technological hub
Dr Heman Mohabeer believes that AI could help to make Mauritius a technological hub thereby solving various problems such as road infrastructure planning, smart health care system, intelligent crop farming. Just like currently AI is used to identify and predict which crops to adopt based on climatic condition change in Australia.

Employment cut off : Myth or reality?
One of the major fears is job cut off, which has been predicted by various experts. What could be the situation in Mauritius? Dr Bhavish Jugurnath argues that there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of people. “One of the biggest concerns regarding AI is that it will replace human labour. 9% of all jobs are indeed at high risk of being automated. However, a new set of personnel will be required to build, maintain, operate and regulate emerging technologies linked to AI and to help people learn to work with them. Therefore, there is a resistance from employees and decision-makers to adopt a technology that might end up replacing their co-workers. The overall impact of AI in jobs is highly controversial today. A recent study launched by the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will destroy 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging countries. However, industry leaders such as Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce affirm the opposite, that the use of AI in businesses will instead create qualified jobs.”
The Economist recalls that AI needs to be explored for the value it brings to specific business functions rather than for a need for novelty. “Skills scarcity is a major constraint on the adoption of AI. All economic sectors are facing the need to adapt their workforce’s skill sets. At stake is their ability to support and complement the AI-powered user experience. To do so, companies have two options: they can either hire external talents or they can rely on their own resources. The first obstacle here is the general shortage of digital talents and data scientists in Mauritius. Companies therefore need to upskill and retrain their own human resources, which is a complex and costly process.”
For Dr Heman Mohabeer, there is more of a myth than a fact when it comes to loss of jobs. “The reality is that there will be job displacement rather than job loss. Indeed, people will need to work smarter as they will be assisted by AI. In fact, more opportunities will be created rather than losses. As at now, the best AI works using supervised learning, meaning that it must be instructed on how to perform. We are a long way (probably at least one hundred years if technology revolves in the similar trend) to achieve completely autonomous machine capable of reasoning without the assistance of human being.”
Dr. Ramesh Caussy argues that there will be cut offs but there will also be new opportunities and people, organization, society, again need to work on their abilities to adapt to the new needs. “This is a kind of Darwinian technological evolution.”
For Loganaden Velvindron, AI will assist people more in their work rather than replacing them. “There are still cases where AI can fail. Many of those AI systems have failures, so you still need a human being to check on them.”

Artificial intelligence salaries benefit from the perfect recipe for a sweet paycheck: a hot field and high demand for scarce talent. It’s the ever-reliable law of supply and demand, and right now, anything artificial intelligence-related is in very high demand.
According to Indeed.com, the average IT salary — the keyword is “artificial intelligence engineer” — in the San Francisco area ranges from approximately $134,135 per year for “software engineer” to $169,930 per year for “machine learning engineer.”
However, it can go much higher if you have the credentials firms need. One tenured professor was offered triple his $180,000 salary to join Google, which he declined for a different teaching position.
However, the record, so far, was set in April when the Japanese firm Start Today, which operates the fashion-shopping site Zozotown, posted new job offerings for seven “genius” AI tech experts, offering annual salaries of as much as 100 million yen, or just under $1 million.

It suggests the group supposedly charting society’s future is even less inclusive than the broader tech industry, which has its own well-known diversity problems.
At Google, 21 percent of technical roles are filled by women, according to company figures released in June. When WIRED reviewed Google’s AI research pages earlier this month, they listed 641 people working on “machine intelligence,” of whom only 10 percent were women. Facebook said last month that 22 percent of its technical workers are women. Pages for the company’s AI research group listed 115 people earlier this month, of whom 15 percent were women.
A Google spokesperson told WIRED that the company’s research page lists only people who have authored research papers, not everyone who implements or researches AI technology, but declined to provide more information. Facebook also declined to provide details on the diversity of its AI teams. Joelle Pineau, who leads the Montreal branch of Facebook’s AI lab, said counting the research team’s publicly listed staff was “reasonable,” but that the group is small relative to everyone at Facebook involved in AI, and growing and changing through hiring.
Pineau is part of a faction in AI research trying to improve the field’s diversity—motivated in part by fears that failing to do so increases the chance AI systems have harmful effects on the world. “We have more of a scientific responsibility to act than other fields because we’re developing technology that affects a large proportion of the population,” Pineau says.
Companies and governments are betting on AI because of its potential to let computers make decisions and take action in the world, in areas such as health care and policing. Facebook is counting on machine learning to help it fight fake news in places with very different demographics to its AI research lab, such as Myanmar, where rumors on the company's platform led to violence. Anima Anandkumar, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who previously worked on AI at Amazon, says the risks AI systems will cause harm to certain groups are higher when research teams are homogenous. “Diverse teams are more likely to flag problems that could have negative social consequences before a product has been launched,” she says. Research has also shown diverse teams are more productive.
Corporate and academic AI teams have already—inadvertently—released data and systems biased against people poorly represented among the high priests of AI. Last year, researchers at the universities of Virginia and Washington showed that two large image collections used in machine learning research, including one backed by Microsoft and Facebook, teach algorithms a skewed view of gender. Images of people shopping and washing are mostly linked to women, for example.
Anandkumar and others also say that the AI community needs better representation of ethnic minorities. In February, researchers from MIT and Microsoft found that facial analysis services that IBM and Microsoft offered to businesses were less accurate for darker skin tones. The companies’ algorithms were near perfect at identifying the gender of men with lighter skin, but frequently erred when presented with photos of women with dark skin. IBM and Microsoft both say they have improved their services. The original, flawed, versions were on the market for more than a year.
The scarcity of women among machine learning researchers is hardly surprising. The wider field of computer science is well documented as being dominated by men. Government figures show that the proportion of women awarded bachelor's degrees in computing in the US has slid significantly over the past thirty years, the opposite of the trend in physical and biological sciences.
Little demographic data has been gathered on the people advancing machine learning. WIRED approached Element about doing that after the company published figures on the global AI talent pool. The company compiled a list of the names and affiliations of everyone who had papers or other work accepted at three top academic machine learning conferences—NIPS, ICLR, and ICML—in 2017. The once obscure events now feature corporate parties and armies of corporate recruiters and researchers. Element’s list comprised 3,825 names, of which 17 percent were affiliated with industry. The company counted men and women by asking workers on a crowdsourcing service to research people on the list online. Each name was sent to three workers independently, for consistency. WIRED checked a sample of the data, and excluded six entries that came back incomplete.
The picture that emerged is only an estimate. Rachel Thomas, a professor at the University of San Francisco, and cofounder of AI education provider, Fast.ai, says it can still be useful. Figures on AI’s diversity problem might help motivate attempts to address it, she says. “I think it’s a fairly accurate picture of who big companies working on AI think are appropriate people to hire,” Thomas says.
AI’s lack of diversity and efforts to address it have won more attention in recent years. Thomas, Anandkumar, and Pineau have all been involved with Women in ML, or WiML, a workshop that runs alongside NIPS, currently the hottest conference in AI. The side-event provides a venue for women to present their work, and in 2017 boasted corporate sponsorship from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Similarly, boldface tech brands sponsored a new workshop that ran alongside NIPS last year called Black In AI, which hosted technical research talks, and discussion on how to improve the field’s diversity. Fast.ai’s courses are designed to offer an alternative to the conventional grad school track into AI, and the company offers diversity scholarships.
Despite the growth of such programs, few people in AI expect the proportion of women or ethnic minorities in their field to grow very swiftly.
Diversity campaigns at companies such as Google have failed to significantly shift the predominance of white and Asian men in their technical workforces. Negar Rostamzadeh, a research scientist at Element, says AI has its own version of a problem well documented in tech companies whereby women are more likely than men to leave the field, and less likely to be gain promotions. “Working to have good representation of women and minorities is positive, but we also want them to be able to advance,” Rostamzadeh says.
Women in AI research also say the field can be unwelcoming and even hostile to women.
Anandkumar and Thomas say they learned long before completing their PhDs that it’s not unusual for men in computer science or math research to subject women to inappropriate remarks or harassment. Two long-standing computer science professors at Carnegie Mellon University resigned this week, citing “sexist management.” In February, Anandkumar made online posts with the #metoo tag, describing verbal harassment by an unnamed coworker in AI.
Events at NIPS in recent years illustrate the challenge of making the field more welcoming to women—and how the new money flowing into AI can sometimes make it worse.
In 2015, the founders of a Canadian startup called Deeplearni.ng brought t-shirts to the conference with the slogan “My NIPS are NP-hard,” an anatomical math joke some men and women found inappropriate. (The conference’s full name is Neural Information Processing Systems.) Stephen Piron, founder of the startup, now called Dessa, says making the shirt “was a meat-headed move” he regrets, and that his company values inclusion.
At last year’s event, Anandkumar and some other attendees complained that a party hosted by Intel—which also sponsored the Women in ML event—where female acrobats descended from the ceiling created an unwelcoming atmosphere for women. An Intel spokesman said the company welcomes feedback on how it can better create environments where everyone feels included. The conference’s official closing party generated similar complaints, triggering investigations into the behavior of two prominent researchers.
One was University of Minnesota professor Brad Carlin, who performed at the NIPS closing party in a band called the Imposteriors made up of statistics professors. Carlin, who plays keys, made a joke about sexual harassment during the show. Tweets complaining about his remark spurred data scientist Kristian Lum to write a blog post alleging that a person involved in the incident—later confirmed to be Carlin—and another, unnamed, researcher had touched her inappropriately, on separate occasions. Carlin later retired after a University of Minnesota investigation found he had breached sexual harassment policy on multiple occasions. Bloomberg reported the second man was Steven Scott, Google’s director of statistics research. A company spokesperson confirmed Scott left the company after an internal investigation into his behavior.
The organizers of NIPS are now working on a more detailed code of conduct for the event, which takes place in Montreal this December. Last week they sent out a survey soliciting opinions on alternatives to the current name that wouldn’t have the same “distasteful connotations.“ Candidates include CLIPS, NALS, and ICOLS.
Pineau of Facebook doesn’t have a preference, but is in favor of changing the name. “I have searched for the conference and ended up on some really unpleasant websites,” she says. She also cautions that renaming NIPS shouldn’t distract from AI’s larger, and less easily fixed problems. “I worry a little bit that people will think we’ve done a grand gesture and momentum on other things will slow down,” she says.",,business,"['https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7609f0f521ce3ac9ba4560/16:9/w_2399,h_1349,c_limit/The%20Gender%20Imbalance%20in%20AI%20v2.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7609f0f521ce3ac9ba4560/4:3/w_2400,h_1800,c_limit/The%20Gender%20Imbalance%20in%20AI%20v2.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7609f0f521ce3ac9ba4560/1:1/w_1801,h_1801,c_limit/The%20Gender%20Imbalance%20in%20AI%20v2.jpg']","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/'}","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}",https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tom Simonite', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/tom-simonite/'}]",https://schema.org/,tags,,"Tom SimoniteBusinessAug 17, 2018 7:00 AMAI Is the Future—But Where Are the Women?Just 12 percent of machine learning researchers are women—a worrying statistic for a field supposedly reshaping society.Casey ChinSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →CompanyAlphabetAmazonFacebookGoogleMicrosoftEnd UserResearchSectorResearchITFor all their differences, big tech companies agree on where we’re heading: into a future dominated by smart machines. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all say that every aspect of our lives will soon be transformed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, through innovations such as self-driving cars and facial recognition. Yet the people whose work underpins that vision don’t much resemble the society their inventions are supposed to transform. WIRED worked with Montreal startup Element AI to estimate the diversity of leading machine learning researchers, and found that only 12 percent were women.That estimate came from tallying the numbers of men and women who had contributed work at three top machine learning conferences in 2017. It suggests the group supposedly charting society’s future is even less inclusive than the broader tech industry, which has its own well-known diversity problems.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTAt Google, 21 percent of technical roles are filled by women, according to company figures released in June. When WIRED reviewed Google’s AI research pages earlier this month, they listed 641 people working on “machine intelligence,” of whom only 10 percent were women. Facebook said last month that 22 percent of its technical workers are women. Pages for the company’s AI research group listed 115 people earlier this month, of whom 15 percent were women.Trending NowWomen Engineers On the Rampant Sexism of Silicon ValleyA Google spokesperson told WIRED that the company’s research page lists only people who have authored research papers, not everyone who implements or researches AI technology, but declined to provide more information. Facebook also declined to provide details on the diversity of its AI teams. Joelle Pineau, who leads the Montreal branch of Facebook’s AI lab, said counting the research team’s publicly listed staff was “reasonable,” but that the group is small relative to everyone at Facebook involved in AI, and growing and changing through hiring.Percent of men and women who contributed work to three leading machine learning conferences in 2017.

Facebook is counting on machine learning to help it fight fake news in places with very different demographics to its AI research lab, such as Myanmar, where rumors on the company's platform led to violence. Anima Anandkumar, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who previously worked on AI at Amazon, says the risks AI systems will cause harm to certain groups are higher when research teams are homogenous. “Diverse teams are more likely to flag problems that could have negative social consequences before a product has been launched,” she says. Research has also shown diverse teams are more productive.Corporate and academic AI teams have already—inadvertently—released data and systems biased against people poorly represented among the high priests of AI. Last year, researchers at the universities of Virginia and Washington showed that two large image collections used in machine learning research, including one backed by Microsoft and Facebook, teach algorithms a skewed view of gender. Images of people shopping and washing are mostly linked to women, for example.Anandkumar and others also say that the AI community needs better representation of ethnic minorities. In February, researchers from MIT and Microsoft found that facial analysis services that IBM and Microsoft offered to businesses were less accurate for darker skin tones. The companies’ algorithms were near perfect at identifying the gender of men with lighter skin, but frequently erred when presented with photos of women with dark skin. IBM and Microsoft both say they have improved their services. The original, flawed, versions were on the market for more than a year.The scarcity of women among machine learning researchers is hardly surprising. The wider field of computer science is well documented as being dominated by men. Government figures show that the proportion of women awarded bachelor's degrees in computing in the US has slid significantly over the past thirty years, the opposite of the trend in physical and biological sciences.Share of bachelor's degrees earned by women in the US.

WIRED approached Element about doing that after the company published figures on the global AI talent pool. The company compiled a list of the names and affiliations of everyone who had papers or other work accepted at three top academic machine learning conferences—NIPS, ICLR, and ICML—in 2017. The once obscure events now feature corporate parties and armies of corporate recruiters and researchers. Element’s list comprised 3,825 names, of which 17 percent were affiliated with industry. The company counted men and women by asking workers on a crowdsourcing service to research people on the list online. Each name was sent to three workers independently, for consistency. WIRED checked a sample of the data, and excluded six entries that came back incomplete.The picture that emerged is only an estimate. Rachel Thomas, a professor at the University of San Francisco, and cofounder of AI education provider, Fast.ai, says it can still be useful. Figures on AI’s diversity problem might help motivate attempts to address it, she says. “I think it’s a fairly accurate picture of who big companies working on AI think are appropriate people to hire,” Thomas says.AI’s lack of diversity and efforts to address it have won more attention in recent years. Thomas, Anandkumar, and Pineau have all been involved with Women in ML, or WiML, a workshop that runs alongside NIPS, currently the hottest conference in AI. The side-event provides a venue for women to present their work, and in 2017 boasted corporate sponsorship from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Similarly, boldface tech brands sponsored a new workshop that ran alongside NIPS last year called Black In AI, which hosted technical research talks, and discussion on how to improve the field’s diversity. Fast.ai’s courses are designed to offer an alternative to the conventional grad school track into AI, and the company offers diversity scholarships.Despite the growth of such programs, few people in AI expect the proportion of women or ethnic minorities in their field to grow very swiftly.Diversity campaigns at companies such as Google have failed to significantly shift the predominance of white and Asian men in their technical workforces.

Is the Art Market Ready to Embrace Work Made by Artificial Intelligence? Christie’s Will Test the Waters This Fall
The auction house is selling an AI-produced work of art for the first time this fall.

Christie’s New York will make history this fall when it becomes the first auction house to sell a work of art made by artificial intelligence. The print on canvas, a product of an algorithm developed by the French art collective Obvious, will be included in the auction house’s prints and multiples sale October 23-25.
 Hugo Caselles-Dupré, a member of the Paris-based collective, told artnet News that they were “interested in the philosophical approach behind this,” he said. “Can an algorithm be creative? If so, this algorithm is the closest to the human mind’s creativity.”
The work was created using a model called a Generative Adversarial Network. The artists first fed a generator a dataset of 15,000 portraits done between the 14th and 20th centuries. It then created new works based on the training set until it was able to fool a test designed to distinguish whether an image was made by human or machine.
The resulting work, titled Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, depicts a man in a dark coat and white collar with indecipherable facial features that reside somewhere in the uncanny valley. The unique piece, a gold-framed canvas print that is currently on view in Christie’s London showroom, is estimated at $7,000-10,000. The collective says it will use the proceeds from the sale to further train its algorithm, finance the computational power needed to make such works, and experiment with 3D modeling.
Obvious Art’s ??? ? ??? ? ?? [??? ? (?))] + ?? [???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, Generative Adversarial Network print on canvas (2018).The Christie’s sale constitutes an important validation in the realm of AI art. Although there are many so-called “creative coders” who use similar technologies to improve web experience, few are considered contemporary artists. The members of Obvious see themselves as conceptual artists whose main goal is to democratize Generative Adversarial Networks and legitimize AI-produced art.
“We wanted to propose this new approach to a more traditional market rather than the tech area,” Caselles-Dupré said. “At the beginning it was difficult to be understood by the traditional art market because they were looking at us like, ‘Who are those guys? What is this new weird stuff?’ But the more we’ve explained what we’re doing, what we want to share, and what we want to say, the more the art world is paying attention to our work.”
Following the Christie’s sale, Obvious plans to work with brands and galleries to expand the movement. “We really believe that AI can be a new tool for art,” Caselles-Dupré said. “In 1850, when the camera showed up, it was only used by highly qualified engineers and so it was not considered for its artistic potential. We think we are in the same situation, because people view us as engineers but we really think this type of technology will be used more and more in art.”
Installation view of Obvious Art’s ??? ? ??? ? ?? [??? ? (?))] + ?? [???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018).The collective began a conversation with Christie’s following a London symposium on the implications of blockchain for the art world. “Christie’s continually stays attuned to changes in the art market and how technology can impact the creation and consumption of art,” said the auction house’s head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, in a statement. “AI has already been incorporated as a tool by contemporary artists and as this technology further develops, we are excited to participate in these continued conversations.”
Edmond de Belamy is one of 11 portraits of the fictional Belamy family, which is named after Ian Goodfellow, the AI researcher who invented the Generative Adversarial Network method in 2014. (“Goodfellow” roughly translates to the French bel ami.) Another portrait from the family, Le Comte de Belamy, sold to Parisian collector Nicolas Laugero-Lassere earlier this year.

The issue was so bad that the number of active contributors or editors—those that made one edit per month—had fallen by 40 percent during an eight-year period. Even though there’s not one solution to combat this issue, Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that supports Wikipedia, decided to use artificial intelligence to learn more about the problem and consider ways to combat it.

Collaboration with Wikimedia Foundation and Jigsaw to Stop Abusive Comments
In one effort to stop the trolls, Wikimedia Foundation partnered with Jigsaw (the tech incubator formerly known as Google Ideas) on a research project called Detox using machine learning to flag comments that might be personal attacks. This project is part of Jigsaw’s initiative to build open-source AI tools to help combat harassment on social media platforms and web forums.
The first step in the project was to train the machine learning algorithms using 100,000 toxic comments from Wikipedia Talk pages that had been identified by a 4,000-person human team where every comment had ten different human reviewers. This annotated dataset was one of the largest ever created that looked at online abuse. Not only did these include direct personal attacks, but also third-party and indirect personal attacks (""You are horrible.""  ""Bob is horrible."" ""Sally said Bob is horrible."") After training, the machines could determine a comment was a personal attack just as well as three human moderators.
PROMOTED
Then, the project team had the algorithm review 63 million English Wikipedia comments posted during a 14-year period between 2001 to 2015 to find patterns in the abusive comments. What they discovered was outlined in the Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale paper:

More than 80% of all comments characterized as abusive were made by more than 9,000 people who made less than five abusive comments in a year rather than an isolated group of trolls.
Nearly 10% of all attacks were made by just 34 users.
Anonymous users made up 34% of all comments left on Wikipedia.

More than half of the personal attacks are being carried out by registered users although anonymous users were six times more likely to launch personal attacks. (There are 20 times more registered users than anonymous users.)

Now that the algorithms have created more clarity about who is contributing to the community’s toxicity, Wikipedia can figure out the best way to combat the negativity. Although human moderation is likely still needed, algorithms can help sort through the comments and flag those that require human involvement.
Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES System)
Another reason for the significant decline in editors to Wikipedia is thought to be the organization’s complex bureaucracy as well as its harsh editing tactics. It was common for first-time contributors/editors to have an entire body of work wiped out with no explanation. One way they hope to fight this situation is with the ORES system, a machine that acts as an editing system powered by an algorithm trained to score the quality of changes and edits. Wikipedia editors used an online tool to label examples of past edits, and that was how the algorithm was taught the severity of errors. The ORES system can direct humans to review the most damaging edit and determine the caliber of mistakes—rookie mistakes are treated more appropriately as innocent.
AI to Write Wikipedia Articles
Well, AI can do ""OK"" writing Wikipedia articles, but you have to start somewhere, right? A team within Google Brain taught software to summarize info on web pages and write a Wikipedia-style article. It turns out text summarization is more difficult than most of us thought. Google Brain's efforts to get a machine to summarize content is slightly better than previous attempts, but there is still work to be done before a machine can write with the cadence and flair humans can. It turns out we're not quite ready to have a machine automatically generate Wikipedia entries, but there are efforts underway to get us there.
While the use cases for artificial intelligence in the operations of Wikipedia are still being optimized, machines can undoubtedly help the organization analyze the vast amount of data they generate daily. Better information and analysis can help Wikipedia create successful strategies to troubleshoot negativity from its community and recruitment issues for its contributors.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",2018-08-20T11:37:08-04:00,The Amazing Ways How Wikipedia Uses Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christie’s Will Be the First Auction House to Sell Art Made by Artificial Intelligence
Christie’s will sell the work from Paris-based art collective Obvious, which created ‘Portrait of Edmond Belamy’ with the machine-learning algorithm GAN

At first glance, portraits of the Belamy family seem to exemplify life in the upper echelons of French society. The haughty features of patriarch Le Comte De Belamy are framed by a voluminous white powdered wig, while the dynastic matriarch, La Comtesse, oozes wealth in her colorful silk attire. Skipping ahead several generations, you’ll encounter Madame De Belamy, whose tightly coiffed hair is tucked inside a blue hat rendered in Impressionistic strokes, and her son Edmond, a comparatively dour-looking young man clad almost entirely in black.
But there’s a catch to this story of generational greatness: In addition to being wholly fictional, the Belamy family hovers in that amorphous space between artificial intelligence and art. Although its members’ names and places in the family tree were assigned by Obvious, a Paris-based art collective, their likenesses are the brainchild of Generative Adversarial Networks, a machine learning algorithm better known by the acronym GAN.

Now, Naomi Rea writes for Artnet News, the youngest member of the family—as depicted in “Portrait of Edmond Belamy”—is set to make history as the subject of the first AI-produced artwork sold by an auction house.
A canvas print of Obvious’ (and GAN’s) creation will be included in Christie’s late October auction of Prints and Multiples, the New York-based auction house reports. It remains to be seen how bidders will react to the AI work, but Obvious remains optimistic, citing an estimated sale price of €7,000 to €10,000, or roughly $8,000 to $11,500.
Hugo Caselles-Dupré, one of Obvious’ three co-founders, tells Christie’s Jonathan Bastable that GAN consists of two parts: the Generator, which produced images based on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries, and the Discriminator, which attempts to differentiate manmade and AI-generated works.
“The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits,” Caselles-Dupré says. “Then we have a result.”



    
      The painting is one of 11 portraits depicting the fictional Belamy family, which was named in honor of GAN creator Ian Goodfellow

According to an essay posted on Obvious’ Medium page, GAN analyzes thousands of images to learn the basic features of portraiture. The subsequent AI-generated portraits are both similar to the images in the original data source and singularly unique. A different image is rendered with every execution of the algorithm.
“This reflects a human creativity feature: We will never create twice the same thing,” Obvious writes.
Obvious, a three-man team made up of Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier, owes much to American AI researcher Ian Goodfellow, who developed the GAN algorithm in 2014. As Time’s Ciara Nugent notes, the rough French translation of “Goodfellow”—bel ami—provided inspiration for the fictional family’s name.
The Belamy portraits are painted in a semi-realistic style, their blurred details creating an overarching impression of motion. In the bottom right corner of the canvases, the artist’s signature is replaced by an intimidating mathematical equation:





Such proclamations of authorship are a central concern in the art world’s AI debate. Skeptics of the new technology doubt that machines can produce art, which has long been viewed as a uniquely human activity. If an AI researcher designs and executes an algorithm, who is the end product’s true creator: human artist or machine? And, most importantly, if robots can create art, where does that leave humans?
There are no easy answers to these questions, but as Rose Eveleth, host of the future-centric podcast Flash Forward, argued in a recent episode, this isn’t the first time humans have felt threatened—or entranced—by machine-made art.
Swiss-born watchmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz launched the golden age of automata, or kinetic sculptures designed to mimic human movement, with “The Writer.” The 1770s doll was made of 6,000 moving parts that allowed it to scribble out an array of messages, dip a quill into an inkwell, and blink with unseeing eyes.
At the time, philosophers were engaged in a heated battle over what it meant to be alive, Eveleth notes. While we don't think of today's AI as a living organism, modern technology does continue to raise existential questions about what it means to be human. Consider a more recent innovation: the camera. It also posed some philosophical problems, Caselles-Dupré tells Time’s Nugent.
“Back then, people were saying that photography is not real art and people who take pictures are like machines,” he says. “And now we can all agree that photography has become a real branch of art.”
By including “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” in its fall sale, Christie’s isn’t offering a final ruling on the value of AI art. Still, the decision is sure to attract ire, elation and, if the sale is successful, newfound faith in the burgeoning medium.
“I’ve tended to think human authorship was quite important—that link with someone on the other side,” Richard Lloyd, head of Christie’s Prints and Multiples department, tells Nugent. “But you could also say art is in the eye of the beholder. If people find it emotionally charged and inspiring, then it is. If it waddles and it quacks, it’s a duck.”

Google recently successfully put its DeepMind artificial intelligence system to work recognising eye diseases. With AI also being used to diagnose cancer, and the launch of AI-driven smartphone apps that can discuss symptoms and triage patients, it might sound like we’re not too far from the creation of a fully fledged AI doctor.
Similar progress is being made putting AI to work writing software and evaluating legal contracts. AI has even started to make its mark in the creative world, generating artworks and fashion, evaluating graphic design, and helping people to create music. So does AI pose a threat to highly skilled jobs in the same way it does to ones that involve simple, repetitive tasks?
New technology has been making workers redundant for hundreds of years. But advances in the various industrial revolutions have also always created other new jobs, and people have been able to adapt. In the end, successful technologies were those where human and machine worked in harmony for the benefit of wider society. But the AI revolution may be different because it could affect as many white-collar professional roles as manual jobs.
That jobs involving lower skilled office work such as data processing will be reduced seems inevitable and, indeed, is already starting to happen. But AI is also invading the realm of highly trained professionals, such as software engineers. However, it’s largely happening in a way that shows how AI will be more of a tool than a threat to skilled workers. It may become more common for professionals to be required to learn how to benefit from the power of AI, than for entire jobs to simply disappear.

Take computer programming. A longstanding dream of researchers is to develop an AI that can develop complex new software from scratch. The reality is that such a goal is probably a bit too far-fetched. The informal and subjective descriptions usually used to create briefs for programmers are just too imprecise for that.
But researchers have realised that AI can be very powerful at optimising existing software, for instance to make it faster and use less energy. Optimising software requires very specific skills, which most software developers actually don’t have. So this kind of AI could be very helpful in improving software development without threatening existing jobs.
Researchers have started to develop novel ways for AI to detect various types of software bugs in realistic scenarios. And companies such as Facebook already use AI testing tools capable of revealing software crashes, a type of bug that causes apps to abort unexpectedly. These are vital tasks given how increasingly important software is to the smooth functioning of society, yet they are currently very hard for people to carry out.
Why we should welcome AI doctors

We can predict a similar pattern in medicine. Many countries, including developed ones such as the UK, have a shortage of medical staff. For example, there are simply not enough well-trained doctors to be able to accurately diagnose the early signs of eye disease. AI could provide a solution to help human practitioners improve their capabilities. And with diagnosis taken care of, medical staff can spend more of their time actually caring for their patients.
This kind of technology could become even more helpful in countries where the number of well-trained doctors per head of population is much smaller, or for remote communities where accessing any medical advice is difficult. So the kind of research being carried out by Google DeepMind should be welcomed not feared by the medical profession.
We should use AI for the tasks that AI is good for, so that we can fill in gaps where there is a shortage of staff and where tasks cannot be easily automated. The challenge we do have is to equip students and professionals for the changes to their jobs that will occur and for the new, unknown jobs that AI will create in the future. With appropriate and timely training, fears of high-skilled job losses won’t come true, enabling society to concentrate more on the benefits that AI will bring.
The modern jobs market is very competitive and continuous professional development is already vital in many professions. In some ways, this could place us in a better position than people at the time of the industrial revolution. But current educational trends towards examinations and mechanistic thinking are movements in the wrong direction. Regurgitating facts and processing data is what machines are good for. Creativity and critical thinking, meanwhile, have never been so important for humanity.

Can We Guess It Out AI Being Not More Than A Buzzword?

Published by Amer Ahmed

We constantly get updates now and then about how the advancing technology of Artificial Intelligence is about to transform the whole industrial world in the coming next five years with significant implications about how we live and work.













Or, can it be such that it is not more than a buzzword for the field of computer science which has till now not made any kind of great leap forward in the past decade.





The view is being aired by Zia Chisti as he opines that the claims made about Artificial Intelligence is disturbing the current setup in every industry present on the earth at a very high speed.

But what is ironical is that Mr. Zia Chisti not among any of those pundits, but he is a computer scientist who has made two multi-billion dollar business and the latest one is devoted for Artificial Intelligence.

The company, Afiniti calls itself as the world’s top artificial intelligence solutions provider and caters to clients about machine learning techniques to interact with their customers.
But the founder of the firm says that the rush by large corporations is nothing to do with any kind of AI strategy up their minds but are based on current fashion over the technology rather than real problems and challenges faced by the technology.

“Really there’s nothing here that’s tremendously groundbreaking – the same principles that were at work even 40 years ago are still at work today,” he says.


He readily accepts the point that machine learning technology has leaped forward similar to the processing power.
But about Artificial Intelligence, he is very skeptical of the kind warned by the likes of Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk in which it is being said that the machines surpass humans and will force them to leave jobs.
According to him, Artificial Intelligence means that the computers are required to acquire human characteristics such as understanding the complete meaning and context of any given situation or to become conscious.

“Nobody serious thinks we’ve made any progress on those fronts,” he says. “There’s not one person in the field that has any view that we’re any closer to generalized intelligence than we were two decades ago.”

He outrightly dismisses the IBM Watson’s mastery of the game show Jeopardy as a kind of “marketing” which has got little relevance to the one encountered in the real world deployment of artificial intelligence.

Robot ordering the human out

Amidst all the hype over AI, there is also a lot of disquieting buzz about the negative consequences of AI. These fall broadly into three camps: job loss, criminal use, and ethical issues. Here, I focus on the concerns of job loss because this is a very real issue.

Philosophically, I am a card-carrying member of the AI fan club, being involved in it for the past three decades, starting with writing expert systems in Prolog back in the mid-80s and moving on to research. I always thought—and continue to think—that outside of low-temperature physics, AI is the coolest invention to beat all inventions in the history of humanity.
So, what more is there to fear here? I won't go into scholarly statistics about the number of jobs that have already been lost to AI with many more potentially on the chopping block. I won't harp on how the transportation industry, facing acute shortages of truck drivers (surely one of the most mind-numbing jobs ever), is looking into AI ""to dump the fleshbag[s] and let the trucks rumble solo down the highway.""
PROMOTED
In my latest book on AI+Blockchain, I describe how jobs that we thought must require a human touch and are therefore safe from AI aren't so immune after all. A quick example should convince you how a number of AI-based technologies can unwittingly collude to make this possible: driverless cars, robotics, payment systems, vision, and natural language understanding for a start. These form a synergistic continuum that, in the restaurant experience alone, can eliminate the parker (valet), barker (doorman), greeter, checker (coat and hat), seater, order-taker, server, sommelier, manager, entertainer, cleaner, and cashier. Let's not forget, tucked away in the kitchen, possibly robotic cooks. Let's face it, fast food burgers don't require a 5-star chef, do they?
All this is widely available on search engines for your reading pleasure (or agony, depending on your viewpoint). But what you won't see as much is the bigger revolution in jobs that I think is inevitable, whether one likes it or not, a revolution that will take place quietly at first, and then with increasing impact.
This revolution will have a much deeper impact than the mere (!) loss of jobs, devastating as job losses can be. After all, unemployment is nothing new. Anyone remember the following industries? Buggy whip makers, switchboard operators, or lift operators? How about knocker-uppers, aka wake-uppers: people whose job was to knock on the outside of your window to wake you up at a specified time in the morning; seriously, that used to be a job 100 years ago before the widespread use of the alarm clock!

Except for the most ardent Luddites, all reasonable people accept this as the price of progress and adapt in their own way. This adaptation is possible mostly because of the disruption caused by automation generally takes a long time to make a whole industry totally extinct.
Here is what I believe about AI and job loss:
Q: Will automation, specifically AI-driven automation, eliminate jobs?
A: Yes. Lots of them and in the most unexpected ways and at an unexpected pace.
Q: Will lost jobs be replaced by other jobs, just as it happened so far throughout history?
A: Only to a limited extent; there will be a massive net loss of jobs. I know many scientists and thought-leaders whom I respect a lot are predicting a huge increase in AI-related jobs to more or less compensate for the losses. I think this time they are wrong. When jobs were lost to mechanization, jobs for the mind opened up. What will happen when jobs for the mind become unnecessary or uneconomical?








Scientists Warn AI Means Job Losses
https://stimsinstitute.files.wordpress.com





Q: Should we retrain our children to compete with robots?
A: This question doesn't even make sense. Did you retrain your kids to run faster than cars? Did you retrain your kids to become stronger than tractors?
Q: Should we refocus children's education to those areas that AI cannot address?
A: Yes and no. The skills that are immune to AI—and unfortunately that is a wispy barrier—are the most impervious to mandatory formal training methods because they stem from innate passion or prodigy-like natural skills. Examples are higher math, theoretical physics, the higher levels of art and music, and so on. For these types of skills, I am reminded of what Edward Gibbon said, ""But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.""
How would you adapt to a revolution that promises, not in words but by example, to eliminate the notion of jobs itself? This is the unthinkable frontier beyond which few people are venturing. The idea that we must have jobs is so ingrained in human culture that we forget to ask why.
Let's step back for a second and look at this objectively. The reason we need jobs is so we can pay our bills, buy things, and fulfill our desires. What we really want aren't jobs but the income that jobs bring us. What we need is work (not jobs) for self-fulfillment, and therein lies an enormous difference. More on that below.
What proportion of workers can truly claim that they love their jobs? Talk is cheap. The acid test is this: If you were to win a lottery jackpot worth several millions, would you continue to work at your current job, perhaps for free? I suspect that even those who claim that they really, really love their jobs would re-examine their options if they hit the jackpot. People may continue working, but they wouldn't hanker after paying jobs, especially not jobs that are ridden with stress, abuse, harassment, and office politics.
Isn't this the promise of automation? Let's take a walk down a path that admittedly stretches our credulity. Imagine a future where most of the work is automated, thanks to AI. This would include farming, transportation of goods, personal transportation, maintenance of roads, generation of power, manufacturing, custodial services, interaction services (for example, customer service and in restaurants), medical care, elderly care, schooling, and so on.
Note that I'm not saying humans will be—or even could be—completely eliminated from the equation, only that their role will become either minimal or move up the cognitive scale; they would function as casual supervisors or auxiliary helpers when things get really tricky, and that too on very reduced work hours.










Far out? Not at all. This is already happening in isolated examples. As William Gibson said, ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""
Informed people know that this is already happening. What stretches the imagination a bit is how this affects jobs. Let's get back to the fundamentals of economics - the law of supply and demand and its effect on prices.
When AI eliminates jobs (more accurately, the need for them), there is the obvious loss of income. This means less disposable income and reduction of spending on nice-to-have goods and luxuries. Less demand forces prices to drop. If prices drop below a level where commodity margins are threatened, the company and eventually the industry, will fold.
Prices of necessary goods (generally, commodities) will continue to drop, but shrinking margins are somewhat offset by decreasing operational costs (thanks to AI-driven automation). Food prices, for example, could go down. Remember that the sinister food cartels that we fear (whether truly sinister or not) cannot keep charging seemingly high prices because consumers' inability to pay cannot sustain high prices in the long run.
Rather than outright and widespread job loss, what I think will happen is a gradual lessening of work hours, eventually moving employees from full-time to temp. But, if all things go well, the loss in pay need not pinch because there will be a corresponding decrease in costs for all types of goods.
People will slowly come to the realization that total income is less important than relative income. Indeed, income that is measured relative to one's neighbor is even less important than measuring against its economic power. Would you lose much sleep if your six-figure salary got cut in half if home prices were also slashed to a fifth, a pound of filet mignon cost $1.50, and a 10-lb bag of potatoes cost 10 cents? Would you really care if the richest person on the planet makes one hundred million times more income than you do under these conditions?
I don't think people would worry so much about the end result if all things go well. The problem is in the transition, of course. Not all things go well all the time. But the general direction will be towards less job-related work without any corresponding reduction in the quality of life (and perhaps an overall improvement in the quality of lifestyle). This progress will obviously not happen in a straight, happy path, but will meander agonizingly, causing considerable distress, backtracking, and excitement along the way.
In truth, I suspect that there will be plenty of advance notice of impending job loss. A few hundred thousand truck drivers aren't going to show up for work one morning only to be told that they have all been replaced overnight by driverless trucks. Drivers' ed instructors will not be completely blindsided to find one day that they have no students because everyone switched over to driverless cars. The entire DMV staff isn't going to be laid off on the same day because autonomous vehicles and blockchains put them out of business overnight.










There will be a transition which, despite all the hype and exuberance, will have a fairly long trajectory. But slowly, slowly, across the board, people will start discovering that they really don't have to work 60 hours a week. There will be serious proposals to reduce the work week from 40 hours to 36 hours; then to four days a week. Full-time work gives way to part-time work. Desk-bound, 8-5 work will slowly give way to flex-time work. Remote work will edge out on-site work. People will cut their working hours by 25% and find, to their pleasant surprise, that their lifestyle actually improves a bit as a result, even if they aren't making the previous level of income. Hard work will be replaced by smart work (but 'smart' perhaps not in the sense of making enormous amounts of money with little work, but in the sense of obtaining high returns on happiness and lifestyle). Financial freedom will give way to time freedom.
AI will cause enormous job losses, but that is nothing compared to the loss of meaning in traditional work and virtue of duty-bound toil. This will force people to re-examine their motivations for work. Would you get up in the morning and do something for your own sake, for your own pleasure and passion, when you don't have to do so to feed yourself?
What will you do when you don't have to?
Many people will be unpleasantly shocked to find they have no passion. For them, AI spells debilitating inertia, deepening despair, and the slide into apathy. A happy group (hopefully, more than a few) will look upon this as a golden opportunity to get rid of the shackles of work they must do so they can do work they want to do.
The AI revolution will be eclipsed by the revolution caused by decoupling jobs from work and by moving from ""I work, therefore I live"" to ""I live, therefore I work."" Sociologists will be forced to re-examine and re-formulate their models of human interaction and organization. Economists will be forced to re-think incentives and agency relationships. Politicians will be forced to invent new rhetoric for their platforms when the traditional political posturings will become moot. Schools will be forced to contend with a deschooled society (in the sense of Ivan Illich's ""Deschooling Society"").
Society as a whole must then grapple with the deeper social, economic, and psychological ramifications of permanent net job losses caused by AI. In consolation, the loss of jobs without (optimistically) loss of lifestyle should give us the time and freedom to think about these issues. Perhaps we can even debate the nature of intelligence as it applies to artificial intelligence.
If all this pans out as I think it will and should, this is quite a good impact of artificial intelligence on natural intelligence; we have nothing to fear but to be prepared for the transition itself!Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website. Kiran GarimellaKiran Garimella is a Chief Scientist & Chief Technology Officer at KoreConX, leading the development of an AI-based blockchain platform for the global... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",2018-08-08T11:04:49-04:00,Job Loss From AI?

  Regardless of whether one adopts a pessimistic or optimistic view of artificial intelligence, policy will shape how it affects society. This column looks at both the policies that will influence the diffusion of AI and policies that will address its consequences. One of the most significant long-run policy issues relates to the potential for artificial intelligence to increase inequality.

Not that long ago artificial intelligence (AI), robots and machine learning (ML) were thought to be things only found in science fiction films. Today, this type of technology is taking center stage in workplaces across the globe. Industries, including manufacturing, retail, agriculture, and customer service have already had AI replace some job positions that left workers scrambling to find new career options.
This AI revolution is not expected to slow down anytime soon. In fact, experts anticipate that as many as 800 million jobsOpens a new window  could be replaced with AI technology by the year 2030. Initially, AI technology and automation in the workplace seemed to only affect pink and blue-collar workers. As this technology advances and becomes more powerful, professional, white-collar workers, including accountants, are starting to worry about what the future holds for their career and if AI will make their job obsolete.
AI in Accounting
In basic terms, AI technologyOpens a new window  is intelligent machines that are able to complete repetitive, mundane tasks at a fraction of the time it takes humans and with greater accuracy. The emergence of Machine Learning Opens a new window now allows AI platforms to observe, analyze and self-learn data and processes to improve its performance and accuracy over time.
AI technology is already able to handle many accounting functions, such as tax preparation, payroll, and audits. Many of the leading accounting software providers, including Xero, Intuit and Sage have incorporated AI technology into their software to handle basic accounting tasks, such as bank reconciliations, invoice categorization, risk assessment, and audit processes, like expense submissions and invoice payments.
Many of these standard tasks are extremely time-consuming, which has many accountants across the country worried about how the emerging AI technology will affect their billable hours. An even bigger concern is that AI technologies will replace the need for companies to work with accountants at all.
AI Will Transform not Replace Accountants
While there is no doubt that AI technology is capable of handling many standard accounting tasks faster and more efficiently or that these capabilities will only increase over time, it doesn’t mean the end for accountants. There always will be a need for that human element – human intelligence – at the other end of AI technology. In fact, according to leading research firm, GartnerOpens a new window , AI is set to create more jobs than it will replace, leaving workers, including accountants with options.
Accountants don’t have to worry about their job being replaced by AI any time in the near future. Companies will always need accountants that can analyze and interpret AI data, as well as provide consulting services. Rather than replacing the role of an accountant, AI technology will transform the duties an accountant performs.
With AI technology and machine learning handling many of the mundane, repetitive tasks, accountants will have more time to focus on other aspects of the job, such as consulting and data analysis. This is good news for many accountants. Rather than spending hours completing menial tasks, accountants of the future will be able to use and analyze AI data to provide their clients with sound business solutions.
In many ways, AI will help accountants improve their services. AI technology will improve data entry accuracy and lower the liability risk for accountants. In addition, emerging technology is more efficient at fraud detection, adding an extra layer of protection for accountants and their clients. It also provides real-time data, which allows accountants to provide real-time solutions. Even more impressive is the ability of machine learning to analyze large amounts of data instantly, evaluate past successes and failures in an effort to accurately predict future outcomes.
Preparing for the Future
There is no way to escape the use of AI technology, at least not if you hope to remain competitive in the upcoming years. The speed, efficiency and accuracy of AI technology just cannot be beat. The only thing accountants can do is to embrace this new technology and learn how to maximize its use. The better equipped you are to help your clients integrate and utilize AI technology in their accounting processes the more valuable you will be.
Many universities today are already incorporating IT and database management courses into their accounting program. This means that graduating students are coming into the workforce with the skills they need for future accounting work. Accountants already in the workforce must find ways to acquire these skills in order to remain relevant to their employers and/or their clients.
Accountants can obtain the IT skills they need by attending seminars, using self-learning online programs or attending college-level courses. It is equally important for accountants to stay up-to-date on the latest accounting trends, emerging technologies and industry news. This will allows accountants to not only keep their jobs but to also provide more efficient services to their clients.
Rather than worry about AI taking over their jobs, accountants should embrace this technology as a powerful solution to enhance customer services. Finally, accountants will be able to use all their training and experience to provide customer will real and effective business solutions, whether it’s in reference to tax consulting, real estate deals, mergers, growth options, or any other business practice.
Technology is advancing at record rates so now is the time to obtain the IT and database management skills you need to advance into the future. With the right skills and training, accountants are guaranteed a lucrative career that will last well into the future.

MIT researchers are employing novel machine-learning techniques to improve the quality of life for patients by reducing toxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy dosing for glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer.Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that appears in the brain or spinal cord, and prognosis for adults is no more than five years. Patients must endure a combination of radiation therapy and multiple drugs taken every month. Medical professionals generally administer maximum safe drug doses to shrink the tumor as much as possible. But these strong pharmaceuticals still cause debilitating side effects in patients.In a paper being presented next week at the 2018 Machine Learning for Healthcare conference at Stanford University, MIT Media Lab researchers detail a model that could make dosing regimens less toxic but still effective. Powered by a “self-learning” machine-learning technique, the model looks at treatment regimens currently in use, and iteratively adjusts the doses. Eventually, it finds an optimal treatment plan, with the lowest possible potency and frequency of doses that should still reduce tumor sizes to a degree comparable to that of traditional regimens.In simulated trials of 50 patients, the machine-learning model designed treatment cycles that reduced the potency to a quarter or half of nearly all the doses while maintaining the same tumor-shrinking potential. Many times, it skipped doses altogether, scheduling administrations only twice a year instead of monthly.“We kept the goal, where we have to help patients by reducing tumor sizes but, at the same time, we want to make sure the quality of life — the dosing toxicity — doesn’t lead to overwhelming sickness and harmful side effects,” says Pratik Shah, a principal investigator at the Media Lab who supervised this research.The paper’s first author is Media Lab researcher Gregory Yauney.

Rewarding good choicesThe researchers’ model uses a technique called reinforced learning (RL), a method inspired by behavioral psychology, in which a model learns to favor certain behavior that leads to a desired outcome.The technique comprises artificially intelligent “agents” that complete “actions” in an unpredictable, complex environment to reach a desired “outcome.” Whenever it completes an action, the agent receives a “reward” or “penalty,” depending on whether the action works toward the outcome. Then, the agent adjusts its actions accordingly to achieve that outcome.Rewards and penalties are basically positive and negative numbers, say +1 or -1. Their values vary by the action taken, calculated by probability of succeeding or failing at the outcome, among other factors. The agent is essentially trying to numerically optimize all actions, based on reward and penalty values, to get to a maximum outcome score for a given task.The approach was used to train the computer program DeepMind that in 2016 made headlines for beating one of the world’s best human players in the game “Go.” It’s also used to train driverless cars in maneuvers, such as merging into traffic or parking, where the vehicle will practice over and over, adjusting its course, until it gets it right.The researchers adapted an RL model for glioblastoma treatments that use a combination of the drugs temozolomide (TMZ) and procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PVC), administered over weeks or months.The model’s agent combs through traditionally administered regimens. These regimens are based on protocols that have been used clinically for decades and are based on animal testing and various clinical trials. Oncologists use these established protocols to predict how much doses to give patients based on weight.As the model explores the regimen, at each planned dosing interval — say, once a month — it decides on one of several actions. It can, first, either initiate or withhold a dose. If it does administer, it then decides if the entire dose, or only a portion, is necessary. At each action, it pings another clinical model — often used to predict a tumor’s change in size in response to treatments — to see if the action shrinks the mean tumor diameter. If it does, the model receives a reward.However, the researchers also had to make sure the model doesn’t just dish out a maximum number and potency of doses. Whenever the model chooses to administer all full doses, therefore, it gets penalized, so instead chooses fewer, smaller doses. “If all we want to do is reduce the mean tumor diameter, and let it take whatever actions it wants, it will administer drugs irresponsibly,” Shah says. “Instead, we said, ‘We need to reduce the harmful actions it takes to get to that outcome.’”This represents an “unorthodox RL model, described in the paper for the first time,” Shah says, that weighs potential negative consequences of actions (doses) against an outcome (tumor reduction). Traditional RL models work toward a single outcome, such as winning a game, and take any and all actions that maximize that outcome. On the other hand, the researchers’ model, at each action, has flexibility to find a dose that doesn’t necessarily solely maximize tumor reduction, but that strikes a perfect balance between maximum tumor reduction and low toxicity. This technique, he adds, has various medical and clinical trial applications, where actions for treating patients must be regulated to prevent harmful side effects.Optimal regimensThe researchers trained the model on 50 simulated patients, randomly selected from a large database of glioblastoma patients who had previously undergone traditional treatments. For each patient, the model conducted about 20,000 trial-and-error test runs. Once training was complete, the model learned parameters for optimal regimens. When given new patients, the model used those parameters to formulate new regimens based on various constraints the researchers provided.The researchers then tested the model on 50 new simulated patients and compared the results to those of a conventional regimen using both TMZ and PVC. When given no dosage penalty, the model designed nearly identical regimens to human experts. Given small and large dosing penalties, however, it substantially cut the doses’ frequency and potency, while reducing tumor sizes.The researchers also designed the model to treat each patient individually, as well as in a single cohort, and achieved similar results (medical data for each patient was available to the researchers). Traditionally, a same dosing regimen is applied to groups of patients, but differences in tumor size, medical histories, genetic profiles, and biomarkers can all change how a patient is treated. These variables are not considered during traditional clinical trial designs and other treatments, often leading to poor responses to therapy in large populations, Shah says.“We said [to the model], ‘Do you have to administer the same dose for all the patients? And it said, ‘No. I can give a quarter dose to this person, half to this person, and maybe we skip a dose for this person.’ That was the most exciting part of this work, where we are able to generate precision medicine-based treatments by conducting one-person trials using unorthodox machine-learning architectures,” Shah says.
The model offers a major improvement over the conventional “eye-balling” method of administering doses, observing how patients respond, and adjusting accordingly, says Nicholas J. Schork, a professor and director of human biology at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and an expert in clinical trial design. “[Humans don’t] have the in-depth perception that a machine looking at tons of data has, so the human process is slow, tedious, and inexact,” he says. “Here, you’re just letting a computer look for patterns in the data, which would take forever for a human to sift through, and use those patterns to find optimal doses.”Schork adds that this work may particularly interest the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is now seeking ways to leverage data and artificial intelligence to develop health technologies. Regulations still need be established, he says, “but I don’t doubt, in a short amount of time, the FDA will figure out how to vet these [technologies] appropriately, so they can be used in everyday clinical programs.”

Data scientists, artificial intelligence experts and machine learning developers are in hot demand right now — so much, that these are some of the hardest jobs to fill.
According to this year’s best jobs report from Glassdoor, data scientist was the best job in the U.S. It was also the top job in 2017, and in 2016, up from ninth place in 2015. The number of job openings on the site rose from 3,449 in 2015 to 4,524 this year. And IBM predicts that the number of openings for U.S. data scientists and similar advanced analytical roles will reach 61,799 by 2020, with a 93 percent predicted growth rate in data science skills, followed by machine learning with 56 percent predicted growth.

And as demand increases, the number of candidates available to fill those roles is showing signs of not being able to catch up. According to Bloomberg, job postings for data scientists on Indeed.com increased by 75 percent between January 2015 and January 2017 — but job searches only went up by 65 percent.











 
 
 
It’s no wonder that enterprises are having a hard time finding qualified people. According to the 2018 State of the CIO report, 36 percent of respondents say that filling business intelligence and data analytics roles will be difficult, second only to cybersecurity. Artificial intelligence also made the top ten list, with 18 percent of respondents saying they anticipate AI role being hard to fill.

“There’s a significant demand for people with expertise in AI and machine learning,” says Tom Mitchell, professor of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University.
Instead of hiring new employees, some companies are looking to help existing staffers get the advanced education and training they need to work in the areas of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.











 
 
 
The most advanced training, such as the master’s program at Carnegie Mellon, takes between a year and a year and a half to complete, and requires knowledge of statistics, and basic programming skills. But there are also many online programs and courses that people can take, Mitchell says.
Here is a look at how several companies across a wide range of industries are training up current employees for the AI era ahead.
Back to school
Los Angeles County knows what the job market is like right now.











 
 
 
“We are also seeking resources that are hard to find when it comes to AI and business intelligence and automation experts,” says Murtaza Masood, assistant director at the LA County Department of Human Resources. He was previously the CIO of the department, and is leading many of the digital transformation initiatives for the county.

Recruitment efforts include partnerships with all regional academic institutions with relevant programs, and an internship program to create a pipeline of talent.
But the county has also been growing its own AI experts.











 
 
 
“Three years ago we established a center of excellence for AI that allowed us to start gathering existing resources within the county that had some expertise in this area,” he says. Employees interested in the subject can get tuition reimbursement for outside coursework, as well as in-house training.
Employees are particularly interested in algorithm design, he says, but the types of training employees pursue varies depending on the need.
“Business initiatives lead to platform decisions which lead to increased demand for training around those particular elements,” he says. Fortunately, the county has in-house talent to draw on. “Historically speaking, we’ve been early adopters of statistical analysis packages.”











 
 
 
For example, the county has recently been investing in monitoring and analysis tools to spot a variety of personnel issues, as well as potential cybersecurity problems. With 111,000 employees — LA County is the largest local government organization in the country — there’s a lot of data that can be analyzed to spot potential problems. But Masood wants to see machine learning and artificial intelligence used for more than spotting problems.
“Where I’m really excited, both as an HR professional and a technologist, is the ability to get training resources to employees to preempt all of that. The ability to serve up timely and bite-size information that enables an employee to improve their thought processes or behavior or knowledge, that is where I think the real power is and that is where the future might be,” he says.
Bringing training in-house
Capgemini is also in the middle of a big push right now to hire people with AI expertise. The consulting firm doesn’t write software, but it works with clients to configure and integrate existing software, and AI is now a major area of focus.











 
 
 
In addition to hiring experts, and sponsoring existing employees to get additional training, the company also has a digital acceleration center to help employees learn about new AI tech.
“We have a sandbox environment and we’ll trial the software in a laboratory,” says Tom Ivory, Capgemini’s head of strategic innovation. “We’re experimenting with dozens of AI technologies right now, and not every single one of them will be greenlit to move forward.”
At that point, Capgemini will train executives and delivery managers and other people on the team that works with customers on how to use those tools, he says.











 
 
 
The company also uses AI in its own operations. For example, Capgemini uses technology from automation vendor UiPath, and IBM Watson, to help process resumes of potential hires.
“We typically used keyword searches,” he says. “By using AI, there are more nuances that can increase the success rate of that individual being staffed on a project.”
At first, Capgemini used vendor-provided training, but soon there was a critical mass of internal experts.











 
 
 
“We had a baseline of management who were trained, as well as people who would actually have their hands on the keyboard, strategists, and folks who could understand how this technology would affect business processes,” he says. At that point, Capgemini brought the training in-house, using purchased training models from the vendor as the base.
Three years ago, the number of people at the company who trained in this technology was in the dozens — now, there are thousands, he says.
Embracing AI companywide
For tech companies that have an AI component to their products or services, employee training is even more critical.











 
 
 
Salesforce, for example, has been adding intelligence to its online customer relationship management platform. That means that in-house employees have to know their way around the technology. There’s an online training platform, part of the same Salesforce Trailhead system that’s available to the public.
“We have our own Trail, in which we have all this learning material that’s just freely available, that allows people to learn how to consume the AI capability that Salesforce provides,” says Marco Casalaina, vice president of product management of Salesforce Einstein at Salesforce.com. “It cuts across the company — we want everyone to be able to add intelligence, and to use intelligence, in applications in Salesforce.”
For example, an IT development team working on a room scheduling application for facilities management added intelligence to their application, to assign rooms to those customers who would benefit from the meetings the most.











 
 
 
“They’re not data scientists,” Casalaina says. “And our training is made for people like that, people who don’t have a data science background but want to make predictions.”
Peer-to-peer mentoring
Cybersecurity firm Stealthbits Technologies is also investing in AI and machine learning skills. Some of that is from outside sources, says Jonathan Sander, the company’s CTO. “But the bulk of it is peer-to-peer.”
The actual training is different for different engineering groups, he says. “For the R&D folks who will get hands on, they are looking for the more comprehensive starter courses followed by the peer-to-peer materials we generate, and finally move into a mentoring system we have for building R&D talent. In that track they cover everything from the basics all the way through to application.”











 
 
 
On the support, consulting, and pre-sales side, the employees need to be able to understand how to use the technology and communicate its value.
“Our customers always benefit from more skilled engineers,” he says, “And the ML training has prepared them to give them good advice in using our ML-powered solutions as well as generally approaching ML as a valuable tool.”
Many companies think that machine learning is too complex or obscure to learn — that’s a mistake, he says.











 
 
 
“Ignore those impressions and get your hands dirty,” he says.
Like Stealthbits, big data firm Insight Engines also see a lot of value in peer-to-peer training.
“We start by incrementally exposing new staff to small areas of our development pipeline, where the changes they make have large-scale impact on our customers,” says Darien Kindlund, vice president of technology at Insight Engines. Then they move on to working on improving workflows, while still being supervised by experienced mentors.
So far about 65 percent of employees — both technical and non-technical — have received this kind of training, with a focus on machine learning, natural language processing, and data science, Kindlund says.











 
 
 
“By providing on-the-job training focused on customer impact in an applied setting, we have found our team absorbs, learns, and builds upon these skills much faster than in an academic setting,” he says.
Cybersecurity vendor Vectra Networks is also focusing on on-the-job, peer-to-peer training.
“Oftentimes, we have experienced mentors paired with new hires on projects to offer suggestions and guide them with machine learning approaches,” says Kevin Ni, the company’s data science team lead. “By training employees here the way we do, we can guide their development focused towards the unique problem space we are in. This means that customers can get results sooner. We also encourage employees to audit major online classes if they are unfamiliar with specific subjects.”
Expecting employees to learn on their own isn’t fast enough, says Joseph Kucic, CSO at Cavirin Systems, a cybersecurity vendor. Until recently, he was with the enterprise AI working group at Verizon.
“On the job, partner-mentor speeds up the ability to transfer knowledge and execute on the business goals,” he says.
If the need for AI talent is extremely urgent, then you can take radical actions, like acquiring talent by buying another company, he says. “But for longer term, the focus needs to be on a partner-mentor approach.”
Training at the pace of change
When training up employees in any emerging technology, keeping up with the rate of innovation is key. That means taking an ongoing approach to fostering new skills.
Invoca, a California-based call intelligence vendor, released its machine learning product, Signal AI, about a year ago. Since machine learning is now a core focus of the company, training is critical.
“We hold educational sessions across departments to educate internal teams about AI foundations, as well as specifically related to our AI solution offering,” says Sean Storlie, the company’s director of product management. There are quarterly AI-related trainings from the company’s data science team. In addition, employees can expense online tutorials, conferences, and onsite training.
“You can’t over-educate on this subject as things are changing so quickly in this industry,” he says.
“We create software that is supposed to also help other companies implement ML and AI,” says Lalith Subramanian, vice president of engineering for security, discovery and analytics at OpenText. “Internally, what we find is that the skills constantly have to be kept up to date.”
The company has a tuition reimbursement program for employees and also has been running training programs for the past three or four years, he says. “For instance, if we have a topic like commutative neural networks to be trained on, we bring in a training company and have groups of employees get the training,” he says.
But will they leave?
Some companies are reluctant to invest in AI-related training because they fear that the employees will immediately walk out the door, translating their new skills into big paydays elsewhere.
“In the tech industry, especially in Silicon Valley, a certain group of opportunists will get the latest training to look good in interviews,” says OpenText’s Subramanian. “But it’s not any more than if we didn’t have the training.”
In fact, in his experience, having the training available helps with retention, he says.
Another cybersecurity company offering extensive AI-related training to employees is Demisto.
“We are not worried about retention,” says company co-founder Rishi Bhargava. “As a company, we firmly believe that better trained employees are happier employees and do their jobs better. Moreover, encouraging upskilling is just one facet of our overall company culture. If a company helps an employee with training and the employee then leaves, the employee must not have been very satisfied with the job in the first place.”
Ongoing training also helps with retention at Aetna, the country’s third-largest health insurance company.
“It teaches them skills that are growing in marketability, and that’s a good thing for a professional,” says Jim Routh, the company’s CSO.
Aetna has a program to teach data science fundamentals to every one of the company’s security professionals, he says. By sticking with Aetna, employees not only continue to get this training, but they can also use the skills they learn on leading-edge applications, which means state-of-the art, unconventional security controls, he adds.
“We partner with a data science team of several hundred data scientists on our health side and our business side,” Routh says. “Together, we’re developing a core curriculum using a combination of commercially-available online training, and some training that we have developed in-house.”
So far, 200 security professionals have gone through the mandatory foundations class. “We’ve been teaching the course for two years now,” he says. “At first it was optional, but it quickly became the most popular course we teach.”

Artificial Intelligence(AI) Systems And Their Influence On Social Media

By Asif Razzaq -   August 8, 2018 



Reddit7VoteFlipShareTweet7 SharesSocial media accounts are an extremely popular method for staying connected and for using emerging technology to grow audiences. Almost 2.5 billion users worldwide will be present on at least one type of social media channel by the end of 2018. 
It’s no wonder that marketing companies as a whole are shifting their focus toward social media and even using AI systems to give themselves an advantage. As the number of tools available starts to rapidly increase it could be possible for marketers to have an easier and more targeted journey of discovering their users.

Facebook and AI:
Facebook with one of the first social networks to start focusing in on AI in the year 2013 when they started to work with New York University. AI systems are present all over Facebook, and many deep learning algorithms are working within keyword studies, shared likes and more. The unfortunate side of Facebook is that it got into hot water from the research that he did with Cambridge analytica. With this specific idea, AI was working to solve through a series of problems over the network. The only issue with that is the AI systems and data that were presented were delivered without the consent of any user. Facebook and the network itself was stopped short in its efforts. 
AI and Pinterest:
With so many people on Pinterest often ending up making purchases of the projects that they see online, the app began to use AI learning to recommend products based off of their likes. The system itself had a stylistic nature that ensured that the suggestions presented could be streamlined for users online and designed in such a way that Pinterest could continually present new ideas and make suggestions for users.

This system did not fall under the same type of scandal that was present on networks like Facebook. The Pinterest recommendations are widely welcomed in many cases for the streamlined and stylistic nature of the social network. The way that searching habits have been changed have also made for a social network that is more intelligent because of its suggestions. 
Twitter and AI:
Twitter also has an advanced AI built into its current configuration. The AI on Twitter is directly responsible for establishing a category for every single tweet. The idea of the category system is to make sure that the content people care about most is what’s appearing in their timeline. 
Twitter is also using a series of neural networks to automatically cropped photos and produce a more consistent aesthetic for the fee. Machine learning was done using eye tracking records to make sure that photographs can be presented in their most appealing form to each user. 
As AI systems continue to integrate their way into social media in the future, brands will be able to generate a better experience for their customers and improve ROI based off of the systems. As there is a large pool of individuals across social media, having AI systems that can cover many bases can help to make sure that ongoing monitoring can occur.

But Can It Do Comedy?Share full articleRead in appPiotr Mirowski in August with a toy robot he uses in his improv act, which combines artificial intelligence and human performers.Credit...Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesBy Alex MarshallAug. 8, 2018LONDON — One recent evening at a London pub, Piotr Mirowski, 39, stood in front of several dozen comedy fans to prove that an artificially intelligent computer program could perform improvised comedy.In one hand, he held a bug-eyed toy robot, its lines voiced by the program. With the other, he pretended to grip a steering wheel. The robot was playing Mr. Mirowski’s partner; they were taking a scenic drive together.ImageCredit...Natalya Micic“I am not trying to be angry,” the robot said, suddenly breaking the mood.“I don’t want you to be angry — this is our quality time,” Mr. Mirowski replied.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m sure that you will find love,” the robot said after an awkward pause, drawing a firm end to the couple’s relationship, and prompting laughter from the audience. “I’m so tired,” it added. Mr. Mirowski made a final attempt to save things, but the robot would not listen. “You are not me. You’re my friend,” it said, emotionless.For someone who had just been dumped in front of a paying audience, Mr. Mirowski looked happy. Why? Because the A.I. he created had worked, and stuck to the topic at hand — a rare event, he said later in an interview.For the past few years, A.I. has been generating attention — and alarm — in many areas of arts and culture. Start-ups and tech giants are developing A. I. systems that can write music, for example, while others are using the technology to generate art. Some fear these projects will put musicians and artists out of work.Using computers to make comedy has received less attention, but it has a surprisingly long history. In the early 1990s, researchers at the University of Edinburgh wrote a program that could produce question-based puns such as “What do you call a good-looking taxi? A handsome cab.” (It “succeeds in generating pieces of text that are recognizably jokes, but some of them are not very good jokes,” the researchers said in a paper on the project.)Today, around a dozen people in Europe and North America are working on similar projects, mainly in their spare time from A.I.-related jobs, Mr. Mirowski said. (He is a senior research scientist working on artificial intelligence at Google DeepMind, but said his work there was not related to comedy.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Mirowski was born in Poland, but spent most of his childhood in France, playing role-playing and video games, he said. He fell in love with improv at college, both the challenge and playfulness of it, and kept doing it after he graduated and started working in A.I.He long thought of combining his passions, but said he had only realized it was possible in 2014, partly because of systems that could quickly analyze large volumes of text, spot patterns and then produce sentences in response. Mr. Mirowski decided to apply that to improv skits.The system he built was remarkably simple. A.L.Ex (which stands for Artificial Language Experiment) has been fed the subtitles from more than 100,000 films, from action movies like “Deep Impact” to the pornographic film “Deep Throat.” When someone talks to it, the system uses a tool called a neural network, vaguely modeled on the brain, to analyze similar exchanges in its database and compose its own response.Mr. Mirowski made his stage debut with A.L.Ex in July 2016. It did not go to plan. “There was a moment where it didn’t say anything as the speech recognition crashed,” Mr. Mirowski said, “so I had to say, ‘I see you want to stay silent.’ That is something you can only really do once.”ImageKory Mathewson, left, in Canada, and Piotr Mirowski in London. They have worked together on A.L.Ex, Mr. Mirowski’s A.I. improv performer, helping it get better at staying on topic.Credit...Daniel Wood for The New York Times; Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesAround that time, Mr. Mirowski met Kory Mathewson, an A.I. researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada who had developed a comedy chatbot he was trying to use in live improv, and the two began collaborating. They have made numerous improvements to A.L.Ex, including tweaks to its code to make it better at sticking to a topic. (If a sketch is set on a pirate ship, you don’t want it to suddenly talk about space.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.L.Ex is now at the point where the pair are happy for other improvisers to work with it. In recent shows in London, Mr. Mirowski also used the system to feed a performer lines through a headset.Despite all the improvements, Mr. Mirowski said working with an A.I. was still like having a “completely drunk comedian” on stage, who was only “accidentally funny,” by saying things that were totally inappropriate, overly emotional or plain odd.“Robots are in a way the antithesis of theater and comedy,” he said. “Theatre is about the human expression on stage, and it’s about the communication and empathy between the actors and the audience. Robots do not have the sensors to perceive any of that.”What A.I. is good at, Mr. Mirowski said, is saying unusual things that challenge the human improviser to work harder, which can increase satisfaction when they manage to make a scene work. “Improv is like intellectual and mental tightrope walking,” he said. “The robot is kind of making the tightrope longer.”In a Skype interview, Mr. Mathewson agreed that the joy of working with an A.I. system came when you managed to do a show that didn’t just rely on the randomness of the responses for humor, but which kept a story going.His early shows were failures in that respect, he said. In one, he swore in exasperation, and the machine replied, “Swearing is often cathartic.” Now he has improvised with it publicly more than 50 times. When shows are a success, they are more celebrations of human creativity than anything to do with A.I., he added.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDuring the show on Wednesday, Mr. Mirowski performed several different scenes using the A.I. None were anywhere near as successful as the one involving the couple going for a drive. The climax of the show involved four members of Mr. Mirowski’s improv troupe, Improbotics Ltd., performing a scene involving a fictional president, his chief of staff and an office cleaner.The audience had to guess which actor was controlled by the A.I. The answer became clear soon after the cleaner took to the stage. “I’m a communist!” she said, completely out of the blue. Later, she performed a U-turn. “I’m not a communist!” she said. Then, out of nowhere she asked another member of the troupe, “Look, do you wanna buy a knife?”Mr. Mirowski watched behind several laptops from the side of the stage. He was smiling. His A.I. was making no sense. But it was getting laughs.A version of this article appears in print on Aug. 11, 2018, Section C, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Hey, That Robot Seems to Think It’s a Comedian.

The company is turning to tech to build a stronger business, drive efficiencies in its supply chain and operations, and give consumers what they want thanks to the insights provided from big data and artificial intelligence about fashion trends and their customers’ preferences. Only time will tell if their investment is enough to catapult them out of their sales slump and if their bet on AI and big data will pay off. Here are a few ways H&M is using tech to their business advantage.

Data insights help avoid bad product cycles
About 20 years ago, fast-fashion retailers became disruptors that built strong businesses by trading in quality for better prices and fresh products. However, in order to succeed, fast-fashion retailers such as H&M need to predict what the market wants to avoid a bad product cycle and the reality of discounting inventory, even more, to move it out. Since the price points are already incredibly low for fast-fashion retailers, it's tough to recover from bad purchase decisions ant to move unwanted inventory.   The stakes are high for fast-fashion retailers and the insights provided by data can help build a more flexible and faster supply chain, facilitate trend detection, manage inventory and set prices.





Inventory for individual stores
PROMOTED
Previously, you could walk into any H&M store whether it was located in Sweden, the United Kingdom or the United States and it would carry very similar merchandise. Unfortunately, the retailer was continually faced with needing to cut prices to clear out unsold inventory in its 4,288 stores around the world. In an effort to better stock individual stores with merchandise local clientele desires, H&M is using big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze returns, receipts and loyalty card data to tailor the merchandise for each store. This is known as localization and can be trickier to execute for a global chain such as H&M that typically can leverage economies of scale with its global network of suppliers.

Automated warehouses
In order to get that customized inventory to each store and to respond to consumers’ demands for a hassle-free shopping experience, H&M invested in automated warehouses that will ultimately result in next-day delivery for 90% of the European market when they are completed. Consumers have come to expect anytime, anywhere delivery, plus free shipping and returns—the latter is now being offered to H&M’s loyalty customers. The warehouses and loyalty programs are fueled by algorithms and data, and the company is rolling out RFID tech to its stores to improve efficiencies in its supply chain.
Inspiring and friction-free customer experience
H&M is already offering personalized recommendations for online shoppers, but it will soon bring that capability to its brick-and-mortar stores through RFID technology. When they are in the store, customers can explore suggestions for merchandise selected for them by algorithms. They are working on better integration between the online and offline shopping experience. For example, through a Find a Store feature, customers can find out if an item they discovered online is available at a physical store nearby. Besides, through Scan and Buy, customers can scan an in-store label to find out whether that item is available at another location or online.

Customized fashion
Machines have already composed music, and now through a partnership with Google and H&M’s digital fashion house Ivyrevel, we have Coded Couture. With a promise to “create one-of-a-kind designs based on how you live your life” the Android application monitors your activity and lifestyle and then custom designs and produces a dress—the Data Dress. Depending on how an individual spends the day, the app translates where you eat, the typical weather in the area and how active you are to make decisions regarding color, materials and added details for a bespoke look.
Whether technology will get H&M the results it needs to once again be profitable isn't clear, but the company’s investment in big data and artificial intelligence is certainly a step in the right direction. Data and AI algorithms can make the company’s merchandising decisions more accurate while streamlining supply chains and operations and improving the customer experience.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",2019-05-13T05:28:29-04:00,How Fashion Retailer H&M Is Betting On Artificial Intelligence And Big Data To Regain Profitability,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stark message coincides with the publication of Digital Jersey’s half-year review, which charts progress made in 2018 against a series of key objectives.

Mr Moretta says that, while there’s been movement on a range of fronts, work to equip the island’s workforce with the right skills in the face of the growth of artificial intelligence and its impact on swathes of jobs is vital.

He said: “I think some people are afraid of AI. They think of robots replacing humans, but it’s not like that. I think of it as automated intelligence, rather than artificial intelligence. This is about software doing processes that workers are currently employed to do.

“A harsh reality facing Jersey right now is the island’s brain drain. As a small island community without a university, there's a constant flow of talented people leaving to go to university and often not coming back. We need more degree education and other upskilling options on-island. It’s why Digital Jersey is working tirelessly to create a year-round calendar of events focused on equipping people with those skills.”

The Digital Jersey Hub has, so far this year, run a series of conferences, classes and other events to offer options that suit people whether in work, or out of a job and looking to re-skill. More than 3,000 people have attended in the first half of the year.

“We’ve had a paint-sprayer and somebody working in a fish and chip shop sign up,” added Mr Moretta. ‘”he result is they come out with a skillset that allows them a route into Jersey’s tech sector. They, in turn, are earning more, and that means more tax for government. It’s a win win.’”

Also revealed in the half-year review, the number of businesses who’ve become members of Digital Jersey has broken through the 100 barrier for the first time.

There were 104 business members as of the end of June 2018, of which 20 had joined in the first half of the year. That’s in addition to the 340 individual members, of whom 30 signed up since the start of the year.

Among other highlights, Digital Jersey has:

Supported four firms in relocating to Jersey as part of a campaign to promote the island as the go-to choice for digital entrepreneurs;

Worked with JT to facilitate a new low power wide area network to help link connected devices to the internet;

Assisted local start-up Soulgenic in creating a global online wellness platform, as part of a new business which has created 40 new jobs;

Signed a memorandum of understanding with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which resulted in more than 600 items of coverage across news, trade press and social media in its first 10 days; and

Helped Drone technology experts to forecast Jersey’s weather <strong>- </strong>data from an innovative new drone-led technology being tested in Jersey could deliver benefits for all islanders, as well as providing a rich data source for Internet of Things companies. In the future we hope this could be a valuable addition to our ambition to be the first whole-country sandbox testing environment.",,"['Business', 'Digital &amp; Technology', 'Jersey']","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://channeleye.media/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Digital-Jersey-Hub-scaled.jpg', 'width': 2560, 'height': 1920}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://channeleye.media/digital-jersey-ceo-says-skilled-workforce-a-priority/'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': '', 'url': 'https://channeleye.media', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ''}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/ChannelEye.Media', 'https://twitter.com/ChannelEyeMedia', 'https://www.instagram.com/ChannelEye.Media', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/ChannelEye']}",https://channeleye.media/digital-jersey-ceo-says-skilled-workforce-a-priority/,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Channel Eye Media', 'url': 'https://channeleye.media/author/channeleyedev/', 'sameAs': ['https://channeleye.media']}",http://schema.org,Business,,"

								How can the government get the most out of its reskilling efforts?							

								Workforce reskilling strategies already reside within the private sector — can the government adopt and scale them for 2 million federal employees?

In navigating the growing shortage of IT and cybersecurity talent available in both the public and private sectors, the Trump administration has made clear its plan to fill a portion of the void by teaching current federal employees new skills.
As part of the President’s Management Agenda, the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense and other agencies have been tasked with developing a system to both identify employees with the aptitude for IT and cybersecurity jobs, and adopting automation technology that can assist the reskilling efforts.
Reskilling strategies and products that facilitate them already reside within the private sector. The more critical question is if they can be scaled to a workforce of more than 2 million civil servants focused on a diverse set of missions?
FedScoop spoke to a trio of experts who believe it’s possible and gave guidance for how they think the federal government can be successful in reskilling.

Cross-training
One popular strategy involves not a wholesale shift of employees to a new skill set but instead fostering greater communications and thought-sharing between groups with adjoining missions. It’s often called cross-training.
Joel Jacobs, MITRE CIO and chief security officer, said his company has been deploying cross-training for decades out of an organic need to capitalize on the proficiency of its federally funded research and development centers and the cybersecurity staff tasked with protecting them.
“There was a natural demand that flows between those two,” he said. “So in our own cyberdefense, going back to the 1980s, we started borrowing people from those who have information security backgrounds who work for our sponsors for our own defenses. It turns into a virtuous cycle, and the additional skills of those doing research could gain operational experience. Those doing our own operations could gain access to new ideas and capabilities that were part of direct work.”
To leverage the cross-training goals, Jacobs said MITRE deploys mechanisms like communities-of-interest around certain topics, technical exchange meetings and an intranet system that fosters communications between the operations and research sets to share ideas and new developments.

It fosters not only the collaboration of ideas but also provides both camps with new experience to augment their skills.
The strategy sounds somewhat similar to the DevSecOps philosophy pervading the IT acquisition space, in which teams of IT engineers, operations personnel, security specialists and often even procurement professionals collaborate to design the systems that will serve their enterprise.
Jacobs said he didn’t know if the cross-training strategy could scale up governmentwide because of the diffuse mission goals of federal agencies, but he said the strategy could be effective in stretching resources if it’s applied to adjoining components.
“Part of it is making sure they are investing training in ways that are effective at identifying talent, expanding its application and looking for opportunities to cross-train from related topics,” he said. “I think they have to be looking for adjacencies in talent, not strictly or narrowly prescribed versions of cyber engineers or exclusively-trained from a cyber curriculum.”
Automation cheat sheets

Another avenue the administration will likely pursue is to lean on new technologies to cut down the learning curve instead of having employees learn a new skill set from scratch.
Grant Wernick is looking to deploy such a technology in government right now. Wernick is the CEO and co-founder of Insight Engines, which leverages automation and artificial intelligence to crunch complex data through natural language queries.
As a result, employees new to IT and cyber roles don’t have to have the colloquial skills of a technical expert to access data fast, allowing them to spend more time on investigative processes.
“Now you can take people who are high school graduates or English majors, and if they want a career in cybersecurity, they can do it,” Wernick said. “We actually have stories in the federal government where midlevel analysts — the people who usually just stare at alerts — are actually finding stuff they would never have found because they are curious, they use our product and start digging in and looking around.”
OMB is currently examining areas where it can pilot automation as part of its reskilling efforts. And while Wernick said interest is growing in the public sector, the all-too-familiar hurdles of acquisition bureaucracy, agency culture and technology infrastructure have made widespread adoption of his product a challenge.

“I would say it’s growing in pockets,” he said. “Business-as-usual has been a process that has involved many steps sometimes, and we’re circumventing tons of steps. So that change makes it so new people coming in can really be part of it. But sometimes, it’s like, ‘Well, that’s not the way we did it before.’ So getting people who have been there a long time to refresh their view on things is something that we’ve been spending a lot of time on too.”
Workforce planning
One of the best efforts for reshaping the workforce is outlining the vision of the enterprise.
OPM has discussed implementing direct-hire authority and compensation restructuring to entice more IT and cybersecurity talent to the federal government. However, Margot Conrad, director for federal workforce programs at the Partnership for Public Service, said agencies should analyze the skillsets they will need in the future and balance them against new technology capabilities.
“I think agencies need to be able to forecast for the future to actually be able to do the hiring that they need from the outside or reskill on the inside. As a starting point, I think that is a huge area that we emphasize,” she said. “Thinking about what are some of these new emerging technologies, what does that mean for the workforce itself and what the future needs are going to be and then trying to put together comprehensive strategies to address that.”

That could include a mix of legacy and reskilled employees but also contractors who may have knowledge bases in new solutions.
“I think you need a holistic approach here to workforce planning and succession management,” she said. “That would be critical to the success of any effort.”

My answer is twofold: First, it’s important to understand the developments in AI and technology.  Learn about the advancements being made and understand what AI can do. And second, focus on building the skills in areas robots can’t do well.

Jobs AI can do better than humans
While AI is making exponential advances year after year, the popular media often like to exaggerate what it is capable of for the sake of eye-catching headlines and anxiety-inducing news soundbites.
PROMOTED
The truth is, while technology is making great strides in simplifying and automating some work, the truth is that many of these tasks are actually much simpler and fewer than you might think.
Machine learning, for example, is good at taking one type of input, call it Input A, and producing a simple response, Output B. Think of a program that is taught to recognize whether or not there is a cat in a photo. We input a series of photos, A, and the program tells us if the images contain cats, B.

(If you have Photos on your Mac, you can see this in action for yourself. Open the program and search your own photo collection for cat or dog or even something like cake or tea. Most of the results will be accurate, and some, often amusingly, won’t.)





While this has the potential to simplify and automate many different types of work, it also has two main drawbacks. First, the program requires massive amounts of learning data to begin to produce Output B reliably. So, in our example, you would have to provide the program with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of examples of photographs and tell the program whether or not they have cats in them so that it can learn what a cat looks like in many different contexts.

Stanford professor Andrew Ng, writing for the Harvard Business Review, has a good rule of thumb for determining which types of jobs are ripe for automation: “If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future,” he writes.
So, while there is great potential here to automate the sorts of tasks that require this Input A to Output B kind of model — including scanning security video for suspicious behavior, alerting drivers to pedestrians in the road, tagging hateful or abusive comments online, and so on — using AI to automate these tasks also requires a great deal of investment and work upfront.
As these technologies develop and become more universal, we probably will see humans losing jobs to computers (though not Star Wars-style sentient robots) in the near future. Jobs currently held by humans that require this same sort of Input A to Output B scenario are likely to be outsourced to computers, including jobs like receptionists, telemarketers, bookkeeping clerks, proofreaders, delivery couriers, and even retail salespeople.
Jobs AI can’t do better than humans
Lucky for us mere humans, there are a significant number of jobs that require more than a simple Input A to Output B calculation.
Many jobs require additional and very human qualities like communication, empathy, creativity, strategic thinking, questioning, and dreaming. Collectively, we often refer to these qualities as “soft skills,” but don’t let the name fool you; these soft skills are going to be hard currency in the job market as AI and technology take over some of the jobs that can be performed without people.
For example:

Empathy and communication: While AI is being used in medical applications to do things like more accurately detect diseases on a scan, I certainly wouldn't want to get a robocall to break the news that I have cancer. Even though we are making strides towards affective computing, we are a long way away from any technology that can genuinely recognize human emotions and respond to them appropriately, so any job that requires empathy like primary care physicians, caregivers, and therapists are unlikely to be outsourced to technology any time soon.
Critical thinking: I love the old science fiction shows where the human asks the computer what they should do in a terrible situation, and the computer predicts a 99 percent probability of failure — but the human goes and does the thing anyway, and usually succeeds. To me, it's a beautiful metaphor for the fact that, no matter how advanced our AI may be, we still need a human to make judgments and critical decisions, even to ""go with our gut,"" in certain situations. A more contemporary example might be that law firms are employing AI to help identify relevant documents in legal cases, but we still need a human judge to adjudicate a decision. (A computer judge and jury would be an entirely different sci-fi horror story in the making.)
Creativity: Computer programs are good at spitting out a number of options, but they're not necessarily good at providing quality of creative choices. While AI can technically produce food, music, or art, the results can be… Well, less than inspiring. We've probably all seen the funny lists of AI-generated recipes or paint colors or even inspirational quotes. Any job that requires true creativity, such as writers, engineers, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, etc., are probably safe for a long while based on these results.
Strategy: In business especially, we're beginning to see a lot of automation of marketing practices and the like. For example, I can tell a program to send a Tweet for me at a particular time of day, every day. And while these can be huge time savers, the automation tools are just that: tools. They don't provide the overall strategy needed to give the individual tasks meaning and relevance. Any job that requires strategic thinking is likely to be safe, and improving your skills in that area can help robot-proof your job.
Technological management, installation, and upkeep: Until the robots have robots of their own to install and maintain them, humans are going to be needed to design, plan, install, manage and maintain any robotics, technology, or AI systems. This takes us back to my first point about understanding what technology is capable of; the more familiar you are with the technology, the more valuable you will be in helping implement and maintain it.
Physical skills: While robots are being created that can do increasingly tricky things, like make your morning latte, there are still a significant number of physical skills robots haven’t mastered. Additionally, we humans seem to love to watch each other accomplish incredible physical feats (the World Cup is just one example). So if you have any amazing physical skills, from crafting to sport, you’re also safe for now.
Imagination and vision: Finally, one quality I can't quite imagine a robot or AI ever possessing is just that: imagination. The way AI currently works is by taking existing data and making logical inferences based on parameters we give it. Imagination and dreaming are merely not programmable skills. Activists, entrepreneurs, visionaries, thought leaders, authors, speakers and others have a distinct advantage over technology in this field, and that isn't going to change any time soon.

In short, if you're concerned that your job might be one day outsourced to technology, the best thing you can do right now is work on your soft skills. Work on communication, strategic thinking, problem-solving, empathy, and creativity. It might eventually save your career from being taken over by robots, and even earn you a pay rise in the near future as well.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",2019-03-08T05:17:56-05:00,7 Job Skills Of The Future (That AIs And Robots Can't Do Better Than Humans),,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a new survey, a quarter of the workforce think their job won’t be needed in future. Many of us expect the technological revolution to be as disruptive as the industrial revolution. This could bring amazing opportunities and emancipation, but also new forms of exploitation, deeper inequalities, injustices and anger.More than 6m workers fear being replaced by machines – reportRead moreTrades unions and communities can’t just stand by and hope for the best. If we want technological change to benefit everyone rather than widening inequality then we need to start preparing now. It took decades for new legislation, the growth of trade unions and the emergence of the welfare state to tackle some of the injustices of the industrial revolution and start harnessing the benefits for everyone. We cannot afford to wait that long this time. The labour movement needs to lead the way.That is why I am working with Community, the trade union, and the Fabian Society to launch a new commission on workers and technology. The commission will take a “worker’s eye view”, starting in those workplaces across the country that are facing the fastest technological and industrial change. It will be looking for the practical and immediate things that government, employers and unions should be doing to make sure people are empowered by advances in technology and not just exploited, abandoned or let down.Automating routine calculations and data assembly could free up workers to use their emotional intelligence insteadThe commission’s initial survey of workers has found that only 44% think their current job will be improved by technology, while 20% think it will get worse. And if the 23% who believe their roles may not be needed at all are right, that means huge disruption – potentially 6 million people needing to move into new kinds of work. Back in 2015, the Bank of England estimated that even more jobs – up to 15 million – were at risk from robots and automation.Importantly, most people are optimistic about their own ability to adapt. Some 73% of workers say they are confident they can update their skills if automation affects their job. However the support is not in place to help them do that. Just one in 10 workers think the government is taking steps to prepare them for new technologies; just one in four think their employer is taking action; and only one in six employees with a trade union in their workplace say it is helping to prepare them.Whether changes to the world of work come from automation or algorithms, everyone should be able to take advantage of the positive opportunities they bring. For example, technology could support people who want to work more flexibly or help people move on from routine, repetitive tasks into more rewarding work.Automating routine calculations and data assembly tasks could free up workers to use their strategic and emotional intelligence instead. In one pilot scheme in Bremen, Germany, the postal service has teamed up with local government, healthcare and welfare associations to allow mail carriers to call in on elderly citizens as part of their daily rounds, opening up new roles while reducing the burden on care providers.But such schemes rely on workers having the support to move from their old jobs to good-quality new ones – something that too often does not happen. Manual or low-skilled workers find themselves downgraded into increasingly insecure and worse-paid jobs instead.Harnessing technological change for the good also requires vigilance and action to prevent new technology being used to control rather than emancipate the workforce. Amazon has patented designs for electronic wristbands to monitor how quickly staff work – and there have been serious concerns raised about the welfare of workers at its warehouses. Far from relieving them of menial tasks, new technology can be used to force humans to work as if they were machines.We are at a crossroads. Technological change opens up the possibility of a positive transformation of the labour market, but there are significant risks that work itself could change for the worse. Politicians, trade unions and business leaders must act now to ensure technological change leads to plentiful, good-quality jobs for all. And, as the TUC has suggested, they must learn from the partnership approach taken in Germany, where workers, business and civil society have had the chance to shape the direction of policy in response to a government white paper on reimagining work.My commission will be looking for practical action in key areas: how government can ensure new jobs are good jobs; how to enable workers to reskill; and how business and unions can work together to help workers navigate change. We’ll be holding evidence sessions, visiting workplaces and hosting public debates.At this moment of huge turbulence in our politics, it is critical that political leaders provide a practical path through the coming economic disruption.

The AI can spot injuries before it ends up like thisAlexander DemianchukTASS via Getty Images
Football may be unpredictable, but its injuries aren’t. Artificial intelligence can work out when players are likely to get hurt so that coaches can let them rest.
A machine learning algorithm developed by data scientists at the University of Pisa, Italy, and FC Barcelona recently predicted 9 out of 14 injuries sustained by an elite Italian football team during a single season.
The researchers fitted the team’s 26 players with GPS sensors during their training sessions to measure how far and fast they…

Tiptoes Into the WorkplaceShare full articleRead in appHolly Uhl, a manager at State Auto Insurance Companies in Columbus, Ohio, oversees an automation project for back-office tasks that saves an estimated 25,000 hours of human work a year.Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesBy Steve LohrAug. 5, 2018There is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where, how and if people work in the future.But the grand work-changing projects of A.I., like self-driving cars and humanoid robots, are not yet commercial products. A more humble version of the technology, instead, is making its presence felt in a less glamorous place: the back office.New software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service. The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe bots are mainly observing, following simple rules and making yes-or-no decisions, not making higher-level choices that require judgment and experience. “This is the least intelligent form of A.I.,” said Thomas Davenport, a professor of information technology and management at Babson College.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.“This is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,” said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, “robotic process automation.” The programs — often called bots — fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.State Auto Insurance Companies in Columbus, Ohio, started its first automation pilot project two years ago. Today, it has 30 software programs handling back-office tasks, with an estimated savings of 25,000 hours of human work — or the equivalent of about a dozen full-time workers — on an annualized basis, assuming a standard 2,000-hour work year.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company’s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers’ compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto’s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: “We’re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. “No one misses that work,” Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. “We’ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,” said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto’s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto’s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,” said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company’s bots as “digital colleagues.” In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“But these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,” said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. “For workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.”The recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology’s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. “It’s not the kind of robot you can see,” Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills are in demand and worth $500k/year


By Neil Aitken -   August 1, 2018 - 1:55 am 17891 0 










9 min readInternet job portal ‘Indeed.com’ links potential employers with people who are looking to take the next step in their careers. The proportion of job posts on their site, relating to ‘Data Science’, a specific job in the AI category, is growing fast (see chart below). More broadly, Artificial Intelligence & machine learning skills, of which ‘Data Scientist’ is just one example, are in demand.
No wonder that it has been termed as the sexiest job role of the 21st century. Interest comes from an explosion of jobs in the field from big companies and Start-Ups, all of which are competing to come up with the best AI business and to earn the money that comes with software that automates tasks.
The skills shortage associated with Artificial Intelligence represents an opportunity for any developer. There has never been a better time to consider whether reskilling or upskilling in AI could be a lucrative path for you.

The AI skills gap the market is experiencing comes from the difficulty associated with finding an individual demonstrating a competent mixture of the very disparate faculties that AI roles require. Artificial Intelligence and it’s near equivalents such as Machine Learning and Neural Networks operate at the intersection of what have mostly been two very different disciplines – statistics and software development. In simple terms, they are half coding, half maths.

Hamish Ogilvy, CEO of AI based Internal Search company Sajari is all too familiar with the problem. He’s on the front line, hiring AI developers. “The hardest part”, says Ogilvy,
“is that AI is pretty complex and the average developer/engineer does not have the background in maths/stats/science to actually understand what is happening. On the flip side the trouble with the stats/maths/science people is that they typically can’t code, so finding people in that sweet spot that have both is pretty tough.”
He’s right. The New York Times suggests that the pool of qualified talent is only 10,000 people, worldwide. Those who do have jobs are typically happily ensconced, paid well, treated appropriately and given no reason whatsoever to want to leave.
Judged by $ investments in the area alone, AI skills are worth developing for those wishing to stay current on technology skills.
In fact, an instinct to develop AI skills will serve any technology employee well. No One can have escaped the many estimates, from reputable consultancies, suggesting that Automation will replace up to 30% of jobs in the next 10 years. No job is safe. Every industry is touched by AI in some form. Any responsible individual with a view to the management of their own skills could learn ML and AI skills to stay relevant in current times. Even if you don’t want to move out of your current job, learning ML will probably help you adapt better in your industry.
What is a typical AI job and what will it pay?
OpenAI, a world class Artificial Intelligence research laboratory, revealed the salaries of some of its key Data Science employees recently. Those working in the AI field with a specialization can earn $300 to $500k in their first year out of university. Experts in Artificial Intelligence now command salaries of up to $1m.

Indraneil Roy, an Expert in AI and Talent Acquisition who works for Edge Networks puts it this way when outlining the difficulties of hiring the right skills and to explain why wages in the field are so high.
“The challenge is the quality of resources. As demand is high for this skill, we are already seeing candidates with fake experience and work pedigree not up to standards.”
The phenomenon is also causing a ‘brain drain’ in Universities. About a third of jobs in the AI field will go to someone with a Ph.D., and all of those are drawn from universities working on the discipline, often lured by the significant pay packages which are available. So, with huge demand and the universities drained, where will future AI employees come from?
3 ways to skill up to become an AI expert (And earn all that money?)
There is still not a lot of agreed terminology or even job roles and responsibility in the sector. However, some things are clear. Those wishing to evolve in to the field of AI must understand the conceptual thinking involved, as a starting point, whether that view is found on the job or as part of an informal / formal educational course.
Specifically, most jobs in the specialty require a working knowledge of neural networks, data / analytics, predictive analytics, with some basic programming and database skills. There are some great resources available online to train you up. Most, as you’d expect, are available on your smartphone so there really is no excuse for not having a look.
1. Free online course: Machine Learning & Statistics and probability 
Hamish Ogilvy summed the online education which is available in the area well.
There are “so many free courses now on AI from Stanford,” he said, “that people are able to educate themselves and make up for the failings of antiquated university courses. AI is just maths really,” he says “complex models and stats. So that’s what people need grounding in to be successful.”
Microsoft offer free AI courses for technical professionals: 
Microsoft’s training materials are second to none. They’re also provided free and provide a shortcut to a credible understanding in an area simply because it comes from a technical behemoth.
Importantly, they also have a list of AI services which you can play with, again for free. For example, a Natural Language engine offers a facility for you to submit text from Instant Messaging conversations and establish the sentiment being felt by the writer. Practical experience of the tools, processes and concepts involved will set you apart. See below.

Google are taking a proactive stance on Machine Learning. They see it’s potential to improve efficiency in every industry and also offer free ML training courses on their site.
2. Take courses on AI/ML
Packt’s machine learning courses, books and videos:
Packt is working towards a mission to help the world put software to work in new ways, through the delivery of effective learning and information services to IT professionals. It has published over 6,000 books and videos so far, providing IT professionals with the actionable knowledge they need to get the job done – whether that’s specific learning on an emerging technology or optimizing key skills in more established tools.
You can choose from a variety of Packt’s books, videos and courses for AI/ML. Here’s a list of top ones:

Artificial Intelligence by Example [Book]
Artificial Intelligence for Big data [Book]
Learn Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow [Video]
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Java [Video]
Advanced Artificial Intelligence Projects with Python [Video]
Python Machine learning – Second Edition [Book]
Machine Learning with R – Second Edition [Book]

Coursera’s machine learning courses

Coursera is a company which make training courses, for a variety of subjects, available online. Taken from actual University course content and delivered with tests, videos and training notes, all accessed online, each course is roughly a University Module. Students pick up an ‘up to under-graduate’ level of understanding of the content involved.
Coursera’s courses are often cited as merit worthy and are recognizable in the industry. Costs vary but are typically between $2k and $5k per course.
3. Learn by doing
Familiarize yourself with relevant frameworks and tools including Tensor Flow, Python and Keras.
TensorFlow from Google is the most used open source AI software library. You can use existing code in your experiments and experiment with neural networks in much the same way as you can in Microsoft’s.
Python is a programming language written for a big data world. Its proponents will tell you that Python saves developers hundreds of lines of code, allowing you to tie together information and systems faster than ever before. Python is used extensively in ML and AI applications and should be at the top of your study list.
Keras, a deep learning library is similarly ubiquitous. It’s a high level Neural Network API designed to allow prototyping of your software as fast as possible.

Finally, a lesser known but still valuable resources is the Accord.net. It is one final example of the many  software elements with which you can engage with to train yourself up. Accord Framework.net will expose you to image libraries, natural learning and real time facial recognition.
Earn extra points with employers
AI has several lighthouse tasks which are proving the potential of the technology in these still early stages. We’ve included a couple of examples, Natural Language processing and image recognition, above. Practical expertise in these areas specifically, image or voice recognition or pattern matching are valued highly by employers.
Alternatively, have you patented something? A registered patent in your name is highly prized. Especially something to do with Machine Learning. Both will help you showcase Extra skills / achievements that will help your application.’ The specifics of how to apply for patents differ by country but you can find out more about the overall principles of how to submit an idea here.
Passion and engagement in the subject are also, clearly appealing characteristics for potential employers to see in applicants. Participating in competitions like Kaggle, and having a portfolio of projects you can showcase on facilities like GitHub are also well prized.
Of all of these suggestions, for those employed, any on the job experience you can get will stand you in the best stead. Indraneil says
“Individual candidates need to spend more time doing relevant projects while in employment. Start ups involved in building products and platforms on AI seem to have better talent.”
The fact that there are not many AI specialists around is a bad sign
There is a demand for employees with AI skills and an investment in relevant training may pay you well.
Unfortunately, the underlying problem this situation reveals could be far worse than the problems experienced so far. Together, once found, all these AI scientists are going to automate millions of jobs, in every industry, in every country around the world.
If Industry, Governments and Universities cannot train enough people to fill the roles being created by an evolving skills market, we may rightly be concerned to worry about how they will deal with retraining all those displaced by AI, for whom there may be no obvious replacement role available.

Research in isolation, or in secret, falls behind the leading edge. According to Nature Index Science Inc. 2017, publications resulting from collaborations not just among academics, which comes most naturally, but between academia and industry more than doubled from 12,672 in 2012 to 25,962 in 2016. The burgeoning dual-affiliation model — where academics actually work inside industry for a time, while maintaining their academic position — makes possible not only technological advances like better speech recognition, image recognition, text understanding, and language translation systems, but also fundamental scientific advances in our understanding of intelligence.Dual affiliation is a boon. It benefits not just the AI economy but individual academics — both researchers and students — as well as industry. We need to champion it.Worldwide spending on AI systems is predicted to reach $19.1 billion in 2018, says International Data Corporation. The number of active AI startups is fifteen times larger than in 2000, per Stanford University. And according to Adobe, the share of jobs requiring AI is 5.5 times higher than in 2013. Things are going pretty well and I'm arguing it's largely thanks to industry-academia collaborations. For decades, many professors of business, finance, law, and medicine have practiced their profession in the private sector while teaching and doing research at university. A growing number of leading AI researchers, from colleagues here at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) to several of my friends at other technology companies, are embracing a version of dual affiliation. Other academics, such as my old friend Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montréal, have not joined corporate research labs but have played important roles in many companies and startups as advisers or co-founders.
  
The dual affiliation model allows researchers to maximize their impact. Different research environments lead to different types of ideas. Certain ideas only flourish in academic environments, while others can only be developed in industry where larger engineering teams and larger computing resources are available. In the past, true collaborations between industry and academia were complicated by overly possessive policies regarding intellectual property — on both sides. But in today's world of fast-paced internet services deployment, owning IP has become considerably less important than turning research results into innovative products as quickly as possible, and deploying them at scale. AI researchers establish priority by publishing their results quickly on open-access repositories such as ArXiv.org. Many papers are accompanied by open-source releases of the corresponding code. This practice has increased the rate of progress of AI-related science and technology and thawed a once icy relationship. Sharing helps everyone now.So investment in basic research in industry, and the practice of open research, open-source software, together with a more relaxed attitude towards IP, have made industry-academia collaborations considerably easier and more fruitful than in the past. But we must keep pushing. What drives new technologies like AI is the speed of adoption by the general population, and what often controls that speed is the number and diversity of talented people who can apply themselves to the problem. There are only so many, highly-coveted spots at universities. Meanwhile there's an ever-growing need for top-talent in the industry — we've made a great start with great leaders in key positions, but we need to support — and drive — exponential growth. We need a deeper bench.Industry partnerships with academic institutions can help. They increase the net number of students who can be expertly trained in AI — giving them the benefit of access to significant computing power and training data with the expectation only that they contribute to the field in the future. The FAIR lab in Paris currently hosts 15 PhD students in residence, co-advised by a FAIR researcher and a professor. Ground-breaking research has come out of this program, and I believe our resident PhD students get a superior research environment and mentoring than in most purely academic environments. The program is so successful that we plan to expand it to 40 students over the next few years. Some students may choose to join FAIR after graduation, but many will choose to join other labs, found a startup, or become professors. This is one way we contribute to the R&D ecosystem.
  
The goal for this ecosystem is to improve everyone's opportunity — not only students, but seasoned academics too. Just because renowned researchers welcome new opportunities to participate in research outside of academia, they shouldn't have to jeopardize their own careers — which often happened in the past. Many academics were forced to choose one or the other. I spent the first 15 years of my professional career in industry research at AT&T Bell Labs, AT&T Labs-Research, and the NEC Research Institute, before becoming a professor at NYU in 2003. When I joined Facebook in 2013, I was fortunate enough to be able to keep my professor position and share my time between FAIR and NYU. My dual affiliation allows me, among other things, to keep educating the next generation of scientists. The same holds for a number of academics working at FAIR today — some 20% of the time, some 50%, and some 80% like me. It's also true for the five key research hires we just announced, who will help build our new Pittsburgh lab and FAIR teams in London, Seattle, Paris, and Menlo Park. The dual affiliation model hedges our personal risk while making our research, and knowledge, more powerful.For us academics, industry affiliation offers any number of benefits: resources in the form of compute power and funding, more collaboration with others, and the opportunity for immediate real-world application of research, at a scale that proves out hypotheses much faster than in a lab. People think such benefits must come with an asterisk — that they'll be expected to be sucked into the shipping product machine. In the right industry environments, this simply isn't the case. In fact, fundamental research really benefits when it is untethered from the resource hunt. The dual affiliation model lets academics control their own agenda and timeline. Freed from time crunch, they identify research trends in both academia and in industry, and can act upon whichever's most promising. They are not pressured by product groups to bring their research to application, to achieve ""real world impact"" the way many companies with AI-powered products pressure their AI engineers. At FAIR, for instance, we want researchers to focus on long-term challenges. And in the process of working towards fundamental scientific advances, we often invent new techniques, develop new tools, or discover new phenomena that turn out to be useful. More often than not, ambitious long-term projects end up having product impact much quicker than we thought. Although FAIR is set up as a basic research lab focused on long-term horizons, our work has had a large impact on products for such applications as language translation, image, video and text understanding, search and indexing, content recommendation, and many other areas.
  
Some of us in AI are working to solve real-world problems that impact billions of people by applying image, text, speech, audio and video understanding, reasoning, and action planning. At FAIR, we openly share our advances as much as we can, as fast as we can in the form of technical papers, open source code and teaching material. We produce new knowledge and tools to educate people on the latest developments and make science progress faster. Others in industry, academia and government can innovate on top of our work, creating new products, building new startups, and making new scientific discoveries. Our goals are shared, and these advances are for everyone's benefit. The AI software tools we are producing are used by hundreds of groups for research in high-energy physics, astrophysics, biology, medical imaging, environmental protection and many other domains. I started my professional career at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the late 1980s, and saw a culture of ambitious, open research that produced many of the innovations that power the modern world. These innovations, including the transistor, the solar cell, the laser, digital communication technology, the Unix system, and the C/C++ language, had a big impact on AT&T. But these and many more discoveries and innovations, a dozen of which won Nobel Prizes and Turing Awards, have had an even bigger impact on the world at large. That's what we are after, with AI. Understanding intelligence in machines, animals and humans, is one of the great scientific challenges of our times and building intelligent machines is one of the greatest technological challenges of our times. No single entity in industry, academia or public research has a monopoly on the good ideas that will achieve these goals. It's going to take the combined effort of the entire research community to make progress in the science and technology of intelligence.Yann LeCun is Vice President and Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Silver Professor at NYU affiliated with the Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science.

Facebook's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, says that letting AI experts split their time between academia and industry is helping drive innovation.Writing for Business Insider, the executive and NYU professor argues that the dual-affiliation model Facebook uses boosts individual researchers and the industry at large.A similar model has historically been practiced in other industries, from law to medicine.

Ground-breaking research has come out of this program, and I believe our resident PhD students get a superior research environment and mentoring than in most purely academic environments. The program is so successful that we plan to expand it to 40 students over the next few years. Some students may choose to join FAIR after graduation, but many will choose to join other labs, found a startup, or become professors. This is one way we contribute to the R&D ecosystem.

The goal for this ecosystem is to improve everyone's opportunity — not only students, but seasoned academics too. Just because renowned researchers welcome new opportunities to participate in research outside of academia, they shouldn't have to jeopardize their own careers — which often happened in the past. Many academics were forced to choose one or the other. I spent the first 15 years of my professional career in industry research at AT&T Bell Labs, AT&T Labs-Research, and the NEC Research Institute, before becoming a professor at NYU in 2003. When I joined Facebook in 2013, I was fortunate enough to be able to keep my professor position and share my time between FAIR and NYU. My dual affiliation allows me, among other things, to keep educating the next generation of scientists. The same holds for a number of academics working at FAIR today — some 20% of the time, some 50%, and some 80% like me. It's also true for the five key research hires we just announced, who will help build our new Pittsburgh lab and FAIR teams in London, Seattle, Paris, and Menlo Park. The dual affiliation model hedges our personal risk while making our research, and knowledge, more powerful.Dual Affiliation, Exponential ProgressFor us academics, industry affiliation offers any number of benefits: resources in the form of compute power and funding, more collaboration with others, and the opportunity for immediate real-world application of research, at a scale that proves out hypotheses much faster than in a lab. People think such benefits must come with an asterisk — that they'll be expected to be sucked into the shipping product machine. In the right industry environments, this simply isn't the case.

In fact, fundamental research really benefits when it is untethered from the resource hunt. The dual affiliation model lets academics control their own agenda and timeline. Freed from time crunch, they identify research trends in both academia and in industry, and can act upon whichever's most promising. They are not pressured by product groups to bring their research to application, to achieve ""real world impact"" the way many companies with AI-powered products pressure their AI engineers. At FAIR, for instance, we want researchers to focus on long-term challenges. And in the process of working towards fundamental scientific advances, we often invent new techniques, develop new tools, or discover new phenomena that turn out to be useful. More often than not, ambitious long-term projects end up having product impact much quicker than we thought. Although FAIR is set up as a basic research lab focused on long-term horizons, our work has had a large impact on products for such applications as language translation, image, video and text understanding, search and indexing, content recommendation, and many other areas.

Some of us in AI are working to solve real-world problems that impact billions of people by applying image, text, speech, audio and video understanding, reasoning, and action planning. At FAIR, we openly share our advances as much as we can, as fast as we can in the form of technical papers, open source code and teaching material. We produce new knowledge and tools to educate people on the latest developments and make science progress faster. Others in industry, academia and government can innovate on top of our work, creating new products, building new startups, and making new scientific discoveries. Our goals are shared, and these advances are for everyone's benefit. The AI software tools we are producing are used by hundreds of groups for research in high-energy physics, astrophysics, biology, medical imaging, environmental protection and many other domains.

I started my professional career at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the late 1980s, and saw a culture of ambitious, open research that produced many of the innovations that power the modern world. These innovations, including the transistor, the solar cell, the laser, digital communication technology, the Unix system, and the C/C++ language, had a big impact on AT&T. But these and many more discoveries and innovations, a dozen of which won Nobel Prizes and Turing Awards, have had an even bigger impact on the world at large. That's what we are after, with AI. Understanding intelligence in machines, animals and humans, is one of the great scientific challenges of our times and building intelligent machines is one of the greatest technological challenges of our times. No single entity in industry, academia or public research has a monopoly on the good ideas that will achieve these goals. It's going to take the combined effort of the entire research community to make progress in the science and technology of intelligence.Yann LeCun is Vice President and Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Silver Professor at NYU affiliated with the Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science.

UCLA engineers develop artificial intelligence device that identifies objects at the speed of light



Aug 2, 2018

Created with a 3D printer, the artificial neural network could have applications in medicine, robotics and security
A team of UCLA electrical and computer engineers has created a physical artificial neural network — a device modeled on how the human brain works — that can analyze large volumes of data and identify objects at the actual speed of light. The device was created using a 3D printer at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.
Numerous devices in everyday life today use computerized cameras to identify objects — think of automated teller machines that can “read” handwritten dollar amounts when you deposit a check, or internet search engines that can quickly match photos to other similar images in their databases. But those systems rely on a piece of equipment to image the object, first by “seeing” it with a camera or optical sensor, then processing what it sees into data, and finally using computing programs to figure out what it is.
The UCLA-developed device gets a head start. Called a “diffractive deep neural network,” it uses the light bouncing from the object itself to identify that object in as little time as it would take for a computer to simply “see” the object. The UCLA device does not need advanced computing programs to process an image of the object and decide what the object is after its optical sensors pick it up. And no energy is consumed to run the device because it only uses diffraction of light.
The network, composed of a series of polymer layers, works using light that travels through it. Each layer is 8 centimeters square.
 
New technologies based on the device could be used to speed up data-intensive tasks that involve sorting and identifying objects. For example, a driverless car using the technology could react instantaneously — even faster than it does using current technology — to a stop sign. With a device based on the UCLA system, the car would “read” the sign as soon as the light from the sign hits it, as opposed to having to “wait” for the car’s camera to image the object and then use its computers to figure out what the object is.
Technology based on the invention could also be used in microscopic imaging and medicine, for example, to sort through millions of cells for signs of disease.
The study was published online in Science on July 26.
“This work opens up fundamentally new opportunities to use an artificial intelligence-based passive device to instantaneously analyze data, images and classify objects,” said Aydogan Ozcan, the study’s principal investigator and the UCLA Chancellor’s Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “This optical artificial neural network device is intuitively modeled on how the brain processes information. It could be scaled up to enable new camera designs and unique optical components that work passively in medical technologies, robotics, security or any application where image and video data are essential.”
Schematic showing how the device identifies printed text.
The process of creating the artificial neural network began with a computer-simulated design. Then, the researchers used a 3D printer to create very thin, 8 centimeter-square polymer wafers. Each wafer has uneven surfaces, which help diffract light coming from the object in different directions. The layers look opaque to the eye but submillimeter-wavelength terahertz frequencies of light used in the experiments can travel through them. And each layer is composed of tens of thousands of artificial neurons — in this case, tiny pixels that the light travels through.
Together, a series of pixelated layers functions as an “optical network” that shapes how incoming light from the object travels through them. The network identifies an object because the light coming from the object is mostly diffracted toward a single pixel that is assigned to that type of object.
The researchers then trained the network using a computer to identify the objects in front of it by learning the pattern of diffracted light each object produces as the light from that object passes through the device. The “training” used a branch of artificial intelligence called deep learning, in which machines “learn” through repetition and over time as patterns emerge.
“This is intuitively like a very complex maze of glass and mirrors,” Ozcan said. “The light enters a diffractive network and bounces around the maze until it exits. The system determines what the object is by where most of the light ends up exiting.”
In their experiments, the researchers demonstrated that the device could accurately identify handwritten numbers and items of clothing — both of which are commonly used tests in artificial intelligence studies. To do that, they placed images in front of a terahertz light source and let the device “see” those images through optical diffraction.
They also trained the device to act as a lens that projects the image of an object placed in front of the optical network to the other side of it — much like how a typical camera lens works, but using artificial intelligence instead of physics.
Because its components can be created by a 3D printer, the artificial neural network can be made with larger and additional layers, resulting in a device with hundreds of millions of artificial neurons. Those bigger devices could identify many more objects at the same time or perform more complex data analysis. And the components can be made inexpensively — the device created by the UCLA team could be reproduced for less than $50.
While the study used light in the terahertz frequencies, Ozcan said it would also be possible to create neural networks that use visible, infrared or other frequencies of light. A network could also be made using lithography or other printing techniques, he said.
The study’s others authors, all from UCLA Samueli, are postdoctoral scholars Xing Lin, Yair Rivenson, and Nezih Yardimci; graduate students Muhammed Veli and Yi Luo; and Mona Jarrahi, UCLA professor of electrical and computer engineering.
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Ozcan also has UCLA faculty appointments in bioengineering and in surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He is the associate director of the UCLA California NanoSystems Institute and an HHMI professor.

How artificial intelligence can help us eat better

You are what your friends eat, according to USC researchers whose study aims to prevent obesity and diabetes in kids; AI may be able to find friends who are good influences


August 06, 2018
Connie Choy






Do you have that friend you go out with to indulge on all the scrumptious (and unhealthy) delicacies L.A. has to offer? Or how about that other friend who eats organic and always makes you feel like an unhealthy chicken nugget? Chances are you have both — and you’re also probably one of them.
Peers can wield a lot of influence when it comes to our lifestyle choices: According to the American Psychological Association, people who enrolled in weight loss programs with friends did a better job at keeping their weight off than those who did it alone. Bryan Wilder, a PhD candidate in computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and Kayla de la Haye, assistant professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, believe there’s an opportunity to optimize our peer influences to live a healthier life using artificial intelligence.
Bridging de la Haye’s knowledge of public health with Wilder’s skills in computer science gave life to USC’s Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society’s RECONNECT model, a comprehensive algorithm that provides health practitioners the tool to form real-life peer support groups based on demographic, social and health-related data volunteered by patients.
Wilder and de la Haye will test their algorithm in California’s Antelope Valley where 15 percent of its 400,000 residents live below the poverty line. According to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, only 10 percent of children living in this region are considered by their parents to be healthy, and obesity rates are among the county’s highest.
The study’s goal is to work with low-income moms and their infants to promote healthy eating and activity to prevent diseases like obesity and diabetes in children.
A pilot research conducted by de la Haye found surprising data to support social intervention. For instance, particularly with the at-risk community in Antelope Valley, moms with young children have very few same-age peers, and those who have no peers and limited social support exhibit poor health-related behavior such as unhealthy diet and lack of exercise.

Healthy eating and key connections
“We know that the algorithm is thinking about the big picture of the entire social network,” said Wilder, who is advised by Milind Tambe, holder of the Helen N. and Emmett H. Jones Professorship in Engineering. “Not just an individual person. It’s considering these chains of influences when it takes someone who needs a healthy buddy and matches him or her up. The algorithm is a lot more effective because it manages the global picture.”
RECONNECT creates networks on a big-picture scale. Rather than recommend the right weight loss program like traditional methods, RECONNECT recommends the right people to surround yourself with for permanent behavior change. Embedded in a social circle that promotes health and well-being, you’re better equipped to make healthier choices.
The National Institute of Health is funding the next phase of its research in Antelope Valley. The NIH funding was granted to de la Haye and her co-principal investigator, Sarah-Jeanne Salvy of the University of Alabama, Birmingham. This phase will involve a group of 300 families that will be enrolled in an 18-month home-visiting program monitored by a certified health professional.
Half of the families will receive the standard home-visiting services, while the other half will get an enhanced home-visiting service with a new healthy lifestyle intervention and a family and peer support component facilitated by the RECONNECT model.
The researchers hope to see if families engaging in healthy lifestyles and RECONNECT are overall better off and have less risk for diseases like obesity and diabetes compared to families who receive only the standard in-home services.

On trial before her were two men accused of forging paintings by artists including Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky, whose angular, abstract compositions can now go for eight-figure prices. The case had been in progress for three and a half years and was seen by many as a test. A successful prosecution could help end an epidemic of forgeries – so-called miracle pictures that appear from nowhere – that have been plaguing the market in avant-garde Russian art.But as the trial reached its climax, it disintegrated into farce. One witness, arguably the world’s leading Malevich authority, argued that the paintings were unquestionably fakes. Another witness, whose credentials were equally impeccable, swore that they were authentic. In the end, the forgery indictments had to be dropped; the accused were convicted only on minor charges.Russian avant-garde forgery case ends in convictions and disappointmentsRead moreThe judge was unimpressed. “Ask 10 different art historians the same question and you get 10 different answers,” she told the New York Times. Adding a touch of bleak comedy to proceedings, it emerged that the warring experts were at the wrong end of a bad divorce.It isn’t a comforting time for art historians. Weeks earlier, in January, the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium, was forced to pull 24 works supposedly by many of the same Russian artists – Kandinsky, Malevich, Rodcheko, Filonov – after the Art Newspaper published an exposé arguing they were all forged. Just days before, there was uproar when 21 paintings shown at a Modigliani exhibition in Genoa, Italy, were confiscated and labeled as fakes. Works that had been valued at millions of dollars were abruptly deemed worthless.The market in old masters is also jittery after an alarming series of scandals – the greatest of which was last year’s revelation that paintings handled by the respected collector Giuliano Ruffini were suspect. A Cranach, a Parmigiano, and a Frans Hals were all found to be forged; institutions including the Louvre had been fooled. The auction house Sotheby’s was forced to refund $10m for the Hals alone. Many experts are now reluctant to offer an opinion, in case they’re sued – which, of course, only intensifies the problem.Adding fuel to the fire is another development: Wary of being caught, more and more forgers are copying works from the early to mid-20th century. It’s much easier to acquire authentic materials, for one thing, and modern paintings have rocketed in value in recent years.For many in the industry, it is starting to look like a crisis. Little wonder that galleries and auction houses, desperate to protect themselves, have gone CSI. X-ray fluorescence can detect paint and pigment type; infrared reflectography and Raman spectroscopy can peer into a work’s inner layers and detect whether its very component molecules are authentic. Testing the chemistry of a flake of paint less than a millimeter wide can disclose deep secrets about where and, crucially, when it was made.“It’s an arms race,” says Jennifer Mass, an authentication expert who runs the Delaware-based firm Scientific Analysis of Fine and Decorative Art. “Them against us.”What if the forger’s handwriting was staring you in the face, if only you could see it?But what if you didn’t need to go to all that trouble? What if the forger’s handwriting was staring you in the face, if only you could see it? That’s the hope of researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who have pioneered a method that promises to turn art authentication on its head.Instead of subjecting works to lengthy and hugely expensive materials analysis, hoping a forger has made a tiny slip – a stray fiber, varnish made using ingredients that wouldn’t have been available in 16th-century Venice – the new technique is so powerful that it doesn’t even need access to the original work: A digital photograph will do. Even more striking, this method is aided by artificial intelligence. A technology whose previous contributions to art history have consisted of some bizarre sub–Salvador Dalís might soon be able to make the tweed-wearing art valuers look like amateurs.At least that’s the theory, says Ahmed Elgammal, PhD, whose team at Rutgers has developed the new process, which was made public late last year. “It is still very much under development; we are working all the time. But we think it will be a hugely valuable addition to the arsenal.”That theory is certainly intriguing. Instead of obsessing over materials, the new technique takes a hard look at the picture itself: Specifically, the thousands of tiny individual strokes that compose it.Every single gesture – shape, curvature, the velocity with which a brush- or pencil-stroke is applied – reveals something about the artist who made it. Together, they form a telltale fingerprint. Analyze enough works and build up a database, and the idea is that you can find every artist’s fingerprint. Add in a work you’re unsure about, and you’ll be able to tell in minutes whether it’s really a Matisse or if it was completed in a garage in Los Angeles last week. You wouldn’t even need the whole work; an image of one brushstroke could give the game away.“Strokes capture unintentional process,” explains Elgammal. “The artist is focused on composition, physical movement, brushes – all those things. But the stroke is the telltale sign.”View image in fullscreenThe original painting by Matisse titled Odalisque in Red Pants, left, next to a fake version that was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, Venezuela. The original work was swapped with a forgery in 2002. Photograph: Uncredited/ASSOCIATED PRESSThe paper Elgammal and his colleagues published last November examined 300 authentic drawings by Picasso, Matisse, Egon Schiele, and a number of other artists and broke them down into more than 80,000 strokes. Machine-learning techniques refined the data set for each artist; forgers were then commissioned to produce a batch of fakes. To put the algorithm though its paces, the forgeries were fed into the system. When analyzing individual strokes, it was over 70% accurate; when whole drawings were examined, the success rate increased to over 80% . (The researchers claim 100% accuracy “in most settings.”)The researchers are so confident that they included images of originals and fakes alongside each other in the published paper, daring so-called experts to make up their own minds. (Reader, I scored dismally.) One of Elgammal’s colleagues, Dutch painting conservator Milko den Leeuw, compares it to the way we recognize family members: They look similar, but we’re just not sure why. “Take identical twins,” he says. “Outsiders can’t separate them, but the parents can. How does that work? It’s the same with a work of art. Why do I recognize that this is a Picasso and that isn’t?”The idea of fingerprinting artists via their strokes actually dates back to the 1950s and a technique developed by Dutch art historian Maurits Michel van Dantzig. Van Dantzig called his approach “pictology”, arguing that because every work of art is a product of the human hand, and every hand is different, it should be possible to identify authorship using these telltale strokes.The problem, though, was that there was too much data. Even a simple drawing contains hundreds or even thousands of strokes, all of which needed to be examined by the human eye and catalogued. Multiply that by every work, and you see how impractical it was.“It just wasn’t possible to test it,” says den Leeuw, who first became aware of pictology as a student. “I saw many attempts, but mostly it ended in ideas that would never be.”But can AI now do what humans failed to, and give an art historian’s trained eye some sort of scientific basis? “Exactly,” says den Leeuw. “Very often it’s a gut feeling. We’re trying to unpick the mystery.”Though Mass says she’s unlikely to throw out her fluorescence gun just yet, she admits to being impressed. “A lot of people in the field are excited by AI It’s not a magic bullet, but it’ll be another tool. And it’s really valuable when you’re dealing with a sophisticated forger who’s got everything else right – paint, paper, filler, all the materials.”Can A​I​ now do what humans failed to, and give an art historian’s trained eye some sort of scientific basis?There are issues. So far, the system has been tested mainly on drawings from a handful of artists and a brief time period. Paintings, which generally contain thousands more strokes, are a tougher challenge; older paintings, which might contain numerous layers of restoration or overpainting, are tougher still. “It’s challenging, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do it,” Elgammal says. “I’m confident.”What about style, though, particularly where an artist changes over time? Think of Picasso’s wildly varying periods – blue, African, cubist, classical – or how in the 1920s Malevich abandoned the elemental abstraction of his black squares for figurative portraits that could almost have been painted by Cézanne (pressure from Stalin was partly responsible).Another expert, Charles R Johnson, who teaches computational art history at Cornell, is less persuaded – not so much by the AI as by the assumptions that lie behind it. “A big problem is that strokes are rarely individualized,” he says. “Overlap is difficult to unravel. Plus, one must understand the artist’s style changes over their career in order to make a judgment.”In addition, Johnson argues, many artist’s brushwork is essentially invisible, making it impossible to unpick; it might be better to focus computer analysis on assessing canvases or paper, which can be more rigorously verified. “I remain quite skeptical,” he says.Elgammal and den Leeuw concede there’s a way to go. Currently they’re working on impressionist paintings – infinitely more complex than Schiele and Picasso line drawings – and hope to publish the results next year. Even with the drawings, the machine can’t yet be left to learn on its own; often the algorithms require human tweaking to make sure the right features are being examined. Artists whose output isn’t large enough to create a reliable data set are also a challenge.I ask Elgammal if he’s worried about being sued. He laughs, slightly nervously. “That’s something I think about.”It’s a reasonable question, particularly pressing given the number of fakes that are circulating: What if your database accidentally becomes contaminated? Many people argue that the art market is hopelessly corrupt – so much so that some economists doubt whether calling it a “market” is even fair. Could the algorithm become skewed and go rogue?“It’s like any system,” Mass agrees. “Garbage in, garbage out.”Does she think that’s a possibility? How many fakes are out there? “Put it this way,” Mass says, “when I go into auction houses – maybe not the big ones, but smaller, local ones – I think ‘buyer beware.’ It might be between 50 and 70% .”Rival solutions are coming down the road. Some have proposed using blockchain technology to guarantee provenance – the history of who has owned a work. Others have called for much greater transparency. Everyone agrees that the system is broken; some kind of fix is urgent.Of course, there are big philosophical questions here. When someone goes to the effort of finding exactly the right 17th-century canvas, dons an antique smock, and paints a near-flawless Franz Hals, it should perhaps make us reconsider what we mean by the words “real” or “fake”, let alone the title of “artist”. Yet the irony is inescapable. It is hard to think of something more human than art, the definition of our self-expression as a species. But when it comes down to it, humans aren’t actually that good at separating forged and authentic in a painting that has all the hallmarks of, say, a Caravaggio but is merely a stunt double. Relying on our eyes, we simply can’t tell one twin from the other. We might even ask: Why do we care?Forget cars that pilot themselves or Alexa teaching herself to sound less like the robot she is – AI seems to understand the secrets of artistic genius better than we do ourselves.When I speak to den Leeuw, I wonder if he also senses the irony: that, while machines might not yet might be able to make good art, they are getting eerily good at appreciating it. “Yes, it’s true,” he says thoughtfully. “When it comes to very complex combinations of things, humans are really not so good.” He laughs. “We make too many mistakes.”

But building that takes lots of programmers many hours; Vice City, after all, was not built in a day.What if an AI could do some of the heavy lifting (so to speak) instead? Computer scientists at Italy's Politecnico di Milano found a way to let AI handle all the difficult parts of level design so that designers and gamers alike can get to the fun parts more quickly.The 1993 first-person shooter DOOM was a natural place to start. People run the thing on as much technology as possible — there are people out there who will figure out how to run the game on anything with an operating system, from a thermostat to a calculator.So it made sense that the ubiquitous game should be the starting point for the scientists to train the Generative Adversarial Network that they used to create new maps.That neural net relies on two artificial intelligence algorithms working with and against each other to create believable levels. One, the generator network, received data from thousands of human-created levels, including some from the original games and some created by hobbyists. It then created new stages that looked similar.The AI took into account the overall size of the level, the heights of the walls, the number of rooms in a level, and other measurements to try and mimic man-made levels as best as it could.The second AI, called the discriminator network, is there to check its work. It, too, analyzes the original levels, but is trained to recognize whether or not they’re man-made or AI-generated. After that analysis, it takes what it learned to check the generator network’s output.With these two algorithms pushing against each other, the researchers found that their technology could generate levels that looked believable, or at least as believable as possible given DOOM's famously-old school graphics.There were some glitches. The networks got confused about some of the fine details of how a wall ought to look, for example. But for the most part the stages were as playable as any other.But DOOM is just the beginning. The researchers believe that the general framework that runs their AI could scale up to larger and more involved games. While this could take some of the imaginative design work out of human hands, such a tool could also encourage video game developers who don’t have the budget of a major studio, allowing them to carve out their own niche in the field. With an algorithm designing or at least helping to design and construct some stages of a game, it could cost much less to make a game.Share This ArticleRead This NextPleading the FifthWashington Post Launches AI to Answer Climate Questions, But It Won't Say Whether AI Is Bad for the ClimatePress GenerateLeak Reveals the New York Times Experimented With Using AI to Write HeadlinesWhat in the BioshockIn Fresh Hell, American Vending Machines Are Selling Bullets Using Facial RecognitionFake LoveResearcher Studying Married Men With AI GirlfriendsVirus PanicChatGPT-4o Is Sending Users to a Scammy Website That Floods Your Screen With Fake Virus Warnings",2018-05-08T15:17:48-04:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}",,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI, at your service.

However, at least one set of experts believes jobs will be shredded, but not eliminated. Instead of worrying about job losses, executives should be helping to reduce jobs in which AI and machine learning take over boring tasks, while humans spend more time with higher-level tasks.
That's the word from Erik Brynjolfsson and Daniel Rock, with MIT, and Tom Mitchell of Carnegie Mellon University, who points out that the impact of machine learning, the self-programming, self-adjusting core of AI, on jobs. is iffy. ""ML will affect very different parts of the workforce than earlier waves of automation,"" they state in a recent paper.  Instead, automation will occur on a task-by-task basis.
PROMOTED
""Tasks within jobs typically show considerable variability in 'suitability for machine learning' while few -- if any -- jobs can be fully automated using machine learning,"" they continue. ""Machine learning technology can transform many jobs in the economy, but full automation will be less significant than the re-engineering of processes and the reorganization of tasks.""
What jobs are most likely to see tasks handled by AI or machine learning? Oddly enough, funeral directors rank high on the automatable list. Here are the roles Brynjolfsson and his co-authors identify as top candidates for machine learning:

Brynjolfsson and his colleagues say we're having the wrong debate when it comes to AI: instead of pondering how jobs will be wiped out, people need to focus on ""the redesign of jobs and re-engineering of business processes."" While AI and machine learning will be everywhere, the suitability for machine learning of work tasks varies greatly.""  The high and low suitability-for-machine-learning  tasks within a job can be separated and re-bundled.""
Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, former IBM mover and shaker and now one of the most informed observers of the digital economy, provided perspective on the Brynjolfsson report, noting that some of the job activities ""are more susceptible to automation, while others require judgment, social skills and other hard-to-automate human capabilities. But just because some of the activities in a job have been automated, does not imply that the whole job has disappeared."" To the contrary, he continues, ""automating parts of a job will often increase the productivity and quality of workers by complementing their skills with machines and computers, as well as enabling them to focus on those aspects of the job that most need their attention.""
Bracing for job shredding calls for rethinking the various tasks for which employees assume responsibilities. Brynjolfsson and his co-authors warn, however, that arbitrarily bundling machine-learning-enabled and non-ML tasks into a single job is counterproductive. ""Bundling suitability-for-machine-learning and non-SML tasks prevents specialization and locks up potential productivity gains.""
Ultimately, the key to success in this emerging environment is to be able to marshal and capitalize on AI capabilities to deliver more value and service to customers. Employees can play a vital role in identifying opportunities, training models and algorithms, and taking a leadership role in determining if the systems are delivering business value in an ethical way.
Jobs will be enriched and elevated by AI and machine learning, but the best jobs will be those created to employ AI that links customers to the services and products they need.

A new survey of NHS staff reveals that while there remains a difference between the level of enthusiasm for AI between senior managers and other respondents of the survey, overall the majority view it as positive.


Digital transformation has been the recent focal point in the discussion surrounding healthcare, and with AI at the forefront, continuously popping up as an example of ways the NHS could achieve its aims stated in the Five Year Forward View.
The tech focused Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced an investment of £400 million in tech transformation and supported AI as providing “huge opportunities to improve patient outcomes and to make life easier for staff.”  The Prime Minister herself has even spoken at length about AIs potential improve health provision in the UK.
However, AI not only provides opportunities to the NHS, it is also draws our attention to the areas where the NHS needs improving. The House of Lords Select Committee report ‘AI in the UK: Ready, willing and able?’ showed that obtaining applicable data from other organisations remains the most significant barrier to adoption of AI and could force the implantation to stand still whilst other changes are made.
This leave us with one question, what does the NHS workforce think?

While the adoption of AI in aiding the NHS to deliver healthcare is a priority of the Department and its Secretary, a survey by Dods Research reveals the NHS workers attitudes to AI and how organisations use it.  

 





The survey had 1,019 respondents including 700 individuals working for NHS Trusts, 47 for clinical commissioning groups, and 31 from NHS England. In terms of roles, approaching 200 respondents were senior managers, heads of services, directors or chief executives and over 300 were clinicians.
The survey revealed a noticeable gap between those that see potential in AI and those that have plans to implement it within their organisations. Over 60% of respondents having no plans for using AI, as opposed to a mere 6% of respondents from each cohort that had been utilising it in their organisations.
Furthermore, it also showed that whilst senior managers were euthanistic about AI, clinicians remained more cautious, noting the issues that could accompany it such as the needs for additional safe guards.
Despite his much-acclaimed appreciation for technology, Hancock’ has acknowledged the gap that will need to be filled before AI can become the star “we will put in place the data standards and support the workforce to adopt change too.” Training will need to be offered to staff to understand the data generated, safe guards will need to be implemented and IT infrastructure will have to be up-to date to ensure the system is secure. 
AI has huge potential for healthcare, as can be seen in the responses to the survey, but progress is still needed to ensure that staff and organisations are using it correctly and to the best of its ability. AI will need to be a much needed helping hand to the NHS workforce, not another issue to add to the NHS’s list of improvements.

Two years ago, Craig Coates, an entomologist at Texas A&M University, was asked to take over a science course plagued by cheating. The previous instructor of the large lecture course, “Insects in Human Society,” had tried to stay one step ahead, but in the class, oriented around online quizzes and tests, students would quickly share new material as soon as it went up. “It became an arms race between pushing out more questions faster and cheating,” recalls Coates, an instructional associate professor who has taught on the campus for nearly 20 years. “It moved everything toward rote learning.”

 Two years ago, Craig Coates, an entomologist at Texas A&M University, was asked to take over a science course plagued by cheating. The previous instructor of the large lecture course, “Insects in Human Society,” had tried to stay one step ahead, but in the class, oriented around online quizzes and tests, students would quickly share new material as soon as it went up. “It became an arms race between pushing out more questions faster and cheating,” recalls Coates, an instructional associate professor who has taught on the campus for nearly 20 years. “It moved everything toward rote learning.” He wanted to reorient the course toward writing and discussion, convinced that the method would not only reduce cheating but also be a more engaging way to learn. But with 500 students — 200 in person and 300 online — grading would be a challenge. He experimented with one assignment, and it took days for him and three teaching assistants to complete the grading. “It was obviously going to be impossible,” he said, to do it by hand. Peer review was an option, but he and his TAs needed help sorting, assigning, and evaluating submissions. That led him to try a tool that uses algorithms and analytics. The switch was a success: Students enjoyed writing about current research, including keeping an insect blog and debating topics in entomology. The response, Coates says, has been “overwhelmingly positive.” Artificial intelligence is showing up more frequently in college classrooms, particularly at big institutions that are seeking to make large courses more intimate and interactive. A professor at Georgia Tech developed virtual teaching assistants and tutors. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are creating conversational agents to promote online discussion. And on a growing number of campuses, professors are using adaptive courseware that adjusts lessons according to students’ understanding and deploying AI-driven tools, like the one Coates used, to promote writing and peer review.

  As artificial intelligence enters our daily lives through smart speakers and chatbots, it’s no wonder that academics are exploring its potential in teaching. The technologies in these tools vary, of course. Some focus on sorting information to a help a professor organize and evaluate assignments. Others use automated text analysis to mine students’ writing and fashion relevant prompts. Adaptive courseware is built around the sequencing of lesson plans, selecting content based on regular assessments of what students know. Advanced tools are based on machine learning, a form of AI that learns from user behavior. And many forms of AI draw on research in learning science, cognitive psychology, data science, and computer science. This trend prompts serious questions. When you’ve got artificial intelligence handling work that is normally done by a human, how does that change the role of the professor? And what is the right balance of technology and teacher? Some, like Coates, feel that algorithm-driven technologies can be useful aids in large classes. They automate some of teaching’s routine tasks, so that professors can do what no machine can — challenge and inspire students to gain a deeper understanding of what they’re learning. These technologies, advocates argue, are simply tools in service of creative forms of teaching.

 But skeptics worry that if education is increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence and automated responses, it will put technology in the driver’s seat and prompt formulaic approaches to learning. Some of the algorithms used in AI-driven tools are built on large data sets of student work, raising privacy and ethical questions. Turning to technology for solutions, critics say, may also short-circuit conversations about some of the structural challenges to effective teaching and learning. That avoidance of structural issues troubles people like Kevin Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University, in Des Moines, and head of the campus Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. “We see a particular problem, whether it’s retention rates for minoritized students or large class sizes and heavy grading loads,” he says, “and our first instinct is to find something new and hot to address the problem rather than focus on the classroom and faculty and students.” Perhaps nowhere are those tensions more apparent than with adaptive courseware, sometimes called intelligent tutoring systems. The programs have grown increasingly popular as an alternative to large classes that emphasize lecture and memorization. They have also given rise to the specter of the robot teacher. With adaptive courseware, students first encounter material outside of class, often through short video lessons and readings. They take quizzes that assess their understanding of the material and, depending on the results, the courseware either advances them to the next lesson or provides supplemental instruction on concepts they don’t yet grasp. Advocates say this lets students study at their own pace and frees up the instructor’s time in class to shore up students’ knowledge or help them apply what they have learned. Adaptive courseware has made the most inroads in introductory STEM courses, particularly math, in which it is easier to sequence content and test understanding of concepts than in, say, a literature class. Administrators at several large public universities, including the University of Central Florida and Georgia State University, have seen positive results with the use of adaptive courseware, which are often accompanied by a rethinking of classroom time, to emphasize active-learning techniques.

Nathan Lindstrom for The ChronicleCraig Coates, an entomologist at Texas A&M, uses a peer-assessment tool called Peerceptiv to anonymize and distribute student work, allowing each writing assignment to be reviewed by several classmates. 


 Susan Holechek became a convert several years ago as Arizona State University began testing adaptive courseware in a number of introductory courses. The biology instructor teaches a class for nonmajors — who probably wouldn’t be there if they didn’t have to be. “It’s a very, very, very tough crowd,” she says. Holechek tried out a small class that used a combination of adaptive courseware and active learning, while also teaching her conventional 300-student lecture course. For a lesson on DNA, for example, her traditional lecture focused mainly on conveying information, she says. Students in the smaller, pilot section might read the textbook, watch a video, and then take a short quiz the night before class to see how well they understood the material. If they scored poorly on some part of the lesson plan, the courseware would then send them back to review that concept, with new examples or additional information to help them grasp it better. Using adaptive courseware enables Holechek to spend class time on exercises that encourage students to apply concepts that they encountered online. In one exercise, called “Who Kidnapped Sparky” (the university’s mascot), they work with DNA samples to understand their use in forensics. “It allows me to be more creative,” she says.

 The adaptive courseware also helps her create opportunities for more points of contact — between her and her students, and her students with the material. A dashboard helps Holechek keep track of how well each student is doing on homework and quizzes, with a cumulative “mastery” rating attached to each. Every Sunday the instructor goes over the collective results from homework reviews to see which concepts her class struggled with. Then she builds a brief Monday-morning lecture around that material. The proportion of students earning a C or better in Holechek’s course rose from 76 to 94 percent in the pilot and has continued to remain strong now that she has switched entirely to adaptive learning. Other experiences with adaptive courseware have been more mixed. A recent study looking at results from across a range of colleges found little to no difference in course grades. This points to a larger challenge with education technology, ed-tech experts say: If instructors expect tech to fix classroom problems but don’t address underlying pedagogical issues, they are likely to see limited results. After stumbling through some early experiments with adaptive learning, Arizona State found that training instructors in active-learning strategies increased the impact of the adaptive courseware they used. The university has also redesigned classrooms to promote collaborative work and offers a starter kit to those new to active learning that includes sample exercises focused on problem solving and critical thinking. The connection between pedagogy and technology is often missing in the debate over AI-driven teaching tools, notes Barbara Means, executive director of learning-science research at Digital Promise Global, an independent nonprofit group that studies digital technologies in education. “We end up talking past each other because people tend to say, ‘Does it work?,’ "" she says. “And it really needs to be a more nuanced question.” In other words, what works for one kind of student in one kind of learning environment with a particular set of educational goals might not work for someone else.

 Ryan S. Baker, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, who does research in this field, goes so far as to call AI a “red herring” in these discussions. “Well-designed activities, on or offline, can promote critical thinking,” he says. AI tools to support these activities are simply “a secondary part of it.” One of the best ways to help students develop their critical-thinking skills is to get them to write. That can be accomplished by writing more — and more often — and reviewing their peers’ writing. This has been a particularly fertile area of exploration for AI in the classroom. Kathleen West tried to encourage her students write more frequently and more meaningfully in her online psychology classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. But she was stymied by clunky technology and large class sizes. Sometimes she would post a discussion question in her learning-management system and no one would answer it. Other times the conversation got so unwieldy it became impossible for her to follow. West, who is a lecturer and academic adviser, began using an AI-driven tool called Packback to support online discussions. Each student is required to post a question relevant to the course once a week and then respond to two other students’ questions. Packback takes care of basic monitoring, like making sure the students are on topic and are asking open-ended questions that encourage discussion. It prompts students to supply answers that are backed up with sources and to write more in depth. And it uses an algorithm to give a ‘curiosity score’ to each post based on those and other measures. Because everyone can see all the scores, some instructors say students often try harder when writing subsequent posts.

 West says the tool frees up her time to do more-engaged teaching. That might include joining an online discussion to press a student to elaborate on her ideas or show better evidence of her assertions. An additional benefit of doing more writing, she says, is that students’ writing and critical-thinking skills have improved overall. “Writing on exams has increased exponentially in quality because they’re practicing writing,” she says. “The quality is just night-and-day different.” The tool Coates uses, called Peerceptiv, works by evaluating the reviewer, not the writing itself, says Chris Schunn, a professor of psychology, learning sciences and policy, and intelligent systems at the University of Pittsburgh and the principal investigator behind the program. It helps instructors by anonymizing and distributing student work, allowing each writing assignment to be reviewed by several classmates. Then it monitors and graphs student feedback, including feedback on the reviewers. 







Robin WilliamsCheating had been a problem in “Insects in Human Society,” a large lecture course at Texas A&M. After Craig Coates took over, he integrated more discussion and writing, using an AI tool to help manage the increased flow of work. 


 If a student hands out high ratings to every classmate while others are writing more-nuanced evaluations, his rank as a reviewer will drop. If he gives feedback that other students say is helpful, his score rises. Essentially the AI is looking for outliers, common ground, and dissension in the reviews, Schunn says, then feeds that information back to the professor in the form of a dashboard. If a particular assignment seems to be generating a lot of conflicting peer reviews, that might signal to the instructor that the topic itself is confusing.

 “It shifts you from randomly looking at everything,” he says, “to paying attention where work is problematic.” But writing is complicated; it can be resistant to standardized evaluation. Other researchers are using AI to better understand what kind of feedback improves writing and how it might vary by discipline. Valerie Ross, director of the Critical Writing Program at Penn, is working on a project, funded by the National Science Foundation, to build what she calls an “ecological model” in support of good writing. By that she means one not built on generic rules — which is often a criticism of writing tools — but specific to discipline, genre, and classroom environment. To do that, she and her collaborators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of South Florida, Dartmouth College, and North Carolina State University are mining writing samples and peer reviews from about 10,0000 students as well as instructor feedback. They will use predictive modeling to identify what seem to be the most useful parts of the process and to answer some big questions: What are valid measures of writing development? Are there particular comments or feedback that lead to improved writing? “Good writing is so socially situated,” she says. “That’s part of the limitations of the AI-big data approach. All those rules are just tools for writers.” But even when it focuses more narrowly on evaluating writing in a specific discipline, artificial intelligence may still be of limited use. At the University of Michigan, concerns about the lack of writing in foundational STEM courses led faculty members to create an automated peer-review system in hopes of changing that dynamic. Created with support from the university and the NSF, the system, called M-Write, has been tested on 8,000 students to date. Similar to Peerceptiv, M-Write anonymizes, sorts, and assigns work by students so that they can review one another’s writing. An integral part of the system, says Anne Ruggles Gere, an English professor who helped create it, is the use of writing fellows. These trained undergraduates act as connectors between students and professor, stepping in, for example, when students get confused by a particular assignment. “They are really the human link that makes the whole system cohere and work well,” says Gere, who heads the university’s Sweetland Center for Writing.

 M-Write researchers would like their system to be able to evaluate how well students understand the concepts they’re writing about, but that goal has proved to be elusive, says Ginger Shultz, an assistant professor of chemistry and co-creator of M-Write. She and her colleagues have figured out ways to tailor messages to students based on, say, whether they’ve made substantial revisions in their writing. But evaluating their conceptual learning through AI has proved far harder, in part because it is so specific to a discipline or even a particular course. To analyze short essay answers of a few sentences for conceptual learning, some software uses what’s called a “bag of words” model, in which the program searches to see whether certain types of words are in the text and how often they appear. A question about chemical equilibrium, Shultz says, might prompt answers that include the words “increasing,” “Le Chatelier’s Principle,” or “reactants.” But that approach doesn’t work for essays of one or two pages, which might cover several ideas. “We’ve been poking at this for two years,” she says, “but accuracy isn’t where we want it to be.” Gere, who is also president of the Modern Language Association, sees AI-driven teaching tools as part of a spectrum of technologies increasingly prevalent in higher education, like advising apps and predictive analytics. Because faculty members are becoming more familiar with how technology is being used on campus, she believes they are more willing to experiment with it in the classroom. “There’s a general awareness,” she says, “that this is, in many ways, going to be part of our lives as academics as we move forward.” Kevin Gannon, the Grand View history professor, isn’t sure that AI-driven teaching is a positive trend. He’s no Luddite: he uses technology in his teaching, runs flipped classrooms, and keeps a blog called The Tattooed Professor. But if colleges are dropping thousands of dollars on tech-driven solutions, he argues, that’s money they’re not spending on hiring more faculty members and teaching assistants. If decision makers believe that AI tutors are effective teachers, he asks, why should they increase salaries and budgets? “I worry that this will be the cost-efficient solution to tuition-dependent systems. And we grow further and further away from conversations about, Is this a public good or not, because we have Auto Teach English 101.”

 He also worries that AI is creating an even deeper divide among the institutional haves and have-nots. No elite colleges, he says, will ever brag about using AI to automate teaching. Their gold standard will remain small class sizes and close contact with professors. Deborah Beck shares Gannon’s skepticism about the use of automation in the classroom. She teaches an introductory course in classical mythology at the University of Texas at Austin. Her class is large — about 200 students — but she gives weekly writing assignments and reads them all. She sees that as integral to her job. Modeling good writing, thoughtful interaction, and respectful disagreement is part of the teaching process, says Beck, an associate professor in the department of classics. “That’s really hard to outsource to AI.” She also believes that her students value her close attention to their work. They tell her the discussion boards were among the most valuable tools they used. In one assignment, she asks her students to analyze how the characters in a reading talk about the ethical issues surrounding the rape of Lucretia, a foundational story in Roman history. Then she shares with the class why she particularly liked one response, explaining how it was written in a lively manner, gave insights beyond what others had already written, and offered specific examples to support the writer’s argument. Beck wonders how automated writing prompts could be as specific, or work as well for students who may have come to college not really knowing how to study. “They need help in learning how to learn,” she says. “And that’s something we all need to think about. Especially in ed tech.”

 As academics experiment with AI in the classroom, privacy experts say more attention needs to be paid to big-picture issues of ethics and efficacy. Technology alters teaching environments in critical ways, yet there is little public scrutiny of those changes, says Elana Zeide, a technology-law expert and fellow at the University of California at Los Angeles’ School of Law. “It’s being adopted without much thoughtfulness or much education of the people using the tools.” One factor is the reliance on algorithms and continuous data collection to make these tools work. Do professors really understand how those tools make their decisions? Probably not, Zeide says, since the algorithms are proprietary. Some tools also control content, determine how learning is measured, and define outcomes, which shifts pedagogical decision-making away from educators toward private, for-profit companies that sell these products, she says. “In contrast to the public and heated debates that accompany textbook choices,” she notes in a recent article, “schools often adopt education technologies ad hoc.” Figuring out which tools might be beneficial, and how they work, is the hard part, of course. Vendors use the language of learning science to describe the benefits of their tools, but their promotional materials can make it difficult to distinguish between broad claims and solid grounding in science and experimentation. Packback, for example, says it uses Bloom’s Taxonomy to prompt higher forms of thinking that shift students away from simple recall and toward analysis and evaluation. The company also claims to help awaken “fearless, relentless curiosity” by encouraging students to ask open-ended questions.

 Experts say vendors should show the research that backs up their products and agree to test runs so that instructors can see how well their programs operate. The technologies should also be adaptable to a particular professor’s course design. “Vendors say we literally can’t tell you how the AI is making decisions on any given case, because the whole point is that it is learned and developed with a set of criteria we input at the start,” says Martin Kurzweil, director of the educational-transformation program at Ithaka S+R, a nonprofit group that studies and supports the use of technology in higher education. “I don’t totally buy that.” 







Deanna Dent, ASUNowSusan Holechek (standing), an instructor at Arizona State U., uses adaptive courseware in her introductory biology classes. It allows her to use class time on exercises that reinforce the concepts students are learning. 


 While the ‘intelligence” part of AI in teaching is still limited, experts envision a future in which the technology becomes broadly multifunctional. Artificial assistants could help design textbooks, deliver course content, develop quiz questions, evaluate the answers, monitor online discussions, adjust to students’ learning styles, and advise students on their path through college. Researchers are already making advances on these fronts.

 Ryan Baker, of Penn, is one of many researchers studying ways to identify students’ habits and attitudes in hopes of developing courseware that can strengthen study skills through tailored messages and tips. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University are piloting a so-called distractor generator that creates the false answers needed to populate multiple-choice quizzes. They are also using AI and machine learning in a program called BBookX to help professors design textbooks. And at Carnegie Mellon, researchers are experimenting with a technology to promote better discussion among students online. Known as a conversational agent, it aims to spur deeper interactions among students by prompting them to react to classmates’ ideas. Robot tutors aren’t about to replicate the full array of teaching-and-learning behaviors that take place as a matter of course among people anytime soon. But artificial intelligence does raise a provocative question, one no doubt on the minds of educators worried about the decline in public higher-education funding: If administrators are willing to cut corners by paying low wages to adjuncts and giving them heavy courseloads, what’s to stop them from trimming their costs even further by offering students some adaptive courseware and a teaching assistant instead? Institutions inclined that way, says Baker, “are probably going to be willing to accept low-quality solutions.”

 He and other educator-advocates say AI can be of real value to learning. Algorithms can reveal patterns of student behavior not immediately noticeable to a professor. Adaptive courseware can nudge students toward effective learning strategies. Tools that can outsource lower-level tasks are worthy of consideration. Just as long as the instructor remains in charge of the classroom. Beth McMurtrie writes about technology’s influence on teaching and the future of learning.

Ken Goldberg, professor and department chair of industrial engineering and operations research at UC Berkeley

Though artificial intelligence systems are already becoming a part of daily life, recent debates about AI and the future of work have gained a sense of urgency. The late Stephen Hawking worried that humans “couldn’t compete, and would be superseded” by machines, while Tesla founder Elon Musk has suggested that competition in AI could lead to World War III. The Economist reported earlier this year that nearly half of the jobs in 32 developed countries surveyed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were vulnerable to automation, declaring, “a wave of automation anxiety has hit the West.”
Ken Goldberg, professor and department chair of industrial engineering and operations research at UC Berkeley, is pushing back on all of that. Instead of embracing the notion that robots will surpass humans and replace us in the workforce (a concept referred to as “singularity”), he argues for “multiplicity” — a hybrid view of how new technologies and people might work in partnership toward human goals. To an extent, he says, this is how AI is already starting to function.
MIT Sloan Management Review correspondent Frieda Klotz spoke with Goldberg about a future in which AI is a complement, not a threat, to workers. What follows is an edited and condensed version of their conversation.
MIT Sloan Management Review: What areas of robotic technology is your lab currently working on?
Goldberg: We’re developing robot software for tasks as wide-ranging as warehouse order fulfillment, home decluttering and robot-assisted surgery. What’s common to all the work we’re doing is the idea of algorithms and learning for robots, improving our ability to analyze data and examples and then use that to build control policies — or models — for how robots can move.
The area I’ve been working on for 35 years is robot grasping — how to reliably pick up objects. It’s easy for humans, but it’s a problem for robots. Basically, every robot is still a klutz, and that’s a big challenge if you want to develop one that will declutter a home or pack boxes in a warehouse.
Can you talk about your concept of multiplicity?
Goldberg: People keep saying we’re on the verge of a transition, the singularity, when computers will take over.

Putting the human touch on artificial intelligence

        Helen Masters says now is great time for HR leaders to embrace transformation and the benefits it can deliver.    


        By: HRM Asia Newsroom | August 15, 2018
         • 3 min read    

Topics: Asia-Pacific | Features | Singapore   


 
 
Helen Masters is Senior Vice President and General Manager for software developer Infor in Asia-Pacific, where she is responsible for the development of the company’s market presence across Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, South Korea, and Greater China.
With the advent of classification methodologies in machine learning and the development of big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform HR functions significantly. The recently conducted annual Harvey Nash HR Survey found that 63% of HR leaders in the Asia-Pacific region expect automation and AI to impact their organisations over the next five years, while 26% report these technologies are already having an impact today.
The creation of individually-tailored learning and development plans generated by big data processes, and chatbots that are able to recruit applicants are just two examples in which AI has already started to impact HR and talent management.
 
Starting the conversation

Chatbots are already omnipresent in consumers’ lives, and now they are starting to appear in the workplace. Intelligent assistants are being used to simulate human interactions. HR leaders are now using chatbots to recruit job candidates and also respond to internal employee enquiries. Chatbots are usually the first line of contact, followed by the HR personnel for more complex enquiries and conversations.
In addition, chatbots can help in the screening process for recruitment by performing quick background checks, can help in on-boarding, training employees and with annual self-assessments.
 
Predicting employee performance

Machine learning is perhaps the most successful part of AI, at least from an industry point of view. Usage cases include when employers want to know which candidates are the most suitable for open positions, or when there is a group of employees that HR would like to evaluate in terms of likely attrition rates.  Predictive talent analytics and employee flight risk models will revolutionise how HR looks at workforce planning. However, human intervention will still be required at some points to work under a diverse set of scenarios.
 
Modern upskilling
Traditionally, coaching modules have been used by the HR profession to offer upskilling and career development for employees. AI can help successfully plan, organise, and coordinate these training programmes for staff members across all levels.

Digital classrooms are the most common solutions for these training programmes. AI can also help in determining the best timeframe for new courses so as to fit the preferences of all employees individually.
 
Employee engagement
Sentiment analysis techniques have been used to evaluate positive and negative emotions and biases in a wide range of digitally published materials, including tweets and blog posts. There has also been an increase in these techniques in the HR space to better evaluate emotions and engagement levels of employees in particular.

Some AI platforms are also designed to identify employees that may be heading for the exit. The platforms help track employee computer activity and then analyse the data to determine a baseline of regular use. Any significant deviation from the normal baseline will then be flagged to the employer.
In practice, sentiment analysis to measure employee engagement can be quite effective. But what is less talked about are the ways in which biased, or even blatantly incorrect results can be generated through traditional methods only. Therefore, HR management must be careful to establish a consensus on sentiment analysis that is fair and objective. In this way, AI tools clearly support this HR function.
 
A balanced approach

As technologies develop and more data becomes available, AI will continue to impact HR in new and vastly different ways. However, HR managers should take the time to fully understand the advantages and potential considerations to various approaches and build the right set of algorithms and data architecture before solely relying on technology solutions.
Because of the human factor, there is no aspect of HR that is purely black or white. HR managers will need to find the right balance between greater insights through data and AI and maintaining the human insights and judgments that are essential to an effective HR team.
 
HRM Asia is excited to announce the HR Tech Think Tank, a one-day event that will deep-dive into the latest HR Technologies that are enabling faster, better and cheaper solutions to HR practices and people operations.
Held in Singapore on October 19, the HR Tech Think Tank will feature eight technologist-led, interactive workshops on the latest applications for payroll, talent management, and much more.
Head to the HR Tech Think Tank website for more information and to register.

3 min readIn the new found age of Artificial Intelligence, where everything and everyone uses Machine Learning concepts to make life easier, the dark side of the same is can be left unexplored. Cybersecurity is gaining a lot of attention these days.The most influential organizations have experienced a downfall because of undetected malware that have managed to evade even the most secure cyber defense mechanisms. The job just got easier for cyber criminals that exploit AI to empower them and launch attacks. Imagine combining AI with cyber attacks!
At last week’s Black Hat USA 2018 conference, IBM researchers presented their newly developed malware “DeepLocker” that is backed up by AI. Weaponized AI seems here to stay.

All you need to know about DeepLocker
Simply put, DeepLocker is a new generation malware which can stealth under the radar and go undetected till its target is reached. It uses an Artificial Intelligence model to identify its target using indicators like facial recognition, geolocation and voice recognition. All of which is easily available on the web these days!
What’s interesting is that the malware can hide its malicious payload in carrier applications- like a video conferencing software, and go undetected by most antivirus and malware scanners until it reaches specific victims. 
Imagine sitting on your computer performing daily tasks. Considering that your profile pictures are available on the internet, your video camera can be manipulated to find a match to your online picture. Once the target (your face) is identified, the malicious payload can be unleashed thanks to your face which serves as a key to unlock the virus. 

This simple  “trigger condition” to unlock the attack is almost impossible to reverse engineer. The malicious payload will only be unlocked if the intended target is reached. It achieves this by using a deep neural network (DNN) AI model.
The simple logic of  “if this, then that” trigger condition used by DeepLocker is transformed into a deep convolutional network of the AI model.

The DeepLocker makes it really difficult for malware analysts to answer the 3 main questions- 

What target is the malware after-  Is it after people’s faces or some other visual clues? 
What specific instance of the target class is the valid trigger condition? 
And what is the ultimate goal of the attack payload?

Now that’s some commendable work done by the IBM researchers. IBM has always strived to make a mark in the field of innovation. DeepLocker comes as no surprise as IBM has the highest number of facial recognition patents granted in 2018.
BlackHat USA 2018 sneak preview
The main aim of the IBM Researchers- Marc Ph. Stoecklin, Jiyong Jang and Dhilung Kirat–  briefing the crowd in the BlackHat USA 2018 conference was,

To raise awareness that AI-powered threats like DeepLocker can be expected very soon
To demonstrate how attackers have the capability to build stealthy malware that can circumvent defenses commonly deployed today and
To provide insights into how to reduce risks and deploy adequate countermeasures.

To demonstrate the efficiency of DeepLocker’s capabilities, they designed and demonstrated a proof of concept. The WannaCry virus was camouflaged in a benign video conferencing application so that it remains undetected by antivirus engines and malware sandboxes. As a triggering condition, an individual was selected, and the AI was trained to launch the malware when certain conditions- including the facial recognition of the target- were met.
The experiment was, undoubtedly, a success.
The DeepLocker is just an experiment by IBM to show how open-source AI tools can be combined with straightforward evasion techniques to build a targeted, evasive and highly effective malware. As the world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, security professionals will now have to up their game to combat hybrid malware attacks.

Holmberg is executive director of the nonprofit Wild Me. The Portland-based organization has developed a digital tool called Wildbook that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to expedite wildlife identification. In tandem with citizen science, Wildbook is able to condense years of human work — like photographing thousands of animals and identifying each by hand — into a matter of weeks.The Portland-based nonprofit Wild Me has developed a tool called Wildbook. It uses artificial intelligence to identify individuals in a species. It can analyze 10,000 photos of zebras to locate a particular individual in two minutes.Courtesy of Wild MeIn research and in daily life, AI is rapidly changing the way things work. With some savvy software engineering, computers can learn to carry out complex, tedious tasks — whether it's detecting cancer cells, operating driverless race cars or analyzing hockey plays. And as Wildbook shows, AI is giving conservation a makeover, too.""It blows human efforts out of the water,"" Holmberg said.For example, in 2016 researchers in Kenya organized a two-day event in which volunteers drove over prescribed regions of the country, taking pictures of all the zebras they could find. The team of over 350 scientists, government officials, park rangers and community members collected more than 40,000 photos in total.""It would be impossible for a research team to take all those photos, let alone analyze them,"" said professor Chuck Stewart, head of the Computer Science department at New York’s Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Instead, citizen scientists were enlisted for data collection and Wildbook’s AI algorithms helped researchers identify every zebra in just a few weeks. The Kenyan government even recognized the results of the study as the country’s official zebra census.For each photo submitted to the system, Wildbook scans the image for signs of wildlife, filtering out background data like trees and brush. Then another algorithm steps in to identify not only the animal’s species but its individual identity.""Rather than just 'this is a humpback whale,' it says 'this is Willy the humpback whale,'"" Stewart explained.A whale shark. Big data and AI allow scientists to rapidly comb through thousands of photos and identify individuals using the skin patterning behind the gills and any scars they might have.Photo by Simon J. Pierce. Image provided courtesy of Wild MeWildbook can do this because many animals have unique markings that distinguish them from other members of their species, “like a bar code,” explained Dan Rubenstein, professor of zoology and program director of environmental studies at Princeton.For zebras, it’s their stripes. With whales, it’s the curvature on the edge of their fins. Soon, researchers hope to identify elephants by the shape of their ears, which flicker before they charge, or even primates, which may be identifiable with facial recognition technology.As for the accuracy of these automated IDs? For some projects, ""it gets it right about 99 percent of the time,"" said Rubenstein, who tests the software in his field work on Kenyan zebra populations. He also provides ecology and biology guidance to the Wildbook team.The population data created with Wildbook’s help can be used for much more than a census. At Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute, professor Scott Baker uses the software to understand humpback whale migrations in the North Pacific. Other researchers have used it to learn about risk mitigation behavior in giraffes.But most importantly, Wildbook is a tool for conservation. By encouraging citizen participation and with the speed of AI-driven data processing, Holmberg hopes to quicken the creation and evaluation of conservation strategies.Related: Can 'Moneyball' Fix How The West Manages Wildfire?THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe arrival of tools like Wildbook comes at time of growing concern for global biodiversity. In March, a United Nations panel released acollection of reportsfinding that plant and animal species in every part of the world were under severe threat. Bysome estimates, as many as 200 species are lost each year. Some have gone so far as to say that we are witnessing Earth’s most devastating extinction event since the end of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago.Researchers are calling for a collaborative effort to protect biodiversity.“From accountants to IT developers and machine learning experts, all of these are desperately needed to elevate wildlife conservation to the 21st century,” said Wild Me software engineer Drew Blount.This includes citizen scientists, as well. For researchers and AI software developers, smartphone cameras represent data-collection game-changers. And a platform like Wildbook can make submitting data easy and accessible.Partnerships with tech giants can offer conservation-minded nonprofits the resources to grow beyond their limited means. The Rainforest Connection, for example, uses Google's Tensorflow technology to monitor the Amazon Rainforest, listening in for signs of illegal chainsaw activity.A similar opportunity materialized for Wildbook this June when Microsoft announced it would back the nonprofit as part of its AI for Earth program. By providing access to more expansive cloud computing and AI resources, the partnership will help make Wildbook more accessible to researchers and citizen scientists.""It’s gonna be huge,"" said Rubenstein.Before AI for Earth, images submitted to Wildbook had to bounce between imaging software and database software, from algorithm to algorithm, as part of the cataloging process. “That’s not an efficient way to digest hundreds of thousands of images,” Rubenstein explained.But Microsoft’s cloud capabilities will allow data to be compartmentalized. Instead of haphazard organization on isolated computers, data will be stored online.In addition to improving data management, the Wild Me team also plans to use AI for Earth’s support to give Wildbook a facelift. An improved user interface will keep users engaged and eager to continue submitting photos.In the future, Holmberg and his colleagues hope that AI and machine learning will continue to ease human researchers from the burden of tedious tasks. One example is the whale shark YouTube scanner, which scours the web for relevant videos of whale shark sightings.Every 24 hours the software finds videos titled or tagged “whale shark,” downloads them, reads the description, and uses machine learning to identify which individual whale shark (if any) appears in the video. The software can even use geolocation information to disregard videos shot in an aquarium and ask real YouTubers for more information by posting a comment.It sounds like the stuff of the future, but the technology is already being deployed. “It’s what we might call an informatics revolution,” said Baker. He and fellow researchers, conservationists, and citizen scientists are hopeful that by making data more accessible and interpretable, Wildbook can help solve — or at least mitigate — the biodiversity crisis.Correction: Aug. 16, 2018.

In the LabOpening the ‘black box,’ Google DeepMind AI system diagnoses eye diseases and shows its work

In eye care, artificial intelligence systems have shown they can match the accuracy of doctors in diagnosing specific diseases. But a new system designed by Google DeepMind and British doctors goes a crucial step further: It can show users how it reached its conclusions.
A study published Monday in Nature Medicine reports that the DeepMind system can identify dozens of diseases and point out the portions of optical coherence tomography scans that it relies upon to make its diagnoses. That’s a crucial factor in validating the safety and efficacy of AI technologies being developed for use in diagnosing or recommending treatments for a broad range of diseases, from cancer to neurological and vision problems.advertisement

The paper states that the system made the right referral recommendation in more than 94 percent of cases based on a review of historic patient scans at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and performed as good as, or better than, top eye specialists who examined the same scans. Experts said that level of accuracy is impressive on such an open-ended query. But the bigger breakthrough is the system’s solution to the so-called “black box” problem of artificial intelligence, which refers to the inability of such systems to explain their thinking.
The opacity of AI systems is an impediment to their adoption by health providers who want the ability to understand their rationale and training, and ensure recommendations are based on science instead of supposition. In cancer care, for example, IBM’s Watson for Oncology has faced criticism for a lack of clarity surrounding the system’s training and the basis of its treatment recommendations.
“Doctors and patients don’t want just a black box answer, they want to know why,” said Ramesh Raskar, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies computational imaging. “There is a standard of care, and if the AI technique doesn’t follow that standard of care, people are going to be uncomfortable with it, even if it’s the smartest thing in the world.”advertisement

The new study, conducted by DeepMind researchers and British eye doctors, is the latest of many to describe an advancement in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. Technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft are all developing products for use in health care. Drug makers are looking to use AI to speed up the development of new treatments, while hospitals are deploying it to improve the efficiency of scheduling and coordination of care, and also want to use it to help doctors diagnose diseases and recommend treatments more accurately and faster.
Startups and individual doctors are also developing AI-based systems; another paper in Nature Medicine on Monday describes a technology tested by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York that uses a deep neural network to identify evidence of acute neurological events such as strokes in CT scans, which could improve outcomes by speeding up diagnosis and treatment.
Much of the recent research and development in AI has focused on eye care, an area where the heavy use of scans — and a shortage of specialists in some regions — makes it ripe for such technology. In April, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first software that can diagnose diabetic retinopathy, a common eye disease that afflicts patients with diabetes. That product, called IDx-DR, can identify the disease without a clinician’s involvement.
In addition to its transparency, the system involved in the DeepMind Health study stands out because it is not focused on a single condition, but can identify 50 different eye diseases based on its review of imaging data. It analyzes three-dimensional scans, making it capable of processing more data than prior AI systems that relied on two-dimensional images. The study authors also demonstrated their system can achieve a high level of accuracy on multiple types of scanning machines with a limited amount of additional training.
The system employs a novel architecture that uses two neural networks — the first network translates raw ocular CT scans into a tissue map, and the second analyzes the map to identify symptoms of eye disease. A user can watch a video showing the portions of the scan it uses to reach its conclusions as well as the confidence levels it assigns to each possible diagnosis.

While the performance of this system is promising, it is not going to be used any time soon in hospitals or eliminate the need for human specialists to review scans. The study authors said the system still needs years of refinement and testing, including a randomized controlled trial, before it could be used in clinical care. Even then, it would still require some degree of human oversight.
“The key thing is that we do prospective studies in multiple different locations before we actually let this loose on patients,” said Dr. Pearse Keane, an ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital and a co-author of the study. “We all think this technology could be transformative, but we also acknowledge that it’s not magic and we have to apply the same level of rigor to it that we would apply to any intervention.”
The level of evidence needed to deploy AI-based diagnostic or treatment advisers remains a matter of debate and varies widely by the type of product and the company selling it.
The approach of DeepMind and Moorfields contrasts with that of IBM and its clinical partner, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center of New York. IBM has aggressively marketed and sold its Watson for Oncology system to hospitals across Asia without publishing prospective studies about its impact on the decision-making of doctors or outcomes of patients. It has done so despite criticism from its own oncologists about the lack of evidence and complaints from clients who have cited examples of biased and inaccurate recommendations.
While AI is still largely experimental in medicine, it offers huge potential for changing the delivery of care. Optical CT is one of the most common imaging procedures in the U.S, with more than 5.35 million scans performed on Medicare beneficiaries in 2014. In some areas, a shortage of specialists is making it more difficult to provide accurate diagnosis and timely care for patients facing vision loss.


“We all think this technology could be transformative, but we also acknowledge that it’s not magic and we have to apply the same level of rigor to it that we would apply to any intervention.”

Dr. Pearse Keane, ophthalmologist and study co-author




In the United Kingdom, the shortage of specialists is more severe than it is in the United States. More than 2 million people are living with sight loss in the U.K., a number that is expected to double by 2050, according to the study. That means some patients with serious conditions end up waiting many weeks, or even months, to get treated.
Keane referenced an experience with a patient who was facing a total loss of sight due to macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss. She sought an urgent medical appointment when she began experiencing problems with her remaining good eye, but had to wait six weeks to see a specialist.  “Clearly there are huge capacity issues that are faced all around the world,” Keane said. “If it was my mother or a family member of mine, I would want them seen within six days, not six weeks.”
The artificial intelligence system used in the study demonstrated potential for reducing the backlog through automation. In the study, it was tasked with diagnosing 50 different conditions and triaging patients using Moorfields’ referral system. Its accuracy was tested on historic optical CT scans of 997 patients whose scans and files were also examined by eight human experts.

On the most urgent referrals, the computer matched the accuracy of the two top retinal specialists and performed better than two other specialists and four optometrists. Across all cases, it had a slightly lower error rate (5.5 percent) than the top two human specialists (6.7 percent and 6.8 percent) when the human experts were limited to a review of the scan results. Several of the specialists nearly matched the computer’s performance when they were able to review patient notes and other supplemental materials, according to the study.
Dr. John Miller, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital who was not involved in the study, said the biggest question facing the system in the study is who will be able to use it — primary care doctors, pharmacists, or specialists.
It could prove useful in all those settings, Miller said, noting that its use at the primary care level could be especially useful by streamlining the referral system to help patients get timely care. “If we can be confident in a system that can identify retinal-specific disease at an early stage, that can prompt an earlier appointment for the patient and potentially save sight,” he said.
Miller added that its use also might save time, money, and worry wasted on incorrect diagnosis — a situation that arises in 10 to 25 percent of the cases he sees at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “I think it’s going to help us see more of the right types of patients, instead of screening some patients without the suggested disease,” he said. “I view it as augmenting my practice, not threatening it.”

Microsoft’s Arabic Toolkit is being discontinued this month (July 2018). Moreover, until recently, even research models using gloVe and word2vec were not easy to obtain. That’s not very helpful. There is generally a lack of available off-the-shelf high quality models for interpreting the Arabic language with artificial intelligence.Google still offers excellent APIs to AI capabilities like neural machine translation, but not the vectors (the AI stuff) used to DO the translation. These language models are important when performing common non-translation text processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, plagiarism detection, and so much more. Moreover, these models are critical for automating enterprise tasks that require natural language understanding as part of a workflow, such as resume processing in Human Resources (HR), document clustering in governmental reports, and document prioritization in financial services. The need for Arabic AI models is quite strong.A very nice starting point for otaining an Arabic word embedding model is AraVec (2017), a model created by Abu Bakr Soliman and his colleagues at the Center for Informatics Science of Nile University, in Giza, Egypt. The following links lead to their article and the related code.bakrianoo/aravecaravec - AraVec is a pre-trained distributed word representation (word embedding) open source project which aims to…github.comAraVec: A set of Arabic Word Embedding Models for use in Arabic NLPAdvancements in neural networks have led to developments in fields like computer vision, speech recognition and natural…www.sciencedirect.comIn the past year or so, some articles on this topic have been published in high quality journals and conferences.

Our solution is to fill that gap. We established a joint venture called Stallion.ai to serve the MENA region with B2B artificial intelligence solutions for enterprise clients.Taking this problem head-on, we decided to design an Arabic word embedding model from scratch. We scraped Wikipedia pages and books from the public domain. That’s 14 GB of text. We have been augmenting this dataset with other large sources of text, to gain additional language context and versatility. Rather than delving into the technological details of the work we have been undertaking, consider the practical business reasons for wanting an AI system that understands Arabic text.One interesting project that highlights the need for more Arabic language support is the NOOR programming language.There is an old legal saying, “He who drafts, wins.” I could not track down the attribution and neither could the books who cite it. The idea of this old quote is that drawing up a contract gives the drafter the ability to set the terms of the contract, and they will do it in their own favor. Similarly, it is essential for a business operating in Arabic to apply AI techniques to their original documents, rather than machine translations of these documents. Operating on the borrowed context from another language simply does not work as well as employing a real embedding model built on text from the same language.In science fiction, and in the press, artificial intelligence is like a universal translator. Even in engineering systems like compilers (e.g. GCC), several high-level languages (e.g. Java, C, C++) can be compiled into one universal middle language (GIMPLE) before being emitted into assembly for one of several processor targets. The structure looks like this:How GCC understands (compiles) many language frontends into a single common representation and then emits code for a target architecture.Having a universal representation of language like GIMPLE is excellent because we can apply common useful optimizations to this intermediate (universal) representation of language. In effect, a universal language allows us to understand meaning rather than think about the idiosyncratic nature of just one language. Unfortunately, machine learning does not represent language like compilers do. Computer code is based on rigorous assumptions about formal language theory that we do not assume in natural language like contracts and text messages. Natural language is full of ambiguity. For example, synonyms are not the same across languages. Code, on the other hand, leaves basically no room for ambiguity. Worse yet, the ambiguity in Arabic is not the same as it is in English. This line of thinking tells us that dedicated per-language models will outperform borrowed across-language models that were not trained on the language we care about. However, the situation is even worse, as we will soon see.We just discussed reasons we want to understand Arabic specifically, rather than learning across languages. Now consider that within arabic text there are variations that we need to consider separately.Firstly, there are dialect issues and slang including emoji, but let’s skip over that, and go to the second issue: style heterogeneity. It is well established that different types of text logs contain different semantic information. For example, the corpus of all text from the newspaper Al Hayat does not give us enough information to understand the tweets by Nancy Ajram. Why? Because formal text and informal text are not the same thing. Machine learning works best when trained on text very similar to the text it will be evaluating.There is even a third problem of context. Word embedding models like Aravec are an excellent first step to support at least SOMETHING in Arabic. The next step must be to encode context-specific business terminology and phrases into these models. These are typically out-of-dictionary terms that the off-the-shelf models were not trained on, or existing words that mean something different. Sometimes these words are English or named entities used inside Arabic documents (e.g. “كابل RS232 إلى واجهة RJ45”). Within dictionary words often still need adjusting. For example, the word collision means accident on the road to a road engineer, but a database key problem to a database engineer. These contexts need to be used to adjust the AI solution, and ofen the words involved are not even in the AI model before this adjustment takes place. On a project by project basis these custom modifications are achieved using our word embedding augmentation technology.To summarize the problems we are addressing at Stallion.ai: Businesses that process Arabic language documents needs customized AI solutions that the market has ignored for far too long. We have seen new projects arise as others shut down. We have identified gaps in the market, including the following shortcomings in existing models: dialect support, understanding slang, understanding technical context and out-of-dictionary words, and understanding various kinds of text. We are exploring both industrial and academic opportunities to study and apply this technology.Are you looking for AI help in the MENA region?

There’s a lot of hype around artificial intelligence so I thought I’d write this post for individuals who are out of this domain or for those interested in knowing about deep learning.When I first started, I pictured this when people said neural networks:This analogy is accurate. A single neuron will take the output of several neurons in the form of nervous impulses and will decide to fire if it meets a certain threshold.I personally like to think of it as a system of connected water pipes with knobs. The knobs determine how much water will come out of the joined ends. If all the knobs are at the perfect setting, the optimal water will flow out of the system.Now let’s work with an example. Here’s a basic graph that models the acceptance at an university:We use the diagonal line to determine if we got accepted to the university or not. Imagine you got a grade of 4 and you had written 10 tests [coordinates (10,4)]. According to this graph, we’d still be accepted to the university since we’re on the green side. Awesome right?In reality, that would be a low score and would probably result in being declined from the university. This tells us that our line isn’t placed at the best spot or angle. Is a single line even a good option? Maybe, but we can do better here.What other shapes can we draw to perfectly separate our data?How about this?This wouldn’t really be accurate. Plus a circle isn’t a function (2 values of y map to a single x). How do we even optimize its size?Let’s try having two lines intersecting and maybe we can use some math to make them positioned in the best way (don’t worry about the math yet).Trending AI Articles:1. Machines Demonstrate Self-Awareness2. Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for Kids3. Part-of-Speech tagging tutorial with the Keras Deep Learning library4. AI & NLP WorkshopNow our data looks more separated. As a student, I can now check if I will be accepted. I can ask myself 3 questions when plotting myself onto this map.Is the point above the horizontal line?Is the point on the right side of the vertical line?Is the answer to question 1 AND 2 a YES?Here’s how it would visually look like:Now, if we look at each question independently, we can model it with a neural network like this:In the image above, you’ll see the AND operation at the end. An AND operation is something we use in the logic world to calculate if two values are both YES. It’ll output a YES only if all values coming in as an input are both a YES. If one or both values are a NO, the AND operation will output a NO.A simplified depiction of the image above is:Notice that we represented the AND operation as a graph.Now we’ve successfully represented our first neural network. There are 3 layers in our network:The input layer — our inputs TEST and GRADE.The hidden layer — our plotting on the graph.The output layer — where the AND operation does its job and outputs a YES or NO.Here’s a simple depiction of our network:This is the simplest version of a neural network. Each node is typically called a neuron or a perceptron. In deep learning, we can have several hidden layers.Here’s a slightly more complex network with 3 inputs (features) and 4 neurons in the hidden layer.Unfortunately, the data in the real world is multidimensional. In our example, we were working with 2 dimensions, the GRADE and TEST. What if we had a 100-dimension input and 4 hidden layers with 100 neurons in each layer? You can start to imagine that our network would start to look very complex.Isn’t it crazy how with a large dataset, a lot of computing power, and a large neural network, we can teach computers to drive cars, understand language and play games?Now things start to get a little more complex:How do you determine which input is more important than the others?How will the neural network pick up on that?In my next post, I’ll breakdown how to make these neural networks learn. These include concepts such as weights, gradient descent and backpropagation. There are also various families of neural networks such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). They can be used for computer vision and natural language processing, respectively. They can also be combined to do very crazy stuff! I will also be covering them in future posts :)If you’re curious, this is what part of a CNN and RNN architecture may look like:Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for Image RecognitionRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) Structure used for SequencesUse-Cases of Architectures & Areas to Hype you up:CNN: Detecting tumors in medical images with higher accuracy than a trained professional.RNN: Making a bot write new chapters of Game of Thrones.Generative Adversarial Network (GANs): Generating new Pokemon using an existing dataset of Pokemon.Deep Reinforcement Learning: Teaching a robot to do surgery or learning to drive from scratch.Autoencoders: Compression, De-noising, Dimensionality ReductionThanks for reading!References:All credits to picture of graphs and neural networks go to Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/)CNN Tesla architecture: http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/RNN architecture: http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/",2018-08-20T13:37:52.641Z,Deep Learning — An ELI5 Intro to Neural Networks - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-08-16T11:05:56.297Z,,,,,,,,,,,['Hammad Asad'],,,,,,,baf7b02c1ae5,,,

China has the world’s largest internet audience but has frustrated American tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including Facebook and Instagram.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is also the latest example of how Google’s outspoken work force has agitated for changes to strategy. In April, the internet company’s employees spoke out against its involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to improve weaponry. By June, Google had said it would not renew a contract with the Pentagon for A.I. work.Google’s interest in bringing search back to China came to the forefront earlier this month, when reports surfaced that the company was working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing. The project, known internally as Dragonfly, was developed largely in secret, prompting outrage among employees who worried they had been unwittingly working on technology that would help China withhold information from its citizens.“We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we’re building,” the letter said.The letter also called on Google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company’s products, to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects. The document referred to the situation as a code yellow, a process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle declined to comment on the letter. It has said in the past that it will not comment on Dragonfly or “speculation about future plans.”Late on Thursday, employees pressed Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and other management about Dragonfly at a weekly staff meeting. As of late Wednesday, one of the top questions on an internal software system called Dory, which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting, asked whether Google had lost its ethical compass, said people who had reviewed the questions. Other questions on Dory asked directly about the Dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the Chinese government, such as air pollution data.“If we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China,” Mr. Pichai said in the staff meeting, audio of which was obtained by The Times. “That said, we are not close to launching a search product in China.”Mr. Pichai and Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, stopped answering questions about Dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on Twitter.ImageGoogle has maintained a significant presence in China even though its flagship services are not accessible in the country.Credit...Aly Song/ReutersThis week’s staff meeting was the first opportunity for Google’s work force to ask executives about Dragonfly, because the meeting was not held last week. The absence of a gathering — the result of a regularly scheduled break in the summer, according to a company spokesman, Rob Shilkin — led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over Google’s government work.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies, inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate.The internal dissent over Dragonfly comes on the heels of the employee protests over Google’s involvement in the Pentagon project to use artificial intelligence. After Google said it would not renew its contract with the Pentagon, it unveiled a series of ethical principles governing its use of A.I.

The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.Learn more about our process.In those principles, Google publicly committed to use A.I. only in “socially beneficial” ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law. Some employees have raised concerns that helping China suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles.In 2010, Google said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company’s corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack, combined with government censorship, propelled Google to pull its search engine from the country.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe exit from China was a seminal moment for the company — a symbol of its uncompromising idealism captured by Google’s unofficial motto of “Don’t Be Evil.” At the time, Chinese internet users marked the loss of Google’s search engine by laying flowers at the company’s Beijing offices in what became known as an “illegal flower tribute.” A possible re-entry to China, according to current and former employees, is a sign of a more mature and pragmatic company.Letter From Google EmployeesHundreds of employees at the tech company urged their leadership to be more transparent about its ethics and its use of artificial intelligence.

Google has maintained a significant presence in China even though its flagship services are not accessible in the country. Last year, Google announced plans for a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And it has introduced translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China.Google’s work on Dragonfly is not a guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to China. The government would have to approve its return and it has kept American technology firms like Facebook at arm’s length, opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths.Some employees are in favor of re-entering China, arguing that exiting the country in protest of censorship has done little to pressure Beijing to change its position while it has made Google nonessential among the world’s largest base of internet users.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhen Google pulled out of China in 2010, Mr. Brin said it objected to the country’s “totalitarian” policies when it came to censorship, political speech and internet communications. If anything, China has only tightened its controls in the last eight years — leaving the company in a bind for how to justify its return.“You can never satisfy a censor, particularly the ones in China,” said Charles Mok, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory’s democratic camp.Google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in China, Mr. Mok said, but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted a censored search product in China.“Then the Chinese government can say, ‘Google is O.K. with it, too,’” he said.

Keeping ethics in artificial intelligence

As artificial intelligence (AI) develops and its uses continue to grow, there’s still a discussion to be had around how to use AI in a trustworthy and ethical way.
Businesses need to lead the process, creating an honest, global conversation about the benefits of AI not only for the industry but also governments and society at large, a Sage Group report on building a competitive yet ethical AI economy has concluded.
“The next challenge will be to move the global conversation away from AI as a threat, or replacement for humans, and towards encouraging businesses to approach AI as a complement to human ingenuity,” the report states.
According to the study that Sage conducted with a group of international business executives and U.K.-based government officials, the key is for industry leaders, businesses and C-suite executives to define ethical principles that will guide AI development.
This discussion comes at a time when the global AI market is hitting its stride, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reports industries are aggressively investing in AI and cognitive systems, and that worldwide spending on these systems will increase by 54 per cent from 2017, reaching $19.1 billion this year.
An example that brings to mind a robot future like that of I, Robot or the Terminator movies, is a report from the Fast Company about an AI-powered “psychopath” named Norman, which was created as an experiment to teach people how AI systems can be as good or bad as the people and the data sets that make them. Fast Company’s article states that “bias can be baked in very easily, and very unintentionally.”
Another example is the ProPublica investigation from 2016 that found the AI systems being used by U.S. judges to help predict the likelihood of criminals to re-offend were biased against African Americans.
Consumers will hold companies responsible for how AI is used and operated, states Sage, and that accountability will lie with C-suite executives; the key is to stay ahead and create ethical practices and tests that go beyond just the creation of technology but also continually evaluate risks and biases in AI machinery.
The British company’s report states that there is a need for businesses and governments to work together to help create a future where interactions with technology are positive and actually help people and improve work, all framed in an environment of understanding and trust. Implementing an ethical framework for your company is a great place to start, a way to create building blocks for the future of AI technology, it finds.
And the Canadian government is starting to recognize that need to address these issues and implement plans in order to keep up with the ever-changing world of AI.
The federal government, as IT World Canada has previously reported, has provided funding to groups such as the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institution in order to help develop a pan-Canadian AI strategy.
The chief intelligence officer (CIO) of the Government of Canada, Alex Benay, has also been a leader in the conversation around the need for ethical AI practices, and argues that the government is currently lacking much-needed regulation.
https://twitter.com/AlexBenay/status/983869169438416901
Benay is also the co-founder of the CIO Strategy Council, a not-for-profit that brings together public and private sector CIOs to discuss digital issues and help set industry standards. In a recent release the Council called itself an emerging leader “committed to spearheading the development of the first-ever globally-recognized standards for the ethical use of both AI and big data.”
The Sage report offers its own idea of what a framework for building ethical AI practices for business and governments would look like. It suggests creating a government framework, ensuring that AI is held accountable, building trust through transparency, and empowering the workforce.
Sage’s framework for ethical AI Source: Sage Group
When it comes to the economy and using these types of technology, the Sage report argues that achieving ethical AI is core to having successful business models and decision making, and that offering education both internally and to society as a whole is necessary. 
“People need to understand how AI works, why it provides the best solution in a given context and why they should welcome assistance from an AI powered platform,” states the report.
Scenarios like the U.S. courts and “Norman” AI that can damage the public’s trust of AI are exactly what parties like Sage, Benay, and CIO Strategy Council are trying to fight by promoting a proactive approach led by leaders in the industry, with support from governments.

One of the problems military veterans have long faced is matching their skills learned in the armed forces to the needs of civilian employers, an issue Congress continues to grapple with in the fiscal 2019 spending bills.Many military jobs translate perfectly into the civilian sector — repairing an Abrams tank is much like repairing any heavy piece of machinery, for example — but many combat and leadership skills do not, on the surface, directly transfer.The Department of Veterans Affairs’ Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program is at the forefront of helping veterans find the right job after military service. The program’s counselors help assess capabilities of veterans and help men and women veterans find the right job.But the VR&E program, as it is known, is often short of counselors and funding. Federal law requires that there be one counselor for every 125 veterans seeking full-time work. But the program never quite reaches that ratio.VR&E would have to have added 266 new full-time counselors to meet that requirement, but the Veterans Benefits Administration only added 61 full-time workers for 2018, and slashed the budget for estimated overtime for counselors from nearly a million dollars to $500,000 through 2019, leaving more veterans unassisted, according to the American Legion.But now a startup company that uses artificial intelligence may be able to make up some of this gap in matching veterans to the right civilian jobs.SkillMil, a San Francisco-based startup, was founded by a former Navy submarine commander, Noel Gonzalez in 2016, during his time at the Stanford Research Institute. Gonzalez’s company has designed software, driven by artificial intelligence algorithms, that translates the byzantine array of military job codes into an assessment relevant to civilian employers.And then SkillMil seeks to link veterans to civilian jobs that will fit their skills.The software is still in the stage of testing and fixing bugs, but SkillMil has already retained six companies with more than 2500 veterans waiting for help, Gonzalez said.Last year, using SkillMil’s beta version of the software, the company matched 40 percent of a test group to jobs, with an 80 percent satisfaction rate, and lower job turnover than usual, Gonzalez said.Normally, during the first 18 months after veterans leave the military, they have high job turnover and go through three or four companies before they find the right fit and stable employment, Gonzalez said. He traces that to the VA’s dependence on counselors and the relative inaccuracy of human matching.This was a subject that Michael Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, talked about at an artificial intelligence summit recently in Washington. Kratsios acknowledged that artificial intelligence raises fears of job losses as machines take over the more routine kinds of work that humans now do.But, he said, artificial intelligence “is not only about displacing workforce, but also about ensuring the right pipeline for more skilled workers, including the matching and training of veterans’ skill sets,” Kratsios said.
Congress takes a look 
Congress has long been interested in new ways to get veterans into full-time stable employment. In the Senate’s version of the 2019 appropriations bill, senators call for the Energy secretary, in consultation with the Defense secretary, to determine which military bases should partner with community colleges, universities and the private sector “to train veterans and members of the Armed Forces transitioning to civilian life to enter the cybersecurity, energy, and artificial intelligence workforces.”Gonzalez said that his experience so far with SkillMil shows that veterans can be placed, not in minimum wage jobs, but in good paying jobs in modern economic sectors such as cybersecurity, supply-chain logistics, aviation, and energy.Artificial intelligence should be able to show the way to more automatic profiling and matching of veterans to appropriate jobs, Gonzalez says.SkillMil has started working with Amazon.com on its Delivery Service Partner program, which encourages veteran entrepreneurs to launch their own truck delivery companies, comprised of between 20 to 40 vans, to help streamline the flow of Amazon’s deliveries in what the company call’s its critical last mile — before it reaches a customer’s doorstep.“The ultimate goal of the partnership is to make sure SkillMil becomes the de facto veteran’s job matching with Amazon,” Gonzalez said. Amazon has set up a $1 million fund to help veterans with startup costs of these local delivery services.Joe Sharpe, the veteran’s employment director at the American Legion, said big tech companies, such as Amazon, are increasingly using targeted employment programs aimed at military veterans.The most recent Department of Labor statistics show that the unemployment rate for calendar year 2017 for veterans serving in the military since September 2001, stood at 4.5 percent, and was slightly higher than the overall national unemployment rate for 2017 of 3.9 percent. Also Watch:Trump Praises McSally, Criticizes the Media at NDAA Signing Event[jwp-video n=”1″]

Members from across the country were in Halifax on August 15, 2018, to attend the Automation, New Technology and the Future of Work conference. As the world of work changes rapidly, new technologies are more frequently introduced in the workplace. Conference delegates came together to discuss, learn and develop a strategy for the future of work that puts workers first. “In a system where profits and productivity are paramount, there will always be a desire for corporations to invest in labour-saving technology,” said Jerry Dias National President. “The Future of Work conference brought members together to craft bargaining and political action strategies to deal with automation, artificial intelligence, and the growth of the digital economy.” Angelo Dicaro, acting Unifor Research Director, kicked off the conference with a presentation on the union's  newly minted research paper The Future of Work is Ours: Confronting risks and seizing opportunities.  The research paper makes it clear that automation, artificial intelligence and other forms of new technology are here to stay and will continue to create challenges that workers will face in workplaces and industries around the world.  The  research paper also discusses possible solutions and strategies to  confront technological changes at work. After the introduction to current issues with automation and technology, participants broke into smaller groups organized by sectors so that tangible, specific strategies and ideas could be developed for workplaces and bargaining. During the report back led by facilitators, certain themes emerged. It was noted that there was significant anxiety in most sectors about job security, but there was also a degree of optimism, especially among skilled trades members. The latter sentiment helped focus the discussion on the fight-back: the role of unions in forcing technological change in order to make work safer and  create new jobs. Collective bargaining was identified as a key tool for worker power in both protecting jobs at individual worksites, but also at leveraging transition for workers into new roles. Regionally and nationally, it was emphasized that Unifor must push for an even stronger social safety net that includes employer or government-sponsored training. Participants discussed the potential that green technology holds for green jobs, and resisting the green-washing (especially in the hospitality industry) that merely reduces work hours. The conference’s final session hosted a panel of experts to offer additional analysis and provide several public policy and tax changes that could protect good jobs and help Canada stay competitive into the future. Guests Sunil Johal, Policy Director, Mowat Centre and Christine Saulnier, Director, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives – Nova Scotia had a wide-ranging conversation about areas where Canada’s skilled workforce and value-added is a strength and not a disadvantage. In the evening delegates were treated to a live viewing of the hit CBC Radio show “the debaters” where comics went toe to toe in a battle of laughs debating if work should be replaced by robots. The conference is the first of many steps in Unifor’s development of a long-term plan to put workers’ interests on the forefront of technological changes in our workplaces.

But a limited pool of talent has allowed viable candidates who smell the desperation to put a high price on their skills. The number of job postings featuring “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” in their description has doubled since 2015, according to global jobs site Indeed.com, and prospective employees are increasingly seeking them out. Search entries for AI and machine learning positions have risen 182 percent in the past three years. But more job searches don’t mean more qualified applicants, as industries struggle to find sufficiently skilled candidates.Meanwhile, the lucrative salaries being offered on public platforms such as Indeed.com may pale in comparison with bigger-money AI jobs filled directly or via head-hunters—jobs which can come with huge bonuses and stock options.Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

One Hour Translation CEO Ofer Shoshan told me that within one to three years, neural machine technology (NMT) translators will carry out more than 50% of the work handled by the $40 billion market.
PROMOTED
His words stand in stark contrast to the often-repeated maxim that, in the near future at least, artificial intelligence will primarily augment, rather than replace, human professionals.
Shoshan told me that the quality of machine translation has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, to the point where half a million human translators and 21,000 agencies could soon find themselves out of work.
He says, ""The analogy that we can use is Kodak and digital photography - Kodak didn't see it coming … and before that, Corona typewriters and word processors
""Two years ago, translation technology would produce something that at best would let you get a general understanding of what the text was about – but in most cases, a professional translator would tell you they would rather just translate from scratch because they couldn't understand a lot of the output.
“Today with neural machines, for a growing amount of material and categories, they only need to make a very small number of changes to what a machine outputs, in order to get a human-quality translation.”

Quantifying this, Shoshan tells me that today on average 10% of a machine-translated document needs to be fine-tuned by humans to meet the standards expected by his company's Fortune 500 clients. Just two years ago, that figure was around 80%.
This has been made possible by the switch to neural machine translation – sometimes known as deep learning – adopted by the most advanced machine translation tools. Previously these relied on a method known as statistical translation. Google, Bing, and Amazon now all use NMT in their translation engines.
Training a neural machine to translate between languages requires nothing more than feeding a large quantity of material, in whichever languages you want to translate between, into the neural net algorithms.
To adapt to this rapid transformation, One Hour Translation has developed tools and services designed to distinguish between the different translation services available, and pick the best one for any particular translation task.
""For example, for travel and tourism, one service could be great at translating from German to English, but not so good at Japanese. Another could be great at French but poor at German. So we built an index to help the industry and our customers. We can say, in real time, which is the best engine to use, for any type of material, in any language.""
This work – comparing the quality of the output of NMT generated translation, gives a clue as to how human translators could see their jobs transforming in coming years. Humans rate the output of each engine and compile the index. In the case of One Hour Translation's index, this is done once per quarter, to reflect the speed at which NMT is evolving, and new players are emerging onto the market.
If that sounds like a silver lining, however, then things may not be quite that straightforward. The level of training and expertise required to rate machine translations, or to translate while “augmented” by a machine, is far lower than for traditional, “from scratch” translation.
“You need someone smart, with good language skills – but they don’t need to be a professional, traditionally-trained translator, because fixing one word here or there is much easier,” says Shoshan.
So, as was the case during the first industrial revolution, are we likely to see gangs of translators rioting in the streets and smashing up the intelligent machines which are threatening their livelihoods?
""I hope not,"" Shoshan says. ""But actually, it is an issue, just like autonomous trucking will be an issue for the four million or so truck drivers employed in the US.
""And importantly, we're not talking about five to ten years; we're talking one to three years.
“It’s obvious that if machines can do what you can do, then you have a problem. A lot of translators and agencies will tell you that there are certain highly specialized translation services which will require a human touch for the foreseeable future – and that may be true.
“But for the bulk – I would estimate 80% - of the material that corporate customers pay to have translated on the market today, it will be machine translatable in the next one to three years.”
Some advice for translators wanting to keep their heads above water could include specializing in languages which are less widely spoken. NMT services rely on huge bodies of literature being available, to train the algorithms – and for languages with a smaller user base, that quantity of material may not be readily available, particularly in specialist, technical or scientific subjects.
Another, as is the case with One Hour Translation, could be to get used to working alongside machines. While they will do the bulk of the work, there will be a need for people able to assess different translation technology and apply the correct tools for specific jobs.
One thing seems certain, however - hiding your head in the sand and pretending that none of this is happening is a recipe for unemployment.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",2018-08-28T16:51:14-04:00,Will Machine Learning AI Make Human Translators An Endangered Species?,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“From diagnosing cancer and understanding climate change to delivering risky and consuming jobs, AI is already showing its potential for good,” says Mariarosaria Taddeo, deputy director of the Digital Ethics Lab at Oxford University and one of the authors of the commentary. “The question is how can harness this potential?”
One example of the potential is the AI from Google's DeepMind, which made correct diagnoses 94.5 per cent of the time in a trial with Moorfields Eye Hospital, looking at 50 common eye problems. Another is helping us understand how the brain works.
The potential for AI to do good is immense, says Taddeo. Technology using artificial intelligence will have the capability to tackle issues “from environmental disasters to financial crises, from crime, terrorism and war, to famine, poverty, ignorance, inequality, and appalling living standards,” she says.
For example, AI has already been used to sift through hundreds of bird sounds to estimate when songbirds arrived at their Arctic breeding grounds. This kind of analysis will allow researchers to understand how migratory animals are responding to climate change. Another way we are learning about climate change is through images of coral. An AI trained by looking at hundreds of pictures of coral helped researchers to discover a new species this year, and the technique will be used to analyse coral's resistance to ocean warming.
Yet AI is not without its problems. In order to ensure it can do good, we first have to understand the risks.
The potential problems that come with artificial intelligence include a lack of transparency about what goes into the algorithms. For example, an autonomous vehicle developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia went on the roads in 2016, without anyone knowing how it made its driving decisions.
There is also a question over who is responsible if they make a mistake. Take the example of an autonomous car that's about to be involved in a crash. The car could be programmed to act in the safest way for the passenger, or it could be programmed to protect the people in the other vehicle. Whether or not the manufacturer or the owner makes that decision, who is responsible for the fate of people involved in the car crash? Earlier this year, a team of scientists designed a way to put the decision in the hands of the human passenger. The 'ethical knob' would switch a car’s setting from “full altruist” to “full egoist”, with the middle setting being impartial.
Another issue is the potential for AI to unfairly discriminate. One example of this, says Tadeo, was Compas, a risk-assessment tool developed by a privately held company and used by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. According to Taddeo, the system was used to decide whether to grant people parole and ended up discriminating against African-American and Hispanic men. When a team of journalists studied 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, it turned out the system predicted that black defendants pose a higher risk of recidivism than actually do in the real world, while predicting the opposite for white defendants.

Meanwhile, there is the issue of big data collection. AI is being used to track whole cities in China, drawing on data collected from various sources. For AI to progress, the amount of data needed for it to be successful is only going to increase. This means there will be increasing chances for people's data to be collected, stored and manipulated without their consent, or even their knowledge.
But Taddeo says national and supranational laws and regulations, such as GDPR, will be crucial to establish boundaries and enforce principles. Yet ultimately, AI is going to be created globally and used around the world, potentially also in space, for example when hunting for exoplanets. So the ways we regulate it cannot be specific to boundaries on Earth.
There should be no universal regulator of artificial intelligence, she says. “AI will be implemented across a wide range of fields, from infrastructure-building and national defence to education, sport, and entertainment” she says. So, a one-size-fits-all approach would not work. “We need to consider culturally-dependent and domain-dependent differences.” For example, in one culture it may be deemed acceptable to take a photograph of a person, but another culture may not allow photographs to be taken for religious reasons.
There are a few initiatives already working on understanding AI technology and its foreseeable impact. These include AI4People, the first global forum in Europe on the social impact of AI, the EU’s strategy for AI and the EU Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence. The EU declaration was signed earlier this year, and those involved pledged to work together on both AI ethics and using AI for good purposes, including modernising Europe's education and training systems.
Other initiatives include the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, which both of the Science editorial's authors are members of. ""We designed the Partnership on AI, in part, so that we can invest more attention and effort on harnessing AI to contribute to solutions for some of humanity’s most challenging problems, including making advances in health and wellbeing, transportation, education, and the sciences"" say Eric Horvitz and Mustafa Suleyman, the Partnership on AI's founding co-chairs.
These are in their early stages, but more initiatives like this need to be created so an informed debate can be had, says Taddeo. The most important thing is we keep talking about it. ""The debate on the governance of AI needs to involve scientists, academics, engineers, lawyers, policy-makers, politicians, civil society and business representatives"" says Taddeo. ""We need to understand  the nature of post-AI societies and the values that should underpin the design, regulation, and use of AI in these societies.""
After all, we are only humans. So the risk remains that we may misuse or underuse AI.
“In this respect, AI is not different from electricity or steam engines” says Taddeo. “It is our responsibility to steer the use of AI in such a way to foster human flourishing and well-being and mitigate the risks that this technology brings about.”

There is no question that automation is changing the nature of work. But are the robots really coming for your job?
One of the most popular narratives is that low-paying jobs are doomed, while college-educated professions will remain largely untouched. Analysts often focus on wages and education as the primary predictors of job evolution, along with organizations’ potential to increase efficiency and reduce costs by changing or cutting jobs. But our research points to a more nuanced explanation.
A review of the academic literature and public discourse on automation revealed limited consideration of risks by profession. So we did our own comparison, coding 50 professions (including many from our literature survey) according to the type of value jobholders delivered and the skills they used to deliver it, to create a framework that helps workers assess what kind of threat automation poses for them. We identified four paths of evolution — jobs will be disrupted, displaced, deconstructed, or durable — and found that value is more predictive of change than wages, education, efficiency, cost, or other factors.
Counter to popular belief, it’s not necessarily blue-collar or non-college-educated workers who will be most threatened by automation in the coming decades. Our analysis suggests that a plumber may see less disruption than a legal professional. Simply instructing everyone to engage in continuous education and skill development is remiss. Workers must understand the four paths of job evolution — and the factors behind each path — if they hope to adapt.
Understanding the Four Paths
A jobholder uses a core set of skills to deliver value in some form to a recipient — either externally to a customer or within an organization. Jobs evolve as those consumers’ perceptions of value fluctuate along two dimensions: core skills and delivery mechanism, or what we call value form.
For some jobs, core skill sets include a specific knowledge base or craft. Others involve people skills and the ability to build relationships rather than technical expertise. Skills that can easily be standardized, codified, or routinized are most likely to be automated. Those that involve hands-on or real-time problem-solving are less so, because developing tools sophisticated enough to handle such ambiguity is either too cost- and labor-intensive or technologically out of reach. For example, while an electrician’s skills may seem vulnerable to automation, the application of those skills varies widely according to the unique circumstances of every client. This degree of customization would be difficult to automate.
A skill set provides value only when it is delivered to a recipient, however, and the delivery mechanism may be transformed. Here’s an example: A professor’s core skill set is expertise in a certain domain. Such expertise has traditionally been delivered to consumers (students) through in-person classes. However, online platforms and massive open online courses, or MOOCs, offer new vehicles through which learning can occur. The core skill remains the same, but technology is shifting the value form as adaptive software and virtual tutors offer highly personalized instruction and support to growing numbers of students with diverse needs. And computer-directed learning will continue to improve with the increasing sophistication of automation and AI.
We identified the four ways automation will affect jobs by separately assessing the degree of threat to each profession’s core skill set and value form. (See “Which Professions Are Most Vulnerable to Automation?”) Here, we’ll describe those paths to evolution and suggest strategies for navigating each one.

Which Professions Are Most Vulnerable to Automation?
Threats should be assessed along two dimensions: How replaceable are the core skill sets? And how much of a shift is there in the way value is delivered?




Disruption. Disruption occurs when the skills in a job are highly standardized yet the consumer prefers to receive value in the same form. It typically follows a reduction in the production costs of goods or services due to increased efficiency. For example, fast-food workers’ core skill sets are highly threatened by the implementation of self-ordering stations and apps where customers place their own orders. Food preparation in this setting is also highly standardized and may eventually be automated as well, disrupting workers in both checkout stations and kitchens. Although these workers’ skills are threatened, the consumer will continue to receive the same value form — fast food prepared consistently and quickly.
Some highly skilled professionals, such as real-estate agents and legal professionals, are experiencing similar disruption from house-hawking robots and the automation of document reviews and other routine legal tasks (although the more nuanced work of advising clients and negotiating in court requires human lawyers, at least for now). Accountants — another example — are seeing the automation of company ledgers and other types of financial data. Value form is not threatened because consumers still need access to their financials, but the skills used to generate those financials are vulnerable.









Finding transitional roles in which human involvement remains necessary is one adaptive solution. As large-scale automation continues to spread, consumers will have to learn to interact with nonhuman providers and adopt new routines. Disrupted workers can function as a bridge, ensuring that value is delivered to end users in its current form as processes are automated. For example, bricklaying robots are much faster and possess more stamina than their human counterparts. But for now, human bricklayers are necessary to complement and safeguard the robots’ abilities, read blueprints, and do corners.
Displacement. With displacement, the core skills of a job are deemed obsolete and the value form is irreversibly altered. Toll takers and telephone operators have already experienced displacement, but even highly skilled professions are not immune. Take pharmacists. They fill prescriptions, deliver them to consumers, and answer questions at brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Yet as more prescriptions are filled online and delivered through the mail, the value form and core skills of human pharmacists are increasingly fulfilled by automated processes. Other jobs facing displacement include librarians (for similar reasons) and software developers (because the skill of writing code is easily standardized, and thus value form has shifted away from in-house development to open platforms such as the cloud).
Retraining is often recommended for displaced workers, but that doesn’t always mean more formal education. They should focus on quickly acquiring the most relevant skills in an area with a relatively stable value form. In a volatile job market, lengthy programs that require years to complete (such as extra bachelor’s degrees) are likely not the best approach. Micro-credentialing programs — competency-based certifications, mini-degrees, and digital badges — deliver qualifications more quickly and offer more options on the path to a degree along with a sense of accomplishment as individuals obtain marketable skills fast. We suggest targeting high-growth sectors that need workers. A timely example is cybersecurity — a rapidly growing field where trained workers (who can qualify through certificate programs) are in demand.
Deconstruction. In the case of deconstruction, the core skill set remains safe, but the value form is threatened. Take, for example, taxi or limo drivers, or anyone who operates a car service. Livery drivers’ skills are central to the value delivered to customers — getting from point A to point B safely and efficiently. While those skills may be threatened by driverless automobiles at some point, human drivers will likely be a necessity in the near term. Yet the value form has already shifted. Traditionally, the value of livery transportation was offered as part of a centralized fleet — drivers were employed by a handful of taxi management companies within a city. Now, the same value is being delivered by Uber, Lyft, and others in the decentralized sharing economy. Photographers and professors are facing similar deconstruction. Their skills remain important, but consumer delivery preferences are changing.

When facing deconstruction, adapt your skills to new value forms. While this sounds easy enough, the biggest impediment is resistance to change. It is well-documented, for example, that many faculty resist online education as a new model for sharing knowledge and expertise with students. Livery drivers would be wise to adjust to evolving transportation norms instead of following these professors’ lead. When a new value form becomes central to consumers’ expectations, you have a choice: acclimate or fade into obsolescence.
Durability. Often lost in workforce analyses is the fact that many jobs will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future, including some lower-wage jobs. We refer to jobs as durable when neither the core skill set nor the value form is under significant threat. Electricians and plumbers are highly durable professions because the work is rarely routine and the cost to develop a technology that could deliver value in the same form — hands-on problem-solving — is excessive. Another example is the physician assistant. The skills associated with this job — medical training, insurance industry insight, bedside manner — will likely become more important as broader technological advancements require fewer doctors to treat more patients. Doing much the same work for less money, physician assistants may just disrupt the role of doctors.
The key for people in durable jobs is to avoid complacency by keeping an eye on tomorrow. Consider whether consumers’ future preferences are more likely to threaten your profession’s core skill set or its value form. Be aware that any job (including those discussed here) could drift from one evolution path to another over time. Thus, the framework we’ve described is a tool to be consulted regularly, even if your job is durable now.
It’s difficult to tell which jobs will be disrupted, displaced, deconstructed, or durable further down the road, but we believe that the basic framework presented here will hold up to changing times. While others have acknowledged that automation will affect jobs in different ways, our focus on jobs as a function of value creation offers an explanation of the underlying dimensions at play. Understanding core skills and value form as the key units of analysis will help jobholders of all types respond to workforce changes currently underway — and tackle those that are impossible to predict.

DataNews 15 millions jobs in Britain at stake with Artificial Intelligence robots set to replace humans at workforce

By Natasha Mathur -   August 23, 2018 - 7:00 am 4863 0 










2 min readEarlier this week, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, gave a warning that the UK needs a skills revolution as up to 15 million jobs in Britain are at stake. This is apparently due to a “third machine age” where Artificial Intelligence is making a huge number of jobs that were previously the preserve of humans outdated.
Haldane says that this potential “Fourth Industrial Revolution” could cause disruptions on a “much greater scale” than the damage experienced during the first three Industrial Revolutions. This is because the first three industrial revolutions were mainly about machines replacing humans doing manual tasks.  But, the fourth Industrial revolution will be different. As Haldane told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, “the 20th-century machines have substituted not just for manual human tasks, but cognitive ones too — human skills machines could reproduce, at lower cost, has both widened and deepened”.
With robots becoming more intelligent, there will be deeper degrees of hollowing-out of jobs in this revolution than in the past. The Bank of England has classified jobs into three categories –jobs with a high (greater than 66%), medium (33-66%) and low (less than 33%) chances of automation. Administrative, clerical and production jobs are at the highest risk of getting replaced by Robots. Whereas, jobs focussing on human interaction, face-to-face conversation, and negotiation are less likely to suffer.

Probability of automation by occupation
This “hollowing out” poses risk not only for low-paid jobs but will also affect the mid-level jobs.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Artificial Intelligence Council Chair, Tabitha Goldstaub, mentioned that the “challenge will be ensuring that people are prepared for the cultural and economic shifts” with focus on creating “the new jobs of the future” in order to avoid mass replacement by robots.
Haldane echoed Goldstaub’s sentiments and told the BBC that “we will need even greater numbers of new jobs to be created in the future if we are not to suffer this longer-term feature called technological unemployment”.
Every cloud has a silver lining
Although the automation of these tasks can lead to mass unemployment, Goldstaub is positive. She says “there are great opportunities ahead as well as significant challenges”. Challenge being bracing the UK workforce for the coming change.
Whereas, the silver lining, according to Goldstaub is that “there is a hopeful view — that a lot of these jobs (existing) are boring, mundane, unsafe, drudgery – there could be — liberation from — these jobs and a move towards a brighter world.”

To pursue his education, Mumbai-born Professor Subra Suresh travelled to the US with less than $100 in his pocket, toting a half-filled suitcase.
His story is one of the power of education, a value instilled in him by his mother from an early age, he notes.

Suresh rose to become the first Asian-born academic to lead the National Science Foundation, an American agency with an US$8bn research budget, and joined Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University in January as its new President. GovInsider caught up with him to learn more about his vision for the university.
Boosting AI research

In one of his first moves, the university has partnered with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to set up a joint AI research institute - the first of its kind outside of China. The research tie-up will explore applications of Artificial Intelligence to solve real-life problems - diagnosis and prevention of diseases, for instance, and urban design, according to a Straits Times report.

Alibaba is dedicating US$15 billion to its Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook Academy programme, and the contribution to this research institute will likely come from this fund, Channel NewsAsia reported.

NTU Singapore was chosen for the partnership because of its AI expertise, the Straits Times report said. The university ranks in the top three globally in terms of AI research, according to a 2017 ranking that measures research citations between 2012 and 2016. At the signing of the agreement, Suresh said that the partnership would give NTU Singapore students and faculty “an opportunity to connect their basic research in the lab with real life applications that have immediate societal impact”.

Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, noted at last week’s Alibaba Cloud Summit that “What we are trying to do, is to transform Singapore now that we are on the cusp of a new revolution. He added: “the real value today is in the ability to derive insights, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analytics, and deep learning”.

This year, NTU Singapore also launched a new undergraduate degree course in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, in response to rapidly growing demand for these capabilities across industries in Singapore. “Not unexpectedly, it's been oversubscribed,” Suresh remarks.
How to relearn 101

At the same time, the university is taking steps to prepare students for a tech-driven future that will inevitably require new skills and capabilities, says Suresh. “Unlike previous generations, this cohort is going to change not only jobs many, many more times, they are likely to change professions - that means they have to relearn at a much faster rate.”

One piece of Singapore’s skills redevelopment focus is how universities and tertiary institutes can support reskilling. NTU Singapore has announced that it will provide $1,600 worth of additional SkillsFuture credit for alumni all over the world to earn certificates through the university’s online professional development courses.
 
“If you graduated ten years ago, you've been working in industry and you know nothing about AI, can you learn through online mechanisms?”
These could potentially help professionals earn a promotion or climb the corporate ladder, Suresh notes. “If you graduated ten years ago, you've been working in industry and you know nothing about AI, can you learn through online mechanisms?”

And starting this year, the university is adjusting curriculums across the board so that all undergraduates will take core courses in basic digital literacy skills. “It doesn't matter whether you are an engineering or music or literature major. You will have what our faculty and experts believe is the minimum requirement to be a successful citizen of the digital world,” Suresh explains.

His vision for NTU Singapore’s graduates includes inculcating in them an understanding of how to use technology responsibly and wisely. “We want to make sure our students get as much exposure to the human aspects of technology - things like ethics, communications, leadership,” he explains, adding that the second largest college in the university is Humanities and Social Sciences.

Disruption is transforming economies and employment, and universities such as NTU Singapore are exploring ways to ensure their graduates are prepared. As Suresh summarises: “The goal of learning should be to acquire the skills that enables you to adapt to change.”
He was once the lead of the US’ largest research funding agency; but in a sign of the changing times, Suresh’s has started in his new role by embracing the opportunities being offered by a rising China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now, researchers from NASA's Frontier Development Lab (FDL) and Intel are working to change that. They've found a way to make it just as easy to navigate a new planet — they just needed a little help from artificial intelligence (AI) to do it.They presented their planetary navigation research during an Intel-hosted event on August 16.NON-GLOBAL GPS. GPS stands for ""global positioning system,"" and it's just that: global. The satellites that let the system know your location so your app can give you directions to that new restaurant don't work when you're not on Earth.Since positioning a similar system of satellites around every moon or planet we'd like to explore would be really difficult and expensive, NASA and Intel set out to create a different kind of planetary navigation system.If we could feed an AI enough pictures of the surface of a celestial body, they determined, a person could simply take a photo of their surroundings and the system would be able to figure out where they were and give them directions to the place they wanted to be.FROM THE MOON TO MARS. To see if this kind of system could work, the researchers built a virtual moon.""[F]or our approach, using the real Moon isn’t actually critical,"" researcher Andy Chung told Futurism. ""It would likely improve performance in a real mission, but a key point of our work is that it teaches a network to learn general distortions caused by general landscape topologies.""To construct this moon, the team first created 2.4 million images of its surface that were taken by a rover (or, at least would have been if the planet had been real). They fed the images captured by these hypothetical cameras to their AI, which put them together to create the virtual moon.According to the team's presentation, this was enough to effectively enable navigation on the virtual moon's surface.Next, they want to try to do the same thing with a real (not virtual) celestial body: Mars. They think they have enough satellite images to make it happen. If they're right, the first people to walk on the Red Planet could find that all they have to do to navigate around the Martian surface is just take a picture.READ MORE: NASA Is Developing AI to Give Directions in Space [The Next Web]More on GPS: GPS Tracking Is Now Accurate Down to the CentimeterEditor’s note 8/24/18 at 12:45 PM ET: This article was updated to include comments from researcher Andy Chung.Share This Article",2018-08-24T09:41:04-04:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}",,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On his first  solo project since 2013, Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds adds a new element – robots! – to his mix of post-minimalist repetition, indie swoon, film score frisson and ambient drifts. Re: Member is a conversation between Arnalds and algorithms, the programmed and the human, his own intentions and new inspirations, composed with a software called Stratus connected to two player pianos.
Nothing here has the unfamiliar, inhuman shocks of a John Cage indeterminate work, a John Zorn game piece or Autechre’s recent robo-dialogue. Instead it’s Arnalds’ signature gorgeous melancholy – as heard on albums like 2013’s For Now I Am Winter and the soundtrack to Broadchurch – with a gentle pulse. “Brot” features luminous throbs of strings, the itchy “Ekki Hugsa” twinkles with typewriter piano and “Inconsist” is reminiscent of fellow minimalist Hauschka gone downtempo. Clicks and clacks of the robotic processes add an extra textural layer for music that’s part Conlon Nancarrow’s 20th Century player piano compositions, part Aphex Twin Satie-and-skitter. A gentle mix of the stiff, sad and soothing.

Faculty and senior researchers at MIT are teaming up in unprecedented ways to help define the next frontier in human and machine intelligence with projects that delve into everything from fundamental research to societal applications for new technologies.
The MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence, a program within the MIT Quest for Intelligence, has announced funding for 27 projects involving about 50 principal investigators from departments and labs within engineering, science, architecture and planning, management, and the humanities and social sciences.
SenseTime, a leading artificial intelligence company founded by MIT alumnus Xiao’ou Tang PhD ’96, jointly created the alliance with MIT earlier this year to define the next frontier of human and machine intelligence. The selected projects are of one year in duration that are intended to kick-start new efforts and initiate longer-term work.
“We were thrilled with the range and creativity of the proposals we received,” says Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering and Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who chairs the MIT-SenseTime Alliance.
“It is particularly exciting to see faculty from so many disciplines join together to embark on projects that speak to the major objectives of the MIT Quest for Intelligence,” he says.
Chandrakasan points to the funded exploratory “moonshot” projects that align with the work of “The Core,” which seeks to advance the science and engineering of human and machine intelligence, explore human intelligence using insights from computer science, and develop new machine-learning algorithms.
One such project features MIT faculty from the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. These professors are working on a “language moonshot” that explores how insights from linguistic theory can be transformed into machine-learning algorithms to better approximate how people converse.
Several MIT neuroscientists from the McGovern Institute for Brain Research are joining with an MIT physics professor and others in a moonshot project that explores the biological mechanisms subtending learning and how to incorporate that knowledge into more robust machine-learning techniques. Meanwhile, MIT faculty from computer science and brain and cognitive sciences are collaborating in a project focused on how artificial systems, like robots, can learn common sense knowledge.
Also popular were projects described as “mission-driven” that aligned, as Chandrakasan notes, with the MIT Quest for Intelligence’s second key entity, “The Bridge,” which is dedicated to the application of MIT discoveries in natural and artificial intelligence to all disciplines.
Seven principal investigators from disciplines including CSAIL, the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences are collaborating on a mission-driven project that will explore drone intelligence for societal applications.
Another mission-driven project features a faculty member from the Sloan School of Management teaming up with an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science who proposes to use machine learning to amplify human intelligence and human employment in future manufacturing. Another involves two MIT mechanical engineering faculty focusing on developing tools in product design and systems architecture that capitalize on strategies that combine human intelligence with machine intelligence.
Eight collaborative projects that involve two or more principal investigators also received funding. For example, Media Lab professors will evaluate the use of a social robot as a personalized emotional wellness coach; electrical engineering and computer science professors will use embedded AI to track neurocognitive decline in the elderly; nuclear science and engineering, materials science and engineering, and electrical engineering professors will develop an all-solid device for low-power, fast, brain-like computing; Sloan professors will research dynamic portfolio management with deep learning; and mechanical engineering professors will investigate a specific approach to low-power image regression at the edge for the internet of things.
Additional funding was dedicated to 13 projects led by individual faculty from a range of departments, including media arts and sciences, chemistry, computer science, anthropology, physics, brain and cognitive sciences, and more. These projects are wide-ranging and include pursuits such as harnessing artificial intelligence to design vaccines for treating metastatic skin cancer, quantifying the robustness of neural networks, and using AI to increase equity in decision making for agriculture market design.“These projects are just the beginning of what promises to be one of the most important initiatives MIT has ever started,” says Antonio Torralba, the director of the MIT Quest for Intelligence. “SenseTime’s tremendous support for pivotal research will deepen the footprint of The Quest on campus.”
