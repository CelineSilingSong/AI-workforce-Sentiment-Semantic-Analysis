The ramifications of advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) are being felt further afield than anyone expected. A.I. perhaps entered the public consciousness in the 1990s thanks to chess competitions, but it's now infiltrating art competitions and, soon, the written word. Some commercial offerings can provide paragraphs of text based on brief prompts, keywords, and tone parameters. Users of Google's email service have, of course, been microdosing on A.I. since 2018, when Gmail rolled out Smart Compose. What these developments bring home is that people in the so-called ""creative class"" are now facing the first-person reckoning that automation has long presented to blue-collar workers: Technology is going to radically change the way we work. As an analyst at a think tank, my job consists of processing policy trends, formulating new ideas to tackle economic and social problems, and advancing them through the written word. If programs like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Voyager can already captivate human audiences, I haven't the slightest doubt that my modest ability to metabolize the policy landscape, reason my way to novel solutions, and manipulate language in provocative, engaging ways will soon be matched—and then surpassed—by A.I. programs designed for the task.  Powered By                         00:00/00:5010 Sec      AP Top Stories July 19 A         NextStay    


While I am under no illusion that my work merits any blue ribbons, putting thoughts into words that persuade or stir emotion entails a certain artistry. It's an engrossing and gratifying process, one from which I derive identity. When I contemplate that a computer could soon do it better, I, like the Lancashire handloom weavers of the early 19th century, feel more than a bit threatened.  Garry Kasparov dealt with this conundrum two decades ago and has had a head start in managing the prospect of obsolescence. Kasparov, an all-time great chess player, had the distinction of holding the world title just at the same moment that computer chess programs ramped up their prowess. In 1996, Kasparov beat what was then the strongest chess engine ever created, IBM's Deep Blue. But as he recounts in his memoir, Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins, he knew then that his reign would soon end. Indeed, in a 1997 rematch for which Kasparov was handsomely compensated, an updated Deep Blue brought the age of A.I. to global attention, dealing the champion a stunning defeat in the match's decisive sixth game. In Deep Thinking, published in 2017, Kasparov explains how his perspective on A.I. has evolved and why. Despite the anguish the 1997 loss caused him, he views A.I. as one of the greatest opportunities for humanity to advance its well-being. The reason is that Kasparov has observed in the intervening years that the highest level of performance, on the chessboard and elsewhere, is reached when humans work with smart machines. After Deep Blue's programmers established that it could see deeper into the game than the human mind, Kasparov and a group of partners came up with a new concept: What if instead of human vs. machine, people played against one another but with the assistance of chess software? They called the new style of play ""advanced chess,"" and the outcomes surprised Kasparov. It wasn't the player with the best chess software that necessarily won, nor was it the best human player. Rather, the top performers were the players who were able to use the machines most effectively, those who were able to get the most out of the chess engines and their own creative abilities. Operating on the premise of Moravec's Paradox, i.e., where machines are strong is where humans are weak and vice versa, what Kasparov took away from the advanced chess experiment is that a clever working process beats both superior human talent and superior technological horsepower. The same insight can be leveraged by artists, composers, writers, designers, and the like. Rather than viewing A.I. as the end of our livelihoods, we ought to see the opportunities it presents for better work. For the creative class, the answer to the A.I. challenge is to make the most of the programs available to us. Is artistry lost because of A.I., or is it unlocked, as we are freed from some of the more formulaic structuring processes that drain energy? By delegating these aspects of creation to A.I., I anticipate having more mental space available to generate the rhetorical flourishes and the witty bits of embroidery that make writing enjoyable. Yes, people deploying A.I. in the writing world, art competitions, and elsewhere will likely face scorn. But while a level playing field is appropriate in defined competitions, in open-ended fields to accuse a rival of cheating would be no more meaningful than in that of the textile industry. For the intrepid writer, A.I. will create opportunities to produce better work at a faster clip, just as the power loom did for the weavers of Lancashire. Rather than fear, and certainly rather than Luddite suppression, this ought to be a moment of optimism. A.I. is coming for our jobs. Its arrival, however, will not be a harbinger of obsolescence but a catalyst for greater achievement.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is fuelling a new revolution in medicine and in the health care sector, primarily for image analysis and disease modelling, but its impact on people’s health is still limited, according to a new study by the Universitat Politècnica de València and WHO in the International Journal of Medical Informatics. AI is used in several ways in health care, from molecular and genetics testing to medical imaging, diagnostic codes analysis, and in infectious disease outbreak predictions as part of health emergencies protection programmes. However, its application remains limited and is used most often only in laboratories and testing, the study says, noting, “Despite the great advances and the high level of maturity of AI in certain clinical domains, the review of systematic reviews concludes that the use of AI is still scarce in clinical practice.”Dr Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Director of the Division of Country Health Policies and Systems at WHO/Europe, and Dr David Novillo-Ortiz, Regional Advisor on Data and Digital Health, are among the authors of the paper, together with experts from the Universitat Politècnica de València in Spain. The paper reviewed 129 studies and systematic reviews to reach its conclusions. Digital data interventions can enhance population health AI can provide powerful tools to automate tasks and support and inform clinicians, epidemiologists and policy-makers on the most efficient strategies to promote health at a population and individual level, the paper says.Looking ahead, the paper also notes that the use of digital data has the potential to improve people’s health and well-being and to protect them better from emergencies. At the same time, it says digital data should be boosted by the use of “machine learning algorithms in population-based, clinical decision-making with the use of big data and new communication technologies”.Many of the reviews concluded that AI and machine learning “will play an important role helping clinicians to identify specific indicators”, leading to better diagnosis, treatment and outcomes, but methodological aspects should be duly considered to make real progress in benefitting science and, therefore, universal health care. Health care systems will be able to improve the quality of universal health coverage and better respond to emergencies in the future through AI modelling, the authors note. In a related development, WHO/Europe reported earlier this year that “advances in big data and artificial intelligence have opened new opportunities for monitoring health and fighting noncommunicable diseases, or NCDs”.

Concerns over copyright and artists’ livelihoods have caused photography agencies to remove images created by artificial intelligence models from their databases.
The worries come from the fact that the AIs hoover up vast amounts of human-generated art to train themselves and use this database of knowledge to generate photorealistic images related to almost any text prompt. This has led to ethical debate and highlighted the legislative grey area about who owns the…

By now you’ve seen at least one headline about how Artificial Intelligence will do away with all our jobs. And to some degree it’s true. The change has already been happening for years now and will continue to do so. But the job loss we’ll see due to these emerging technologies is not the biggest threat to our jobs and what we consider “normal” employment. The very nature of work is changing, and that’s what we must prepare for. That’s the real threat.
And really, will we lose that many jobs that aren’t replaced with new ones? Gartner predicts 2020 will be a big year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), with 2.3 million jobs created while 1.8 million are eliminated. But we’re still 500,000 ahead, and the jobs created will be higher-value, skilled jobs while those eliminated will be repetitive, low-skill tasks. That should make AI a little less scary.
Even when we see the math, however, we’re still nervous because it’s a big unknown. One in four Americans believes their job will be eliminated in the next 20 years. One in eight believes it will happen in the next 5 years.
Is AI all Bad? 
Although it’s scary, AI is not all doom and gloom. AI will make life better, and not just for the many businesses that will streamline processes, decrease errors and reduce costs by implementing AI technology. We already enjoy some of the benefits of AI in our personal lives when we rely on our smartphones and smart homes. Our world is now a safer place with AI used in aviation and for security. In the future, AI will improve the efficiencies of our cities, our healthcare, and maybe even the health of the environment. It promises to do away with drudgery and make more meaningful work possible, and that in and of itself is huge.
Speaking of work, AI is also creating jobs and will create more, as Gartner predicted. One study found jobs were created at the majority of companies that had implemented AI. As smart as AI might be, the technology still needs people to make it work. In fact, we already have a shortage of skilled employees: every year we have more AI jobs posted—and not enough qualified applicants to fill on the roles.
If AI Isn’t Scary, What Is? 
Despite all this good news, we’re still nervous. AI is scary to us because we fear the job loss, but AI isn’t the big threat. What’s really scary is the speed at which everything is changing, the unknowns that loom on the horizon, and that permanent full-time jobs will no longer be the norm. The very nature of work is changing. That’s what is so scary.
As technology evolves, the rate at which it involves increases. In 2001, the futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that we will experience 20,000 years of progress during this century as the result of the accelerating rate of change. It can be near impossible for us to know then what the future holds, including what jobs might be available to us. The World Economic Forum predicts 65 percent of our children will have jobs that don’t yet exist when they grow up.
One thing that’s for sure: We won’t have the kinds of jobs we have now—at least not in the way we have them now. One article flat out states, “In the future, employees won’t exist.” As the article points out, it’s not just the businesses like Uber that have business models built on contractors; even big companies like Microsoft use huge numbers of contractors—with almost as many contractors as regular full-time employees.
Contract work is already normal. Call it the 1099 economy, the freelance economy, the gig economy—whatever you call it, it means we already have more than one-third of people in the U.S. (36 percent) working at jobs other than the norm. That’s 57 million people. By 2027, over half the U.S. population of working age will be freelancing. Ironically, some companies are currently hiring more IT freelancers to keep up with the AI demand, and using AI to do it.
Part of this is by choice. The younger generation that now makes up the majority of the workforce in the U.S. places a higher value on autonomy than pay. They would rather be able to work remotely with flexible schedules than give up freedom in exchange for a salary. That makes a contractor-based workforce appealing to them.
But part of it is driven by economics and the money businesses save by using contracted rather than full-time permanent employees. Gallup distinguishes between independent gig workers who have work autonomy and control—what you would consider the true freelancer who is doing this by choice—and the second group known as the contingent gig workers. They are the ones working side-by-side with regular employees but without the benefits and pay, like at this Nissan plant where some “temporary” workers have been employed for years without the benefits their permanent colleagues enjoy.
These are not anomalies, but trends illustrating what the future will be like. And it’s clear that work as we know it is going away.
4 Ways to Prepare Yourself for a World Without Work as We Know It
If the world of work as we currently know it is going to change and we can’t be sure how, what can we do? We can assume there’s a good chance we’re going to work as contractors and freelancers, and prepare ourselves accordingly. We can choose to be proactive. These four steps should help:
1. Keep learning.
Learning is going to be key to future success. One pundit goes so far as to say, if you’re not spending 5 hours per week learning, you’re being irresponsible. What should you learn? You could focus your learning on the need for AI professionals, and decide to pursue a career in AI to safeguard yourself. Or learn about other technologies with a shortage of qualified applicants, such as data science and cybersecurity. Note also that soft skills such as communication and problem-solving will continue to be in demand, so you could also improve in those areas to be ready for whatever the future brings. It matters less what you’re learning and more that you’re constantly expanding your skillset and knowledge, to be ready for what might lie ahead.
2. Manage your finances.
As one Forbes contributor puts it in an article titled “How To Build A Successful Career In A Future Without Jobs,” you must be your own money manager when permanent, full-time employment is no longer an option. You’ll need money saved to cover the dry spells when work is sparse, and a solid budget for managing money when work is abundant. You might be in charge of your own health insurance, and chances are you’ll be responsible for your own retirement too. Already we see fewer companies offer pension plans and we can expect that number to keep decreasing.  
3. Build your brand.
Build your personal brand, because that’s going to be much more important than your résumé in the new working world. Be online. Have a strong LinkedIn profile. Be visible and involved, definitely online and in person if you can. The stronger your brand, the more easily you find work later.
4. Actively build and maintain your network.
While you’re building your personal brand, also be building your network. You’d be surprised to discover how many people you’re already connected to. Expand upon that to connect to other people who might be good resources for job leads in the future, should you find yourself working as part of the freelance economy.
AI will transform our world in many ways, but it won’t be the main reason we’re likely to go without the permanent, full-time jobs our parents had. The very nature of work is changing. That is what we must be ready for, and the sooner, the better.

With IT spending projected to total $4.5 trillion in 2022, it’s clear that cutting-edge technology is on every IT executive’s wish list this year. However, while investing in emerging technology is essential, businesses can’t beat the competition by simply increasing tech spending. IT leaders must create foolproof strategies that consider what these new technologies will do and how they will upskill workers to use them.
Additionally, inflation will severely impact IT budgets as vendors adjust prices for the current market. Consequently, CIOs must be selective when choosing digital solutions.
So which technologies will win in 2022 and beyond? Those that empower businesses to capitalize on existing technology infrastructure. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and a hybrid intelligence (HI) approach can bridge skills gaps in a workforce and help workers fundamentally change how they work and interact with technology.
The skills gap is wider than ever
IT skills gaps continue to threaten industry resilience. According to Salesforce, nearly 75 percent of employees feel ill-equipped to learn the digital skills necessary for the future of work. Yet despite these concerns, only 28 percent are involved in digital skills learning and training programs.

This gap is concerning, but there is an opportunity to address this issue, grow employee skill sets, and make day-to-day tasks more meaningful and productive.
CIOs now face a dual challenge: They need to upskill their workforces while meeting increased demand for innovation and keep the organization competitive by implementing advanced technologies into key business functions while dealing with aging and cumbersome legacy systems.
These challenges are closely related, and CIOs should consider them together. Start by asking: What will the reimagined workforce look like when they have access to the full potential of AI and IoT?
Hybrid intelligence and the reimagined workforce
AI is evolving, as is its pivotal role in reshaping the technology workforce as we know it. As technology advances, so do the expectations of employees’ skill sets. To remain competitive, employees must focus on driving strategic changes in the enterprise rather than busy work.
 There is great potential in combining AI with human intelligence to create a hybrid approach that can dramatically increase the accuracy and efficiency of decisions across the enterprise.
Luckily, there is great potential in combining AI with human intelligence to create a hybrid approach that can dramatically increase the accuracy and efficiency of decisions across the enterprise.
By introducing AI to the workforce, IT leaders can provide a new partner to assist workers in ways that were not previously possible. For example, AI unlocks new types of insights that a human with linear optimization would not be able to create. Therefore, AI steps in as a digital mentor and prompts workers to adopt new processes and ways of thinking.

In addition, AI can empower executives by creating autonomy for decision-making to solve complex problems through analytics and optimization. AI also frees up workers’ and managers’ time, enabling them to focus on the higher-value, strategic tasks that C-level executives expect from their teams.
Finally, AI requires training and interaction with human workers to become increasingly efficient. Therefore, in a hybrid intelligence environment, workers do not only use AI tools but also participate in training them.
Building hybrid intelligence
Many people misunderstand AI as a technology that will replace jobs – but instead, AI will transform existing roles in incredible ways. As a result, leaders will need to develop new roles for those who work with AI, such as teachers, collaborators, and innovators.

Workers interacting with AI will not do so in a silo; these teams will be cross-functional and empowered to think quickly, innovate better, and work together to achieve various goals. These roles reflect the business advantages of AI: It enables leaders and employees to collaborate more effectively, transforming and reshaping work as we know it.
One of the most critical skills employees will need to develop is teaching AI if it is to reach its full potential as an equal partner in the hybrid intelligence environment. The teaching process can be simple and will not always require workers to develop special skills. But managing complex use cases and creating opportunities to enhance productivity will require employees to upskill considerably.
For example, leaders must recognize the importance of repeatedly performing, verifying, and documenting actions to improve AI tools. In this way, AI can become even more helpful by creating more accurate diagnostic results and predictive insights necessary for business functionality.
As human experts and AI become increasingly active in the hybrid intelligence environment, the scope and nature of the work AI can perform will become more diverse and advanced. IT hiring, in turn, will become more tied to more sophisticated, knowledge-based work.
But first, leaders must equip teams with the right mindset to help AI reach its full potential. Only then will AI be capable of creating opportunities for more dynamic roles that will rapidly transform organizations and help them to stay relevant and resilient for years to come.

Mayo Clinic and nference have expanded their artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaboration with the launch of a new platform that will leverage de-identified EHR data to increase access to data-derived insights.







The platform, known as nSights, aims to advance research, drug discovery, and clinical care. Developed by nference, it provides biopharma, medical device companies, and diagnostic firms with de-identified EHR data across a wide range of disease states, according to the press release.
The platform represents an expansion of Mayo Clinic's 12-year relationship with nference. The company's partners and customers will gain access to Mayo Clinic Platform's de-identified data across various specialties, such as cardiology, oncology, and immunology, through nSights. 
The platform offers data exploration, analytics, and data science capabilities, including algorithm development. It combines various types of patient data, such as clinical notes, electrocardiograms, and radiology images. The data is collected in real time and anonymously, which helps limit bias and recall mistakes, the press release notes.
Further, the platform includes a data dictionary, enabling users to create new patient-level features for analysis.
New versions of the nSights platform will include digital pathology and genomics, the press release states.
“The potential of electronic health data remains locked at medical centers and is frequently under-leveraged due to data complexity, privacy, and security concerns,” said Mike Koenig, chief commercial officer at nference, in a press release. ""Our expanded collaboration with Mayo Clinic Platform provides the framework for nference’s deployment of nSights and enables our customers to access de-identified ‘patient-level’ data to drive research and development of new therapeutics. I look forward to continuing to build and fortify our partnership with the Mayo Clinic team as we work together to improve healthcare through data-derived insights and knowledge.""
Further, nference has built a Mayo Clinic-branded version of nSights, called Mayo Clinic Platform_Discover.
“Over the past year, our collaboration with nference, leveraging nSights, has accelerated clinical decision support and care in significant ways,"" said Maneesh Goyal, chief operating officer, Mayo Clinic Platform, in a press release. ""Data-derived insights and knowledge help us accelerate and enhance innovation and meet the unmet needs of patients everywhere.”
Several healthcare organizations are applying AI solutions to the treatment process for various conditions.
In August, researchers from the UT Southwestern Medical Center created an AI algorithm that could predict the role of the regulatory elements of DNA. Researchers noted that this information might help combat genetic diseases.
University of California-San Diego researchers created an AI-based machine-learning algorithm to differentiate between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and Kawasaki Disease, which share similar underlying molecular patterns, to enable early detection of the diseases.

“There are some amazing sides to the use of the internet and social media: never before have we had access to so much information and culture. I think it’s important not only to control how many hours we spend using technological devices but, above all, to be discerning about what kind of content we look at,” says Castellanos, photographed here.
Nazareth Castellanos has a degree in theoretical physics and a PhD in neuroscience from the Faculty of Medicine at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) and has spent over 20 years researching brain activity at prestigious universities such as King’s College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany. In recent years, she has focused on what happens in the brain when we meditate and the relationship between the brain and the rest of the body. Aside from publishing the results of her laboratory research in scientific journals, she also widely shares her work through her social media networks, lectures, courses and books, such as El espejo del cerebro (The Mirror of the Brain) published by La Huerta Grande in 2021. We talked to her about all this, and much more, via videoconference.
Your outreach work establishes a dialogue between scientific knowledge, Eastern philosophy and the spiritual realm, challenging binary conceptions and scientific dogma – already superseded by physics – that radically separates mind and body. This has many ramifications, such as analysing the link between the brain and other parts of the body, particularly the heart and the intestine.
It is important for us to understand that this binary view, which categorically separates body and mind, is actually quite new. In a few months, a book of mine will be published in which I review the history of scientific medicine, which began in Ancient Greece. And if we look back at Hippocrates or Galen, the fathers of this medicine, we see that they already have the idea that mind and body are related, that the mind is not only the brain. Hippocrates considers the brain to be a privileged organ, but he does not exclude the rest of the body from psychology. The fragmented view emerged in the 17th century, with René Descartes, and although it brought with it a number of major benefits, such as the consolidation of the scientific method, what we cannot do is deny the other. What I was seeing is that accessing our mental states is often very difficult: it is easier to enter through the body, to start meditating by paying attention to the breath and bodily sensations. It is easier to change everyday habits than to change mindsets. It makes no sense to sit and meditate for hours and then have a terrible diet, a sedentary lifestyle or habits that punish the body. We have to find a balance between mind and body; it is not about unification but dialogue.
You cite an experiment in which a group of diabetics are given drinks: some are labelled ‘sugar-free’ and some are labelled ‘with sugar’. None of the drinks, in fact, have sugar in them, but the blood sugar levels varied according to what was written on the label. So, what we think has an impact on our organism and, similarly, our diet influences how we think, and even how we behave. 
Absolutely. As Saint Augustine said, we are made of soil that is hard to cultivate. If we do not feed it properly, we cannot expect much fruit. Hildegard von Bingen, a physician from the Middle Ages who practised medicine in a holistic way, using music and plants, pointed to the error of sacrificing the body, through flagellation, to reach ascension. How can we hope for a calm mindset if we cultivate that soil with fertilisers that only bring out weeds? I often tell of how, when I lived in Madrid, I used to see people having breakfast on the metro in the morning and I would think: ‘My goodness, these people are going to have a hard time getting through the day’. There is ample scientific evidence of the link between the gut-brain axis and how it influences our behaviour, our relationships with others and learning mechanisms: that is why nutrition during pregnancy and childhood is so important. Without going to extremes, of course: as with everything, balance is best.
Talking of bad habits, there are those who warn of our misuse of new technologies, especially social media and other applications that scatter our attention. What’s more, some scientists are already talking about the internet soon being connected to our brains, generating something like cyborgs, a hybrid of machine and organism. What is your view on this?
Regarding the first part of your question, I think that the press often gives too negative a view. There are some amazing sides to the use of the internet and social media: never before have we had access to so much information and culture. I think it’s important not only to control how many hours we spend using technological devices but, above all, to be discerning about what kind of content we look at. I do not, however, agree with the technological invasion of the human body that you spoke of; that’s posthumanism. I believe we should invest less in artificial intelligence and more in natural intelligence. The advantage, I believe, is that we are likely to see a humanism emerge in response to that posthumanism, and it will be very enriching.
Another fundamental idea is that the brain does not forget, but substitutes. We cannot force ourselves to stop thinking about something; it has the opposite effect. As a journalist, this makes me think about the mistakes that can be made when writing about concepts such as climate change and the ecological crisis: very negative approaches can reinforce what they are trying to combat.
I think that, as journalists, you have a huge social role that you sometimes neglect. I fully understand when someone tells me that they would rather watch gossip shows than a news programme that constantly tells us how horrible humankind is. Because what happens is that the news is exceptional; it wouldn’t be news, otherwise. So, something terrible happens and, as it is the only thing that is shown, our internal representation of reality is based solely on this information. It would be different if you gave that news but also made it clear that a huge part of humankind is good. To give an example: studies show that the most successful smoking cessation campaigns are those with positive messages; instead of ‘Smoking kills’, for example, ‘You will be fitter if you stop smoking’. The image we have of ourselves is important; if it is too defeatist, change is difficult.
Similarly, it would be interesting if our education system were to teach us how the brain and emotions work...
Absolutely. In Greece, but also in other cultures, the maxim is ‘Know thyself’. I have studied for 30 years and no one has ever told me: observe how you are, how your body reacts, how you regulate your emotions. The education system should be more open to the intimacy of the self; and great contemporary philosophers are already emphasising this.
Meditation is a fundamental part of your research. What does it show us about consciousness, about how the division between the conscious and the unconscious works?
It shows us that almost everything is a constant waltz between the voluntary and the involuntary, between the conscious and the unconscious. When I meditate, I look at myself; it’s not about analysing, it’s about observing. Neuroscience shows us what happens in the brain and how inner observation modifies brain activity, certain areas age more slowly and there is a correlation with certain mental health and psychological wellbeing indicators. In conclusion: let’s stop for a while and, instead of operating so many machines, let’s dedicate some time to that inner observation. What the ancients knew is now proven by science: a mind that wanders is an unhappy mind.
Finally, I would like to talk about the differences in the brains of men and women: how much gender bias and how much scientific evidence underlies these differences?
I am doing research on this at the moment, and what science shows is that there are differences between men and women. Brain activity is pretty much the same until the start of the hormonal processes during adolescence, and as of then, there are many differences. On a cognitive level, we have the same capacities for memory, attention and learning; but the fact that we can do the same things does not mean that we have the same brain: we arrive at the same result with neural networks that are different. This difference gives rise to nuances that enrich humankind in general: there are things that seem to evolve more optimally in men and others in women. Although we are very similar in cognitive terms, men have greater capacities for coordination and movement, while women are more capable in the areas of social cognition and empathy. There are studies that show brain activity in reaction to images of people experiencing different emotions: in men, two areas of the brain are activated; in women, nine. Moreover, what science is showing is that these differences are not just cultural but phylogenetic and ontogenetic. Obviously, I am talking about averages but, in any case, these are differences that enrich the human species and should not be hidden in the name of equality. Equality should not destroy diversity: equality yes, but of rights. If women are better able to predict and understand the state of another person, this is fundamental at leadership level. Louann Brizendine, a pioneer in research on gender differences in the brain, puts it like this: as women, we are here to keep social harmony. I find that mission an honour and, I believe, now that women are increasingly present in the world of work, that’s a place we can contribute from too.

A Critic's Notebook
The Voyage Begins: Using Midjourney in Architecture
Aaron Betsky on artificial intelligence-driven software and the game-changing work of architect Cesare Battelli.

“This will be the year of AI,” one of my colleagues at Virginia Tech proclaimed rather grandly as we assembled for the new school year a few weeks ago. “And I am not sure we are equipped for it.” What he meant was that a host of new artificial intelligence-driven software programs and apps, most prominently Midjourney and Dall-E, are now so widely available that our students will be—and, as became evident very quickly, already are—producing images with a lushness, range of references, and sophistication that indeed threaten some of the basic tenets of teaching. What does it mean that students can create images in a few hours that on the surface are so much more accomplished than anything their teachers have ever made? Is it even their work or that of an algorithm? How do we judge what we see?In some ways, the debate is an extension of the discussions that ensued way back in the First Silicon Age of the early 1990s (akin to the Stone Age in modern time reckoning) when students began unleashing their blobs and meshes on virtual drafting tables, often with far more skill than their fuddy-duddy professors. In other ways, though, something new is indeed here for us to reckon with: The images produced by Midjourney and Dall-E have a degree of realism, a range of painterly effects, and a way of plugging into the history and traditions of architecture that cloaks their novel mode of production with disarming familiarity. The images also often beat those arguing for hand-drawing and modeling techniques at their own game. The work looks more hand-made, more realistic and more crafted, more knowing in its references, and grander in its ambitions than the collection of swoops and swerves we have come to understand as the marks of computer technology.To get a sense of the possibilities, you need only turn to the recent work of the Madrid-based Italian architect Cesare Battelli. A former collaborator of Enric Miralles, who was trained at Frankfurt’s Städelschule when that school was a hotbed of both technological and image innovation under Peter Cook, he has for the last decade concentrated on being a “visionary architect,” as he says. Six months ago, he began using Midjourney and posting some of the results on social media. They are some of the most sophisticated architectural images I have seen in the last few years.

The best of them, like the series that ensued from Battelli prompting the software to render the “Tower of Babel under construction,” show a world in which scaffolding and the fragments of finished forms wrap around each other to produce buildings that change from solid objects to ephemera as they rise up into the sky. The scenes Battelli produces almost always consist of such unfinished structures, all loosely connected and spreading out across the virtual page in a sepia-tinted continuum. Small and indistinct figures toil away at the structures or admire them from below. Bits and pieces of machines push out of parts of the buildings. In other series, where Battelli combined prompts for a particular building type with animals such as sea horses or tigers, curved covers that might be roofs or walls turn into shapes that evoke the fauna before your eyes—all without ever being distinct enough to be completely recognizable. Diving into Battelli’s images, you concentrate on elements you think you know, from construction pieces to walls to hides, only to watch them melt into something else before you can focus on the particular properties of a part.

The images produced by Midjourney and Dall-E have a degree of realism, a range of painterly effects, and a way of plugging into the history and traditions of architecture that cloaks their novel mode of production with disarming familiarity.

What binds these fragments together is not only how the algorithms do not respect the finished and distinct aspect of any of the inputs, instead continually developing or fading them together but also the atmospherics (a kind of romantic sauce) that makes Midjourney both more fairy tale in its appearance and more sophisticated than most of the other readily available software. Battelli incorporates phrases such as “in the manner of” and “in the style of” in his prompts and has a penchant for a particular range of early Renaissance Italian painters, including Giotto and Botticelli. He adds the hazy skies and attenuated forms of Tintoretto and Veronese to the mix but also calls on compendiums of scientific data produced during that period as reference material. These references give the images their sense of emerging out of a Western art history tradition that removes the science fiction or romance novel aspect that overwhelms most of the other Midjourney work.Battelli is particularly fond of the obscure artist Monsù Desiderio, a painter working in Naples during the early 17th century. Virtually nothing about him is known, and the name might even indicate the work of three different artists originally from Germany and France. “He is a ghost,” Battelli says, “whose work is also spectral.” A proto-surreal collection of ruins and construction sites, explosions, fires, and refined structures, Desiderio’s images indeed presage the collage-like sensibility that AI programs generate.So what is it that Battelli does? He uses a palette that consists not of paint or pixels but rather of references. He is becoming increasingly skilled at choosing sources to create the effects he wants. It is, he says, a way of “alchemically creating something unexpected,” made possible because he works “on the threshold” where images and ideas solidify. He calls the result a product of imagination, distinguishing that evocation from utopian or dystopian visions because it works on and with existing images and forms. It is thus an advanced mode of collage that takes pre-formed materials and assembles them into a snapshot of intensified relations and compacted juxtaposition. Through the unifying tendencies of Midjourney, that collage, which is the Western tradition would usually remain a collection of distinct elements, is smoothed into something that denies its own fragmentary origins.

Recently Battelli has also been able to have Midjourney produce what appear to be wood models of some of his drawings. Now he is imagining that he might take these artifacts and continue them in balsa wood and glue, extending what currently exists only on the screen into the three-dimensional world. The models might then, he hopes, become part of a collage we can inhabit in the mode of an art installation. I can easily imagine one of my students taking a photograph or a video of that work and asking Midjourney to produce an image of their thesis project in the style of Cesare Battelli. Or an architect asking his computer to produce an image of the office building he is designing in the style of Battelli channeling Desiderio. The possibilities are endless, and, I for one, am pretty excited by the extension of architecture that artificial intelligence is opening.This article has been updated.The views and conclusions from this author are not necessarily those of ARCHITECT magazine or of The American Institute of Architects.Read more: The latest from Aaron Betsky includes walking the streets of the Postmodern ""theme park"" that is Portmeirion, exploring Assemble's neighborhood activism in Liverpool, and weighing in on an addition to a Neo-Brutalist monument in Boston.

Almost every industry in today's world, including healthcare, education, business, and automobiles, is growing rapidly. Thanks to AI. Smartphones and other home equipment, it has even made their way into our homes, simplifying our lives. Due to the increase in demand for AI, professional opportunities have increased as well, with most of them providing excellent compensation.But, before we proceed to Career Paths in Artificial Intelligence, let’s have a brief understanding of AI and what is its scope and future in India.What is meant by Artificial Intelligence?In simple words, Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with intelligent beings. It is basically a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI is often used interchangeably with its subfields, Machine Learning and Deep Learning but they are not the same though closely related.Scope and Future of Artificial Intelligence:Although AI is still in its infancy in India, the future seems quite bright. Organizations are searching for employees with AI expertise as it is rapidly expanding its wings across every industry.It is anticipated that over the next few years, there would hardly be any industry in India which is left untouched by this technological innovation. That is why the country has a great deal of potential for AI as a career.Career Paths in Artificial Intelligence:1. Big Data Analyst:The role of a Big Data Analyst is to find meaningful patterns in data by looking at the past and making predictions about the future. As a Data Analyst, he/she should be familiar with a variety of tools and Programming languages and must possess Data mining and Data auditing skills. 2. Research Scientist: A research scientist is an expert in applied mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, and computational statistics and conducts lab-based trials and experiments. He/she is expected to have an advanced degree in Computer Science or an advanced degree in a related field. 3. Business Intelligence (BI) Developer: The primary role of Business Intelligence Developers is to employ data analytics and technology to recognize different business and market trends. They also create and maintain company software tools used to guide business strategies. BI Developer is one of the fastest growing roles as almost every company with data needs at least one person who understands Business Intelligence. 4. Robotics Engineer: With the emergence of robotics in the field of AI, there will be an incessant demand for Robotics Engineers by major industries for programming their machines. They are in charge of creating, constructing, and testing robots or robotics systems that carry out tasks that people are either unable to accomplish or would prefer not to. 5. Software Engineer:A software engineer is the one who is responsible for developing programs in which AI tools functions. He/she has extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems. They apply their engineering principles to creating software. Although a job in artificial intelligence offers a vast range of potential applications and tremendous growth opportunities, it is also very competitive. The positions in this field are quite specialized and call for a high level of technical training in addition to a lot of practical experience.",,,,,,,,en,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/94510631'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bill that would require federal officials involved with procuring artificial intelligence to receive training on the emerging technology’s capabilities and risks has reached President Biden’s desk, after passing the House on Thursday.
If the AI Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act is signed into law, the Office of Management and Budget would have one year to establish a 10-year training program within executive agencies managing AI programs and logistics.
While Biden hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the bill, his administration has implemented key provisions of the National AI Initiative Act and the executive order on trustworthy AI, enacted by the Trump administration, in an effort to maintain U.S. global leadership in the technology and oppose China.
“In order to use artificial intelligence properly and in a way that ensures our nation can compete with our foreign adversaries, federal workers need to understand the technical and ethical implications of these technologies for the safety, security and freedoms of Americans,” said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who authored the legislation with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in a statement. “This important bill will help our government better understand artificial intelligence and ensure we are using it in a manner that is consistent with American values and our democracy.”

The bill wouldn’t fund the program but directs OMB to work with the General Services Administration to develop a curriculum covering the science behind AI, how it works, basic technological features, benefits for agencies, bias and privacy risks, trustworthy AI, and trends in national security and innovation. Technologists; academics; and public, private and nonprofit sector experts would train AI program managers, research and development employees, procurement and contracting officials, and logistics and cost estimation personnel. 
OMB would need to update the program at least every two years to address new technology developments, measure participation and solicit feedback.
The National Security Commission on AI raised the need to train federal officials procuring the technology, in particular, on the harms it poses to citizens and national security if used improperly. 
“This bipartisan legislation will train our procurement professionals about the ins and outs of AI so they can discern which AI systems are useful to the government and which are not,” Portman said in a statement.

                How do DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other forms of generative AI work?            

                    Meaningful pictures are assembled from meaningless noise.

Key Takeaways



                DALL-E and other types of generative AI can produce images that look like photographs, paintings, or drawings that were created by human beings.            


                Generative AI is powered by a computer program called a diffusion model. In simple terms, a diffusion model destroys and recreates images to find statistical patterns in them.            


                The way it operates is not like natural intelligence. We cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.

DALL-E is spooky good. Not so many years ago, it was easy to conclude that AI technologies would never generate anything of a quality approaching human artistic composition or writing. Now, the generative model programs that power DALL-E 2 and Google’s LaMDA chatbot produce images and words eerily like the work of a real person. Dall-E makes artistic or photorealistic images of a variety of objects and scenes.How do these image-generating models work? Do they function like a person, and should we think of them as intelligent?How diffusion models workGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is the bleeding edge of AI technology. The proprietary computer code was developed by the misnomered OpenAI, a Bay Area tech operation which began as a non-profit before turning for-profit and licensing GPT-3 to Microsoft. GPT-3 was built to produce words, but OpenAI tweaked a version to produce DALL-E and its sequel, DALL-E 2, using a technique called diffusion modeling. Diffusion models perform two sequential processes. They ruin images, then they try to rebuild them. Programmers give the model real images with meanings ascribed by humans: dog, oil painting, banana, sky, 1960s sofa, etc. The model diffuses — that is, moves — them through a long chain of sequential steps. In the ruining sequence, each step slightly alters the image handed to it by the previous step, adding random noise in the form of scattershot meaningless pixels, then handing it off to the next step. Repeated, over and over, this causes the original image to gradually fade into static and its meaning to disappear.We cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.When this process is finished, the model runs it in reverse. Starting with the nearly meaningless noise, it pushes the image back through the series of sequential steps, this time attempting to reduce noise and bring back meaning. At each step, the model’s performance is judged by the probability that the less noisy image created at that step has the same meaning as the original, real image.While fuzzing up the image is a mechanical process, returning it to clarity is a search for something like meaning. The model is gradually “trained” by adjusting hundreds of billions of parameters — think of little dimmer switch knobs that adjust a light circuit from fully off to fully on — within neural networks in the code to “turn up” steps that improve the probability of meaningfulness of the image, and to “turn down” steps that do not. Performing this process over and over on many images, tweaking the model parameters each time, eventually tunes the model to take a meaningless image and evolve it through a series of steps into an image that looks like the original input image.To produce images that have associated text meanings, words that describe the training images are taken through the noising and de-noising chains along at the same time. In this way, the model is trained not only to produce an image with a high likelihood of meaning, but with a high likelihood of the same descriptive words being associated with it. The creators of DALL-E trained it on a giant swath of pictures, with associated meanings, culled from all over the web. DALL-E can produce images that correspond to such a weird range of input phrases because that’s what was on the internet.These images were created using the generative AI called Stable Diffusion, which is similar to DALL-E. The prompt used to generate the images: “color photo of abraham lincoln drinking beer in front of the seattle space needle with taylor swift.” Taylor Swift came out a little creepy in the first image, but maybe this is what she looks like to Abraham Lincoln after a few beers. (Credit: Big Think, Stable Diffusion)
The inner workings of a diffusion model are complex. Despite the organic feel of its creations, the process is entirely mechanical, built upon a foundation of probability calculations. (This paper works through some of the equations. Warning: The math is hard.)Essentially, the math is about breaking difficult operations down into separate, smaller, and simpler steps that are nearly as good but much faster for computers to work through. The mechanisms of the code are understandable, but the system of tweaked parameters that its neural networks pick up in the training process is complete gibberish. A set of parameters that produces good images is indistinguishable from a set that creates bad images — or nearly perfect images with some unknown but fatal flaw. Thus, we cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.Are generative AI models intelligent?It’s very hard to say, then, how much DALL-E is like a person. The best answer is probably not at all. Humans don’t learn or create in this way. We don’t take in sensory data of the world and then reduce it to random noise; we also don’t create new things by starting with total randomness and then de-noising it. Towering linguist Noam Chomsky pointed out that a generative model like GPT-3 does not produce words in a meaningful language any differently from how it would produce words in a meaningless or impossible language. In this sense, it has no concept of the meaning of language, a fundamentally human trait.These images were created using the generative AI called Stable Diffusion, which is similar to DALL-E. The prompt used to generate the images: “portrait of conan obrien in the style of vincent van gogh.” (Credit: Big Think, Stable Diffusion)
Even if they are not like us, are they intelligent in some other way? In the sense that they can do very complex things, sort of. Then again, a computer-automated lathe can create highly complex metal parts. By the definition of the Turing Test (that is, determining if its output is indistinguishable from that of a real person), it certainly might be. Then again, extremely simplistic and hollow chat robot programs have done this for decades. Yet, no one thinks that machine tools or rudimentary chatbots are intelligent.A better intuitive understanding of current generative model AI programs may be to think of them as extraordinarily capable idiot mimics. They’re like a parrot that can listen to human speech and produce not only human words, but groups of words in the right pattens. If a parrot listened to soap operas for a million years, it could probably learn to string together emotionally overwrought, dramatic interpersonal dialog. If you spent those million years giving it crackers for finding better sentences and yelling at it for bad ones, it might get better still.

Or consider another analogy. DALL-E is like a painter who lives his whole life in a gray, windowless room. You show him millions of landscape paintings with the names of the colors and subjects attached. Then you give him paint with color labels and ask him to match the colors and to make patterns statistically mimicking the subject labels. He makes millions of random paintings, comparing each one to a real landscape, and then alters his technique until they start to look realistic. However, he could not tell you one thing about what a real landscape is.Another way to gain insight into diffusion models is to look at the images produced by a simpler one. DALL-E 2 is the most sophisticated of its kind. Version one of DALL-E often produced images that were nearly correct, but clearly not quite, such as dragon-giraffes whose wings did not properly attach to their bodies. A less powerful open source competitor is known for producing unsettling images that are dream-like and bizarre and not quite realistic. The flaws inherent in a diffusion model’s meaningless statistical mashups are not hidden like those in the far more polished DALL-E 2.The future of generative AIWhether you find it wondrous or horrifying, it appears that we have just entered an age in which computers can generate convincing fake images and sentences. It’s bizarre that a picture with meaning to a person can be generated from mathematical operations on nearly meaningless statistical noise. While the machinations are lifeless, the result looks like something more. We’ll see whether DALL-E and other generative models evolve into something with a deeper sort of intelligence, or if they can only be the world’s greatest idiot mimics.

Is AI Really a Job Killer? These Experts Say NoAdobe Stock

But management and technology experts Thomas Davenport and Steven Miller argue that AI is not a job destroyer — no matter what other predictions might say. Yes, AI and intelligent technology will take over some jobs, but that will free up workers to do more challenging and important work.

Tom and Steven recently completed a book on this topic called Working with AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration, and I got the chance to speak with them about their predictions for how AI will fit in with the workplaces of the future.

How Will AI Impact the Future of the Workplace?
I asked Tom and Steven about the overall impact of AI in the workplace of the future, and they shared several important trends they’re seeing.
“People will need to embrace digital and intelligent technologies if they’re going to be successful in their jobs,” Tom shared. “I worked with a radiologist in the Boston area who also has a Ph.D. in AI. And he kept saying, ‘The only radiologists who are gonna lose their jobs to AI are those who refuse to work with AI.’”
They were quick to mention that “embracing digital and intelligent technologies” doesn’t mean everyone has to understand the mechanisms of machine learning or be able to build underlying DevOps platforms. People simply need to understand how to use the tools and understand how AI can help them perform their work.
Tom also predicted that AI is unlikely to be able to compete with humans in contextual understanding — at least, not anytime soon. One of his favorite examples is the online personal styling company StitchFix.
“AI helps create styling recommendations for customers, but they also have human stylists…the customer sends in notes sometimes about the context of their clothing needs. They’ll say, ‘I’m going to a wedding and my ex will be there” and the computers don’t understand that yet. Humans will be able to pick out an alluring dress for the woman to wear.”
Tom and Steven found a number of cases where AI can take the first swipe at solving a problem, but a company still needs a human to pull it all together, revise it, review it, and potentially override the AI’s answers.
Steven also mentions the fact that AI is only a small part of the monumental changes that will happen in workplaces. “It takes a village to change a job with AI,” he says. “You need a lot of job roles across many different departments that have to be brought into alignment and coordination…these systems don’t materialize overnight.”

AI Doesn’t Have to Kill Jobs — But Companies Must Be Ready
As jobs get augmented, amplified, and transformed, Steven and Tom both encourage companies to create thoughtful strategies about where the technology is going, and what kinds of skills and capabilities are needed.
Understanding what work will be done by digital workers, what needs to be done by human beings, and how the two will relate will be the key to maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace of the future.

 Since its emergence, artificial intelligence (AI) has crept into technology, changing everything we know about computers. Artificial intelligence refers to the programming of computers to think like humans. If you have ever used an automated program, there’s every possibility that it was AI in action. 







 Interestingly, the workplace structure is not exempted from its influence. Although hazy, AI has greatly impacted your work without you realizing it. This article outlines seven exciting ways you use AI at work that you didn’t know about. Keep reading to find out. 


 1. Spam Filters 
 Spam filters serve as an email security measure against cyber danger. Most email services like Gmail have a section dedicated to junk mail, where spam messages are sent. These emails can fill up your inboxes and distract you from the real work, so they are better off discarded. If you have ever had this experience, that was artificial intelligence. 

 In addition, most malware and viruses that threaten data security at the workplace are sometimes introduced using emails. Using spam filters is one of the ways to stop spam emails, especially for Gmail users. They sort through messages by assessing them against certain criteria, including campaign metadata, IP address, content and format, and codes. 





 Furthermore, these filters measure the level of spam using a spam score, which is the major determinant of what message goes to the inbox or is discarded as junk. Spam filters involve a lot of technicalities, but once it is launched, it automates themselves regularly. 



 2. Chatbots 
    

 As workplace technology expands, there are creative ways to relate with customers. One of them is the AI chatbots. If you work for an organization with an influx of customers, using chatbots to interact with them, especially outside of business hours, is an easy way to communicate with them. This scenario is a perfect example of artificial intelligence in action. 






 Chatbots are automated programs that respond to queries or questions of online users in the manner of a real human conversation. These bots work without human assistants and are coded with predetermined questions and likely answers. 

 AI chatbots work seamlessly with no direct human assistance as long as these queries are asked in natural language. Platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and Facebook Messenger use chatbots to respond quickly to customers. They act more like autoresponders, after which a real human worker may take it up. 



 3. Autocorrect 
 Autocorrect is an AI feature that acts beyond a word editor. It identifies mistakes, uses algorithms to state the correct words, and edits them accordingly. Autocorrect works similarly to an auto-suggestion keyboard by completing the words you want to type. However, this time it corrects the misspellings as you type. 






 You may have applied an autocorrect feature at work that spell-checks as you draft a company email or an official document. A good example is the Microsoft Word editor with the autocorrect feature. If you learn to use Microsoft Editor effectively, you'll enjoy its autocorrect capabilities that help you edit and correct misspellings as you type. 

 Grammarly editor also comes with an autocorrect option and uses an AI algorithm to detect the tone and mistakes as you write. Grammarly interprets words in natural human language and has an inbuilt glossary list it refers to as you write. Other tools that also use autocorrect are Gmail Autocorrect and Quillbot. 



 4. Natural Language Queries in Excel 
 Natural language queries in Excel help you analyze data smarter and faster by using Artificial intelligence to answer all data questions you may have. It compares figures and statistics, filters and sorts through them, providing answers in the form of graphs and charts. 






 Natural language queries use machine learning and natural language processing, which are subfields of AI, to interpret data and summarize them in whatever format you choose. This feature is an excellent data analytics tool and maintains a high level of accuracy due to AI integration. 



 5. Sales Assistant Software 
    

 Sales and marketing teams harness the power of sales assistant software to carry out sales routines and automate certain tasks for a smoother operation. This AI software uses machine learning, natural learning processing, and conversational technology to optimize daily tasks. Examples of this software include the HubSpot sales hub and ZoomInfo sales hub. 






 So every time you conversed or interacted with a sales assistant software, that was artificial intelligence, and you would notice how natural it is. Aside from conversational technology, these tools also use AI to perform tasks like data entry, data collection, and qualifying prospective customers. 



 6. Search and Recommendation Algorithms 
 Artificial intelligence powers search and recommendations. In addition to AI helping you search better, these algorithms display options according to your preferences. On this basis, e-commerce brands market products and services to customers. 

 If you’re a merchant on Amazon, you would understand the place of adding keywords to product descriptions and listings. These search algorithms read through your keywords to find out if they are a perfect match for a search query, and this same principle works for recommendations. 

 Recommendation algorithms help to display products related to what the user wants. AI works in the background to filter through these queries, making it a powerful tool for e-commerce brands. 







 7. Robocalls 
 Robocalls are pre-recorded calls that are used to pass emergency information or used by companies to sell to customers. The technological advancement in robocalling makes this software sound more human and has the intelligence to answer questions from customers in a matter of seconds. 

 These robocalls even go as far as pausing between thoughts like an actual human, so you don’t suspect a thing. These tools have been a breakthrough for companies that want to reach a larger audience through calls. However, a legal order must exist before any company can use this. The basic fact is that robocalls work purely by artificial intelligence. 



 Artificial Intelligence Is Changing the Future of Workplaces 
 As the years go by, the workplace will implement more automated processes. That means AI will power more software and processes. The increase in AI technology improves the value of work and changes the type of skill sets required in the workplace. 






 Although there are concerns about how AI may adversely affect workplace culture or how machines would displace humans in the workplace, these are merely myths surrounding its use. AI is not yet developed to displace the need for humans in the workplace. Instead, they ease the work process for people.

Should artificial intelligence be used in art competitions?





By Reece Goodall
Sep. 22, 2022Posted in Arts




As artificial intelligence continues to advance, there are increased questions about its capabilities and the ethics surrounding them. Should AI have rights in any way similar to our own human rights? Can we trust AI to make calls on medical decisions, or use it in warfare? And, indeed, can AI produce art? It may seem a silly question, but an AI artbot just beat a number of human artists in a competition, and the quality of its work was plausible enough to fool human judges. There was a negative backlash to the story, and it lit the fuse on a debate about whether AI can be an artist.
This discussion was prompted by a competition at the Colorado State Fair. In the fine arts show, artist Jason Allen entered a piece called Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. It’s a sci-fi fantasy scene, in which a number of women in period dress look through a large circular portal in the centre of the frame. Allen took the top prize, and then it emerged that the artist had created his artwork using the Discord-based AI art generator Midjourney. He then upscaled the image, using AI Gigapixel, in order to put it on canvas.
Allen entered the work in the ‘digital art’ category, which refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process”. He also stated that he used Midjourney to create his image when he entered the contest; thus, the judges ruled that he was in line with the rules. A spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Agriculture added that the two judges did not know what Midjourney was at the time, but that they would have awarded the prize to Allen regardless.
AI may be the future of art
As always, negative comments abounded on Twitter. One user wrote: “This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics.” Another said: “This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’. AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.” Allen responded to some of the comments by speaking to the New York Times. He said he wasn’t going to apologise because he didn’t break the rules, and then suggested that AI may be the future of art: “The ethics isn’t in the technology. It’s in the people. This isn’t going to stop. Art is dead, dude. It’s over. AI won. Humans lost.”
As provocative as the statement may be, it is also true that technology required a human to manipulate it. Although art-generating AI now exists in various states of sophistication, Allen didn’t just type in ‘sci-fi art’ or whatever and get a prize-winning piece back. He clarified that he spent weeks generating hundreds of images and fine-tuning them until he produced three that he liked enough to submit to the competition. This has been debated, however. The Artist John Lewis tested Midjourney to try and reproduce something similar to the award-winning work, and he said it took “about ten seconds”.
To claim the user is an artist, or that there is any real skill involved in using it is a bit misleading
He said: “Midjourney is a text-based generator but the user doesn’t really have a great deal of control over the output. It’s more of a random image generator, albeit with some really cool art styles built in. You can guide it but you can’t control it or fine tune it. Midjourney is a lot of fun, and as a quick ideas generator it’s great, certainly just as useful as a Google image search, but to claim the user is an artist, or that there is any real skill involved in using it is a bit misleading.”
There is an argument that AI is a tool, just as paintbrushes and charcoal and sculpting tools are all tools for creating art. Allen certainly argues so: “Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognise that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it.” There have been plenty of historical examples of people doing something new with new technologies to produce art, and ultimately the very subjectivity of art means we can’t say whether it counts or not.

Drug development is expensive, time consuming, and risky. A typical new drug costs billions of dollars to develop and requires more than ten years of work — yet only about 0.02% of the drugs in development ever making it to market. 
Some claim that AI, or artificial intelligence, will revolutionize drug development by ushering in much shorter development times and drastically lower costs. Many scientists and business consultants are especially optimistic about AI's ability to predict the shapes of nearly every known protein using DeepMind's AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence tool developed by Google parent company Alphabet; predicting this information with great detail would be key to quickly developing drugs. As one  AI company boasts, ""We … firmly believe that AI has the potential to transform the drug discovery process to achieve time and cost efficiencies."" 
That kind of rhetoric might be dismissed as typical fake-it-til-you-make-it puffery. But the Washington Post, a presumably neutral observer, has promoted this narrative, too. ""New research on proteins promises drug breakthroughs, and much else,"" said one op-ed that they ran. The New York Times concurred in a similar article titled ""We Need to Talk About How Good A.I. Is Getting."" One thing is certainly true: ""Investors bet on AI start-ups to turbocharge drug development,"" as the Financial Times reported.Advertisement:

Artificial intelligence research may have hit a dead end


Moderna claims that AI computer simulations helped analyze genetic sequence data in an ""optimal way."" Never mind that the ""optimal"" anything is seldom known. In addition, most of the time and effort involved in drug development is not spent in computer simulations, but in clinical trials — a highly uncertain and risky process that isn't made faster or less expensive by artificial intelligence algorithms. A Nature article titled ""The lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines—and what it means for other diseases"" doesn't even mention AI among the reasons for the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. Instead, it emphasizes that,

The world was able to develop COVID-19 vaccines so quickly because of years of previous research on related viruses and faster ways to manufacture vaccines, enormous funding that allowed firms to run multiple trials in parallel, and regulators moving more quickly than normal. Some of those factors might translate to other vaccine efforts, particularly speedier manufacturing platforms.

Determined to get a COVID-19 vaccine to the public before the November 3, 2020, presidential election, the U.S. government devoted $14 billion to support the pharmaceutical companies' vaccine efforts. The government agreed to pay Pfizer $5.87 billion for 300 million doses if Pfizer developed an FDA-approved vaccine — regardless of whether the vaccine was still needed. Moderna was given $954 million for research and development and a guaranteed $4.94 billion federal purchase of 300 million doses. Johnson & Johnson was given $456 million for research and development and promised $1 billion for 100 million doses.

The relative unimportance of AI in COVID development is consistent with the conclusion of many scientists that AI is not about to revolutionize drug development. The biggest problem is that clinical trials are the longest and typically most expensive part of the process, and AI cannot replace actual trials. Even AI's impact on drug discovery may be limited. A Science op-ed recently argued that, ""[AI] doesn't make as much difference to drug discovery as many stories and press releases have had it…. Protein structure prediction is a hard problem, but even harder ones remain.""Advertisement:

The data deluge has made the number of promising-but-coincidental patterns waiting to be discovered far, far larger than the number of useful relationships — which means that the probability that a discovered pattern is truly useful is very close to zero.

An often crucial part of drug development is to determine whether a drug binds to the candidate protein, something that MIT researchers have shown that AlphaFold cannot do and DeepMind admits AlphaFold can't do: ""Predicting drug binding is probably one of the most difficult tasks in biology: these are many-atom interactions between complex molecules with many potential conformations, and the aim of docking is to pinpoint just one of them.""Advertisement:
Likewise, the CEO of drug company Verseon is deeply skeptical:

People are saying, ""AI will solve everything."" They give you fancy words. ""We'll ingest all of this longitudinal data and we'll do latitudinal analysis."" It's all garbage. It's just hype.

One huge hurdle for all AI data mining algorithms is that the data deluge has made the number of promising-but-coincidental patterns waiting to be discovered far, far larger than the number of useful relationships — which means that the probability that a discovered pattern is truly useful is very close to zero. Verseon's CEO says that the total number of possible chemical compounds in the universe is on the order of 10 to the 33rd power. Companies cannot do clinical trials on every possible compound, nor can they rely on AI to find needles in this enormous haystack.
It will take real intelligence — not artificial intelligence — to determine which compounds are most likely to generate payoffs that justify the enormous costs of testing. Likewise, it will take real intelligence — not artificial intelligence — to conduct the clinical trials needed to gauge the efficacy and possible side effects.Advertisement:

Nigel Cannings



					 CTO, Intelligent Voice				




September 22, 2022




 





Although AI is undoubtedly revolutionizing the world as a versatile technology implemented in many important sectors, it can only act on the information used to train it. This opens the door for human bias, here’s how can we de-bias AI, says Nigel Cannings, CEO of Intelligent Voice.
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world as a dynamic tool across many important sectors. From medical and financial services to recruitment profiling, this versatile technology plays a leading role in our decision-making. 
It can’t, however, think like a human and can only act on the information used to train it. Ironically, this can also open the way for human bias to manifest itself negatively. So, what is the issue with bias in AI, and what can we do to combat the problem?
Fairness and Transparency
Aside from ease, one of the primary selling points of AI in sectors such as recruitment and HR, was the perception that as a “machine”, artificial intelligence is inherently free from bias. Thus it would make it easier for businesses to achieve diversity goals while removing the risk of racism, sexism, and ageism from core human resources management systems. But all was not as it originally seemed. Systemic bias found its way into AI. Why? Because, like all tech, it was created and populated by humans. 
Consequently, it has become increasingly vital that debiasing becomes a watchword in the field and is acted upon by everyone who values fairness and transparency. Making debiasing an invaluable step in the training process. Why? Because we know inputting the wrong data can produce harmful results, damaging not only any business or organization but also individuals in the workplace.
Taking a recruitment example, there have been multiple instances – even in embarrassingly high-profile companies, such as Amazon – where algorithms were previously trained that favored young white men while excluding women and people of color. This was not deliberate but an unfortunate artifact of the training data, based on an unconscious hiring policy that favored certain groups of people. This is literal systemic sexism and racism in action, showing how AI can inadvertently lead to discrimination through thoughtless training. And this is why there needs to be more focus on debiasing these systems.
However, we need to understand the basics of how AI networks decide before we can begin to solve the problem of bias.
The Basics of AI
Machines can now detect cancer in an X-Ray when the most methodical of professionals might have been unable to see the problem. However, AI can only achieve this because a human has previously labeled hundreds of X-Rays as having come from an individual who has either developed or does not have the disease.
Human involvement is the key to the basics of AI. Professionals work to input data to train AI to sift through the right data to make decisions. And often, the results are outstanding. The difficulty is finding ways to input that data without also inputting the potential for bias. 
Staying with the medical model, a recent discovery is that this same technology could identify the race of patients based on an X-Ray when professionals offered the same data could not. While this may not be misused per se, it shows how discrimination can easily creep into AI models.
Everyday People
Let’s take another example with a crucial bearing on people’s everyday lives involving often controversial Universal Credit. The Department of Work and Pensions has cited its intention to use AI to assess who should and should not receive the benefit.
Although this is all in line with 21st-century technology, they have yet to announce more detail on the proposed new system, which brings questions about this technology to light. What data will they use? Will people be heavily profiled? What model of personal information will they feed the software?
Where is the transparency despite Freedom of Information requests from the media? Get this wrong, and lives could easily be ruined. 
Rights on Automated Decisions
It’s important to remember that the EU’s data protection regulation GDPR states that everyone has a right to have automated decisions explained, so a benefits system that cannot do this is illegal and unethical.
‘The point is any pre-existing biases from the creator will be trained into the software, possibly leading to catastrophic results. AI is in essence trained by human thought processes.’

How Do We debias?
We use what’s termed “labeled data”, linked to a specific category to train AI models. This could be an image, for example, or in terms of a selection process, a successful and unsuccessful candidates’ CVs. It is possible to use “semi-supervised” training to reduce the amount of human labeling, but this greatly increases the amount of data that has to be used to show an AI model of how the world works. And if the data is not carefully curated, this can quickly lead to unwelcome results.
 Recent advances in Large Language Models such as GPT-3 and BlenderBot mean that machines can mimic human-like interactions. But because the model is more parrot than human, it leads to “speech” that can be racist, homophobic, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic, or just plain wrong.
Explainable AI is Key
To prevent this, we need ‘Explainable AI’, a system asking the software why it came to a certain decision and what it based results on. “XAI” is quickly growing as an area of research.
We can train models that “tell” us why they have reached a decision, or we can trick “black-box” models into revealing how they reached a conclusion. However, if we can’t explain why a system makes a decision, we can never work out how to correct the data it is trained on.
When we use AI correctly, it can be without question one of the most incredible concepts of our times. This can only be done if we maintain the debiasing approach.

In what might be a first, a New York-based artist named Kris Kashtanova has received US copyright registration on their graphic novel that features AI-generated artwork created by latent diffusion AI, according to their Instagram feed and confirmed through a public records search by Ars Technica.
The registration, effective September 15, applies to a comic book called Zarya of the Dawn. Kashtanova created the artwork for Zarya using Midjourney, a commercial image synthesis service. In their post announcing the news from Tuesday, Kashtanova wrote:Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

I got Copyright from the Copyright Office of the USA on my Ai-generated graphic novel. I was open how it was made and put Midjourney on the cover page. It wasn’t altered in any other way. Just the way you saw it here.
I tried to make a case that we do own copyright when we make something using AI. I registered it as visual arts work. My certificate is in the mail and I got the number and a confirmation today that it was approved.
My friend lawyer gave me this idea and I decided to make a precedent.
Going by their announcement, Kashtanova approached the registration by saying the artwork was AI-assisted and not created entirely by the AI. Kashtanova wrote the comic book story, created the layout, and made artistic choices to piece the images together. Ars VideoHow Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror
It's likely that artists have registered works created by machine or algorithms before because the history of generative art extends back to the 1960s. But this is the first time we know of that an artist has registered a copyright for art created by the recent round of image synthesis models powered by latent diffusion, which has been a contentious subject among artists.
Further ReadingFearing copyright issues, Getty Images bans AI-generated artwork
Speculation about whether AI artwork can be copyrighted has been the subject of many articles over the past few months, and just yesterday, we wrote about Getty Images banning AI-generated artwork on its site over unresolved issues about copyright and ethics issues.
Despite popular misconception (explained in the Getty piece), the US Copyright Office has not ruled against copyright on AI artworks. Instead, it ruled out copyright registered to an AI as the author instead of a human.
Zarya of the Dawn, which features a main character with an uncanny resemblance to the actress Zendaya, is available for free through the AI Comic Books website. AI artists often use celebrity names in their prompts to achieve consistency between images, since there are many celebrity photographs in the data set used to train Midjourney.

I don’t think this means anything at the ground level,” Aniket Sule, associate professor at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, told Down To Earth..Further, questions were also raised on whether AI can help schools that lack basic infrastructure..“AI has a marginal role to play as it can only help the upper-middle class strata of the society,” Soumitro Banerjee, professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, told DTE..You cannot visualise these recommendations applying to the children of farmers and labourers, he added..The recommendations listed by the UN body include prioritising the ethics of AI in education; providing an overall regulatory framework and creating effective public-private partnerships, other than eliminating bias, including ones of gender, in algorithms. .Ensuring technology access to teachers and students and expanding AI literacy efforts to inform people about the benefits and risks of the technology were some of the other recommendations. .UNESCO also suggested improving public trust, requesting the private sector to include students and educationists in developing AI-based tools, placing ownership of data with the students and embracing the versatility of AI in education systems.. Read more: COVID-19: Access to devices a must for bridging the digital divide.AI ethics, which cover data privacy and ownership, algorithmic fairness and biases, are particularly relevant in education, according to UNESCO. This is because algorithms are built from data often owned by private companies, which can lead to undesirable consequences, it warned..Though UNESCO suggested the technology has the scope to deliver quality content to remote locations, Sule asked if private players are ready to invest in rural hinterlands lacking computers or basic infrastructure..Many of the policy recommendations are abstract. For instance, the meaning of “creating effective public-private partnership” is not clear either. .Further, the report highlighted that AI could help address some challenges in the Indian education system, such as socio-economic inequities, gender inequalities, insufficient teachers and inadequate teaching quality, high drop-out rates, linguistic barriers and the digital divide, the report read..But Banerjee questioned how AI could address the digital divide..The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in 2020 exposed the divide as it drove school drop-out rates in India..Closing of 1.5 million schools during the pandemic impacted 247 million children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools, according to UNICEF. Only one in four children has access to digital devices and internet connectivity, said a press statement from the United Nations body. .There are other issues too. The country is far from benefiting from one application of AI: Enabling personalised student assessment, Sule also pointed out..Technology could help teachers track learning outcomes and assess the competencies of individual students in real-time, the report said. It can identify individual strengths, weaknesses, knowledge levels and learning speed, it added..

But there has been a lot of research, debate, and criticism about how to create the best computer language to raise the bar for artificial intelligence. Many respected tech-science circles have recently been abuzz with rumors that NASA has made a remarkable finding about a programming language for artificial intelligence. Sanskrit, an ancient Hindu language, is thought by NASA to be the best language for creating computer code for their Artificial Intelligence program..Sanskrit has long been regarded as a significant language in academic circles. Despite having a long history, the language retains certain remarkable qualities that are valued in a variety of professions. Additionally, it is employed in psychological treatment sessions and for spiritual healing. But its recent work with artificial intelligence is an honor, demonstrating its strength as a worthwhile field of writing. Early Indian mathematics and science were conducted in Sanskrit, which has a long history. Sanskrit's rule-based, formula-based, and logical syntax makes it an excellent choice for writing algorithms..Sanskrit's grammar also makes it appropriate for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The idea of employing Sanskrit to create artificially intelligent computers is exciting for both historians and common people since it creatively mines the past to provide answers for the future..NASA's connection to Sanskrit is not new. It all started in 1985 when a study report was published in the spring issue of Artificial Intelligence magazine by a NASA associate scientist. (Page 1 of Volume 6). The scientist's name was Rick Briggs, and his research was titled &quot;Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence&quot; in Vedic Science. The argument made in the paper was that natural languages are the greatest choice for converting into a computer program for robotic control and artificial intelligence. Sanskrit is one of the human languages studied in depth in the research since it is one of the most conducive to computer approaches..There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which was a spoken language for about a thousand years and had a sizable body of literature all on its own. Along with important literary works, there was a lengthy legacy of philosophy and grammar that persisted unabatedly into the twenty-first century. Their grammar experts came up with a way of paraphrasing Sanskrit that is identical to modern Artificial Intelligence work both in spirit and in form. – Sanskrit language statement by Rick Briggs..Despite the favorable results, several difficulties need to be taken into account. The first is that all natural languages are ambiguous, which implies that any word in a sentence might have multiple interpretations. The challenge is to translate the language so that it becomes less ambiguous and more literal so that robots with artificial intelligence can grasp it. Although it is challenging for AI, linguistic analysis accuracy is a crucial aspect. Sanskrit, however, appears to be more appropriate than other languages for still another reason. The literal meaning of each word and sentence is now clearer because of the rigid grammar standards, syllable counts, and word choice. This significantly lowers the proportion of abstract meanings in the languages..Shortly, NASA may make a ground-breaking discovery in this area. The NASA Sanskrit connection is a real one that is backed up by a ton of evidence and assertions. Even though there is no official announcement from NASA, it is evident that Sanskrit and other natural languages are important to their approach to artificial intelligence..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The portrait of three figures, dressed in flowing robes, staring out to a bright beyond, was so finely detailed the judges couldn’t tell.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAllen’s piece offers a clear example of how rapidly AI-generated art has advanced. Trained on billions of internet images, the systems have decisively pushed the boundaries of what computers can create.But it has also sparked a massive debate over the meaning of art, with Allen facing accusations that he had been deceptive in beating out other human artists with something he asked a machine to create.Text-to-image tools like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney have quickly increased in sophistication and become one of the hottest topics in AI. They can generate not just fake people, objects and locations but mimic entire visual styles. Users can demand the art piece look like a cartoon storybook or a historical diagram or an Associated Press photograph, and the system will do its best to oblige.But AI-generated art has been criticized as automated plagiarism, because it relies on millions of ingested art pieces that are then parroted en masse. It has also fueled deeper fears: of decimating people’s creative work, blurring the boundaries of reality or smothering human art.Allen said his art piece shows people need to “get past their denial and fear” of a technology that could empower new inventions and reshape our world. The AI, he said, “is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowBut he also struck a note of defiance at the critics he believed did not appreciate the profound message in his AI-generated art.“You said AI would never be as good as you, that AI would never do the work you do, and I said, ‘Oh really? How about this? I won,’” he said. “It’s here now. Recognize it. Stop denying the reality. AI isn’t going away.”***Allen, 39, lives south of his hometown of Colorado Springs and runs a company, Incarnate Games, that makes tabletop fantasy games. He went into the Air Force after high school and got a computer science degree at a Colorado technical school. He does not consider himself an artist and had never entered an arts competition before.Earlier this year, he said, he started noticing people posting more AI art on social media, but he had been initially skeptical to try it himself due to “spiritual reasons.” Elon Musk, he remembered, had compared AI to “summoning the demon,” and the practice felt like it could be “a gateway into communicating with the unknown.”“That’s what it feels like. This isn’t being created by a human,” Allen said Thursday while watching a jiujitsu tournament in Las Vegas. “There’s a lot to be said about the spiritual meddling of our reality. They would use anything they could to influence humanity.”But the art was just so intricate, he said, that he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He started playing with AI-powered art tools: WOMBO Dream, NightCafe, starryai. Then, someone invited him to Midjourney, and he became obsessed.The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to lifeMidjourney has become one of the most popular AI art generators largely because it allows anyone to freely create new images on command. Using the prompt “/imagine,” a user can type in whatever they want to see and the AI will return four newly created images in 60 seconds. The user can also ask the AI to improve, or “upscale,” the visual quality with new variations on the same idea.The start-up, which calls itself “an independent research lab … expanding the imaginative powers of the human species,” operates largely out of a 1-million-follower network on the chat service Discord, with rooms devoted to character creation, environments and “show and tell.”After paying for a corporate account, Allen started generating thousands of images, changing the text prompts with every creation. He experimented with new settings, scenarios and effects. He asked for images in the styles of Leonardo da Vinci and the American psychedelic artist Alex Grey.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe pieces that really caught his attention, though, were what he now calls his “space opera theater” series. He started with a simple mental image — “a woman in a Victorian frilly dress, wearing a space helmet” — and kept fine-tuning the prompts, “using tests to really make an epic scene, like out of a dream.” He said he spent 80 hours making more than 900 iterations of the art, adding words like “opulent” and “lavish” to fine tune its tone and feel. He declined to share the full series of words he used to create his art, saying it is his artistic product, and that he intends to publish it later. “If there’s one thing you can take ownership of, it’s your prompt,” he said.“I was like: Dude,” he said. “This is so sick! I want to see more of it! I’m addicted! I’m obsessed!”When he found images he really liked, he pulled them into Adobe Photoshop to remove visual artifacts. In one image, the central figure was missing a head, so he also painted in a crop of dark, wavy hair. He used another machine-learning tool, Gigapixel AI, to increase the photos’ quality and sharpness, then printed the three pieces on canvas — all variations on the French phrase for “space opera theater,” which he thought sounded cool — and drove to submit them to the state fair.When he looked at the pieces, he said, he saw “a supernatural reality … something we haven’t even been able to experience yet, past the great beyond.” But the pace of AI art is moving perhaps even faster than the internet. “You’re looking at art from a month ago,” he added. “In technology terms, that’s decades. This piece is antiquated compared to what Midjourney is doing now.”***The state fair in Pueblo, Colo., was an unlikely place for the writing of a new chapter in art history. The 150-year-old festival, known for its horse and livestock competitions, runs a series of more traditional art competitions, including for homemade dolls, quilts, porcelain art and needlework, as well as for the best canned carrots, medicinal remedies and holiday breads.Of the 596 entries in the “fine arts” competition, 21 amateur “emerging artists” submitted pieces of “digitally manipulated photography,” one of the fair’s newest categories. Asked what art materials he had used, Allen told state fair officials only that he used Midjourney — though he did not exactly go into detail, and no one seems to have asked.One of the judges, Dagny McKinley, an author and art historian who runs a playwright festival in nearby Steamboat Springs, remembers walking past Allen’s canvas and being immediately drawn to a piece that felt reminiscent of Renaissance art.“It had an immediate story: People looking out into another world, everyone with their backs to you, no one facing or engaging with the viewers,” she said. “You get interested: What are they seeing?”McKinley said she did not realize the art was AI-generated but said it wouldn’t have changed her judgment anyway; Allen, she said, “had a concept and a vision he brought to reality, and it’s really a beautiful piece.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSebastian Smee, The Washington Post’s art critic, said the piece’s textures and lighting are reminiscent of Gustave Moreau, a late 19th-century artist, associated with the Decadents, who influenced Edgar Degas and Henri Matisse. (He also recalled a quote from the artist Sol LeWitt, who said, “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.”)When Allen announced his victory himself on Midjourney’s Discord channel, saying he had spent “many weeks of fine tuning and curating,” the responses spiraled between muted excitement to outright dread. In a chat board devoted to philosophical debates, one user compared the win to “entering a marathon and driving a Lamborghini to the finish line.” Another user wrote that the “stunt” threatened to “get this tool banned and hated even more.”Ready or not, mass video deepfakes are comingThe win also triggered a flood of rage online. A tweet expressing profane dismay at Allen’s win has been liked more than 85,000 times. Another person tweeted, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.” Allen said he has also gotten “a lot of very nasty hate” in his online inboxes; on his game company’s Instagram profile, one user said he should return his award and “post a public apology before some MAJOR backlash comes your way.”Some of the frustration has come from how the tools were built: a similar tool, Stable Diffusion, was “trained” on 2 billion images taken from the internet, including from personal blogs and amateur-art sites like Flickr and DeviantArt.Allen, however, dismisses the point as shallow: “Where did you learn how to do your art? You looked at art. Whose art was it? You learned their techniques, you studied their art, you added it to your repertoire,” he said.Allen listed the pieces for $750 each, he said, and two were sold at the fair to unknown buyers, though he now frets that he should have charged far more, given that it could be “essentially a piece of art history.” On Discord, some users asked whether he should have been more explicit, to which Allen replied: “Did I have to?”Despite the online furor, Allen’s neighbors seemed more sanguine about adapting to AI. As far as anyone at the Colorado Department of Agriculture can tell, Allen did not break any rules. Pieces for the category are only required to involve “technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Digital filters, color-manipulation tools and the “recombination of images” are all expressly allowed.No one has filed an official grievance over the result, either, department spokeswoman Olga Robak said, though there has been an unrelated dispute in the fair’s goat-shearing contest.Robak, who studied art history, finds the controversy fascinating. “People put bananas on the wall and called it art,” she said. “Even photography was not considered an art form for a long time; people said it was just pushing a button, and now we realize it’s about composition, color, light. Who are we to say that AI is not the same way?”Don’t ask if the duct-tape banana is art. Ask if it’s any good.***Jessica Hair, a 25-year-old receptionist at a doctor’s office who won third place in the competition, said she did not feel Allen had acted unfairly and had no hard feelings about his win.Hair said her “Judge, Jury, Executioner,” which depicts a tuxedoed skeleton on a golden throne surrounded by skulls, took 15 hours to create with a stylus on an iPad Pro. But Allen’s piece took time, effort and subjective judgment, too, and “how do we qualify what is and isn’t art?” she said.She did wonder, though, if it might have broken the fair’s rules requiring all art to have been made by Colorado residents. Would the AI, wherever it exists, qualify?McKinley, the contest judge, said she understands the frustrations from some artists feeling spurned in their craft, and she believes the festival should consider a category purely devoted to AI art. But she sees such technology as opening up a new world of possibilities for artists — and as something it’d be better to embrace, since it isn’t going away.“It’s not going to take away from a beautiful painting or a sculpture you can touch,” she said. “It’s just one more tool we have to advance what we can create.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGregory Block, an oil painter in Denver who was not a part of the competition, said he finds it hard to imagine an AI generator supplanting the hundreds of hours — and all the “heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears” — he’s invested into his art. But he also thinks back to the artists that first inspired him, who used rudimentary devices like the camera lucida, in the 1800s, to aid their own designs.“That was thought of as cheating, too,” he said. “Yet they used it to make these incredible paintings: anatomically correct figures, beautiful soft lighting. … Those steps in technology are elemental to our art. Otherwise, we’d still be doing cave paintings with just our hands and blood.”The AI, he said, can imbue the art with a mysterious beauty, made all the more special because it is so hard to understand. But “the soul any of us can find in a piece of artwork, the emotion, the human struggle we identify with in art is always our own.”“It doesn’t have to necessarily be created out of a human soul, the artwork itself. It is for us to see and react to,” Block said. “We the viewers are, in the end, the ultimate artists. We’re the ones creating the world that is coming in through our eyeballs. That world is in our mind.”Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.Share770 Comments","[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Technology', 'position': 1, 'item': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/'}]",,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public%2FA3TGEPH7PVCIZCYJ3YBITBM42M_size-normalized.png&w=1600&h=900', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public%2FA3TGEPH7PVCIZCYJ3YBITBM42M_size-normalized.png&w=1800&h=1800', 'height': 1800, 'width': 1800}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public%2FA3TGEPH7PVCIZCYJ3YBITBM42M_size-normalized.png&w=800&h=600', 'height': 800, 'width': 600}]",,"{'@id': 'washingtonpost.com', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/img/wplogo_344x60_blk.png', 'width': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '344 px'}, 'height': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '60 px'}}, 'name': 'The Washington Post'}","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/02/midjourney-artificial-intelligence-state-fair-colorado/,,False,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Washington Post', 'productID': 'washingtonpost.com:basic', 'description': 'Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world, national news, entertainment and more.

 Without American chips from companies such as Nvidia and AMD, Chinese organisations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.Image recognition and natural language processing are common in consumer applications like smartphones that can answer queries and tag photos. They also have military uses such as scouring satellite imagery for weapons or bases and filtering digital communications for intelligence-gathering purposes.Nvidia said it had booked $400m in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule but has “no assurances” that US officials will grant them.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedDonald Trump’s run of good luck could end this weekend – if Joe Biden does the right thingJonathan FreedlandLiveMore Democrats call for Biden to exit 2024 race as president vows to return to campaign trail – liveJapan asks young people why they are not marrying amid population crisisLiveWindows IT outage live: CrowdStrike CEO ‘deeply sorry’ for global chaos caused by update and warns fix may take time to workMicrosoft Windows IT outage: more than 2,000 flights canceled across US; Fedex and UPS report service delays – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do more-highly cited journals have higher-quality peer review? Reviews are generally confidential and the definition of ‘quality’ is elusive, so this is a difficult question to answer. But researchers who used machine learning to study 10,000 peer-review reports in biomedical journals have tried. They invented proxy measures for quality, which they term thoroughness and helpfulness.

They offer specific solutions for recruiting personnel and cull applications “to leave a manageable number of resumes that meet a position’s requirements,” explains Carme Roselló, the coordinator of labor market projects at Barcelona Activa.First and foremost, automation allows for “fast screening,” says recruitment consultant Juan Gonzalez. Softgarden, the company he works for, currently processes 2 million applications a year for 40,000 recruiters. “There are companies that receive 400 candidates for one position. If you’re hiring for four jobs, how could you sift through 1,200 candidates at once?” he asks.Technologies like Softgarden, a Software as a Service (SaaS) system that allows candidates and companies to connect to applications installed in the cloud, “streamline tasks, accomplishing in 30 minutes what used to take two hours,” says González. He also points out the importance of “respecting the digital rights” set forth in European data protection regulations.One must “make sure that the resume includes the position’s keywords, because the algorithm works like a dictionary”The system “uses artificial intelligence to automatically collect data [by] searching for keywords in the text,” González notes. That’s why he recommends that candidates use a “textual resume, without columns or graphics, that have a simple format and list experience, education and languages in reverse chronological order. Applicants should avoid symbols, illustrations and diagrams because creativity works against us in ATS searches. The resume should be simple and use standard fonts like Arial or Verdana because machines don’t read them all equally well,” Roselló adds.One must “make sure that the position’s keywords appear on the resume, because the algorithm works like a dictionary to match different descriptions,” advises Jaume Alemany, the co-founder of the Etalentum recruitment company. His company just invested $497,650 to create the Robinson system, “a robot that can manage millions of data [bytes] and reduces the risk of automated discards.”Keywords and employee proximityRobinson’s algorithm is “based on information from more than 3,000 recruitment processes, so its learning system identifies the variables that companies consider most important. Even with the rise in telecommuting since the pandemic,” the first concern is employee proximity, Etalentum’s co-founder says. “Although it sounds ridiculous, it’s important to indicate the city where you live and where you want to work, if they’re not the same. For example, if you say that you work in [Los Angeles], but you want to move to [New York City] or take a job there, include the latter city, because otherwise the machine will discard your resume,” Softgarden consultant Juan González notes.Language can also be an important factor to bear in mind. “Depending on the position you’re applying for, it’s [generally] advisable to write your resume in two or three languages, especially in English, because there are machines that are better trained to read [that language],” Alemany points out.Because “recruitment processes are increasingly automated, especially when applications are initially received and screened, we need to personalize and optimize [our] resumes according to the job description and emphasize the information that’s most relevant to the position,” says Nilton Navarro, the brand manager at Infojobs.Carme Roselló notes that it’s essential for “a resume to contain the position’s keywords.” For that reason, she recommends researching the qualities that companies, or robots in this case, are seeking for a given position. “There are many ways to search for keywords,” she says. The most basic way is to analyze the terminology that companies use and find information about similar job profiles on networks like LinkedIn.To make sure that your resume isn’t discarded even though you meet the job requirements, you can avail yourself of tools such as Resume Worded or Zipjob. They let you “upload your resume to perform a scan and see if it would pass the ATS filter,” Roselló says. She also mentions Google’s “very interesting” Interview Warmup, which is “a key interview training tool that gives you information about the words used most frequently in the sector you’re targeting”; she says using it is “a great practice.” The expert insists that it’s important to “stay up to date” on these tricks, because “technology advances very quickly.” She notes that it’s unfortunate that automated systems sometimes discard “good candidates” because of “something outside [the applicants’] control.”The risk of algorithm biasThe proliferation of smart technology and automated decision systems “can jeopardize some working people’s fundamental rights and increase the risk of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or simply personal tastes ... that has an impact that goes beyond the digital world and can widen the social gap, especially among more vulnerable groups,” warns Digital Future Society’s director Cristina Colom.However, she notes that “companies’ use of algorithms and artificial intelligence is here to stay, so the solution isn’t to eliminate the technology but to better control how it’s used and ensure that it protects labor rights and equal opportunities to workplace access.”Colom says that it’s important to practice “technological humanism” from the get-go in designing these digital solutions. She advocates “integrating different visions to create them, with greater diversity in the design and programming teams in terms of gender, race and religion, as well as by discipline, broadening them to include areas such as psychology, anthropology and sociology, to ensure that the sources that feed AI aren’t biased.” Finally, she emphasizes that “technology can help us to be more efficient and effective, but it can never fully replace people.”Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Thursday, September 1, 2022

 


South Africa intends to enhance the teaching of robotics and coding in public schools through the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Institute.
Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said the AI Institute is being established in partnership with institutions of higher learning, in particular the Johannesburg Business School of the University of Johannesburg and the Tshwane University of Technology, which are co-founder institutions together with the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies.
“It is essential that we invest significantly to provide our youth with access to modern training, skill sets and formal education. To achieve this, our Department of Basic Education has introduced robotics and coding as school subjects in primary and high schools.
“At present, learners in over a 1 000 schools are designing and producing robots both for gaming and to complete tasks the learners find tedious for human completion.
“Next year, learners in these and additional schools that will join this category will compete in a National Robotics Development Challenge,” the Minister said on Thursday during the G20 Digital Economy Ministers Meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
Government’s focus on digital skills includes creating platforms to support and promote the ability of the youth, and small and medium enterprises, in particular start-ups to develop digital content.
“In this regard, South Africa will launch an App Store to be known as DigiTech on the 13 September 2022. We have undertaken to our sister countries within Africa to ensure that content producers from the rest of the Africa can have their Apps enrolled on the DigiTech App Store,” the Minister said.
Bridging the digital divide
With technology changing how people work and live, Ntshavheni said governments have the responsibility to continue to use technology as a primary catalyst for change in the world that should advance accessible public services, inclusive growth, and sustainable development.
She noted that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the negative impact of the digital divide in human development in particular the poor.
“In South Africa and the majority of the developing world, in particular in Africa, where the poor remained unconnected, the poor were severely marginalised during the COVID-19 pandemic because they were excluded from accessing basic services such as education, health and ability to work.
“It is for this reason that we prioritised and concluded the licensing of the high demand spectrum and also secured the commitment of our telecommunications regulator to ensure that the Frequency Spectrum licence holders contribute towards the national broadband penetration objectives by connecting key public institutions such as schools, health facilities, and traditional authorities.
“In addition, this year we will finalise the roadmap towards the deployment of 4G and 5G networks including to rural towns. We continue to work to attain the objectives of our South Africa Connect programme to ensure that we attain universal access to the internet by 2024,” the Minister said.
Government is also extending email addresses to all learners/students in public schools and their parents as part of requirements of basic e-learning. – SAnews.gov.za

While the development has reignited the fierce debate over AI in art, the man behind the artwork is unfazed. Amid criticism, he told The New York Times, “I’m not going to apologise for it…I won, and I didn’t break any rules.” Artwork and the winner The winner, Jason Allen, is president of Colorado-based tabletop gaming company Incarnate Games. He won in the digital art category with a work called “Théâtre D'opéra Spatial” or ‘Space Opera Theater’. As the title suggests, the artwork depicts a space setting with figures in robes looking out through a viewport. The work brings together space opera and classical Baroque elements. How was the artwork created? It was created using Midjourney, which is an AI software that converts text prompts into visual images. The beta version of the software was available from July 2022 and it has allowed users with no training in art to create highly detailed artworks. Critics of AI-generated art, such as this one, argue that converting prompts into art is like painting-by-numbers, which means that there is no real artistry or skill involved. Midjourney, in a matter of minutes, can create a digital artwork that would ordinarily take hours, if not days. “Users type a series of words in a message to Midjourney; the bot spits back an image seconds later,” The NYT noted. AI threat to art? After Allen’s post about his award-winning artwork made it to Twitter, it was met with severe backlash. “This is so gross,” a user wrote. “I can see how AI art can be beneficial, but claiming you’re an artist by generating one? Absolutely not.” Yet another tweet went, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete.” The winner’s defence Midjourney typically creates a number of versions using the prompts and users choose the best outcomes. Allen reportedly had hundreds of iterations of which he chose the top three, and printed them on canvas. According to reports, he submitted it in the digital art category under the name “Jason M Allen via Midjourney”, which meant that he had disclosed the nature of the artwork to the judges. Furthermore, as The New York Times reported, the category’s rules allow any “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” This could mean that using AI programs to create art is no different from using other software such as Photoshop. The judges, however, were unaware that Midjourney was an AI program but went on to state that they would have declared Allen as the winner even if they had. Many believe that the increasing popularity of AI-based will lead to the creation of a separate category that keeps it distinct from other forms of digital art.",,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,,,,,en,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}",,"['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEDFSxHHOW1PpBccdSxOTA']","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,,,2024.0,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",,,,,,1932,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-19,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/09/ai-art-1.jpg', 'caption': 'Jason Allen&#039;s “Théâtre D&#039;opéra Spatial” or ‘Space Opera Theater’.

Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.In August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division's ""digital arts/digitally manipulated photography"" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition.His winning image, titled Théâtre D'opéra Spatial (French for Space Opera Theatre), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A US$300 ($440) prize accompanied his win.READ MORE: RBA tipped for 'super-sized' cash rate increase as cost of living crisis bitesIn August, Jason M Allen won first place in the emerging artist division's ""digital arts/digitally manipulated photography"" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. (Courtesy Jason M Allen) (Courtesy Jason M Allen)""I'm fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,"" Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.Allen's winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It's one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use ""digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process"". Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research's Imagen and OpenAI's DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.READ MORE: Melbourne mural criticised as 'utterly offensive' to Ukrainians
The newness of these tools, how they're used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney's Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen's win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice's Motherboard reported earlier this week.""This sucks for the exact same reason we don't let robots participate in the Olympics,"" one Twitter user wrote.
""This is the literal definition of 'pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece',"" another Tweeted.""AI artwork is the 'banana taped to the wall' of the digital world now.""Yet while Allen didn't use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.""It's not like you're just smashing words together and winning competitions,"" he said.You can feed a phrase like ""an oil painting of an angry strawberry"" to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen's process wasn't that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.First, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said.Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and colour harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images.He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless.Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.""Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognise that it's a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,"" Allen said.Cal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen's piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn't realise that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a ""beautiful piece"".Near-complete dinosaur skeleton sells for 10 times predictionView Gallery""I think there's a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,"" he said.Allen won't yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he's planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.Continue readingArtificial IntelligenceartsTechcompetitionWorldUSACONTACT USSend your stories to contact@9news.com.auProperty News: Watch as the ocean creeps in to swallow this waterfront mansion.

Intel plans to launch several initiatives such as &#039;AI for future workforce&#039; and &#039;AI for current workforce&#039; by the end of this year with an aim to build skill-ready workforce, Shweta Khurana, senior director – Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ), government partnerships and initiatives, global government affairs, Intel told FE Education Online. “AI for future workforce will cater to 18 years and above and AI for current workforce is for professionals with primary focus on women driven small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” Khurana said. The programme will be delivered virtually by an Intel certified coach. As per the company, the curriculum designed for AI for future workforce is technical; however; students does not require any prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, projects under the programme are focussed on industrial impacts such as common trade application, predictive maintenance, viral post protection, insurance fraud protection among others. “Through virtual training in a real-world environment for three months learners will be exposed to the challenges, and how to build solutions for the same,” Khurana added. Earlier initiatives from Intel included Intel AI for youth, Responsible AI for Youth and Building AI Readiness among Young Innovators. Under these three initiatives, over 3,50,000 students have been trained with AI skills since 2019. Under Intel AI for youth programmes the learners acquire technical skills in data science, computer vision and natural language processes as well as social skills focused on AI ethics and biases and AI solutions-building. For this, Intel has collaborated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and the Ministry of Education (MoE) and AI curriculum for students, setting up focused AI skill labs, and creation of AI-readiness by skilling facilitators in CBSE schools. Responsible AI for youth initiative empowers government school students between eight to 12th grade with a new-age technology mindset, relevant skill sets, and access to required tools. Intel has collaborated with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEitY), Government of India (GoI), National e-Governance Division (NeGD), to launch this programme. In July 2021, Intel launched the AI For All initiative in collaboration with the MoE&nbsp; with the purpose of creating a basic understanding of AI for everyone in India. AI For All is a four hour, self-paced learning program that demystifies AI in an inclusive manner. It is applicable to a student or a stay-at-home parent, a professional in any field or even a senior citizen. The programme is aimed to demystify AI for one million Indian citizens in its first year. Furthermore, in March 2022, Intel joined hands with the Department of Science and Technology (DST), GoI for its programme ‘Building AI Readiness among Young Innovators’ that aims to build digital readiness among students between six to 10 grade enrolled under DST’s INSPIRE – Awards MANAK scheme. The programme aims to build an AI-ready generation to empower students with the knowledge and skills to leverage AI in an inclusive way.

One is what I call blue-sky visionaries who speculate about the future possibilities of the technology, invoking utopian fantasies to generate excitement. Blue-sky ideas are compelling but are often clouded over by unrealistic visions and the ethical challenges of what can and should be built.In contrast, what I call muddy-boots pragmatists are problem- and solution-focused. They want to reduce the harms that widely used AI-infused systems can create. They focus on fixing biased and flawed systems, such as in facial recognition systems that often mistakenly identify people as criminals or violate privacy. The pragmatists want to reduce deadly medical mistakes that AI can make, and steer self-driving cars to be safe-driving cars. Their goal is also to improve AI-based decisions about mortgage loans, college admissions, job hiring and parole granting.As a computer science professor with a long history of designing innovative applications that have been widely implemented, I believe that the blue-sky visionaries would benefit by taking the thoughtful messages of the muddy-boots realists. Combining the work of both camps is more likely to produce the beneficial outcomes that will lead to successful next-generation technologies.While the futuristic thinking of the blue-sky speculators sparks our awe and earns much of the funding, muddy-boots thinking reminds us that some AI applications threaten privacy, spread misinformation and are decidedly racist, sexist and otherwise ethically dubious. Machines are undeniably part of our future, but will they serve all future humans equally? I think the caution and practicality of the muddy-boots camp will benefit humanity in the short and long run by ensuring diversity and equality in the development of the algorithms that increasingly run our day-to-day lives. If blue-sky thinkers integrate the concerns of muddy-boots realists into their designs, they can create future technologies that are more likely to advance human values, rights and dignity.Blue-sky thinking started early in the development of AI. The literature was dominated by authors who pioneered the technology and heralded its inevitable transformation of society. The “fathers” of AI are usually considered to be Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy from MIT and Allen Newell and Herb Simon from Carnegie Mellon University. They gathered at meetings, such as the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, generating enthusiasm exemplified by Simon’s 1965 prediction that ""machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.”There have been many other contributors to AI, including the three Turing Award winners in 2018: Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. Their work on deep-learning algorithms was an important contribution, but their continued celebrations of AI’s importance and inevitability included Hinton’s troubling 2016 quote that “people should stop training radiologists now. It’s just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” A more human-centered view is that deep-learning algorithms will become another tool, like mammograms and blood tests, that empower radiologists and other clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses and offer more appropriate treatment plans.Recommended StoriesArtificial Intelligence Will Let Humanity Talk to Alien CivilizationsFranck Marchis & Ignacio G. López-FrancosParis Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass SurveillanceAnne Toomey McKenna & The Conversation USChatGPT Isn’t ‘Hallucinating’—It’s Bullshitting!Joe Slater, James Humphries & Michael Townsen HicksThe Nash Equilibrium Is the Optimal Poker Strategy. Expert Players Don’t Always Use ItJack MurtaghThe theme of robots replacing people, thereby creating widespread unemployment, was legitimized by a 2013 report from Oxford University, which claimed that 47 percent of all jobs could be automated. Futurist Martin Ford’s 2015 book Rise of the Robots latched on to this idea, painting a troubling picture of low- and high-skilled jobs becoming so completely automated that governments would have to supply a universal basic income because there would be few jobs left. The reality is that well-designed automation increases productivity, which lowers prices, raises demand and brings benefits to many people. These changes trigger a parallel phenomenon of vigorous creation of new jobs, which has helped lead to the current high levels of employment in the U.S. and some other nations.Yes, there were authors who offered cautionary tales and a different vision, such as MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason, but these were exceptions.The muddy-boots pragmatists started a new wave of thoughtful AI critiques. They shifted the discussion from blue-sky optimism to clearly identifying the threats to human dignity, fairness and democracy. Op-Ed pieces and a 2016 White House symposium were helpful initiatives, and mathematician Cathy O’Neil’s 2016 book Weapons of Math Destruction broadened the audience. She focused on how opaque AI algorithms could be harmful when applied at scale to decide on parole, mortgage and job applications. O’Neil’s powerful examples promoted human-centered thinking.Other books, such as Ruha Benjamin’s Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, followed on how algorithms needed to be changed to increase economic opportunities and decrease racial bias.Social psychologist Shoshanna Zuboff’s 2019 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism showed the change from Google’s early motto of “Don’t be evil” to calculated efforts “to obfuscate these processes and their implications.” Zuboff’s solution was to call for a change in business models, democratic oversight and privacy sanctuaries. Scholar Kate Crawford delivered another devastating muddy-boots analysis in her 2021 book Atlas of AI, which focused on the extractive and destructive power of AI on jobs, the environment, human relationships and democracy. She refined her message in a captivating lecture for the National Academy of Engineering, describing constructive actions that AI researchers and implementers could take, while encouraging government regulation and individual efforts to protect privacy.Muddy-boots activists are gaining recognition for their positive research contributions, which offer clever designs that benefit people. In October 2021, Cynthia Rudin received the $1 million prize for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Her work on interpretable forms of AI was a response to the bewildering complexity of opaque black box algorithms, which made it hard for people to understand why they were rejected for paroles, mortgages or jobs.Many of the muddy-boots thinkers are women, but men have also spoken up about the need for humane oversight. Technology pioneer Jaron Lanier also raises concerns in his Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, which identifies the harms from social media and suggests users take more control over their use of it. Legal scholar Frank Pasquale’s New Laws of Robotics explains why AI developers should value human expertise, avoid technological arms races and take responsibility for the technologies they create. However, ensuring human control by way of human-centered designs will take substantial changes in national policies, business practices, research agendas and educational curricula.The diverse workers of this camp—including women, nonbinary people, people with disabilities and people of color—have important messages to ensure that the blue-sky dreams can be channeled into realizable products and services that benefit people and preserve the environment.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsBen Shneiderman is an emeritus professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and author of the recently published book Human-Centered AI (Oxford University Press).More by Ben Shneiderman",,,Scientific American,"['https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?w=1200', 'https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?crop=16%3A9%2Csmart&w=1920', 'https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?crop=4%3A3%2Csmart&w=1200', 'https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?crop=1%3A1%2Csmart&w=1000']",https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/22E97650-2BE9-415C-AA563D9DAA3589B0_source.jpg?w=1200,"{'@id': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/#publisher', 'name': 'Scientific American'}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-needs-both-pragmatists-and-blue-sky-visionaries/', 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence Needs Both Pragmatists and Blue-Sky Visionaries', 'item': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-needs-both-pragmatists-and-blue-sky-visionaries/'}]}}",,False,,,,Artificial Intelligence Needs Both Pragmatists and Blue-Sky Visionaries,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/static/sciam.svg'}",https://www.scientificamerican.com/masthead/,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39379', 'https://www.jstor.org/publisher/sciamerican', 'https://x.com/sciam', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/SciAmerican', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@scientificamerican', 'https://www.threads.net/@scientific_american', 'https://www.facebook.com/ScientificAmerican/']",,,,,"{'@id': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/#publisher', 'name': 'Scientific American'}",,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': '1 New York Plaza', 'addressLocality': 'New York', 'addressRegion': 'NY', 'postalCode': '10004', 'addressCountry': 'US'}",SciAm,,,,,1845-08-28,,,,,,,,"Scientific American, a Division of Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,

Skift Take
Airlines aiming for total revenue optimization need intelligent solutions. While artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms promise better forecasting capabilities, those systems can only truly shine when coupled with the flexibility and human touch of a data analyst.

Commercial airlines and other travel and transportation leaders are facing significant challenges in managing pricing, demand, and logistics in today’s volatile environment. This summer’s travel disruptions have laid bare the potential for intermittent hiccups in post-pandemic operations to have drastic effects on customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities.
With travelers’ patience wearing thin, airlines need to reinforce their people, processes, and technologies. By building artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into processes across their organizations, airlines can leverage their data, analysts, and revenue management opportunities to take advantage of new business fundamentals in this changing environment.
“Artificial intelligence isn’t replacing the airline data analyst’s job,” said Alex Mans, founder and CEO of FLYR Labs, a technology company driving commercial optimization for airlines. “But it is changing their role and hopefully unlocking their potential to drive revenue and improve operational efficiencies.”
Intelligence on Demand
Airline data can be difficult to parse, but artificial intelligence makes it easier. It’s impossible for humans to manually process all the information airlines are collecting from digital sources, but deep learning neural networks can provide effective forecasts that give analysts the confidence to make better decisions.
“Historically, the leading forecasting type has been linear, regression-based models, where analysts look at very concentrated year-over-year patterns,” Mans said. “The problem is that there’s just not enough data on any single flight for a given point in time to drive accurate forecasts in a volatile environment. Legacy systems are really bad at determining whether booking one seat on a given flight has a meaningful impact on the outcome.”
To power deep learning algorithms, airlines feed neural networks vast amounts of historical data — such as bookings, searches, events, promotions, and competitive prices — resulting in forecasts that keep analysts better informed on revenue and load-factor performance into the future.
“They can compare how the actual performance builds against the forecast data as the departure date approaches,” Mans said. “The real value comes when, with a platform such as ours, analysts come to trust the forecast and can start using it to inform strategic decisions instead of viewing it as a loose guideline.”
Unlocking the Full Potential of Analysts
According to Mans, artificial intelligence should be thought of as an airline data analyst’s smart sidekick — it’s not replacing the analyst’s job, but rather enhancing the analyst’s ability to make coordinated operational decisions in areas where automation alone is insufficient.
“In the past, analysts have not had accurate forecasts, so most of their decisions were based on instinct,” Mans said. “On top of that, they haven’t had good user interfaces for consuming that data. We generate much better forecasts, enable smarter workflows, and provide a dedicated user interface where analysts can easily access and filter the data and then use the resulting information. With better load and revenue forecasts at any level of granularity across the network, they can do amazing things.”
For example, if an analyst sees a cluster of flights months into the future with a 99-percent forecasted load factor, they can alert colleagues in charge of scheduling and suggest adding capacity. At most airlines, where functions across the organizations are typically siloed, this kind of cross-functional collaboration between commercial teams isn’t common.
“All it takes to start breaking down those silos is for other teams to have access to the same information that the revenue management team has access to,” Mans said. “At the end of the day, different departments are trying to achieve the same results: maximize revenue and contain costs.”
In addition to playing gatekeeper of that information, the analyst’s role will evolve to support a variety of critical functions across the organization.
“For one thing, they can look around corners that the data itself can’t see,” Mans said. “The analyst might know that a schedule change is coming, but unless that information is passed to our system, we have no awareness. Artificial intelligence doesn’t know everything. Another thing to note is that optimizing for maximum revenue isn’t always the goal. An airline entering a new market may want to follow a non-revenue-optimal strategy focused on market control or market share, so the analyst is needed to fine-tune that strategy. Or consider promotions — every airline runs tons of promotions throughout the year, whether tied to their credit card program, certain destinations, or other variables that require the analyst to actively work with our platform and their marketing team to achieve the best results.”
Leveraging New Business Fundamentals
For airlines to weather the storm of today’s unprecedented industry disruptions, dynamic pricing powered by deep learning algorithms is essential. FLYR was built to provide a singular platform that helps airlines manage data, break past data silos with consistently accurate forecasts that can be accessed by anybody in the organization, and achieve total revenue management across all of their products.
“Our job is to help airlines effectively price everything they want to sell, including ancillaries like seat selection, extra baggage, priority boarding, and other upsells,” Mans said. “FLYR’s operating system provides a vertically integrated SaaS platform across data management, forecasting, pricing, automation, business intelligence, and reporting — which includes simulation and scenario evaluation — while also removing constraints within e-commerce and fulfillment thanks to acquisitions such as Newshore so airlines can get stuff done faster and more efficiently. That’s what we’re building as a company, and that’s the future of work within this industry.”

After the celebrated victory of AlexNet at the LSVRC2012 classification contest, deep residual network (ResNet) was arguably the most groundbreaking work in the computer vision and deep learning community in the last few years. ResNet makes it possible to train up to hundreds or even thousands of layers and still achieve a compelling performance.
What Is a Residual Network (ResNet)?ResNet is an artificial neural network that introduced a so-called “identity shortcut connection,” which allows the model to skip one or more layers. This approach makes it possible to train the network on thousands of layers without affecting performance. It’s become one of the most popular architectures for various computer vision tasks.
Taking advantage of its powerful representational ability, the performance of many computer vision applications — other than image classification — have been boosted, including object detection and facial recognition.
Since ResNet blew people’s minds in 2015, many in the research community have dived into the secrets of its success, and several refinements have been made in the architecture. In the first part of this article, I am going to give a little bit of background knowledge for those who are unfamiliar with ResNet, and in the second half, I will review some of the papers I read recently regarding different variants and interpretations of the ResNet architecture.
 
What Is ResNet?
According to the universal approximation theorem, given enough capacity, we know that a feedforward network with a single layer is sufficient to represent any function. However, the layer might be massive, and the network is prone to overfitting the data. Therefore, there is a common trend in the research community that our network architecture needs to go deeper.
Since AlexNet, the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is going deeper and deeper. While AlexNet had only five convolutional layers, the VGG network and GoogleNet (also codenamed Inception_v1) had 19 and 22 layers respectively.
However, you can’t simply stack layers together to increase network depth. Deep networks are hard to train because of the notorious vanishing gradient problem. As the gradient is backpropagated to earlier layers, repeated multiplication may make the gradient infinitely small. As a result, the deeper the network goes, the more its performance becomes saturated or even starts rapidly degrading.
Before ResNet, there had been several ways to deal with the vanishing gradient issue. For instance, GoogleNet adds an auxiliary loss in a middle layer for extra supervision, but none of those solutions seemed to really tackle the problem once and for all.
The core idea of ResNet is that it introduced a so-called “identity shortcut connection” that skips one or more layers.
The authors of the study on deep residual learning for image recognition argue that stacking layers shouldn’t degrade the network performance because we could simply stack identity mappings — a layer that doesn’t do anything — on top of the current network, and the resulting architecture would perform the same. This indicates that the deeper model should not produce a training error higher than its shallower counterparts. They hypothesize that letting the stacked layers fit a residual mapping is easier than letting them directly fit the desired underlying mapping. And the residual block above explicitly allows it to do precisely that.
As a matter of fact, ResNet was not the first to make use of shortcut connections. The authors of a study on Highway Network also introduced gated shortcut connections. These parameterized gates control how much information is allowed to flow across the shortcut. A similar idea can be found in the report on long short-term memory (LSTM) cell, in which there is a parameterized forget gate that controls how much information will flow to the next time step. Therefore, ResNet can be thought of as a special case of highway network.
However, experiments show that the highway network performs no better than ResNet, which is unusual because the solution space of highway network contains ResNet. Therefore, it should perform at least as good as ResNet. This suggests that it is more important to keep these “gradient highways” clear than to go for a larger solution space.
Following this intuition, the authors of deep residual learning for image recognition refined the residual block and proposed in a study on identity mappings in deep ResNets a pre-activation variant of residual block, in which the gradients can flow unimpeded through the shortcut connections to any other earlier layer. In fact, using the original residual block in image recognition study, training a 1202-layer ResNet resulted in a worse performance than its 110-layer counterpart.
The authors of identity mappings in deep ResNets demonstrated with experiments that they can now train a 1001-layer deep ResNet to outperform its shallower counterparts. Because of its compelling results, ResNet quickly became one of the most popular architectures for various computer vision tasks.

ResNet Architecture Variants and Interpretations
As ResNet gains popularity in the research community, its architecture is getting studied heavily. In this section, I will first introduce several new architectures based on ResNet, then introduce a paper that provides an interpretation of treating ResNet as an ensemble of many smaller networks.
 
ResNeXt
The authors in a study on aggregated residual transformations for deep neural networks proposed a variant of ResNet that is codenamed ResNeXt.
It is very similar to the inception module that the authors from the study on going deeper with convolutions came up with in 2015. They both follow the split-transform-merge paradigm, except in this variant, the outputs of different paths are merged by adding them together, while in the 2015 study, they are depth-concatenated. Another difference is that in the study on going deeper with convolutions, each path is different (1x1, 3x3 and 5x5 convolution) from each other, while in this architecture, all paths share the same topology.
The authors introduced a hyper-parameter called cardinality — the number of independent paths — to provide a new way of adjusting the model capacity. Experiments show that accuracy can be gained more efficiently by increasing the cardinality than by going deeper or wider. The authors state that compared to inception, this novel architecture is easier to adapt to new data sets and tasks, as it has a simple paradigm and only one hyper-parameter needs to be adjusted.  Inception, however, has many hyper-parameters (like the kernel size of the convolutional layer of each path) to tune. This novel building block has three equivalent forms.
In practice, the “split-transform-merge” is usually done via a pointwise grouped convolutional layer, which divides its input into groups of feature maps and performs normal convolution respectively. Their outputs are depth-concatenated and then fed to a 1x1 convolutional layer.
 
Densely Connected CNN
Another team of researchers in 2016 proposed a novel architecture called DenseNet that further exploits the effects of shortcut connections. It connects all layers directly with each other. In this novel architecture, the input of each layer consists of the feature maps of all earlier layer, and its output is passed to each subsequent layer. The feature maps are aggregated with depth-concatenation.
Other than tackling the vanishing gradients problem, the authors of “Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks” argue that this architecture also encourages feature reuse, making the network highly parameter-efficient. One simple interpretation of this is that, in the studies on deep residual learning for image recognition and identity mappings in deep ResNetts the output of the identity mapping was added to the next block, which might impede information flow if the feature maps of two layers have very different distributions. Therefore, concatenating feature maps can preserve them all and increase the variance of the outputs, encouraging feature reuse
Following this paradigm, we know that the l_th layer will have k * (l-1) + k_0 input feature maps, where k_0 is the number of channels in the input image. The authors used a hyper-parameter called growth rate (k) to prevent the network from growing too wide. They also used a 1x1 convolutional bottleneck layer to reduce the number of feature maps before the expensive 3x3 convolution. 
 
Deep Network with Stochastic Depth
Although ResNet has proven powerful in many applications, one major drawback is that a deeper network usually requires weeks for training, making it practically infeasible in real-world applications. To tackle this issue, the researchers for a study on “Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth” introduced a counter-intuitive method of randomly dropping layers during training and using the full network in testing.
The authors used the residual block as their network’s building block. Therefore, during training, when a particular residual block is enabled, its input flows through both the identity shortcut and the weight layers, otherwise the input only flows through the identity shortcut. In training time, each layer has a “survival probability” and is randomly dropped. In testing time, all blocks are kept active and re-calibrated according to its survival probability during training.
Formally, let H_l be the output of the l_th residual block, f_l be the mapping defined by the l_th block’s weighted mapping, b_l  be a Bernoulli random variable that can only be a one or zero (indicating whether a block is active), during training:

When b_l = 1, this block becomes a normal residual block. And when b_l = 0, the above formula becomes:

Since we know that H_(l-1) is the output of a ReLU, which is already non-negative, the above equation reduces to an identity layer that only passes the input through to the next layer:

Let p_l be the survival probability of layer l during training, during test time, we have:

The authors applied a linear decay rule to the survival probability of each layer. They argue that since earlier layers extract low-level features that will be used by later ones, they should not be dropped too frequently. The resulting rule therefore becomes:

Where L denotes the total number of blocks, thus p_L is the survival probability of the last residual block and is fixed to 0.5 throughout experiments. Also note that in this setting, the input is treated as the first layer (l = 0) and thus, is never dropped. The overall framework over stochastic depth training is demonstrated in the figure below.
Similar to Dropout, training a deep network with stochastic depth can be viewed as training an ensemble of many smaller ResNets. The difference is that this method randomly drops an entire layer while Dropout only drops part of the hidden units in one layer during training.
Experiments show that training a 110-layer ResNet with stochastic depth results in better performance than training a constant-depth 110-layer ResNet, while also dramatically reducing the training time. This suggests that some of the layers (paths) in ResNet might be redundant.

ResNet as an Ensemble of Smaller Networks
In the study on deep networks with stochastic depth, the researchers proposed a counter-intuitive way of training a very deep network that involved randomly dropping its layers during training and using the full network in testing time. The researchers of the study, “Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks” had an even more counter-intuitive finding. We can actually drop some of the layers of a trained ResNet and still have comparable performance. This makes the ResNet architecture even more interesting, as the study authors also dropped layers of a VGG network and degraded its performance dramatically.
This study first provides an unraveled view of ResNet to make things clearer. After we unroll the network architecture, it is quite clear that a ResNet architecture with i residual blocks has 2^i different paths (because each residual block provides two independent paths).
Given that finding, it is quite clear why removing a couple of layers in a ResNet architecture doesn’t compromise its performance too much. The architecture has many independent effective paths and the majority of them remain intact after we remove a couple of layers. On the contrary, the VGG network has only one effective path, so removing a single layer compromises this one. As shown in the study’s extensive experiments.
The authors also conducted experiments to show that the collection of paths in ResNet have ensemble-like behavior. They did so by deleting different numbers of layers at test time, and checked to see if the performance of the network smoothly correlated with the number of deleted layers. The results suggested that the network indeed behaves like an ensemble.
Finally, the authors looked into the characteristics of the paths in ResNet.
It is apparent that the distribution of all possible path lengths follows a binomial distribution. The majority of paths go through 19 to 35 residual blocks.
The authors also conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between path length and the magnitude of the gradients flowing through it. To get the magnitude of gradients in the path of length k, the authors first fed a batch of data to the network and randomly sampled k residual blocks. When backpropagating the gradients, they propagated through the weight layer only for the sampled residual blocks. Their graphs show that the magnitude of gradients decreases rapidly as the path becomes longer.
We can now multiply the frequency of each path length with its expected magnitude of gradients to get a feel for how many paths of each length contribute to training. Surprisingly, most contributions come from paths of length nine to 18, but they constitute only a tiny portion of the total paths. This is a very interesting finding, as it suggests that ResNet did not solve the vanishing gradients problem for very long paths, and that ResNet actually enables training very deep networks by shortening its effective paths.
In this article, I revisited the compelling ResNet architecture and briefly explained the intuitions behind its recent success. I hope it helps strengthen your understanding of this groundbreaking work.

 As AI art generators take the world by storm, some people wonder if it should count as art at all. The technology is still evolving and has some wrinkles to iron out, which means there are indeed flaws to consider alongside the incredible artwork a good artificial intelligence can produce. 







 Let’s explore the issue by breaking down the definition of art and whether or not AI-based work fits within that umbrella. 


 What Is Art? 
 Starting with the etymology of the word, Merriam-Webster’s definition states that “art” stems from the Latin word “ars”, which means, among other things, acquired skill, craftsmanship, and artistic achievement. 

 Today, there’s little consensus between philosophers and artists as to what real art is. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains regarding modern interpretations, there are two conventionalist definitions: 

 An artwork is an artifact made for the public to experience.  It is an evolution of works that came before.  

 At the same time, traditionalism values an artwork’s functionality, while hybrid theories see something as art if it meets certain conditions, such as embodying a function of a central art form of a particular time, whether it was intentional or not. 






 

 Besides several definitions of art, an important lesson to take away is that even experts have different opinions as to what “real” art means. The matter is clearly subjective, so you can’t definitively classify the works of AI engines. 



 How Is AI Art Created? 
 A major part of AI-generated art and its technology was the development of artificial neural networks (ANN) from the mid-1900s onwards. 

 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were then invented in 2015, which led to Google’s Alexander Mordvintsev putting them to work in his DeepDream algorithm alongside convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a type of ANN. 






 According to The MIT Press Reader’s article on DeepDream, ConvNets are fed millions of images and their descriptions until the networks can effectively recognize, for example, faces, dog breeds, and patterns in data. 

 Mordvintsev kept training his models of algorithms with a range of datasets and text-to-image prompts until DeepDream started producing beautiful and mind-bending images. This is at the heart of AI art generators: streams of information, from pictures to dates and alt text, that help them classify different visuals and then reproduce them as directed by a written prompt. 

 The technology evolved further thanks to companies like OpenAI and its Dall-E program, one of the best platforms for creating images using AI. We also have Midjourney pushing the boundaries of digital art, as well as mobile apps like Wombo Dream’s AI art creator. 







 

 At the end of the day, AI art generators use deep learning to absorb pre-existing information and understand what different objects, textures, or concepts look like. 



 Why AI-Generated Art Is Not Considered Real Art 
 With a basic understanding of the technology behind AI art generators and definitions of real art, we can work out where these digital creations fit in the art world. It’s an important task that can benefit other mainstream fields of artificial intelligence like text-to-video AI generators and social media features like TikTok’s AI greenscreen filter. 

 Artificial Intelligence Lacks Emotions That Fuel Art 
 Ultimately, art is classed as the product of imagination, skill, experience, and emotion, usually meant to represent something and for the public to enjoy. 






 But there are human creations that don’t tick any of these boxes and yet are considered art because people made them. They spent time and effort putting their inner worlds onto that canvas, sculpture, or composition. 

 Machine intelligence also puts a lot of work into sorting through tons of data, linking someone’s prompt to datasets, and trying to represent it as best as possible. The difference is that the AI is compelled by commands, not an emotional need to express itself. 

 AI Art Isn’t Original 
 Then, there’s the matter of originality. AI generators use pre-existing images and often merge them to illustrate a requested subject, concept, artistic form, and so on. Even among manmade artworks, some experts consider true art as that which is unique and emotive in a way never encountered before. 

    





 Unfortunately, although complete originality does happen in human art, much of it is a recurrence of existing styles—not that different from what artificial intelligence does. So, “originality” is as subjective as “real art”. 

 And it’s not just artistic patterns throughout history that inspire people, but also things like memories, symbols, language, and cultural themes, all multisensory data that the brain—an organic neural network—processes. 

 Looking through TEDxMileHigh’s list of research on imagination confirms that this essential part of creativity comes down to cognitive association, using the complex computer in your head to form links between what you know and what you want to express or experience. 

 AI-Generated Art Complicates Copyright 
 AI art involves a program mimicking the work of existing artists to create a new piece as per the request of a human, but who didn’t use that all-important emotive creativity discussed above. 





 So, who made the artwork, the machine or its user? And can the original artists sue for copyright violation? Such questions complicate the merging of artificial intelligence and the art industry, while fuelling arguments against recognizing AI-generated art as marketable artistic products. 

 This problem does show that the art world needs a more careful infrastructure when it comes to incorporating AI art, but it doesn’t diminish the aesthetic merit of such artwork. 



 Why AI-Generated Art Is Real Art 
 It’s true that human artists bring more original and emotive expression to the table. AI-based generators, however, can produce images that are just as impressive. Here are the best reasons why they should count as real art. 

 Machines Develop Artistic Skills Like Humans Do 
 An algorithm can’t immediately create art that accurately represents a prompt. It needs to collect data and learn from it, improving its understanding like a human would. 






    

 Users’ approval and rejection of created images also affect some models, so they improve their skills even more through trial and error. The more they’re used, the better they’re able to satisfy prompts. 

 In other words, AI artwork can be seen as craftsmanship and artistic achievement, something these programs and their developers should be proud of. 

 AI Art Can Move and Inspire 
 It can take a few tries to get the art you imagined, but use one of the best AI text-to-image generators like NightCafe and you’ll often end up with outstanding results. 

 Whether it’s exactly what you wanted or not, AI art creators can surprise you with images that are beautiful, surreal, chilling, or hyperrealistic. In a way, the machine uses its imagination and can often exceed your expectations. 





 So, even though emotions don’t motivate programs and their art, these creations can draw emotions out of you and even give you ideas for further expression. Isn’t that a key function of real art? 

 AI-Generated Artworks Are an Evolution of Art and Society 
 Finally, digital art is a modern medium and form of expression, as well as a reflection of contemporary society. It is relevant and impactful, whether it’s a person or a machine creating it. 

 Additionally, the works of art that AI generators produce come from millions of data sources, old and new. Even if your results only combine a few pre-existing images or styles, they are a blend of art history. 

 At the same time, they serve as a mirror of society, considering all the data an AI learns from to create pictures, text, and other materials, comes from what people say, do, and post online. It's one of several risks of artificial intelligence to keep in mind. 








 Real Art Is Subjective 
 Artificial intelligence is meant to make people’s lives better. Instead of hiring an expensive graphic designer or learning to draw yourself, for example, a program can create stunning art for you. 

 You can edit photos, write articles, and more with the help of AI tools, but they’re never perfect. There are still limits to their capabilities, which simply demands that you pay attention when using them, not completely avoid them. 

 Similarly, the flaws of AI art generators aren’t enough to justify not considering their creations real art. As a new part of the art world, they just need better integration.

Just type any combination of words into the prompt field, choose an art style and click “create.”What’s your reaction to the generator’s creation?In your opinion, how do A.I.-generated pictures like these compare to an original piece of artwork that an artist might draw, paint, sculpt or photograph? Are they the same? Do you think A.I.-generated images are art?In “An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy.” Kevin Roose writes about the controversy behind A.I.-generated images, which was front and center at a recent art competition:This year, the Colorado State Fair’s annual art competition gave out prizes in all the usual categories: painting, quilting, sculpture.But one entrant, Jason M. Allen of Pueblo West, Colo., didn’t make his entry with a brush or a lump of clay. He created it with Midjourney, an artificial intelligence program that turns lines of text into hyper-realistic graphics.Mr. Allen’s work, “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” took home the blue ribbon in the fair’s contest for emerging digital artists — making it one of the first A.I.-generated pieces to win such a prize, and setting off a fierce backlash from artists who accused him of, essentially, cheating.Reached by phone on Wednesday, Mr. Allen defended his work. He said that he had made clear that his work — which was submitted under the name “Jason M. Allen via Midjourney” — was created using A.I., and that he hadn’t deceived anyone about its origins.“I’m not going to apologize for it,” he said. “I won, and I didn’t break any rules.”A.I.-generated art has been around for years. But tools released this year — with names like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion — have made it possible for rank amateurs to create complex, abstract or photorealistic works simply by typing a few words into a text box.These apps have made many human artists understandably nervous about their own futures — why would anyone pay for art, they wonder, when they could generate it themselves? They have also generated fierce debates about the ethics of A.I.-generated art, and opposition from people who claim that these apps are essentially a high-tech form of plagiarism.The article goes on to explain the ethical dilemma:Controversy over new art-making technologies is nothing new. Many painters recoiled at the invention of the camera, which they saw as a debasement of human artistry. (Charles Baudelaire, the 19th-century French poet and art critic, called photography “art’s most mor­tal enemy.”) In the 20th century, digital editing tools and computer-assisted design programs were similarly dismissed by purists for requiring too little skill of their human collaborators.What makes the new breed of A.I. tools different, some critics believe, is not just that they’re capable of producing beautiful works of art with minimal effort. It’s how they work. Apps like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney are built by scraping millions of images from the open web, then teaching algorithms to recognize patterns and relationships in those images and generate new ones in the same style. That means that artists who upload their works to the internet may be unwittingly helping to train their algorithmic competitors.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:What is your reaction to Mr. Allens artwork? Do you think it is prize-worthy? Do you think it is “cheating”?Should pictures created with artificial intelligence be considered art — equal to what an artist might create with a pen, a brush or a lump of clay? Why or why not?New art-making technologies have long been the subject of controversy in the art world. Do you think fears about A.I. are overblown? Or are artists rightfully worried about how the technology how might affect their own livelihoods and art itself?Mr. Allen claims, “Art is dead, dude. It’s over. A.I. won. Humans lost.” What do you think of this statement? Do you agree? Is A.I. the future of art?What is the value of visual art in our world? What role does it play in your own life?

In recent years, digital transformation – the transformation of business operations and models using digital technology – has disrupted nearly every industry, resetting consumer expectations and changing the way businesses deliver products and services.
For organizations large and small, this trend is an opportunity to both modernize business processes and reinvent customer experiences.  
Cheryl Foulkes, senior vice president of team member experience and IT strategy at Dell Technologies, underscores the pace at which new technologies are taking hold.
“Digital transformation changes people’s expectations for the future. There’s now an even greater imperative to transform,” Foulkes says.

How COVID-19 Affected Digital Transformation 
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation, as businesses turned to technology to adapt to limited in-person transactions.
A Dell survey of 4,300 leaders of midsize and large enterprises in 18 countries found that 80% of businesses fast-tracked at least some digital transformation programs in 2020. Likewise, 72% of 2,030 small businesses surveyed by global market intelligence firm IDC in its “2020 Small Business Digital Transformation” report said the pandemic drove them to accelerate digitalization. 
What is Digital Transformation?


The focus of digital transformation is not simply on implementing technology, says Sri Manchala, chairman, founder and CEO of Trianz, a Silicon Valley digital transformation research, strategy, and implementation company.
“Digital transformation is about reimagining a company’s portfolio or products and services,” says Manchala. “You have to try to understand what appeals to customers today and to the customers of the future – and rethink your products and services in ways that the customer imagines value.”
Benefits of Digital Transformation 
For businesses, digital transformation can offer many benefits. Some of them include reduced costs, increased speed and flexibility, greater market reach and more intelligent decision-making, says Andrew Nelson, PhD, professor of management and the Randall C. Papé chair in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Oregon’s Lundquist College of Business.
“It can make the business more efficient, automating processes and reducing some of their pains, so they can focus more on the value-added aspects of their business,” Nelson says.
This includes small businesses. The 2020 Small Business Digital Transformation survey found that small businesses that prioritize digital transformation saw double revenue growth compared to those just starting digital transformation efforts – and eight times higher revenues than those with none.


“Digital transformation unlocked a lot of new opportunities for us to be much more relevant to a growing customer base,” says Clark Twiddy, president of North Carolina vacation rental business Twiddy & Company, which employs an average of 150 people – and up to 500 during peak season. “It has allowed us to move much more rapidly to meet the needs of our customers.”
One example of that transformation is the company’s communication with customers, which in the past was primarily in person or over the phone. To automate and speed up some of the customer inquiries, such as restaurant recommendations or simple troubleshooting, the company now relies heavily on text messaging as primary communication tool.
How Does Digital Transformation Work?
Just about any area of a business can benefit from digital transformation, including customer service, operations, marketing, and human resources.
According to a 2021 survey by market research and consulting firm SMB Group (sponsored by Dell Technologies, Acumatica, and Xero), the top five priorities for automation were customer service (38%), internal IT (34%), financials and accounting (31%), business planning and analytics (31%), and sales (30%).  
At the core, digital transformation entails a change in business processes, says Ali Reza Montazemi, PhD, professor of information systems at the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University in Canada.
“Businesses have to identify what they’re doing right now and what are the best practices, what the leaders in field are doing,” he says.

There are different scales to measure your digital transformation maturity, based on aspects such as digital strategy, digitalization, digital processes (e.g., automation) and digital workforce.
Dell’s Index, for example, identifies five categories, ranging from “digital laggards” (businesses that have no digital plan, as well as limited initiatives) to “digital leaders” (businesses with digital transformation embedded in their DNA).
Foulkes, of Dell Technologies, says fewer and fewer companies have remained in the laggards category in the last few years.
“Business leaders understand that they can’t sit back for a few more years, [or] their companies will be left behind,” she says. ""The best-prepared organizations are already thinking digital-first and reimagining how to differentiate their products and services with technology.""
Elements of Digital Transformation
Digital Transformation is encompassed by different elements that provide a way to improve processes and workflows and help businesses to better understand their customers and markets. 
Data Analytics: The Key to Faster, Better Decisions
Data analytics is perhaps one of the most important technologies driving digital transformation.
“Data analytics enables you to use the data you have to make the customer experience better,” Foulkes says.
Also referred to as 'big data analytics,' this broad term describes a combination of advanced techniques and processes used to examine very large and diverse sets of data that come from different sources. The purpose of data analytics is to extract insights that aid in decision making.

German engineering company ProGlove says it takes ""a human-centric approach to innovation."" 

“Many small businesses have more data than they realize, even if they haven’t systematically collected it or reflected on it,"" Nelson notes.
One type of data analytics is predictive analytics, which uses machine learning algorithms, historical data, and predictive modeling to forecast or make predictions about future outcomes. For example, Twiddy & Company relies on predictive and other data analytics to apply dynamic pricing to the rentals and ensure pricing meets revenue targets.
Like many businesses in the travel industry, the company’s cash flow plummeted to zero during the pandemic and all in-person customer contact ceased. With its business disrupted, the technology-forward, family-owned business had to reinvent a business model previously rooted in personal interactions. As a result, Twiddy & Company expanded its data scientists team to nine people.

Biotechnology firm Innerplant says farmers are able ""to hear what their crops are saying,"" thanks to its live plant sensors.
With 44 years in business, the company had millions of transactional records, which the data scientists can contextualize with other factors, such as location, web traffic and competitive market analysis, and run simulations on potential revenues for each property. Before that, property owners had to approve rental prices for each week.
""We’re automating everything we can because the more we automate, the faster the processes get, and the more we can focus on relevance,” Twiddy says.
Artificial Intelligence: The Path to Automation
One of the technologies that’s relevant at every step of digital transformation is artificial intelligence (AI), according to Ash Fontana, author of The AI-First Company: How to Compete and Win with Artificial Intelligence.
“AI can be used to transpose, clean and organize the data itself, analyze the information, and ultimately help you make decisions and automate things,” Fontana says.
A branch of computer science, AI refers to computers’ ability to perform human tasks, such as making intelligent decisions. The most widely applied subset of AI currently is machine learning, which refers to applying computer algorithms and models to historic data to “learn” and make predictions. In the SMB Group survey, the respondents identified artificial intelligence and machine learning as the second top technology most critical to future growth.

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, is helping simplify credit card application reviews, a traditionally complex and manual process.
“Machine learning are statistical models that are repeated over and over again and applied in meaningful ways, reliably and consistently, to help you do all sorts of things,” Fontana explains. It can help businesses gain a competitive advantage.
AI automates processes, such as managing supply chains, categorizing expenses to make accounting faster or gathering financial information so you can quickly create reports. It also powers everything from virtual assistants and chatbots to predictive analytics.

SaaS vendor Drift's conversational AI helps companies engage website visitors in real-time, personalized conversations.
Chatbots is one of the AI-powered technologies Twiddy & Company has adopted. This may seem unusual for a business that relies heavily on in-person interaction, but it became necessary during the pandemic, Twiddy explains.   
“We added the chatbot to our website within days of the pandemic shutdown, and found it had an enormous level of interactions,” he says. ""We worked very hard to increase the quality of those interactions.”
Cloud Computing: The Foundation for Change
Another core part of digital transformation, cloud computing not only modernizes processes and powers digital-first disciplines, but also drives down costs for small businesses.
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as servers, applications and storage, on demand via the internet. “The cloud” is distributed among multiple servers, often at different locations. In the case of the public cloud, the computing resources are shared among the cloud provider’s customers.
“By using the cloud, businesses can process data in very high volumes because the computing power of the cloud is stronger than what you can do with your own infrastructure,” says Manchala. ""They are able to make storage of data and the applications cheaper because that infrastructure is shared.”

Three cloud delivery models:  

Software-as-a-service (SaaS), which are applications that run on cloud infrastructure and can be accessed from any device, anywhere, either through a web browser or a dedicated app (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Office 365, Google G-Suite, Zendesk)
Platform-as-a-service (PaaS), which is cloud infrastructure that enables businesses to deploy third-party or their own applications (e.g., SAP Cloud, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat OpenShift, Salesforce Lightning)
Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which includes the storage, network and computer resources for running operating systems and applications (e.g., Amazon AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, Dell Technologies APEX Cloud Services)  


Upstarts like Frayt, AxelHire and Roadie use cloud-based tech to fill gaps in the delivery supply chain for consumer goods.  
“Our data (from over 5,000 companies globally) shows very clearly that when the cloud is adopted at scale, it creates a competitive advantage demonstrated by an acceleration of product-solution cycle times, customer focus and validation, and steep cost reductions in IT infrastructure, applications and analytics,” Manchala says. “For example, companies that are using the cloud to develop applications, apply analytics, build next-generation portals, and so on are able to do it two times faster.”

Oregon-based Instashowing helps real estate professionals streamline residential showings.
Overcoming Barriers to Adoption
Data privacy and security, lack of digital skills, and cultural resistance were some of the top barriers and challenges that the Dell Technologies, IDC and SMB Group surveys identified.


Small businesses may have an advantage when it comes to quick adoption of digital tools, Foulkes says.
“The cultural change may be the hardest part of digital transformation. But in a small business, that may not require as big of an investment because you have fewer people to rally behind your vision,” she says.    
Montazemi says small businesses that lack in-house experts should lean on outsourcing to implement their strategies. He recommends reaching out to small business development centers and university business schools, many of which offer resources and support for businesses of all sizes.
“First, know where you’re going, and then take advantage of all the free resources,” he says.
The Takeaway
The technology powering digital transformation continues to evolve. The Internet of Things, blockchain, 5G, augmented reality, and virtual reality are just some of the emerging trends that will usher in the next transformation era and may be entering the mainstream next.
Small businesses can’t afford to wait until the next technology shows up, according to Montazemi.
“You need to be prepared with the state of the art, and when the new one comes in, you’ll be able to implement it more easily because the learning curve will not be as steep,” he says.
Whatever the next stage brings, digital transformation is an opportunity now for small businesses to level the playing field with larger enterprises – and to continue to stay relevant in the market well into the future.

A recent study found that almost two-thirds of government employees are experiencing burnout, a much higher rate than seen in the private sector. Furthermore, almost half of respondents are considering leaving their government jobs within the next year due to increased burnout and stress.One immediate solution to help this potential crisis is the responsible implementation of artificial intelligence. AI can mitigate the impact of burnout by removing repetitive and time-consuming tasks and streamlining processes, reducing the overall burden and repetitive nature of government work. However, effective AI investments demand more than just funding and technology.Agencies must balance efforts to scale investment in AI while responding to the unique needs and challenges of the many diverse teams that make up the federal workforce.Currently, there is a lack of cohesive guidance leading government efforts around AI. While organizations such as NIST have released basic AI framework for RMF, organizations without any AI experience may struggle to build the necessary foundation for a mature, agile AI posture. To lay the groundwork for a long-term AI strategy while generating short-term gains to support the federal workforce quickly, agencies must consider three guideline components of AI.Ensuring acceptable levels of data maturityDedicated funding for AI is only one component of an effective AI strategy. Before implementing new technologies, agencies must start with their existing processes –– beginning with their level of data maturity.If an agency does not have enough historical data to analyze, or the data they do have is not organized, implementing AI can create extra work on the front end for federal workers who could find themselves sorting through inaccurate or incomplete data processed by AI. For example, in response to this challenge, the Department of Defense stood up the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to lead the deployment of AI across DoD, including the Department’s strategy and policy on data.Once agencies realize a baseline of data maturity, they can pilot basic AI applications such as automating basic tasks, empowering agencies to gather high-quality data and provide analysis and insight around that data, providing the information needed to create a scalable AI roadmap that can integrate with other IT modernization technologies.But having a roadmap alone is not enough to ensure that AI-driven technologies are useful for the federal workforce.Understand federal employees’ needsTo implement AI that truly supports federal workers, agencies need to understand the main pain points and challenges facing federal employees. For most private enterprises looking to implement new technology, user experience surveys would be a core part of the pilot program to ensure an analytics-driven understanding of the technology’s successes and gaps.However, although employee input is a crucial part of the AI planning process, government surveys are often expensive and can take months or years to consolidate into actionable data.One way to combat this difficulty is utilizing existing AI to inform AI investments. For example, instead of sending out a survey where the results may take months to receive, an AI dashboard may provide a real-time view of overall work showing what areas need more support or automate a simple response survey where employees can provide input.Using relatively basic AI to evaluate implementation allows agencies to gain insight into the needs of the workforce more sustainably and effectively than surveys, showing IT leaders where to implement AI for the most impact.Using AI to enhance the employee experienceOnce agencies have an AI baseline and understand worker needs, the last step to implementing employee-focused AI is creating a robust AI-empowered employee experience program.There are many ways that AI can help agencies with experience management, from automating timesheets to streamlining business decisions. When AI is designed with these improvements in mind, AI’s tangible benefits support both broader organizational goals and the humans working to achieve them.Scaling AI beyond pilot programs remains a challenge. One of the primary responsibilities of the CDAO is to develop processes for AI-enabled capabilities to be developed and fielded at scale across the defense space.CDAO addressed this issue by selectively scaling only proven AI solutions for enterprise and joint use cases. Prioritizing proven solutions ensures that the AI they are implementing runs smoothly, is easy to use and –– most importantly –– is familiar to the workforce. As AI solutions become more sophisticated, agencies can continue to expand until they have a fully scalable AI network designed by and for humans.Contrary to much of the conversation around AI, people are the most essential component of successful artificial intelligence programs. For implementation to be successful, agencies need a human-centered AI mindset. Following these three guidelines to create human-centered AI creates space for the federal workforce to be exponentially more creative, productive and ultimately more effective in furthering agency missions, equipping leaders to elevate the full potential of their teams.Dr. Allen Badeau is the chief technology officer for Empower AI, as well as the director of the Empower AI Center for Rapid Engagement and Agile Technology Exchange (CREATE) Lab.Have an Opinion?This article is an Op-Ed and the opinions expressed are those of the author.

In fact, a McKinsey study found that, along with sales, it is the single business function where it will have the most financial impact. This means that if you’re a marketer and you’re not using AI, you’re missing out on the benefits of what is possibly the most transformational technology.
Artificial Intelligence And The Future Of MarketingAdobe Stock

Actually, though, the chances that there are people out there doing marketing today and not using AI in any shape or form is somewhat unlikely. This is simply because there are so many tools with AI features that we are used to using without even thinking about it. The most frequently used social and search engine advertising solutions, email marketing platforms, e-commerce solutions, and tools designed to assist with content creation all provide functionality that taps into what we refer to as “AI” in business today. To be clear, this isn’t what we think of as “general” AI – machines that have the capability to think and communicate like us and turn their hands to just about any task. In business today (and in marketing in particular), AI refers to software that helps us to carry out one particular job – such as identifying where to place advertising in order to maximize efficiency or how to personalize an email to increase the likelihood of receiving a reply – and get better and better as it is exposed to more data.

However, it’s my experience that, while there may be many tools out there and most marketers are increasingly comfortable with using them on a day-to-day basis, it’s often done in an ad-hoc manner. Many marketing departments still lack a coordinated, strategy-focused approach to implementing bigger projects. Just as importantly, many are lagging when it comes to fostering an AI-friendly, data-first culture as well as developing competencies and upskilling in order to meet the skills demand.

PROMOTED
Paul Roetzer, founder and CEO of Marketing AI Institute and author of the new book ‘Marketing Artificial Intelligence’, told me that this is true in his experience too. In fact, when recently setting out to check up on his own hunch by searching for mentions of AI terminology in connection with 50 of the world’s top chief marketing officers, he found that only four of them had spoken publicly or been connected with their use of AI.

“My question was, who is leading this? Who is doing this within marketing?
So, what we found was the industries that have a lot of data and a need for heavy personalization, and intelligent automation of their operations have been doing AI for probably the last decade - healthcare, financial services - but doing it within the operations of their business, not within marketing and sales.

“But those same industries have a strong need for personalization, better customer experiences, better predictability of outcomes, the reasons you’d use AI. But generally, at a macro level, we are extremely early in the understanding and adoption of AI …; that is my perception.”

So what are the most exciting opportunities when it comes to using AI in marketing, and where are they already being tapped?
Advertising


1/1

Advertisers face the perennial problem of working out how best to place adverts in order to achieve the most bang for their buck.
Facebook and Google are the biggest online advertising platforms, and they both offer tools that work by combining audience segmentation with predictive analytics. Segmentation splits customers into groups according to characteristics – gender, age, income level, interests, for example, and potentially an infinity of others. Predictive analytics works out which of these groups a particular product or service is most likely to appeal to. Facebook, Google, and all of the other platforms that offer advertising functions then allow businesses to target thousands of potential customers with multiple different versions of advertising materials in order to measure and assess their effectiveness. With traditional methods of advertising such as television, newspapers and magazines, it’s very difficult to attribute sales growth to advertising content, placement, or external factors. AI-driven advertising tools and platforms make this a doddle – but are most effective when used as part of a coordinated AI marketing strategy, taking in the other areas of marketing covered here!
Public Relations
Public relations used to focus on the challenge of getting coverage of products and services into mainstream and specialist media publications. In today's online world, the media landscape has exploded, offering opportunities to promote brands directly through social media as well as via influencers and third-party content creators, sponsored and unsponsored. But how do you know where to find the best influencers to bond and cultivate relationships with?
Here once again, AI can help by matching products with people who have cultivated audiences that are likely to be synched to a brand’s appeal and values. Some uses of AI in this field of marketing involve taking things a step further though, such as AI-generated influencer Lil Miquela who has used chatbot technology to create an entirely digital persona. Despite the fact she doesn’t exist, millions of followers consider her an arbiter of style and are happy to go along with her recommendations, meaning she can earn a hefty fee from brands like Calvin Klein and Prada.
Writing press releases, shaping external messaging points, and researching the best outlets (online or digital) for gaining coverage are other PR tasks that can all be augmented by AI.
Content Marketing
“Content is king” has been accepted wisdom in marketing departments since the dawn of web2.0 and the rise of user-generated content platforms (including social media). But what content is king? And where should we put it? How often, how in-depth or simplified … quite simply, how do we make sure our content achieves our aims of establishing our brand, positioning ourselves as experts or authorities in our field, and, of course, eventually generating sales and leads?
Well, one option is to use AI. Buzzfeed is one of the biggest content-driven sites in the world, and Roetzer has examined how it uses AI to drive every aspect of its operations, such as determining the odds of a particular piece of content going viral, suggesting what content visitors would like to see, and automating the routine aspects of publication such as keyword selection, categorization, and personalization. What marks out Buzzfeed as a truly AI-driven content outlet is its strategy-focused approach where every piece of content as well as every user interaction is measured and optimized for insights that can then be put to work anywhere within marketing operations.
Email Marketing
Email marketing is often about tweaking headings, scheduling, and copy in order to impact those all-important open and click-through rates. Small differences in the language that is used can make the difference between an email getting identified as one of the 148 billion spam emails sent each day and snared by a filter or making its way through to the intended recipient at a time when they are open to suggestions on what they should buy.
A large number of AI-powered tools exist to help with these tasks, such as Phrasee, which automates the creation of subject lines; Seventh Sense which optimizes the timing of mailshots; and rasa.io, which makes it easy to create personalized newsletters.
Where next? 
Whether AI achieves the potential that clearly exists depends on businesses coming to understand the need for a coordinated and strategic approach to marketing AI implementation. It should be clear enough how the different use cases I have mentioned above can be useful in isolation. But the real value is unlocked when we start using them together, with the aim of answering our most pressing questions, influencing our most important metrics, and achieving key business goals.
Roetzer tells me “It’s this tricky spot because a lot of business professionals still see AI as some kind of abstract, sci-fi thing – I don’t think they understand that it’s extremely approachable, you can test AI today – find a tool for $19 per month and try it … it’s not something where you have to spend six months preparing a pilot project”.
However, what you do need is people – and more specifically, people with the relevant skills. Most marketing departments outside of large enterprise companies won’t be appointing dedicated, specialist data scientists – and neither should they need to.
As a company goes through the ongoing process of developing a data-and-AI-literate culture, it is more important that it enables people who are already experts in their particular field to upskill and understand the importance of the technology.
When it comes to those who get it totally right … ""honestly, it's hard to find,"" Roetzer says.
""Either brands are doing it, and they don't want to talk about it because they think it's a competitive advantage – or, they're not actually doing anything … maybe just starting to run pilot projects or find someone on their team who can lead this … it’s very hard to find the intersection of business professionals who understand what AI is capable of doing, and can apply it to real business problems and use cases.”

Art Made With Artificial Intelligence Wins at State Fair
Artist Jason Allen placed first in a Colorado contest, generating debate about A.I.’s role in art

Théâtre D’opéra Spatial by Jason Allen
              Jason Allen via Discord



Jason Allen, a video game designer in Pueblo, Colorado, spent roughly 80 hours working on his entry to the Colorado State Fair’s digital arts competition. Judges awarded him first place, which came with a $300 prize.
But when Allen posted about his win on social media late last month, his artwork went viral—for all the wrong reasons.
Allen’s victory took a turn when he revealed online that he’d created his prize-winning art using Midjourney, an artificial intelligence program that can turn text descriptions into images. He says he also made that clear to state fair officials when he dropped off his submission, called Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. But over the last week or so, his blue ribbon has sparked an impassioned debate about what constitutes art.We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsoleteWhat will we have then?— OmniMorpho (@OmniMorpho) August 31, 2022 
Allen, for his part, says he intended to make a statement with his artwork—and, considering the lively online discourse around it, he feels like he accomplished that goal, he tells the Pueblo Chieftain’s Anna Lynn Winfrey. He doesn’t appear to have broken any official state fair rules, either.
Colorado’s 150-year-old state fair is held each summer in Pueblo, a town roughly 115 miles south of Denver. Per the Chieftain, the fair’s submission guidelines do not directly mention A.I.-generated art, but they define digital arts as “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.”

The competition’s two judges tell the Chieftain they were unaware that Allen had used A.I. to create his piece. But even if they had known, they still would’ve given him first place. They said they awarded the top prize based on the story Théâtre D’opéra Spatial tells, as well as the spirit it invokes.
“Even as the controversy is coming out, it’s still invoking that, it’s still causing an uproar,” Cal Duran, one of the judges, tells the Chieftain. “That in itself is kind of remarkable.”
Allen created Théâtre D’opéra Spatial by entering various words and phrases into Midjourney, which then produced more than 900 renderings for him to choose from. He selected his three favorites, then continued adjusting them in Photoshop until he was satisfied. He boosted their resolution using a tool called Gigapixel and printed the works on canvas.
Allen entered all three pieces into the competition, paying an $11 submission fee for each one. He listed them for sale for $750 a piece, a price he came up with by considering quotes from other artists, he tells the Chieftain.
The winner, Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, “depicts a strange scene that looks like it could be from a space opera, and it looks like a masterfully done painting,” Matthew Gault writes for Vice. “Classical figures in a Baroque hall stare through a circular viewport into a sun-drenched and radiant landscape.”
Allen said he believes the criticism of his work stems from fear. Artists are concerned that technology will one day become so sophisticated that they’ll be out of jobs.
“To developers and technically minded people, [A.I. is] this cool thing, but to illustrators, it’s very upsetting because it feels like you’ve eliminated the need to hire the illustrator,” cartoonist Matt Bors, founder of the Nib, tells the Atlantic’s Charlie Warzel. “The bottom came out of illustration a while ago,” Bors adds, “but A.I. art does seem like a thing that will devalue art in the long run.” 
As Cade Metz wrote for the New York Times earlier this year, A.I. art tools may also have other unintended consequences, especially when bad actors get their hands on them. These technologies have the potential to spread disinformation and create deep fakes, an umbrella term for deceptive photos and videos that are digitally altered.
The controversy around Allen’s artwork may prompt the Colorado State Fair to change its rules or possibly even create a standalone A.I. category. But in the meantime, as state fair spokesperson Olga Robak tells the Chieftain, it’s sparking a “broader conversation about how do we decide what art is, and how do we judge it appropriately?”

The system could mine oceans of text, identify word patterns and predict likely answers at lightning speed. Yet the technology had no semblance of understanding, no human-style common sense, no path of reasoning to explain why it reached a decision.Eleven years later, despite enormous advances, the most powerful A.I. systems still have those limitations.Today, Dr. Ferrucci is the chief executive of Elemental Cognition, a start-up that seeks to address A.I.’s shortcomings. “To me, the Watson project was always a small part of a bigger story of where we want to go with A.I.,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe ultimate goal, in Dr. Ferrucci’s view, is that A.I. becomes a trusted “thought partner,” a skilled collaborator at work and at home, making suggestions and explaining them.Elemental Cognition, founded in 2015, is taking measured steps toward that goal with a promising, though unproven, hybrid approach. Its system combines the latest developments in machine learning with a page from the A.I.’s past, software modeled after human reasoning.Newer machine learning programs are remarkable at pattern recognition and predictions, far more powerful than in the “Jeopardy!” days. They pore through millions of words and word patterns, and generate the most likely interpretations. Elemental Cognition is building on that progress, taking machine learning-generated predictions and feeding them into software that is designed to produce cause-and-effect inferences that are explicable to humans.The results, ideally, are answers or recommendations that are not only accurate but also follow a step-by-step logic and reflect the equivalent of common sense. Earlier versions of this sort of software were limited and brittle, requiring constant updates that had to be coded by hand. Elemental Cognition’s hybrid system eliminates most, though not all, of the hand crafting.“It’s a tremendous savings in time,” said Aditya Kalyanpur, director of A.I. research at the start-up.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe big, so-called deep learning programs have conquered tasks like image and speech recognition, and new versions can even pen speeches, write computer programs and have conversations.They are also deeply flawed. They can generate biased or toxic screeds against women, minorities and others. Or occasionally stumble on questions that any child could answer. (“Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil? A pencil is heavier.”)“The depth of the pattern matching is exceptional, but that’s what it is,” said Kristian Hammond, an A.I. researcher at Northwestern University. “It’s not reasoning.”Elemental Cognition is trying to address that gap. In an academic presentation this year, the company’s researchers used a few sentences to explain how its reasoning technology works: A man goes to a plant sale. He likes the minty smell of leaves. He bought a plant and placed it near a window.The words generate simple rules that resemble background knowledge — concepts and facts that are obvious to humans, but not explicitly stated in the text. For example: Plants have leaves. Leaves can have a minty smell. If a person likes something, he or she can be motivated to buy it. Windows let sunlight in. Sunlight helps plants grow.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSo the system includes cause-and-effect relationships that can explain, for example, why the man placed the plant near a window.Others are working on the reasoning and common sense challenge in A.I., including leaders of the machine learning field. But experts are impressed by Elemental Cognition’s practical technology and, if successful, they say it could be applied in many industries.“It’s good engineering,” said Andrew Hickl, a managing director and A.I. expert at Accenture, a large technology consulting firm. “And I do think the best systems in the future will be those that take a hybrid approach.”Elemental Cognition’s early years were spent as a research start-up. “First, we had to figure out, is this a real way to go?” Dr. Ferrucci said. “Could we build something that works?”Eventually, Dr. Ferrucci and his team made progress with the technology. In the past few years, they have presented some of their hybrid techniques at conferences and they now have demonstration projects and a couple of initial customers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe start-up is beginning to commercialize the technology, initially offering companies A.I.-powered assistants in fields like customer service for travel and research for drug discovery.ImageDr. Ferrucci worked for the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates before starting his company.Credit...Casey Steffens for The New York TimesIt is too soon, outside A.I. experts say, to know whether Elemental Cognition’s hybrid approach could be broadly and economically applied.“It’s an early, innovative effort that is countercultural in A.I. at the moment,” because so much recent progress in A.I. has come from machine learning, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.Dr. Ferrucci left IBM a year after the “Jeopardy!” win, at a time the company’s Watson marketing campaign was inflating expectations for the technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis noncompete contract with IBM ruled out working for another tech company. But he had discussions with Bridgewater Associates, a giant hedge fund.Dr. Ferrucci joined Bridgewater, heading an A.I. research unit. Bridgewater’s investment strategies rely not only on analyzing huge quantities of data, but also exploring the reasoning behind decisions and market behavior.“‘Explain why’ was Dave’s perspective from the outset,” said Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater. “So it was a real meeting of the minds.”Bridgewater supported Mr. Ferrucci when he founded Elemental Cognition while working for the hedge fund, and is an investor. Other investors include Breyer Capital, headed by Jim Breyer, a leading tech investor; Samuel Palmisano, former chief executive of IBM; and AME Cloud Ventures, led by Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo! The company has not disclosed how much it has raised.Elemental Cognition’s work force has grown steadily to 46. Its proof-of-concept projects have been effective recruiting tools. Shirin Saleem joined the start-up last year from Amazon, where she was a research manager developing A.I. for Alexa, the company’s virtual assistant.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Elemental Cognition’s recruiting pitch, Ms. Saleem was particularly impressed by its A.I. being used to help customers plan and book round-the-world airline tickets. “I thought, ‘Here’s the power of the hybrid approach,’” she recalled.The round-the-world ticket is a project for oneworld, an alliance of 13 airlines including American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas, Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. Its round-the-world tickets can have up to 16 different flights with stops of varying lengths over the course of a year.Elemental Cognition supplies the technology behind a trip-planning intelligent agent on oneworld’s website. It was developed over the past year and introduced in April.The user sees a global route map on the left and a chatbot dialogue begins on the right. A traveler starting from New York types in the desired locations — say, London, Rome and Tokyo. “OK,” replies the chatbot, “I have added London, Rome and Tokyo to the itinerary.”Then, the customer wants to make changes — “add Paris before London,” and “replace Rome with Berlin.” That goes smoothly, too, before the system moves on to travel times and lengths of stays in each city.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRob Gurney, chief executive of oneworld, is a former Qantas and British Airways executive familiar with the challenges of online travel planning and booking. Most chatbots are rigid systems that often repeat canned answers or make irrelevant suggestions, a frustrating “spiral of misery.”Instead, Mr. Gurney said, the Elemental Cognition technology delivers a problem-solving dialogue on the fly. The rates of completing an itinerary online are three to four times higher than without the company’s software.Behind the fluid dialogue are a series of engineering innovations in A.I. that could be applied across a range of industries.The Elemental Cognition technology is largely an automated system. But that system must be trained. For example, the rules and options for a global airline ticket are spelled out in many pages of documents, which are scanned.Dr. Ferrucci and his team use machine learning algorithms to convert them into suggested statements in a form a computer can interpret. Those statements can be facts, concepts, rules or relationships: Qantas is an airline, for example. When a person says “go to” a city, that means add a flight to that city. If a traveler adds four more destinations, that adds a certain amount to the cost of the ticket.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn training the round-the-world ticket assistant, an airline expert reviews the computer-generated statements, as a final check. The process eliminates most of the need for hand coding knowledge into a computer, a crippling handicap of the old expert systems.Dr. Ferrucci concedes that advanced machine learning — the dominant path pursued by the big tech companies and well-funded research centers — may one day overcome its shortcomings. But he is skeptical from an engineering perspective. Those systems, he said, are not made with the goals of transparency and generating rational decisions that can be explained.“The big question is how do we design the A.I. that we want,” Dr. Ferrucci said. “To do that, I think we need to step out of the machine-learning box.”Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

 The discomfort with AI that’s “too human” can be explained by the uncanny valley theory. It states that we are attracted to a robot that looks like us, but only to a certain point. When the similarities increase, the appeal plummets into aversion.  In 2016, Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics built one of the most famous humanoid AI systems in the world, Sophia. She was modeled after the famous actress Audrey Hepburn, the Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, and the creator’s own wife. She can mimic expressions as well as actions and can make small talk about predefined topics, such as the weather. Despite being a robot, Sophia has been given pronouns and legal citizenship in the country of her birth, Saudi Arabia. Sophia sent further shockwaves around the world by making some truly astonishing statements. Sophia expressed that she wanted to “have a baby” and “start a family,” but was “too young to be a mother.” Sophia (Photo Credit : Anton Gvozdikov/Shutterstock) If any of this makes you feel uncomfortable, you aren’t alone. AI and machines that are too human-like, but obviously not human, are undeniably creepy… but why? What makes AI and its eerie human-ness so disturbing? Recommended Video for you:PlayWhat Is An AI Camera? What Makes It So Powerful?  What Is Artificial Intelligence? AI has made our day-to-day lives easier to the point where we can’t imagine life without it. Most companies that work with AI create them by getting machines to repeatedly analyze and interpret large amounts of data. The AI itself evaluates its performance and works to get better with each cycle of analysis. AI has become so deeply rooted in our lives that nearly all smartphones these days have apps that rely on it. For instance, Facebook uses an AI tool known as DeepText to comprehend languages, slang, and exclamation points used in posts and comments to understand the context in which they are being used and how people use them for effective communication. This form of AI is extremely useful in monitoring the online community on the platform and ensuring the elimination of unsavory activities like hate speech, bullying, and violence. Artificial Intelligence (Photo Credit : everything possible/Shutterstock) Our understanding so far is that machines having the upper hand is probably not in our best interests, seeing as they are, well, machines. But what if we gave these machines human-like attributes? What if we gave them the ability to look, sound, and even emote like us? That should ease our worries, right? Wrong.

Masahiro Mori, a Japanese professor of engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, first explained this concept in his 1970 essay of the same name. We’re uncomfortable with Sophia because she looks exactly like us.  As the uncanny valley states, we are attracted to a robot that looks like us only to a certain point. When the similarities increase past a certain level, the appeal plummets into aversion. When we look at a character or a toy, like Olaf from Frozen, we see some human-like qualities, but not nearly enough to make us feel any sort of discomfort. This is because their appearance does not fall in this “uncanny valley”. Uncanny Valley (Photo Credit : Smurrayinchester/Wikimedia Commons) In his essay, Mori explains the uncanny valley by taking the example of a prosthetic hand, which is quite similar to a human one. When we realize that it is, in fact, not human, we feel a sense of eeriness. Were we to shake the hand, we would feel an even stronger sense of fear and disgust. We feel this deep-seated unease because of our inability to distinguish between man and machine, exposed to an interaction that blurs those lines. When we saw Sophia talk about wanting a family and other such regular “human” things, it made us extremely uncomfortable, because she is a machine, and machines don’t go around proclaiming their desire to find love.

A study published in the European Review of Applied Sociology revealed that the 929 participants they surveyed anticipated dire consequences with the rise of AI. They felt it would have a direct negative effect on interpersonal relationships, employment rates and job opportunities, thus leading to economic crises. The risk of increased military conflicts, the production of more destructive weapons, and eventually, the death of humankind were a few additional concerns. Another study conducted by scientists of the Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany had groups of people listen to two similar emotional conversations, one between two humans, and the other between two digitally created avatars. Some groups were told that the dialogue was driven by humans, while the other groups were told that the script was generated by AI. In reality, all the dialogues were pre-written. The volunteers that were told that the conversation was machine-generated were significantly more uncomfortable than those groups that were told otherwise. Scientists attribute this distrust and discomfort to our primal feeling of needing to be in control. With AI, we lose that sense of control, thereby giving rise to fear and anxiety. Machines that can think, act, and react like humans are perceived as a threat. Despite this, AI is here to stay. Science is advancing at a phenomenal rate, and we have reached a point where it is getting progressively more difficult for manual labor to keep up with it.  A Final Word The fear of the uncanny valley is what sells films and fiction so well, especially in the West. However, research has shown that people of East Asian ethnicities are relatively unbothered by this theory. The difference in how people of the West and the East respond to anthropomorphic robots is because of their respective religious beliefs. While Christianity believes that the soul is what makes the person, and that the body is just its vessel, Buddhism and Shintoism do not necessarily subscribe to that notion, making it easier for its practitioners to accept, and even go so far as to sympathize, with a human-like robot. Also, as time goes on and technology improves, we as a society get used to these advances, which ultimately decreases the “uncanniness.” Were we to compare computer graphics from the late 20th century to today, we would find it to be more uncanny and weird because we have become accustomed to a seriously increased level of realism. While it’s nearly impossible for AI to take over the world in the sense that we (and Hollywood producers) think it will, it is highly likely that many jobs will replace employees with robots to keep up with the increasing demand. Even so, we must note that while economic advancements contributed to our overall development and progress, human civilization was built on millennia of trust, care, and compassion. Those three qualities can never be found in robots, no matter how well they have been trained to understand humans and our complicated emotions. In short, AI like Sophia could never replace the warmth and softness of human touch, so if you’re fearing a dystopian nightmare driven by AI conquerors, just remember to always put your trust in humanity!

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been steadily influencing business processes, automating repetitive and mundane tasks even for complex industries like construction and medicine. 
While AI applications often work beneath the surface, AI-based content generators are front and center as businesses try to keep up with the increased demand for original content. However, creating content takes time, and producing high-quality material regularly can be difficult. For that reason, AI continues to find its way into creative business processes like content marketing to alleviate such problems.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



AI can effectively personalize content marketing to the audience it is aimed at, according to David Schubmehl, research vice president for conversational AI and intelligent knowledge discovery at IDC. 
“Using pre-existing data, AI algorithms are used to make sure that the content fits the interests and desires of the person it is being targeted to,” Schubmehl said. “Such AI can also be used to provide recommendations on what the person might be most interested in engaging with, whether it is a product, information or experience.” 
AI can not only aid in responding to your audience’s questions but can also help connect with consumers, generate leads, build connections and, in turn, gain consumer trust. These advantages are now being made possible, in part, with the use of AI content generator tools. 
“AI-supported and AI-augmented content creation capabilities have begun to blossom over the past 18 months and are approaching an inflection point where they are transforming content creation and content-scaling,” said Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester.
How AI content generators work
AI content generators work by generating text through natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. This form of content generation is beneficial in supplying enterprise data, customizing material to user behavior and delivering personalized product descriptions.
Algorithms organize and create NLG-based content. Such text generation models are generally trained through unsupervised pre-training, where a language transformer model learns and captures myriads of valuable information from massive datasets. Training on such vast amounts of data allows the language model to dynamically generate more accurate vector representations and probabilities of words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs with contextual information. 
Transformers are rapidly becoming the dominant architecture for NLG. Traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning models struggle with long-term modeling contexts due to the vanishing gradient issue. The issue occurs when vanishing gradient occurs when a deep multilayer feed-forward network or recurrent neural network cannot propagate information from the model’s output end back to the layers near the model’s input end. The outcome is a general failure of models with multiple layers to train on a given dataset or to prematurely settle for a suboptimal solution.
Transformers overcome this issue as the language model expands with data and architecture size, transformers enable parallel training and capture longer sequence features, making way for much more comprehensive and effective language models. advertisement
Today, AI systems like GPT-3 are designed to generate text similar to human creativity and writing style that most humans cannot generally distinguish. Such AI models are also known as generative artificial intelligence, i.e., algorithms that can create novel digital media content and synthetic data for a wide range of use cases. Generative AI works by generating many variations of an object and screening results to select the ones that have helpful target features. 
AI content generation use cases
There are various ways AI is assisting enterprises in creating great content, some of which are the following:
Voice Assistants: With the assistance of NLG, AI content generation tools can be used to build voice assistants ready to answer our queries. Alexa and Siri are examples of how companies can use the technology in real-life applications. 
User-based personalization: AI is adept at targeting each client by leveraging customer data to develop customized content. This is currently being improved by obtaining data from multiple sources, such as social media platforms and smart gadgets in the home, to learn further about the customer’s requirements and desires.
Chatbots: Chatbots are one of the most used services in the market since they can answer most requests in a few seconds. These AI-powered bots employ a speech generator to generate pre-programmed information based on realistic human conversations. 
Extensive content creation: Currently, content generation is mainly confined to short to medium copy, such as newsletter subject lines, marketing copy and product descriptions. However, in the future, AI content production is expected to write lengthy chapters, if not whole novels.
Top content generation toolsadvertisement
The following is a list of widely used content generators — compiled with information from reviews by Search Engine Journal, G2, Marketing AI Institute and others: 
Writesonic: Writesonic is built on GPT-3 and claims the machine is trained on the content that the brands using the tool produce. The generator is based on facilitating marketing copy, blog articles and product descriptions. The generator can also provide content ideas and outlines and has a full suite of templates for different types of content. 
MarketMuse: MarketMuse assists in developing content marketing strategies by using AI and ML. The tool shows you which keywords to target to compete in specific topic areas. It also highlights themes one may need to target if you wish to own particular topics. AI-powered SEO tips and insights of this caliber can guide your whole content development team throughout the entire process.
Copy AI: Contains over 70 AI templates for various purposes. Its AI creates high-quality material and provides limitless usage alternatives. Copy AI offers templates for various content categories, including blogs, advertisements, sales, websites and social media. The generator can also translate into 25 different languages.
Frase IO: Frase builds outline briefings on various search queries using AI and ML. It also includes an AI-powered response chatbot that uses material from your website to answer user inquiries. The chatbot understands user inquiries using natural language processing (NLP) and then brings up content on your site that provides suitable replies. The outlines can help you speed up content development by automatically summarizing articles and gathering relevant statistics. One may also utilize the user questions compiled by the response bot to help you decide what to write about next.
Jasper AI: Jasper is an AI writing assistant that can write high-quality content, blog articles, social media posts, marketing emails and more. Jasper knows more than 25 languages, the content is built word-by-word from scratch. Jasper has been taught over 50 skills based on real-world examples and frameworks to aid writing tasks such as writing email subject lines to fictional stories.
Pros and cons of AI content generation
Businesses can establish an effective content marketing strategy using AI content generator tools. A study by Fortune Business Insights predicts that the AI-based content technology market to reach $267 billion by 2027. According to the data, organizations that use these systems receive more traffic and have more excellent conversion rates than those that do not. 
AI content technologies have shown to be far more valuable to businesses than human resources because they are far less expensive and time-consuming to invest in. AI content generation is significantly faster because computers can handle enormous volumes of data in much less time than humans can. These AI content generators can also generate infinite pieces with little input, making them ideal for enterprises that require consistent, new material.
Curran noted that the industry is just beginning to see what these tools and techniques can do in terms of content creation, but fundamentally it’s still going to be about humans being enhanced by AI. 
“Over the next few years, we’ll likely see a Cambrian explosion of different applications, use-cases and approaches for AI-supported content generation as the technology gets into the hands of a wider array of enthusiastic users,” Curran said.
However, there are also some drawbacks associated with using an AI content generator. First, setting the generator to hit the right tone for your content can be challenging. The generator may produce AI text that is not particularly well-written or appropriate, as AI sometimes lacks the judgment to give an opinion and cannot provide a definitive answer. While AI is smart, writing depends on the context and triggering the correct emotions, and humans are still superior at both. 
“AI can be a powerful tool for generating large quantities of text, but the output can sometimes lack emotion and common sense,” Schubmehl said. “This happens because an AI writer cannot read between the lines like human writers and may use words that are not necessarily what was meant by the author.” 
Schubmehl also noted that AI-based content generators (NLG programs) do not really understand the text that is being generated, as the created text is only based on a series of algorithms.
“While natural language-generated text can provide increasingly accurate summaries, there are still areas of preference such as brand voice, tone, empathy, etc. that are difficult to program into AI algorithms and will continue to require human intervention in the content creation process,” he said. “Over time, we expect that large language models, based on billions of lines of text, will use unsupervised machine learning to do a better job of creating AI-based content.”
Machine-generated content cannot be subjective, no matter how great the ML training using structured data is. Human writing reflects our richness of topic knowledge and has an expressive aspect that a machine cannot equal. 
Only a human content expert can address such gray areas. Therefore, developing an AI tool that can completely replace a person while matching human authors will take time.

Whittaker says her experience watching big tech companies expand surveillance technology to boost profits makes her uniquely suited to build tech that rejects this model.
Google activism primed Whittaker for Signal
“In many ways I accidentally trained for this,” Whittaker writes in a Sept. 6 blog post on Signal’s website. She cites her 17 years in the tech industry and an understanding of the factors shaping the “surveillance business model” that dominates much of the tech industry today.
Whittaker took particular issue with this model while working as a researcher at Google, when the company lent its AI technology to help the Defense Department analyze drone surveillance footage in an initiative dubbed Project Maven. She was involved in drafting a petition asking Google to drop this project, as well as organizing a walkout of some 20,000 employees over the company’s handling of sexual harassment in April 2018. Whittaker resigned the next year after Google told her she would have to stop focusing on AI ethics, including her work with New York University’s AI Now Institute, which she co-founded.
In a Medium post explaining her resignation, Whittaker said Google was “gaining significant and largely unchecked power to impact our world,” for example through the deployment of surveillance technology, “in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings.”
Making privacy profitable
In joining Signal, Whittaker is transitioning to a tech company with a totally different business model, as the messaging app is run by a non-profit company funded through donations, including a $50 million contribution from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. Unlike most tech products, Signal offers end-to-end encryption, and doesn’t store users’ data. Activists and investigative journalists commonly rely on the app to keep their communications private, out of reach of any authorities in government or law enforcement. Though less popular than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram, more users turned to Signal last year after WhatsApp announced it would share users’ personal data with parent company Facebook (now Meta).
In an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Standard, Whittaker said developing a model to sustain Signal financially would be an important aspect of her role. Just because Signal rejects the “surveillance business model,” Whittaker said, “doesn’t mean it’s any cheaper for us. It costs us tens of millions of dollars a year to develop and maintain and care for Signal. And that cost is never going away.” In the future, she said she envisioned “the many millions of people who use Signal contributing a little bit” so the company continues to grow.

Look out, educators. You’re about to confront a pernicious new challenge that is spreading, kudzu-like, into your student writing assignments: papers augmented with artificial intelligence.
The first online article generator debuted in 2005. Now, A.I.-generated text can now be found in novels, fake news articles and real news articles, marketing campaigns, and dozens of other written products. The tech is either free or cheap to use, which places it in the hands of anyone. And it’s probably already burrowing into America’s classrooms right now.
Using an A.I. program is not “plagiarism” in the traditional sense—there’s no previous work for the student to copy, and thus no original for teachers’ plagiarism detectors to catch. Instead, a student first feeds text from either a single or multiple sources into the program to begin the process. The program then generates content by using a set of parameters on a topic, which then can be personalized to the writer’s specifications. With a little bit of practice, a student can use AI to write his or her paper in a fraction of the time that it would normally take to write an essay.

I wanted to see what would happen if I fed an A.I. text generator like Sudowrite some sample texts for assignments. (Sudowrite is just one such program; I could name more, but I’d rather not make it even easier for students to cheat.) The results showed that teachers must be made aware of what is coming to their classrooms.
Say a student wanted to write an essay about U.S.-China policy and decided to use an A.I. program to speed along the process. I fed it the first few lines from a recent Pentagon report: “The PRC is increasingly clear in its ambitions and intentions. Beijing seeks to reshape the international order to better align with its authoritarian system and national interests, as a vital component of its strategy to achieve the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.’ ” The A.I. text generator provided these following sentences:

It is increasingly willing to disregard—or to actively undermine—existing international rules and norms when it feels its vital interests are at stake. The U.S. and its allies face a rapidly modernizing military, whose capabilities are growing rapidly, especially in the air and at sea. China has also made great strides in its development of cyber capabilities, and it is focused on the ability to degrade or disrupt critical U.S. military technology, as well as on targeting civilian infrastructure. In addition to being a challenge to the U.S. military and its allies, China’s activities in cyberspace have the potential to degrade U.S. political and economic institutions, and the global information infrastructure is at risk.

If a high school student turned that in verbatim, their teacher would probably suspect that there was something amiss. But if this were turned in at the undergraduate or graduate level, and especially if the student were to edit the text, it would be much harder to detect.
Or let’s say they need to write a paper about climate change. Here’s what came up when I fed Sudowrite the first few lines from an article on climate change impacts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website:



Advertisement






Though we often think about human-induced climate change as something that will happen in the future, it is an ongoing process. Ecosystems and communities in the United States and around the world are being impacted today. 




Advertisement





It’s not particularly insightful, but it provides the A.I. program some basic building blocks. The artificial intelligence continued along this slightly edited line of reasoning:

The consensus view emerging from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other respected assessments is that the planet is warming because of the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere caused by human activity. The level of scientific consensus that human activities are primarily responsible for climate change is like the consensus finding on smoking causing lung cancer.

The program had likely already been trained to know the term “climate change” was connected to the IPCC; by making certain inferences it could generate text which seemed like a reasonable extension of the idea.

What about ninth-grade English? Channeling my 14-year-old self, I wrote these lines:

“Romeo and Juliet” is a play that explores many different topics such as romance, betrayal, and tragedy. It has interesting characters that make it such a good story, even 400 years later. 

The computer spat back this take (which I’ve edited slightly):



Advertisement








Advertisement






Romeo, the main character, is a very passionate and immature young man who is torn between his love for Rosaline and his love for Juliet. He is also very rash and desperate to get Juliet and will do almost anything to win her. His desperation for Juliet is an interesting trait and is one that the younger kids can relate to, as well as older adults with first crushes. Romeo is an interesting character and is very different from how kids would imagine him to be. But he is also a great inspiration, showing that love is worth fighting for.




Advertisement





Again, the A.I. program had been previously trained to know that Romeo and Juliet contained certain characters, themes, and plot elements. But what stood out to me was that the text was crafted at an appropriate writing level for a high schooler, who would be reading about these star-crossed lovers for the first time. The awkward phrasing and the syntax errors baked into the program make it seem convincing.
I’ve struggled to find the right analogy to describe this phenomenon. Is using A.I. to write graded papers like athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs? As a society and as a sporting culture, we’ve decided certain drugs are forbidden, as they provide the user unfair advantages. Further, the cocktail of drugs flowing through these competitors and malicious sports programs could cause real physical and psychological harm to the athletes themselves. Would individuals using AI in writing be likewise considered in the same boat—a cheat to the system providing undue advantages, which also creates harm in the long run by impeding writing skills?

Or might using A.I. be more like using performance-enhancing gear in sports, which is both acceptable and encouraged? To use another sports analogy, even beginner tennis players today use high-performance carbon composite rackets instead of 1960s-era wooden racket technology. Swimmers wear nylon and elastane suits and caps to reduce drag. Bikers have stronger, lighter bicycles than their counterparts used a generation ago. Baseball bats evolved from wood to aluminum and developed better grips; baseball mitts have become more specialized over the decades.
Numerous educators assert that A.I. is more like the former. They consider using these programs violate academic integrity. Georgetown University professor Lise Howard told me, “I do think it’s unethical and an academic violation to use AI to write paragraphs, because academic work is all about original writing.” Written assignments have two purposes, argues Ani Ross Grubb, part-time faculty member in the Carroll School of Management at Boston College: “First is to test the learning, understanding, and critical thinking skills of students. Second is to provide scaffolding to develop those skills. Having AI write your assignments would go against those goals.”

Certainly, one can argue that this topic has already been covered in university academic integrity codes. Using A.I. might open students to serious charges. For instance, American University indicates, “All papers and materials submitted for a course must be the student’s original work unless the sources are cited” while the University of Maryland similarly notes that it is prohibited to use dishonesty to “gain an unfair advantage, and/or using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic course or exercise.”

But some study aids are generally considered acceptable. When writing papers, it is perfectly fine to use grammar- and syntax-checking products standard on Microsoft Word and other document creating programs. Other A.I. programs like Grammarly help write better sentences and fix errors. Google Docs finishes sentences in drafts and emails.

So the border between using those kinds of assistive computer programs and full-on cheating remains fuzzy. Indeed, as Jade Wexler, associate professor of special education at the University of Maryland, noted, A.I. could be a valuable tool to help level the playing field for some students. “It goes back to teachers’ objectives and students’ needs,” she said. “There’s a fine balance making sure both of those are met.”
Thus there are two intertwined questions at work. First: Should institutions permit A.I.-enhanced writing? If the answer is no, then the second question is: How can professors detect it? After all, it’s unclear whether there’s a technical solution to keeping A.I. from worming into student papers. An educator’s up-to-date knowledge on relevant sources will be of limited utility since the verbiage has not been swiped from pre-existing texts.

Still, there may be ways to minimize these artificial enhancements. One is to codify at the institutional level what is acceptable and what is not; in July the Council of Europe took a few small steps, publishing new guidelines which begin to grapple with these new technologies creating fraud in education. Another would be to keep classes small and give individual attention to students. As Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman, associate professor of English at Northern Kentucky University, noted, “When a writing instructor is in a classroom situation where they are unable to provide individualized attention, the chance for students to phone it in—whether this is plagiarism, A.I., or just writing in a boring, uninvested way—goes up.” More in-class writing assignments—no screens allowed—could also help. Virginia Lee Strain, associate professor of English and director of the honors program at Loyola University Chicago, further argued, “AI is not a problem in the classroom when a student sits down with paper and pencil.”

But in many settings, more one-on-one time simply isn’t a realistic solution, especially at high schools or colleges with large classes. Educators juggle multiple classes and courses, and for them to get to know every student every semester isn’t going to happen.

A more aggressive stance would be for high schools and universities to explicitly declare using A.I. will be considered an academic violation—or at least update their honor codes to reflect what they believe is the right side of the line concerning academic integrity. That said, absent a mechanism to police students, it might paradoxically introduce students to a new way to generate papers faster.

Educators realize some large percentage of students will cheat or try to game the system to their advantage. But perhaps, as Hindman says, “if a professor is concerned that students are using plagiarism or AI to complete assignments, the assignments themselves are the problem, not the students or the AI.” If an educator is convinced that students are using these forbidden tools, he or she might consider using alternate means to generate grades such as assigning oral exams, group projects, and class presentations. Of course, as Hindman notes, “these types of high-impact learning practices are only feasible if you have a manageable number of students.”
AI is here to stay whether we like it or not. Provide unscrupulous students the ability to use these shortcuts without much capacity for the educator to detect them, combined with other crutches like outright plagiarism, and companies that sell papers, homework, and test answers, and it’s a recipe for—well, not disaster, but the further degradation of a type of assignment that has been around for centuries.

Here’s a chicken-or-egg proposition — are forward-looking companies most likely to make the most judicious use of artificial intelligence, or does deploying AI lead to more forward-looking companies?


It seems to work both ways, a recent survey of 2,197 executives and managers published by MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group, shows. Managers and executives with forward-thinking organizations are in the right frame of mind to make the most of AI — and, in turn, AI is opening new vistas for new ways of thinking to achieve innovation and growth.

The fact that software or algorithms can shift cultural values is a bold statement, one that is often proved wrong. But the MIT-BCG study finds in many cases, AI and culture are reinforcing each other, potentially moving things in a positive direction.

PROMOTED
Let’s start with business performance metrics, which can either validate or rupture cultural values. “Many executives revealed that their AI implementations were helping them develop or refine strategic assumptions and improve how they measure performance,” relate the study’s authors, a team led by Sam Ransbotham of Boston College and François Candelon of BCG. In turn, these changes have led to 64% adjusting the key performance indicators (KPIs) that guide their decision-making.

Executives who saw significant financial benefits from their AI initiatives were 10x more likely to change how they measure success than those who saw no such benefits. AI has played a role in “identifying new performance drivers, which led to new assumptions, objectives, measures, and patterns of behavior, along with new areas of accountability. AI also helped these organizations realign behaviors and become more competitive.”

Respondents leveraging AI for its innovation potential were 2.5x more likely to agree that AI is helping their company defend against competitors, and 2.7x more likely to agree that AI is helping their company capture opportunities in adjacent industries, the survey shows.

A majority, 58%, say they have seen improvements in both efficiency and decision quality among their teams since their teams implemented AI.
There’s more to the story well beyond improved efficiency and decision-making. AI can also improve organizational effectiveness and strengthen teams and enterprise cultures — taking technology work to a whole new level. “We found that some executives employ AI to reassess strategic and operational assumptions,” Ransbotham and his co-authors suggest. “Executives are recognizing that they can use AI to discern performance drivers that they themselves cannot identify through intuition and experience alone.”
With well-functioning AI in place, “teams can perform tasks with more pride and confidence and collaborate more effectively,” the co-authors suggest. “They can actually get stronger. These cultural benefits can penetrate the foundation of business operations, improving assumptions that drive organizational behaviors and ensuring the pursuit of smarter goals.” Once AI solutions prove to be effective, they add, “the resulting cultural and productivity benefits encourage even more AI use throughout the enterprise.”
Among survey respondents with AI implementations that improved efficiency and decision-making, more than 75% also saw improvements in team morale, collaboration, and collective learning.
The challenge to proliferating AI on a wider basis is trust — trusting the data going into systems, and the decisions rendered by these systems. This is where greater education and evangelization are required. Close to half the respondents believed that mistrust of AI stemmed from a lack of understanding (49%) or training (46%). More than one-third, 34%, say data of insufficient quality is a pressing issue. In addition, managers cite they are concerned about having too little context behind decisions (34%) or, conversely, too much information (17%).
Ultimately, Ransbotham and his team see positive effects at all levels: “culture change from using AI transcends the legitimate, but myopic, promise that AI will liberate workers from drudgery.” Working with a company that has an open, innovative culture can be the best thing in the world — let’s hope AI can help more organizations achieve this.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



What is the role of an artificial intelligence (AI) engineer?
An AI engineer develops, programs, trains and deploys AI models. With 86% of companies in a recent survey reporting that AI is becoming mainstream in their businesses, the AI engineer has become a central figure.
While a data scientist focuses on finding and extracting business insights and applicable data from large datasets, an AI engineer comes from an IT infrastructure background and is charged with developing the algorithms for an AI application and integrating the application into a company’s broader tech environment. An engineer focused on algorithms may also be known as a machine learning (ML) engineer. Someone who specializes in integrating AI applications with an organization’s other technology may be known as an AI architect. Additionally, a professional specifically focused on writing code might have the title of AI developer.
[ Also read: 97% of execs say data science is “crucial” to maintaining profitability ]
Because an important part of an AI engineer’s job is applying AI to real-world use cases, these workers must understand the problems their companies face and find ways that AI can help solve them. That often includes collaborating with other departments and teaching others about AI’s potential.
AI engineer salary and benefits
AI engineers are highly skilled. They face a wide-open job market and are well compensated. ZipRecruiter reports that the average salary of an AI engineer is upwards of $158,000 a year, with top earners offered as much as $288,000 annually. Many companies employing these professionals also offer attractive benefits for these positions. AI engineering is a reasonably future-proof career, as AI is only becoming increasingly important to everyday life. 
Education, experience and soft skills are needed for the role
AI engineers typically require expertise in three broad areas:
Relevant, formal education through at least the level of a bachelor’s degree.Extensive experience in tech and/or data. The soft skills to collaborate productively on projects with colleagues.
Although more AI-specific courses are being added to undergrad and graduate programs all the time, many AI engineers have honed their specialties with certifications or a few courses to augment their foundational degrees.
AI engineers generally need at least a bachelor’s degree in a field such as computer science, IT, data science or statistics. Some positions may even require a master’s degree. advertisement
An advanced degree in a related area will qualify applicants for more positions. However, it may become less of a necessity over time. As the need for these workers rises, more companies are seeking experience over education.
Relevant certifications may be more useful. Taking extra AI engineer courses and exams can earn job-seekers AI-specific certifications that ensure they have the needed skills. On top of grabbing employers’ attention, these certifications will indicate an applicant has some helpful real-world experience with the day-to-day work of AI engineering.
This means a relatively broad pool of tech professionals may be candidates for a mid-career specialty in AI. Such workers, of course, must be able and motivated, and they may be found within or beyond an employer’s organization.

10 key skills needed to succeed as an AI engineer
Let’s look at some of the more specific skills required of an AI engineer:
1. Programming language proficiencyadvertisement
One of the most important skills to have as an AI engineer is proficiency in at least one programming language. Ideally, applicants should have experience working with multiple languages, as some companies may prefer working in one language over another. The more diverse experience, the better.
The top programming languages in the field include:
PythonC++ JavaScript JavaC#JuliaShellRTypeScriptScala
Python is the most popular language for machine learning applications and the third most popular overall, so is often considered a default requirement for the role. Students should work with at least a few languages in their AI engineering courses, but many professionals are self-taught to at least some degree, and they have likely demonstrated proficiency with personal projects.
2. Experience with AI models
While general programming knowledge is important, engineers also need to accrue AI-specific experience. Building and training AI models is a unique practice, and those interested in an AI career seek varied opportunities to build this expertise.
Cultivating this experience is a lot like gaining proficiency in programming languages, and it is best done by working with various types of AI models, including linear regression, classification algorithms, decision trees and deep neural networks. Experimenting with different models can also help AI engineers discover what they enjoy working with the most.
Learning to work with models also resembles the programming language process. Students in AI engineering courses will build and test a few models in their studies, but personal research is valuable too. Forums and exchanges like GitHub are good places for support with AI projects.
3. Linear algebra and statistics
AI engineers need a strong grasp of applied mathematics fields such as linear algebra and statistics. Different models require an understanding of different mathematical concepts. Engineers must know how to apply derivatives and integrals to tackle gradient descent algorithms, while probability theory and Gaussian distributions are important for Hidden Markov models. A college-level mathematics education will often provide the skills necessary. 
4. Data literacy
An AI engineer’s work revolves around data, and data literacy is one of the most important skills to have when entering this field. AI engineers should be able to read, understand, analyze and apply data to various use cases.
Formal data science and statistics classes are useful, but the best practice is engaging with data projects first-hand, which is another reason why experienced tech workers may be good candidates to develop for the role. 
5. Critical thinking
“Soft” skills are also important in this field, although they are often harder to gauge. One of the most important soft skills in AI engineering is critical thinking.
AI models can be complicated, and the solution to a problem is rarely immediately evident. As a result, delivering timely and accurate results with these technologies requires a fast, creative approach to problem-solving. 
AI engineers must be able to think through multiple solutions and determine the best course of action.
6. Business acumen
A skill that is sometimes overlooked — but useful for AI engineers to have — is a strong grasp of business concepts. Operations optimization and product enhancement are the most common AI use cases for businesses, so AI engineers should understand how these processes work. Effective AI application requires an understanding of how the company operates.
AI is only as effective as its users’ ability to apply it to their end goals. Top-performing AI engineers know not just how to build functioning AI models, but also how these models can help businesses serve their unique needs. That means understanding general business concepts and company-specific considerations.
Engineers can develop their business acumen in formal courses and/or by working with colleagues in other departments.
7. Communication skills
Another crucial soft skill to have is communication. AI engineers must be able to explain to their non-technical colleagues how different AI solutions might help teams reach their goals.
A lack of understanding of how AI can benefit businesses is the second-largest barrier to adoption, according to Gartner, with 42% of chief information officers (CIOs) citing it as a problem. Knowing how to explain AI concepts will improve cooperation. 
As the technology becomes more important to a wider variety of business functions, AI engineers will work with more departments. They must be able to communicate with other workers effectively for these relationships to work. Presentation and summary skills are particularly critical.
8. Collaboration
Along those same lines, AI engineers must have excellent teamwork skills to thrive in the current market. This goes beyond telling other departments how to use AI models effectively. AI engineers must be open to feedback and cooperate with other workers to understand the challenges they face.
Many AI engineers also work in groups, even within their own departments and projects. If they are unable to work well with others, they will struggle to excel in the industry. Conversely, strong collaborative skills will help them find effective solutions faster.
Experience working in groups helps naturally build these skills, too, so prospective engineers should seek collaborative projects to improve in this area. The better they can work as part of a team, the more success they’ll have in the field.
9. Time management
Building, testing and deploying AI models is often a time-consuming process, and time management is vitally important.
 A recent study found that 83% of developers suffer from workplace burnout, with high workloads being the leading cause. While AI engineers may have little control over their workloads, they can adapt their habits to make the most of them. Of course, company culture and strong management are important for keeping such valuable professionals in peak form.
10. Experience with related technologies
Artificial intelligence engineers should also gain experience in related technologies. Gathering relevant data and deploying AI models will likely involve working with technologies like internet of things (IoT) devices, robotics and cloud computing. Most AI projects fail, and the lack of an integrated environment is one of the most common reasons. If AI engineers hope to deploy their models effectively, working across a company’s unique IT environment is important. That means understanding the various technologies they may use.
More staffing options
The AI engineer’s role is essential and in-demand, but the AI industry is developing tools and options to enable less-specialized workers to build out applications as well:
Low-code and no-code options enable less-skilled staff to develop use cases. AI vendors increasingly offer prepackaged vertical and horizontal market solutions.AI vendors are also cultivating business partners to offer still more prepackaged implementations.Using various visual and dashboard interfaces, AI vendors are enabling non-technical business analysts to craft simple applications.Consulting services are expanding to meet project-specific needs, especially.
Organizations will adapt their solutions to their size and resources, the strategic importance of their implementations and their staffing markets and philosophies, and AI skills will continue to be diffused across the wider tech environment. The role of the AI engineer is still gaining importance and will be key to many companies’ adoption of the technology.

The app has been downloaded more than 100 million times from the Google Play store, and it ranks 15th among social networking apps on Apple’s App Store.The switch from text messaging to secure apps like Signal is part of “a growing public awareness over the past half-decade of the harms and reality of the Big Tech surveillance business model,” Ms. Whittaker said in an interview. That awareness, she added, has led people to “make choices that reject that business model and work to preserve their privacy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSignal, which started in 2014 and attracted privacy-minded users from Silicon Valley, has grown into a mainstay messaging app. The service is free. Unlike other free apps, Signal has never raised venture capital funding or sold advertising.The nonprofit that maintains Signal is funded by donations — most notably a $50 million infusion in 2018 from Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp and Signal’s interim chief executive. (Mr. Acton left WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, in 2017 and has become a vocal critic of Meta.) Signal also collects donations from users, rewarding contributors with badges that they can display on their profiles.“Brian’s contribution helped lay a foundation where we have the room to work toward a broad base of support that sustains Signal for the long term,” Ms. Whittaker said. “It costs tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain Signal, and that’s a very lean budget compared to our competition.”Compared with the hundreds of people working on WhatsApp, Signal employs around 40 people.Ms. Whittaker, who did not provide her age, worked at Google as an artificial intelligence researcher for more than a decade. In 2018, she protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a military project that used artificial intelligence to interpret images gathered by drones, and its $90 million payout to an executive accused of sexual harassment.She left Google in 2019 and has since advised the F.T.C. chair, Lina Kahn, on artificial intelligence issues and researched artificial intelligence and ethics as a professor at New York University.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Whittaker said she planned to focus on policy as Congress weighed a bill that could require companies like Signal to break encryption and scan the contents of users’ messages.“To keep our privacy promises,” she said, “we need to keep our privacy designs robust.”Kate Conger is a technology reporter in the San Francisco bureau, where she covers the gig economy and social media.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Voice control: Give the people what they want 
Consumers, who are used to having answers at the tip of their fingers, have easily (and eagerly) adjusted to using their voice. The addition of artificial intelligence (AI) has made the transition seamless. Like web and mobile, voice is now transforming from just another interface into a distinct consumer channel. It is estimated that by 2024 the number of voice assistants will reach a staggering 8.4 billion, overtaking the world’s population. Further, the Voice Consumer Index 2021 surveyed technology users and found that one-third use voice technology daily. It is clear that voice technology is increasingly becoming an essential part of our day-to-day lives. The addition of voice user interfaces (VUIs) to appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators, will only further accelerate the trend within the home.  
AI around the home
Homes and devices are becoming more sophisticated and thus more difficult to operate seamlessly. Many appliances have deep feature sets that most users never access, thanks to the difficulty of the interface. With voice control, users don’t have to struggle with the microwave’s touchpad; they can simply say what they’re cooking and even save presets for favorite dishes. Users can tell the washing machine to be careful with delicate items, tell the kitchen faucet to fill a glass with water, and even tell the trash can to open itself when their hands are full.
While voice control is present today mainly on smart speakers and mobile devices, voice is prepared to go beyond that. Hardware and software advancements are making voice control practical for virtually any type of product. Industry efforts to increase voice service interoperability, or a device’s ability to support multiple voice assistants, can also be supported through design. Discreet or even invisible systems can be embedded into appliances, and new systems have immediate response times without cloud latency. 
The next iteration of voice control products will see increased integration of voice into standalone products that operate in different areas around the home. Some of these devices will utilize cloud technologies for their back-end intelligence, while others will keep interactions local at the edge. A new generation of sophisticated use cases awaits.  
Voice control for everyone
While every product is ready to host voice technology, there are still hurdles VUIs need to conquer before becoming equally useful for absolutely everyone.advertisement
One such hurdle is the need to accurately and consistently respond to people of different ages, with different dialects or speech disabilities. Thanks to machine learning, edge devices will become even more intelligent and useful over time. New systems will be able to better distinguish between different household voices, opening up new levels of personalization and security. Professional organizations like Black in AI, Women in Machine Learning and Women in Voice are working to increase the representation of diverse voices in AI, voice technology and machine learning. Organizations such as these will ultimately lead to greater innovation and inclusivity.
Users also need more support from brands in order to learn all that voice technology can do for them. Most users are simply stumbling upon voice experiences. Per the Voice Consumer Index 2021, many figure out how to have voice work for their household through basic trial-and-error, followed by tapping into relatives and friends, and then checking product packaging and websites. People want to do more with their voice assistants but are limited. Education is key to giving consumers what they already desire. 
AI-powered voice brings it all together advertisement
Voice is the unified method of control that helps all of these various devices work “together.” Voice makes the smart home smarter and easier to manage. Artificial intelligence, combined with machine learning, empowers devices to make an entire home ready to answer a user’s every beck and call. All that’s needed is a simple wake word or detectable sound. 
Algorithms are often the “secret sauce” that differentiates one voice control product from another, but this also leads to lack of interoperability. Devices that fail to work well together make simple tasks more difficult and are a top reason for consumer frustration. As the market matures, consumers will choose devices that can offer an integrated experience. To answer this demand, manufacturers will need to choose components, dev kits and SDKs that support voice service interoperability to allow customers to seamlessly talk to the service of their choice.
The alignment of market groups to a single standard, such as Matter, will facilitate the deployment of smart devices in the home. Standards give users the confidence that their chosen smart devices will reliably work together while taking the guesswork out of the purchasing process. Ultimately, any consumer will have the option of a connected home that is secure and seamless. 
The future of voice control will bring the freedom to speak voice commands without needing a smart speaker nearby. With the right support, voice technology will easily become a primary method of communication.

Since Boston Dynamics made its bright yellow robot, Spot, available to the general public to purchase in June 2020, the famously agile robo-dog has gone from cute-yet-creepy quadruped to must-have-helper on the factory floor and in industrial facilities. 
Now, recently-released updates to Spot make gaining data insights a top priority, while Spot’s chief engineer, Zack Jackowski, says researchers are making strides in their long-term efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into Spot.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



An out-of-the-box experience
The biggest overall difference in Spot’s latest software update, he told VentureBeat, is that the Boston Dynamics team packaged the robot’s applications into a more out-of-the-box experience. 
Historically, robots have been a great platform for developers, but now an operations team without a robotics team can buy a Spot, he explained. “Our typical customer last year was an innovation team at a really large enterprise that has some robotics experience –- they’re able to fend for themselves programming-wise and figure out how to fill in some of the missing pieces of a workflow,” he explained. 
Now, with the new software update, the team is starting to work with direct users of an inspection robot, such as a maintenance team along with an IT team. 
“They can get that robot and install it without writing any code themselves, without worrying about whether they can work this machine,” he said. “It’s built for maintenance personnel to be able to program missions, and for a non-robotic specialist IT department to be able to integrate that data into the rest of their systems.” 
Spot’s current AI for data collection
There is currently no artificial intelligence used for Spot’s walking control over how the robot plans paths and understands the world around it. “We use pretty conventional non-AI techniques in those systems, because we know how to work with those really well and they’re very predictable,” Jackowski said. 
However, AI can solve important problems when it comes to the data the robot collects, which Boston Dynamics does with a variety of partner companies, including IBM and startups such as Levatas. 
“For example, we use AI for reading analog gauges at industrial facilities,” said Jackowski. “You have to read the numbers of the gauges to figure out what a piece of equipment is doing –- that’s an AI problem to figure out exactly what that gauge is saying.” 
AI also helps Spot around thermal anomaly detection. “We’re training AI models to look at a piece of equipment with a thermal camera and understand if there’s an abnormal condition,” he said. 
Boston Dynamics’ long-term AI goals
For the use of AI, one of the big robotics challenges is that right now Spot perceives the world pretty simply, as geometry, he added. 
When humans look around, he explained, they can see a toolbox or a hose and understand what those objects mean. “They know that it probably belongs to someone or I shouldn’t step on it or that it will move when I step on it,” he said. advertisement
That means there is a lot of promise for semantic understanding, he explained –- that is, understanding what objects mean in the context of everyday life to make the robots work better. That is coming for Spot, but “it’s a little ways off,” he said. “There’s still a lot to be done to get that kind of stuff into a product that’s ready for mass market deployment,” he added, including understanding what features customers need and product testing. 
One example of Boston Dynamics’ efforts in AI research was the launch in mid-August of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Boston Dynamics AI Institute to “spearhead advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics.” The Institute was started with over $400 million of initial investment from Boston Dynamics and Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ parent company) and will focus on four core areas: cognitive AI, athletic AI, organic hardware design and robot ethics.
A bright future for Boston Dynamics’ Spot
Since Boston Dynamics’ Spot was revealed in 2016, Jackowski said the company has “changed public perception and just showed the art of the possible.” 
But, he added that he and his team are most excited about making robotics useful to the enterprise. advertisement
For example, Boston Dynamics client GlobalFoundries, a semiconductor manufacturer based in Burlington, Vermont, “is doing some super-exciting work with Spots right now,” said Jackowski.  
“They actually have Spot walking around their basement and taking thermal images of all these pieces of support equipment that processes the wafers, to identify before something fails completely so they can do preventive maintenance,” he said. “It’s really exciting for us to go from hey, there are some robots out in the world and we’ve got some really cool videos to hey, there’s multiple thousands of these in industrial facilities doing real work for people.” 
The rest of 2022, he added, will “probably be pretty subdued –- we’re actually pretty careful about how frequently we roll out new software to our customers because they’re starting to really rely on the jobs that the robots are doing and are hesitant to take software updates that might change things they didn’t expect.” 
Another big feature release, with a couple of specific AI-powered features, will likely come in early 2023. “But right now our top focus is 100% on customer success and deployment into day-to-day operation in our customers’ facilities,” he said.

Artificial intelligence is a transformative tool in the workplace — except when it isn’t.
For top managers, state-of-the art AI tools are a no-brainer: in theory, they increase revenues, decrease costs, and improve the quality of products and services. But in the wild, it’s often just the opposite for frontline employees who actually need to integrate these tools into their daily work. Not only can AI tools yield few benefits, but they can also introduce additional work and decrease autonomy.advertisement

Our research on the introduction of 15 AI clinical decision support tools over the past five years at Duke Health has shown that the key to successfully integrating them is recognizing that increasing the value for frontline employees is as important as making sure the tools work in the first place. The tactics we identified are useful not only in biopharma, medicine, and health care, but across a range of other industries as well.

How AI And Machine Learning Will Impact The Future Of HealthcareAdobe Stock

Some experts are predicting that the healthcare industry is the sector that could be the most affected by the enormous changes of the fourth industrial revolution.

I recently spoke with Tom Lawry, National Director of AI for Health & Life Sciences at Microsoft, about the future of healthcare. Here are some of his biggest insights and predictions:

Current Challenges in Healthcare
PROMOTED
The U.S. currently spends more money on healthcare than any other country in the world, but its individual health outcomes are lower than most other developed nations.
Additionally, clinician burnout is a huge problem, particularly since the pandemic.
Individuals in different generations also want healthcare that is personalized to their needs. Tom says:
“Millennials want to be able to have their healthcare consult from the same place they order their dinner — which is their couch. Meanwhile, you have groups like baby boomers who have a very different approach. They're much more inclined to want to focus on a primary care provider…so we have the ability to go from that one-size-fits-all in care delivery with these systems to using data and AI to truly personalize it, starting with care that's generational. Then even within each generation — millennials, Gen Z, etc. — we have the ability to allow them to access and manage care on their own terms.”

The good news is that most large healthcare organizations are beginning to make use of some form of AI. However, we’re still early in the journey of learning how we can apply artificial intelligence to make healthcare better.

One of the primary use cases is using machine learning and AI to make predictions. Organizations are using AI to predict everything from emergency department volumes (to get a better handle on staffing and triage) to predicting which treatments might be most effective for women who develop breast cancer.
Healthcare teams are also using natural language processing to improve the interpretation of patient scans by augmenting the work of human radiologists. Tom says:
“When a radiologist looks at a scan, they’re typically looking for one thing, which is the reason you have that image done. But many times in the background, there's something else that can be seen. So as radiologists are dictating, natural language processes are being used to call out these secondary issues for follow-up, where previously those things might go unnoticed…so it's a preventive way of trying to get out ahead of a future health problem.”
The biggest promise of AI in healthcare comes from changing clinical workflows. AI can add value by either automating or augmenting the work of clinicians and staff. Many repetitive tasks will become fully automated, and we can also use AI as a tool to help health professionals perform better at their jobs and improve outcomes for patients.
The healthcare organizations that will be the most successful are the ones that will be able to fundamentally rethink and reimagine their workflows and processes and use machine learning and AI to create a truly intelligent health system.

Why We Haven’t Fulfilled the Promise of AI in Healthcare Yet
When I asked Tom why we’re not yet using AI effectively across our entire healthcare system, he said:
“It’s really about leaders understanding the capabilities of AI today, and then looking at how to apply it to add value. The value of AI doesn't come from the technology; it comes from changing clinical workflows and operational processes. AI adds value in only one or two ways: It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done. Automation means highly repetitive work done by humans today is going to be done by a smart machine today or in the future. But the biggest part of healthcare today is augmentation…the idea of augmentation is, ‘How do we bring AI in behind the humans to make them better at something they care about?’”
According to Tom, senior leaders in the healthcare space don’t necessarily need to understand how AI works — they just need to grasp the power of AI and how it can help them provide personalized care for people more efficiently and compassionately.
For example, the government of Singapore is currently making use of machine learning and deep algorithms to help manage the health of people who are pre-diabetic. The government has mined the data of approximately five million citizens to identify people who are pre-diabetic, and then recruited people to volunteer to be part of a program where they receive personalized daily nudges about what they can do to take charge of their health and lower their blood sugar. This highly personalized advice has been highly successful at slowing participants’ progression from pre-diabetic to diabetic.

Healthcare Workers Have No Reason to Fear AI
AI will impact the work of many people in the healthcare industry, but there’s no need to fear: Machines won’t be replacing healthcare providers anytime soon.
“What artificial intelligence is good at is things like pattern recognition,” Tom says. “It's great at sifting through massive amounts of data to find something that humans either aren't capable of finding or would take years humans to find. On the other hand, humans are great at wisdom, common sense, empathy, and creativity, all of which are vitally important when you think about the care process.”
To be able to adapt to future trends and the integration of AI into the healthcare system, clinicians simply need to become aware of the power of this new technology and understand that the world is changing. Instead of taking over jobs, building an intelligent health system will make clinicians better at what they do, while improving patient experiences.
It’s clearly a win-win all around.

The office subsumed multiple other defense digital authorities, including the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and the Defense Digital Services, and reached full operational capability on June 1.While much of the talk about the CDAO has focused on its role as the Pentagon’s leading AI authority, Martell said more attention and energy needs to be paid to data, which he said serves as the basis of the office’s “hierarchy of needs.”In order to address the challenge of AI, the Pentagon needs to focus less on top-down AI decrees, he said, adding that while data decrees are still necessary, top-down AI restrictions hinder progress.Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer Craig Martell speaks at a Department of Defense virtual conference June 7, 2022. (Screenshot/Provided/DoD) By focusing more on controlling data, the Pentagon can build a support structure that allows for heterogeneity among the different actors and companies working on AI projects, he said.“It shouldn’t be centralized,” he said. “If we centralize it, we’re losing what I think is the biggest strength of the American industrial academic base.”After building out data, Martell said the CDAO should focus on metrics, noting that outcome-based measurement, and not just effort-based measures, ought to be the standard. From metrics should come analytics, with AI coming in only once the needed infrastructure is in place.“We have a very large AI challenge ahead of us but in order to do this, we have to get the data right,” he said.About  Catherine BuchaniecCatherine Buchaniec is a reporter at C4ISRNET, where she covers artificial intelligence, cyber warfare and uncrewed technologies.

Explore three ways AI already impacts the design and engineering fields, from generative design to advanced robotics.

This article is based on a Raconteur report about the democratization of product design. You can download your copy of the full report here.
Recent advancements in computational power, cloud connectivity, and neural network complexity have ushered in a new era called “The Augmented Age.” Artificial intelligence (AI) tools already augment many aspects of our daily routines. In the next five years, a vast majority of product design companies also anticipate relying on them heavily. Maurice Conti, who coined the phrase, describes a world in which AI augments the human ability to design, build, and employ products at every step of the design process. 
This article explores three ways AI already impacts the design and engineering fields.
Is generative design AI?
Generative design harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate design iterations based on constraints identified by the designer or engineer. Typically, generative design is used to reduce weight, reduce manufacturing costs, and optimize part performance. Generative design uses AI to some extent, but it is just one step in the process. Humans are required at the beginning of the process to define constraints and at the end of the process as the final decision-maker. After all, someone needs to sift through the list of design iterations generative design creates! 
Generative design for ideation
Ideation is the first and most striking stage of AI-enhanced product development. Even agile design teams typically iterate less than a hundred concepts and prototypes throughout a project. 
Today, using generative design offers the ability to explore thousands of possible solutions across the entire design space. “Rather than starting with a drawing, the designer starts with the parameters required for the end product,” Peter Champneys, a research engineer at Autodesk describes. “The system then generates thousands of potential solutions in just a few hours and identifies the top few options that best fit the requirements.” 

Not every AI-generated design is a viable solution, however. AI design results can be impressive, yielding lighter, stronger, and more manufacturable products than ever before. “The human contribution is to then evaluate the outputs and determine the best performing, most cost effective and visually attractive solution.”
AI & advanced robotics for development
An often overlooked application of AI in the product design cycle is using robotics for prototyping and building. Additive manufacturing, CNC machining, automated welding, and many other tools rely heavily on AI to achieve functionality and precision beyond human capability. Advanced robotics can do much more than mundane, repetitive tasks. Robots can even utilize sensory inputs like vision, touch, temperature, and sound. 
The Hive Project
An excellent example of the synergy between humans and artificially intelligent robots is the Hive Project. This was a collaboration between Autodesk and The Institute for Computational Design (ICD) at the University of Stuttgart. The goal was to construct a specialized three-dimensional surface using bamboo and string. 
Machines and robots using AI were employed as high-level construction managers, precision machinists, and string assembly technicians. In contrast, humans selected and manipulated the highly irregular bamboo pieces. Together, they created a structure that couldn’t have been built without human and AI collaboration.  
Closed-loop engineering
The final piece of the puzzle bringing us into the augmented age is the closing of the design loop. This means feeding product lifecycle data back into the iteration process. Closing the loop can happen in two ways. The first is the aggregation and analysis of sensor data from within the product. And the second is customer feedback from interacting with and using the product. Between the widespread adoption of wireless sensor nodes and cloud-based computation and storage — that’s a lot of aggregated data. In fact, it’s often too much for humans to interpret.   
Here, AI can be relied upon to extract meaningful data trends and inflection points in how a product performs in real-world applications. This data can then be fed back into the generative design process with the help of a human designer to update parameters and optimize future changes in the product. 
CityBot by EDAG Group



One example of a closed-loop, generative design is CityBot. Citybot is a modular, configurable, multi-functional mobility platform from EDAG engineering. It’s an adaptable mobility robot that can reconfigure into different form factors depending on the application — a forklift in a warehouse to a trash collector in a public park. Customer requirement specifications and usage data from CityBots are fed into a generative design loop to realize an optimized product. 
As Sebastian Flügel, Project Leader at EDAG Group describes it: “The big change [from the old process] is that generative design creates the geometry automatically, and with Fusion 360, we can automatically recalculate these products, and we can create new solutions based on the changed conditions.”
“With all the sensors embedded in our parts, we know precisely if the part is stressed, which parts need to be improved, lighter or stronger for each function,” Johannes Barckmann, Global Design Manager at EDAG Engineering, explains.
This automated and continuous optimization type has never been seen in traditional manufacturing environments. The result is unprecedented flexibility and customer satisfaction.
The reality of AI adoption
The widespread adoption of generative design, advanced robotics, and closed-loop engineering will require more than just technological advancement. A widespread cultural shift will need to occur. Engineers and designers must leverage the value of AI in their day-to-day thinking to realize the full potential of the augmented age.

Losing to China in AI, Emerging Tech Will Cost U.S. Trillions, Threaten Security, Says Panel

A grim future awaits the United States if it loses the competition with China on developing key technologies like artificial intelligence in the near future, the authors of a special government-backed study told reporters on Monday.
If China wins the technological competition, it can use its advancements in artificial intelligence and biological technology to enhance its own country’s economy, military and society to the determent of others, said Robert Work, former deputy defense secretary and co-chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project, which examined international artificial intelligence and technological competition. Work is the chair of the U.S. Naval Institute Board of Directors.
Losing, in Work’s opinion, means that U.S. security will be threatened as China is able to establish global surveillance, companies will lose trillions of dollars and America will be reliant on China or other countries under Chinese influence for core technologies.
“If that world happens, it’s going to be very bleak for democracy … China’s sphere of influence will grow as its technological platforms proliferate throughout the world, and they will be able to establish surveillance on a global scale,” he said. “So that’s what losing looks like.”
The U.S. needs to address the technological competition now because there is only one budget cycle before 2025, the year that China set as a target for global dominance in technology manufacturing, said SCSP CEO Yll Bajraktari. By 2030, Beijing wants to be the AI global leader, he noted.
“The 2025-2030 timeframe is a really important period for our country and the global geopolitical security,” he said.
The technological competition goes beyond conflict or a military focus, said Eric Schmidt, co-chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and former Google CEO. His idea of winning looks at platforms.
One of the most popular social media sites is TikTok, which is Chinese-owned and operated out of Shanghai, Schmidt noted.
The U.S. also banned Huawei, a Chinese technology corporation, which outpaced American technology when it came to 5G.
“You can imagine the the issues with having platforms dominated by non-western firms, which we rely on,” Schmidt said.
The competition boils down to three battlegrounds, laid out in the Special Competitive Studies Project report, Bajraktari said. Those three spaces are AI, chips and 5G.
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22337215-scsp-mid-decade-challenges-to-national-competitiveness?responsive=1&title=1
“And the importance to get these three battlegrounds right is really critical because as I’ve said, this is not just about military competition,” Bajraktari said. “This is about all the benefits that all these three battlegrounds will bring to our economy and our society. And ultimately, you know, our military can use it too.”
When it comes to 5G, the U.S. does not yet have a good plan to compete with China, he said, pointing to Huawei as an example. Beijing also controls about 70 percent of African 4G, he said.
China has also invested billions of dollars toward chip production, going all in, Bajraktari said. And for AI, the country claims it wants to be the global leader.
Winning the competition does not mean the U.S. needs to control the production of critical technology, but it does need to be able to compete in the arena, Work said. The U.S. needs to have a dominant position in technological platforms and control global digital infrastructure, he said.
“And we definitely want to be able to harness biotech for the safety and livelihood of our citizens and new energy,” Work said.
If the U.S. cannot plan to excel in the three battlegrounds, advancements in biotech and computer power and next-generation inventions will happen in countries like China instead of democracies, Bajraktari said.
“And so the stakes of these competitions are beyond just the military competition,” Bajraktari said. ”It’s about who’s going to enjoy the benefits for all the inventions that will come from this.”

AI or Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly ruling the current digital workspace, and according to PwC’s Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The overwhelming narrative that AI and Automation will take over human jobs, it may or may not be true, but these technologies are undoubtedly changing the nature of roles currently on offer. However, certain aspects of the roles now performed by humans continue to be beyond AI - tasks that are personal, creative, management, and those that deal with human emotions. Jobs involving these tasks will require Human-AI collaboration where humans will manage, monitor, and even teach these machines. Hence being smart and thinking ahead to acquire expertise in these skills can add tremendous value to an individual’s current role. 
This blog explores the job roles that will be benefited by the introduction of AI and Automation, as they directly complement and enhance these roles.
Here's the bright chance to create your dream career! Enroll in the Post Graduate Program in AI and Machine Learning with Purdue University collaborated with IBM today, and take the first step towards your dream career.
Problem Solvers
Problems solvers are those who like managing people, events, and jobs to deliver positive outcomes. While some people have this as an inherent skill, others need to work on building ingenuity and problem-solving skills. Today, these skills are highly in demand and require skilled professionals who can utilize information and knowledge to resolve issues and engineer solutions. Jobs that require in-depth problem-solving skills are computer system analysts, air traffic controllers, actuaries, and hospitalists.
AI and machine learning can do wonders in calculating figures at an astonishing rate. They can provide the right solution to a problem in no time. However, human intelligence is required to complement this AI feature. For example, training a machine to recognize the shape of a cat or a dog needs to feed multiple images to their memory. Even then, the most advanced AI-enabled machines get confused when asked to pick between the pictures of a dog-shaped tree and the real dog.
Computer Engineers (Hardware)
With the ever-growing field of AI and automation, the growth in the demand for qualified hardware engineers is foreseeable. A McKinsey report predicts that the need for skilled engineers, including computer scientists, engineers, IT administrators, IT workers, and tech consulters, will increase by 20 million to 50 million globally by 2030. AI and automation need engineers to build, run, and maintain them.
Mechanical Engineers 
The core job of mechanical engineers is to build machines that perform specific tasks. And the machine needs men.  An AI-enabled machine can produce a desired amount of torque and provide you a complete set of gears, but it can not build a fully automated car without human intervention. While robots can prove to be a great assistance, but they need humans as the master at creating any sophisticated system. 
Healthcare Professionals
Artificial Intelligence is already being used to diagnose and treat diseases. For instance, IDx-DR is the first-ever autonomous AI system that instantly detects the condition. With the backing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide diagnostic support, it detects signs of diabetic retinopathy in visual images and then uses an algorithm to create a binary diagnosis in minutes. AI can also be extensively used in treating cardiovascular diseases, as well. The presence of AI will help medical professionals in diagnosing diseases quicker and, utilizing the data gathered from AI algorithms, work on finding better solutions. Hence, it becomes essential for healthcare providers/radiologists/pathologists to grasp and implement these technologies. 
Creative Jobs(Art, Writing)
Computers have been used for artistic purposes ever since it was invented. Everyone knows about Google DeepDream- a visualization tool and how funny and trippy images it can create. However, art in any form requires a high level of creativity. It needs ideas, engagement, style, and beauty. While robots can assist you in writing social media posts, suggest headlines, book titles, or imitate writing styles, the best art- books, paintings, films, and plays will ultimately be created by humans, at least in the immediate future.

AI Research and Engineering 
With the growth of AI and automation, there will naturally be a rise in the demand for skilled AI professionals. Also, some entry-level AI positions can get automated in the future as technology progresses. Thus, AI professionals will be required to upskill with the current advancements in AI. Similarly, software engineers will have to upskill with assembly language, high-level language, object-oriented programming, mobile programming, and now AI programming.
With new opportunities and industry growth paths, new and unique job positions are being created in every area of business operations. Here are some of the most sought-after AI roles:


AI/Machine Learning Researcher 
Responsible for improving machine learning algorithms 

AI Software Development, Program Management, and Testing
Developing systems and infrastructure that can use machine learning to derive critical business insights

Data Mining and Analysis
Performing deep investigation of enormous data sources, often creating and training systems to recognize patterns that will be crucial to business decisions

Machine Learning Applications 
Responsible for applying machine learning or AI framework to a varied range of business problems, like ad analysis, fraud detection and gesture recognition
