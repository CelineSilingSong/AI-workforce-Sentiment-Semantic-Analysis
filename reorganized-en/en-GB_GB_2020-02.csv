In the age of artificial intelligence, technology has given us many online tools, apps, and robots to help us educate our children. But, as parents know, nothing beats one-on-one interaction between a parent and a child. Our children learn most effectively by social means. 


With the influx of technology, there’s one inherent problem in our current education system that seems to be amplified: flexibility. 

Our children never had the “flexibility” of education that can provide them with a tailored experience to fulfill their potential. We had camps, schools, after school activities, etc.. But now we have much more.

Now, with the use of AI and robotics, we can tailor curriculums and provide personalized distance learning options. We can even provide therapeutic options for students with special needs. 

PROMOTED
With an increase in flexible learning options, we are faced with too many choices while still grappling with the inflexible behemoth of our current public education system. 
Can a mixture of technology options and our public education system provide what our children will need to usher them into the age of artificial intelligence?
This is the question that many parents are asking. 
There’s no doubt that many parts of our public school education system needs to change. Educator Sir Ken Robinson, the author of Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That’s Transforming Education speaks about the way that we need to change our education system so that we can help our kids succeed in their future world.

Creativity is at the center of progress
The catch 22 in our current education system is the question of creativity. As technology advances, humans are put in a position of having to be more creative. At the same time, without creativity, our humanity doesn’t progress and our technology doesn’t progress either.

Creativity is not just about creating artworks, making music, or writing poetry.
Creativity underlies every single profession in our future of work.
With the help of an AI, every single one of us: teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, programmers, politicians, and shop keepers, etc.. will be making decisions about more complex problems. We will get to a point when an AI will be integrated into our work to help us become more efficient. The complex world will demand us — humans, to be that much more creative in our future of work. 
No, we don’t want to offload the best parts of us, such as creativity to an AI. 
This is why we must step up to the job. 
We’ve got to show our children how to step up to the job as well. We are educating people out of their creative capacities.. I believe this passionately, that we don’t grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it.

Ken Robinson
More technology is not the whole solution, the whole solution is a mindset change
What does it mean to educate a creative child? The answer is not what we expect. Some of us who came out of the rigid system of education is not familiar with the concept of educating a creative child.
This is when we need to shift our mindset.
Educating a creative child can mean letting your child engage in messy play at the expense of cleaning up right away.
Educating a creative child can mean a focus on art and physical education as much as focusing on STEM subjects.
Educating a creative child can mean that coaching a child is as important as teaching a child.
This mindset shift of educating our children how we have always done it versus let’s find out how we can do better is an important one.
Replace the complacency with action
Currently, many of us are struggling with the future of work. It’s tempting to put off our children’s education and just let the system take care of it. The truth is that complacency actually leads us to fear. Complacency in times of change leads us to a place where we fear for the future. 
The best way to deal with water is simply to float above the water and swim. 
Visualize change as the action of a wave. It may inundate you with emotions for a few weeks if the change is drastic. But, once you go through that, you can adapt by swimming in it and taking action.
We can all see the future of artificial intelligence. It’s not coming in tidal waves of months but rather years. Still, it’s there. We can see the wave coming up over the horizon.  
To deal with it effectively, burying comfort is the first step. Taking action to come up with a plan of action for our children will snap the fear at its source. 
Ask yourself these questions:


What does my child need? 
How can I help my child unleash their potential? 


Each one of us along with our children can cultivate their intelligence by walking alongside of them on their learning journey.
Instead of teaching, how about facilitating opportunities for them to learn?
Integrate your learning with your child’s
There’s no better time to learn with your child. Yes, we don’t know everything that there’s to know. If we admit that, then it’s that much easier to be empathetic toward your child’s learning path. Learning with your child means going on an exploration with your child. Both of you don’t know where you will end up. That’s what’s thrilling.
Kobe Bryant taught his daughter to play basketball.
Kris Jenner taught her children to run businesses.
Maria Shriver taught her children to care about the world around them.
In each of these cases, these parents are not just teaching their children about their own professions and values. They are increasing their own depth of knowledge by going on an educational journey with their children.
The path of learning is failing over and over again
There’s nothing more powerful than the gut-wrenching feeling of failure. You feel humiliated. You can’t get up from your bed. You want to eat a tub of ice cream. Sometimes, even when you know that you gave it your all, you still feel terrible when things didn’t work out. 
If you are watching your child go through this process, you can feel worse.
It’s tempting to show them how to do it so that they can avoid feeling like a failure.
My question to you is that, would you rather have your child fail “young”, when no one is watching, or would you rather have your child fail as an adult when the world is watching? 
Failures are lessons that are hard-won. They are opportunities to imprint a set of values and experiences that will consistently remind your child of important lessons. 
In the end, your child will learn whether you are there or not. Your child’s learning process might start with your encouragement but it will carry on without you.
How do you set them up for success?
In the age of artificial intelligence, as parents, we are blessed to have so many tools available to design a flexible, tailored set of education for our children. We are empowered to work with teachers, and our community to set our children up for success in their future of work. If we simply shifted our mindset and took small steps to steer our everyday actions toward unleashing our children’s potential, the end result, in the next decade, is that our collective efforts have the power to change the world. Now, that’s something to look forward to.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  HSBC Holdings is a multinational banking and financial services holding company and is ranked 99th on the Fortune 500 list. The bank has worked with multiple AI vendors and provided evidence of success that other top banks lack. According to our AI Opportunity Landscape research on how the top global banks are using AI, besides Deutsche Bank, HSBC is the European bank with the most AI initiatives. HSBC’s AI initiatives account for 12.5% of the AI initiatives at the European banks in our analysis.  In this article, we cover the bank’s work with two vendors in particular: Ayasdi: AI for anti-money laundering and reducing false positives in fraud detection processes. Element AI: AI for compliance and predicting services customers might need. We begin our dive into HSBC’s AI initiatives with its anti-money laundering solution from Ayasdi.  HSBC’s AI-enabled Anti-Money Laundering Solution In 2018, HSBC partnered with Ayasdi to develop an AI-enabled anti-money laundering solution. The software can purportedly identify patterns within historical data that may point toward money laundering, which helps the bank stop payments before they violate regulations. Ayasdi claims to have reduced HSBC’s false positives by 20% and found numerous behavioral patterns directly related to fraud. The solution was developed in collaboration with HSBC’s IT team and Ayasdi’s data scientists and developers. The IT team purportedly helped Ayasdi access and parse the bank’s AML data. Additionally, the internal modeling review team helped Ayasdi create more accurate models for customer behavior. The bank could then understand these models because they were made using terms they were already familiar with.  Ayasdi’s solutions are primarily based on anomaly detection technology, which is helpful for recognizing deviations from a pre-established norm. They claim their software analyzes the sources and destinations of customer payments to make sure the funds are coming from legitimate sources. Anomaly detection software seems to have worked well for HSBC and other banks looking to improve their defense against money laundering. This is because well-trained algorithms may recognize deviations much faster than human analysts at computers.  HSBC’s Interest in AI for Trade Flow and Document Search In 2019, HSBC announced a partnership with Element.AI, a firm that primarily offers AI solutions for trade flow and document search. They also offer AI business management solutions such as an access governor that determines which employees can access which sets of data.  HSBC claims their goal for this partnership is to improve global regulatory compliance in areas such as anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, the solution would help them predict which services and product solutions their clients may need in the future.  HSBC may be able to achieve its goal of global compliance using AI resources from Element. An NLP solution would allow them to automatically tag new information with metadata for greater searchability and transparency.  This allows a client company to more accurately retrieve data requested by a customer or auditor. One example of this is a situation where a customer requests all of their personal data be deleted from the company’s database. Element AI’s solutions most likely run on some combination of natural language processing (NLP) and predictive analytics technology. NLP could be used to create document search applications and automatically tag documents with metadata. HSBC likely intends to use Element’s predictive analytics engine to study customer data for information that could indicate potential problems. For example, Element’s software may be able to detect metadata tags pertaining to the type of customer support issue for each email. It could then determine that the majority of their customer support tickets come from their mobile app not recognizing a verification code.  Most of these customers could report a problem where the app would not allow them to log in until they have requested a second code and used it for verification. HSBC may be able to recognize this problem as it arises and begin working on a fix earlier than if detected and reported manually by customer service agents.

Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.On Friday, Pope Francis backed a document that outlines how artificial intelligence, including facial recognition technology, should be regulated. This so-called “Rome Call for AI Ethics” carries the endorsement of the Vatican as well as Microsoft and IBM. Believe it or not, the future of AI is actually one of the pope’s passion projects — and greatest worries.The Vatican’s interest in the technology is hardly new, and several of its pontifical academies — essentially research societies under the Pope’s authority — are hard at work studying what AI, robotics, and other emerging technologies will mean for the Catholic faith and humanity at large. Still, the document is a sign that organized religion is increasingly interested in weighing in on the ethics of artificial intelligence and, in the case of the Vatican, working alongside large tech companies in the process.Six general principles for the use of artificial intelligence are at the center of the Rome Call, which declares that ethics must be integral to an algorithm’s initial design. But notably, none of the outlined principles are particularly new ideas. The pope’s pledge embraces the values that many AI ethics experts have already called for by pointing to values of transparency, nondiscrimination, and the right to privacy. That somewhat echoes some of the nonbinding AI guidelines the European Union released last year, as well as the Trump administration’s guidance for the federal regulation of artificial intelligence (released in January).From the “Rome Call for AI Ethics”Transparency: in principle, AI systems must be explainable;Inclusion: the needs of all human beings must be taken into consideration so that everyone can benefit and all individuals can be offered the best possible conditions to express themselves and develop;Responsibility: those who design and deploy the use of AI must proceed with responsibility and transparency;Impartiality: do not create or act according to bias, thus safeguarding fairness and human dignity;Reliability: AI systems must be able to work reliably; [and]Security and privacy: AI systems must work securely and respect the privacy of users.“AI systems must be conceived, designed and implemented to serve and protect human beings and the environment in which they live,” the document reads. “This fundamental outlook must translate into a commitment to create living conditions (both social and personal) that allow both groups and individual members to strive to fully express themselves where possible.”Alongside these principles is a mandate from the Vatican and its affiliates for AI to be “explainable” to humans. In other words, as artificial intelligence is increasingly applied in consequential contexts — like algorithms that screen our resumes and determine whether we’re granted parole — we need to understand how artificially intelligent technology makes decisions. AI ethics advocates argue that such “explainability” is one of the key ways we can hold artificial-intelligence-based systems accountable.The Rome Call also emphasizes that artificial intelligence should not be discriminatory, echoing board concerns about algorithmic bias. Depending on who builds them, how they’re built, and the data on which they’re trained, computer systems can end up mimicking and even amplifying societal racism, sexism, and other forms of bias. This is bad, says the pope.Also (maybe) bad: facial recognition, one of the most controversial applications of artificial intelligence. This is a particularly buzzworthy topic, as the fallout of the Clearview AI scandal demonstrates how facial recognition technology raises significant concerns about security and human rights. However, the Vatican’s new statement on the matter does not raise the idea of a complete ban or moratorium on facial recognition, which some critics of the technology say is necessary. Instead, the Vatican simply seems to call for better rules to govern the tech.“New forms of regulation must be encouraged to promote transparency and compliance with ethical principles,” the document reads, “especially for advanced technologies that have a higher risk of impacting human rights, such as facial recognition.”The Catholic Church is actually no stranger to artificial intelligence. In recent years, much of its focus on the technology has been in consultation with expert researchers in the field and representatives of major technology companies. The Dominican Order has even supported a priest-led research organization called Optic since 2012, which, among other things, researches AI and its potential to marginalize people. The organization also says it provides private consultations to leaders in the tech industry.Meanwhile, the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life has hosted workshops on artificial intelligence. The effort extends further, as last year, two more pontifical academies — the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences — hosted a conference on the ethical questions raised by robotics and artificial intelligence. These conferences have been attended by the likes of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Facebook computer scientist Yann LeCun, and even LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. The Vatican’s much-covered first hackathon in 2018 was also supported by companies such as Google, Salesforce, and Microsoft.The list of Silicon Valley stars hanging out in Rome goes on. The Pope himself has personally met with Microsoft president Brad Smith, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google’s Eric Schmidt. Earlier this month, the Pope met Smith to discuss how artificial intelligence could serve the “common good,” according to Reuters.So it might not be surprising that the Vatican’s vision for artificial intelligence appears to mirror much of what tech giants are already saying: Regulate our new technology, but don’t ban it outright.Keep in mind that, as Wired reported last year, tech companies have been actively trying to influence the rules that will govern this new technology. Some, such as Microsoft, are even creating AI principles of their own. There’s also the Partnership for AI, a corporate-funded nonprofit meant to study best practices for artificial intelligence that is supported by Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and IBM, among other companies.The Rome Call is just another sign that the Vatican is paying close attention to emerging technology. And, for whatever it’s worth, tech companies seem eager to come along. While new faith-filled robots and AI-inspired gods stand to shape conversations about religion in the 21st century, there are also complicated conversations between age-old religious institutions and powerful tech platforms that it would be a mistake to ignore.Open Sourced is made possible by the Omidyar Network.

By Jerimiah OettingUPDATED: February 29, 2020 at 7:00 a.m.How many scientists does it take to design a better battery? According to a new study, artificial intelligence might do it better and faster than human scientists ever could.Researchers at Stanford University employed artificial intelligence to work out a method for rapidly charging a battery while minimizing the impacts on the battery’s lifespan. The technique, a form of AI called machine learning optimization, revealed an ideal charging method in a fraction of the time it would have taken using traditional experiments. It’s a method that the scientists say can shorten the time it takes to design better batteries in the future.“The goal was to get better batteries faster. Our paper provides one solution, which is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the process,” said William Chueh, a materials scientist at Stanford who co-led the team.Improving batteries is a major step in California’s goal of reaching carbon-free electricity by 2045. Batteries are necessary for storing electricity generated by wind and solar. And battery-powered electric cars are becoming more common around the Bay Area and beyond, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“The reason this is exciting is because battery research and development is a really long process … batteries last a really long time,” Chueh said. “You don’t get the instant reward of knowing if something worked or not.”The team, which included scientists from the Toyota Research Institute, wanted to apply a machine learning approach to a specific problem: charging an electric car battery to 80% of its capacity in only 10 minutes, while minimizing stress on the battery that would shorten its life.

About ConnatixV510246 What’s next in AI: Can we become virtually immortal?Do we want to?“People don’t want to take a road trip and then have to wait 40 minutes to recharge,” said Peter Attia, the lead author of the study, which was completed when he was a graduate student at Stanford. Attia said the fear of running out of a charge is a common deterrent to electric car ownership.Normally, testing a new battery design requires observing how the battery behaves over repeated charging cycles — a process that can take years before the battery fails. Instead of this lengthy approach, the researchers fed “training data” from past experiments into a computer, teaching it to accurately predict how long the batteries would last after only 100 charging cycles. That shortened the process of testing a battery with each charging method from 40 days to four.

Then, the computers detected patterns in the results of each experiment, and whittled down the options for the next round of tests, speeding up the process even more.“Humans don’t usually work that way. We have intuitions,” Chueh said. “We think a certain thing works better based on our understanding of the process.”He said the AI tested 224 different charging methods, and produced a solution in just 16 days. That process would have normally required over a year and a half to accomplish.“It’s a pretty big multiplier in terms of time-saving,” Chueh said. “Not to mention, the answer you arrive at may be better than the one that you would get in the ordinary approach.”While this particular example used artificial intelligence to identify the best way to charge a battery, the researchers said AI could improve all aspects of battery design, from the way they’re manufactured to their internal chemistry.“I’m pretty excited about the future of AI development,” Attia said. “AI gets a lot of flack for being used for (advertising). But I think there’s a lot of excitement now for getting AI to accelerate science.”Attia notes that machine learning is also being used in the field of genetics, to create better cancer treatments, and to speed up pharmaceutical development.But using complicated machine learning programs is a bit of a black box, according to Matthieu Dubarry, a battery specialist at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute.“You could get a result without understanding how you got there,” he said. “As a scientist, that bothers me a little.”Dubarry cautions that speeding up the design process using machine learning depends on the strength of the training data involved, which has to reflect the particular qualities of a type of battery and how it’s being used.“I don’t think you can really extrapolate their result to another application, even for that same battery,” he said. “Battery degradation is extremely dependent on the way (the battery) is used.”To fully understand how a different charging method might change between different batteries, and different applications, Dubarry said you need “more diverse training data.” And that training data is produced the old-fashioned way: with lots of time-intensive testing.But Dubarry also agrees that there are some big advantages to using AI.Related Articles

“The work they did is a really great starting point, they did a wonderful job,” he said. “No doubt their approach will lead to some major discoveries.”Chueh said he’s driven to increase the development of technologies, like batteries, that can help mitigate climate change. Using AI is a way to achieve that goal.“Many people are working on better batteries, so we have less expensive electric vehicles, and solar and wind electricity that’s available 24/7” he said. “I’m constantly asking myself … can we do it faster? Because time is limited.”

Predictions about the impact of artificial intelligence on employment oscillate between unlimited optimism and the fear of human redundancy. Which is true? A look at the past, peppered with some economics, provides more clarity. After all, this is not the first time technology is shaking up established working practices.
The website for the history of Switzerland’s PTT, the former post, telegraph and telephone monopoly, is most informative. It includes testimonials from former employees about special moments in their careers. The memories of the switchboard operators – a typically female profession at the time – are particularly insightful, revealing much about the arrival of new technology.
Although the technology had long progressed, female switchboard operators were employed for more than half a century in Switzerland. (ETH picture archive Commons)
Although Switzerland was at the forefront of the switch to direct dialing, the last manual telephone exchange (in Scuol in the canton of Grisons) only closed in 1959. Quite late, considering direct dialing had been available for more than 60 years. As early as 1892, the world’s first automatic telephone exchange started service in the US. By 1900, some phone companies had completely dispensed with manual exchanges.
The long career of the Swiss switchboard operator was not due primarily to technical tardiness. Practical reasons prompted the PTT, like many international counterparts, to delay the introduction of direct dialing. Among the reasons was quality of service. As PTT pensioners recount, it used to be commonplace to call the operator to connect with someone whose number you did not have. The operator also checked the quality of the line and, if the person called did not answer, would sometimes even take a message to pass on later (services performed today by Siri and other digital assistants).
So, if artificial intelligence should one day become truly intelligent, it is by no means certain the professions theoretically most at risk will actually disappear. Ultimately, rising female wages and rapidly growing demand for telephone services after World War II provided the decisive impulse for full automation. From then on, people had to learn how to dial a number themselves.

It is making mundane and dull office work more interesting and productive. AI also enables workers to focus on the most engaging jobs while making them more effective and efficient..Soon, even those who don't happen to work for technology companies (although as every company moves towards becoming a tech company, that will be increasingly few) will find AI-enabled machines increasingly present as they go about their day-to-day activities..From how people are recruited and on-boarded to how they go about on-the-job training, personal development and eventually passing on their skills and experience to those who follow in their footsteps, AI technology will play an increasingly prominent role..The technology in the workplace has eventually been better for higher-skilled workers than for the lower-skilled, said Mark Muro, an expert from Brookings Instiution. &quot;Artificial intelligence could play out just the opposite.&quot;.As noted by Livemint, while machines have long been able to perform repetitive physical tasks or complex mathematical calculations, AI enables computers to analyze data, predict outcomes, learn from experience by recognizing patterns and make decisions. Such tasks are currently done by professional workers, many with college degrees..Examples:.A financial adviser analyzes a client's economic circumstances, income prospects and personal goals to guide retirement planning. With AI, an algorithm could use the same information to make recommendations..The market research analyst analyzes consumer spending trends and patterns to recommend an advertising strategy for a new movie or automobile. With AI, a computer could do the same thing..Medical facilities have started using computers to read X-rays and determine whether images are consistent with a disease such as pneumonia, a task previously performed by radiologists..AI will replace the jobs?.&quot;AI will substitute for a set of tasks, but there's no reason it would have to be a total displacement,&quot; said Stanford University economist Michael Webb. &quot;The only thing you can say for sure is that the job will change.&quot;.Artificial intelligence may allow some workers to dispense with time-consuming tasks such as data analysis, and focus on potentially more profitable activities, such as meeting clients. Those workers could become more productive and command higher wages..Other workers could find their jobs simplified and more easily filled by someone with less education, which could drive down wages in the process. And in other cases, jobs could be replaced entirely by technology..To be sure, experts in the past have incorrectly predicted that other major shifts in the economy—including the mechanization of agriculture, automation of factories and outsourcing of labor to foreign countries—would cause mass unemployment. While these trends did eliminate many US jobs, many others were created over time. And the unemployment rate was near a 50-year low in January, at 3.6 percent..&quot;Expanded use of artificial intelligence is necessary given the labor shortage that is happening,&quot; said Irina Novoselsky, chief executive of job-search site CareerBuilder.com..The company is tapping AI to help fill some job openings. It uses technology to scan resumes and job descriptions, matching workers who might have the right skills for a job but not the specific experience. Such matching wasn't possible a few years ago, Ms. Novoselsky said..The company uses AI to read resumes and make sense of jargon the same way a human can, but without the pesky constraints of sleeping or eating..Top executives are likely less exposed to potential displacement by AI than lower-level professionals. A Brookings study found that exposure to artificial intelligence falls for the top 10% of earners..&quot;CEOs are largely exempt from this,&quot; Mr. Muro said. &quot;They're not the ones doing the number crunching and making the PowerPoints.&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Where are our self-driving cars?In the age of AI advances, self-driving cars turned out to be harder than people expected.by  Kelsey PiperFeb 28, 2020, 5:33 PM ESTFacebookLinkA Yandex driverless car undergoes testing in Moscow on July 15, 2019. |  Sergei Bobylev/TASS via Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.FacebookLinkWhen it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.In2020, you’ll be a “permanent backseat driver,” the Guardian predictedin 2015. “10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,” blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google’s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they’d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 — and then, when that failed, by 2020.But the year is here — and the self-driving cars aren’t.Despite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which — disclosure — my partner and I own)whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.But almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.What happened? Here arenine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn’t arrived.1) How exactly do self-driving cars work? Engineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the carreact if it’s about to steerinto one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.This simple description elidesa whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn’t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with othersto confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, presents a self-driving car at Wed Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on November 7, 2017. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis/Getty ImagesAnd even the simple parts of driving — like tracking the objects around a car on the road — are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google’s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo’s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light andsoundoff things.The car’s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they’re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed — that is,the car has to drawon millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It’s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data — but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.That’s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the “easy” things turn out to hide surprising complexity.2) Why is it takinglonger than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?Self-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances intranslation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that’s a trivial task.It’s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they’d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.But when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains becamevery apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.Much of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare — witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road — it’s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.Carmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They’ve driven more miles. They’ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.And they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber).If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below).But it’s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?Companies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world — and make their creators lots of money.Many consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips.It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can’t get a driver’s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor’s appointments.A self-driving car from General Motors’ Cruise division waits at an intersection in San Francisco on January 26, 2020. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won’t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.Others have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don’t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car — but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who’d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they’d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they’d never use one.Over time, our infrastructure will likely change to make iteasier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won’t have widespread self-driving cars until we’ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it wouldfollow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?Almost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.There are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That’s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.The other is disengagements — moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn’t handle a situation — per mile driven. Most companies don’t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California’s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.On both fronts, Google’s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors’ Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco’s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)Those two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that’s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.5) Didn’t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?March 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe,Arizona.The incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That’s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn’t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it’s simply far too soonto prove that they’re as safe as or safer than a human driver.An Uber self-driving car drives through traffic on Fifth Street in San Francisco on March 28, 2017. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesUber hasn’t driven nearly as many miles andhas had a fatal incident. The company doesn’t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven “millions” of miles. It’s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it’s fair to wonder ifUber’s driving record is much worse than a human’s.Furthermore, a review of Herzberg’s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors “were not in use at the time of the crash.”Additionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms — detecting dangerous situations when none existed — that it had been programmed with “a one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system]suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,” according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn’t brake — which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly — but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.The system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact — and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.Those are avoidable failures.Uber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. “We’ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB’s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,” Nat Beuse, Uber’s self-driving cars head of safety, told Voxin a statement in response to a request for comment. “As we look ahead to the future, we’ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.”Nonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening — and it’s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla’s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn’t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn’t. That won’t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it’s a potentially major one now.As I’ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment? Some advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they mightreduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don’t own a car and just call for onewhen they need one.In addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way — braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel — which a computer could avoid.But as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.There’s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There’s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent),but there’s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient — so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.One study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they’d treat having a car that could drive itself.The result? They went on a lot more car trips.It’s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn’t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it’s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.7) So if they’re not necessarily safer and they’re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?The above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there’s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easierfor older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. Theymight provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer — and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.In a sense, we’re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren’t yet an uncomplicated positive.Research and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold minefor the first company to get them on the road. They’ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they’ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.It’s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars? There is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.Self-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it — especially California and Arizona — and it’s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn’t a slam-dunk.When self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn’t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive — for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn’t have been on the road at all.Policy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or badfor the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of usingself-driving cars — and the money can bespent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn’t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that’s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?In some senses, we’ve been “close” on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, whichit’s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it’ll be available for sale. Tesla’s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.There are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might “never happen.”A Tesla Model 3, which is fitted with a a partial self-driving system, on display at the Brussels Expo in Brussels, Belgium, on January 9, 2020. Sjoerd van der Wal/Getty ImagesThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that’s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast abouttheir progress butdon’t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it’s become obvious that the deadline can’t be met.At the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there’s any chance they aren’t ready.

It has been heralded by experts as a major breakthrough in the fight against the growing problem of drug resistance. A powerful algorithm was used to analyse more than one hundred million chemical compounds in a matter of days. The newly discovered compound was able to kill 35 types of potentially deadly bacteria, said researchers. Antibiotic-resistant infections have risen in recent years - up 9% in England between 2017 and 2018, to nearly 61,000.If antibiotics are taken inappropriately, harmful bacteria living inside the body can become resistant to them, which means the medicines may not work when really needed.Artificial intelligence apps, Parkinson's and meNHS to set up national artificial intelligence labThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called the phenomenon ""one of the biggest threats to global health security and development today"".'A new age'""In terms of antibiotic discovery, this is absolutely a first,"" said Regina Barzilay, a senior researcher on the project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The discovery was made using an algorithm inspired by the architecture of the human brain. Scientists trained it to analyse the structure of 2,500 drugs and other compounds to find those with the most anti-bacterial qualities that could kill E. coli. They then selected around 100 candidates for physical testing before discovering halicin. ""I think this is one of the more powerful antibiotics that has been discovered to date,"" said James Collins, a bioengineer on the team at MIT. ""We wanted to develop a platform that would allow us to harness the power of artificial intelligence to usher in a new age of antibiotic drug discovery.""Dr Peter Bannister, chairman of the Institution of Engineering and Technology healthcare panel, said the method used was already ""well established"" within medical research. ""The same approach has gained popularity in the development of new therapeutics, such as pharmaceuticals and, in the case of this research, antibiotics where pattern recognition including deep learning can help sort through the vast numbers of molecules,"" he told the BBC. ""This paper goes beyond theoretical simulation and presents pre-clinical results, which are essential along with subsequent clinical trials to clearly demonstrate the efficacy and safety of these new 'AI discovered' drugs.""Since 2014, the UK has cut the number of antibiotics it uses by more than 7%, but the number of drug-resistant bloodstream infections increased by 35% from 2013 to 2017.Researchers added that the use of the machine to accelerate drug discovery could help bring down the cost of generating more antibiotics in future.

Artificial intelligence makes a splash in efforts to protect Alaska’s ice seals and beluga whales

When Erin Moreland set out to become a research zoologist, she envisioned days spent sitting on cliffs, drawing seals and other animals to record their lives for efforts to understand their activities and protect their habitats.
Instead, Moreland found herself stuck in front of a computer screen, clicking through thousands of aerial photographs of sea ice as she scanned for signs of life in Alaskan waters. It took her team so long to sort through each survey — akin to looking for lone grains of rice on vast mounds of sand — that the information was outdated by the time it was published.
“There’s got to be a better way to do this,” she recalls thinking. “Scientists should be freed up to contribute more to the study of animals and better understand what challenges they might be facing. Having to do something this time-consuming holds them back from what they could be accomplishing.”

That better way is now here — an idea that began, unusually enough, with the view from Moreland’s Seattle office window and her fortuitous summons to jury duty. She and her fellow National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists now will use artificial intelligence this spring to help monitor endangered beluga whales, threatened ice seals, polar bears and more, shaving years off the time it takes to get data into the right hands to protect the animals.
The teams are training AI tools to distinguish a seal from a rock and a whale’s whistle from a dredging machine’s squeak as they seek to understand the marine mammals’ behavior and help them survive amid melting ice and increasing human activity.
Moreland’s project combines AI technology with improved cameras on a NOAA turboprop airplane that will fly over the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska this April and May, scanning and classifying the imagery to produce a population count of ice seals and polar bears that will be ready in hours instead of months. Her colleague Manuel Castellote, a NOAA affiliate scientist, will apply a similar algorithm to the recordings he’ll pick up from equipment scattered across the bottom of Alaska’s Cook Inlet, helping him quickly decipher how the shrinking population of endangered belugas spent its winter.
The data will be confirmed by scientists, analyzed by statisticians and then reported to people such as Jon Kurland, NOAA’s assistant regional administrator for protected resources in Alaska.

Then they bring it onboard to download the data before guiding the equipment back down to the ocean floor, where it will listen for another six months.

Kurland’s office in Juneau is charged with overseeing conservation and recovery programs for marine mammals around the state and its waters and helping guide all the federal agencies that issue permits or carry out actions that could affect those that are threatened or endangered.
Of the four types of ice seals in the Bering Sea — bearded, ringed, spotted and ribbon — the first two are classified as threatened, meaning they are likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future. The Cook Inlet beluga whales are already endangered, having steadily declined to a population of only 279 in last year’s survey, from an estimate of about a thousand 30 years ago.
Individual groups of beluga whales are isolated and don’t breed with others or leave their home, “so if this population goes extinct, no one else will come in; they’re gone forever,” says Castellote. “Other belugas wouldn’t survive there because they don’t know the environment. So you’d lose that biodiversity forever.”
Yet recommendations by Kurland’s office to help mitigate the impact of human activities such as construction and transportation, in part by avoiding prime breeding and feeding periods and places, are hampered by a lack of timely data.
“There’s basic information that we just don’t have now, so getting it will give us a much clearer picture of the types of responses that may be needed to protect these populations,” Kurland says. “In both cases, for the whales and seals, this kind of data analysis is cutting-edge science, filling in gaps we don’t have another way to fill.”

The AI project was born years ago, when Moreland would sit at her computer in NOAA’s Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle and look across Lake Washington toward Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. She felt sure there was a technological solution to her frustration, but she didn’t know anyone with the right skills to figure it out. 
She hit the jackpot one week while serving on a jury in 2018. She overheard two fellow jurors discussing AI during a break in the trial, so she began talking with them about her work. One of them connected her with Dan Morris from Microsoft’s AI for Earth program, who suggested they pitch the problem as a challenge that summer at the company’s Hackathon, a week-long competition when software developers, programmers, engineers and others collaborate on projects. Fourteen Microsoft engineers signed up to work on the problem.
“Across the wildlife conservation universe, there are tons of scientists doing boring things, reviewing images and audio,” Morris says. “Remote equipment lets us collect all kinds of data, but scientists have to figure out how to use that data. Spending a year annotating images is not only a bad use of their time, but the questions get answered way later than they should.”
Moreland’s idea wasn’t as simple as it may sound, though. While there are plenty of models to recognize people in images, there were none — until now — that could find seals, especially real-time in aerial photography. But the hundreds of thousands of examples NOAA scientists had classified in previous surveys helped technologists, who are using them to train the AI models to recognize which photographs and recordings contained mammals and which didn’t.
“Part of the challenge was that there were 20 terabytes of data of pictures of ice, and working on your laptop with that much data isn’t practical,” says Morris. “We had daily handovers of hard drives between Seattle and Redmond to get this done. But the cloud makes it possible to work with all that data and train AI models, so that’s how we’re able to do this work, with Azure.”
Can you spot the seals in this aerial photograph (left)? Look at the thermal image (right), and then back at the photo — can you even see them now? This is what AI will help NOAA scientists sort through. (Photo provided by NOAA, from a survey of Alaska’s Kotzebue Sound, where the ice had melted, forcing the seals closer together than normal.)
Moreland’s first ice seal survey was in 2007, flying in a helicopter based on an icebreaker. Scientists collected 90,000 images and spent months scanning them but only found 200 seals. It was a tedious, imprecise process.
Ice seals live largely solitary lives, making them harder to spot than animals that live in groups. Surveys are also complicated because the aircraft have to fly high enough to keep seals from getting scared and diving, but low enough to get high-resolution photos that enable scientists to differentiate a ring seal from a spotted seal, for example. The weather in Alaska — often rainy and cloudy — further complicates efforts.
Subsequent surveys improved by pairing thermal and color cameras and using modified planes that had a greater range to study more area and could fly higher up to be quieter. Even so, thermal interference from dirty ice and reflections off jumbled ice made it difficult to determine what was an animal and what wasn’t.
And then there was the problem of manpower to go along with all the new data. The 2016 survey produced a million pairs of thermal and color images, which a previous software system narrowed down to 316,000 hot spots that the scientists had to manually sort through and classify. It took three people six months.

When Moreland told colleagues about the AI project, she discovered that Castellote faced a similar obstacle.
Castellote and his team spend months every year classifying logs of the sound files they’ve collected to determine whether a noise is perhaps ice shifting, a ship passing, an airplane overhead, or a whale calling — and if the latter, if it’s a beluga, humpback or killer whale. (Photo by Daniela Huson with Ocean Conservation Research)
Each spring and fall, Castellote flies from Seattle to Anchorage, takes a boat out, retrieves microphones from 15 spots around the bottom of Cook Inlet, downloads the data and puts the equipment back. He and his team spend the rest of the year trying to classify each sound from the previous six months, determining which whistles and calls are from beluga, humpback or killer whales, which roars are from a plane or a ship, and which thumps are from construction or cracking ice. 
That doesn’t leave him with much time for analysis, such as trying to interpret how the whales are communicating.
Whales operate on sound, using echo location to get around, especially in Cook Inlet, where sediment from melting glaciers makes the water murky and where it’s too dark most of the year for eyes to be useful. That means noise — which is amplified under water — can disorient the mammals, leaving them unable to find the ocean floor or surface, follow their pod, catch prey or be alerted to the presence of a predator such as a killer whale.
If calves can’t hear their mothers’ clicks and whistles, for example, they can get separated and die.
“Human noise could be masking key signals the whales use to find food and each other, which could affect reproduction, and if you can’t eat, mate or reproduce, then you can’t increase the population,” says Castellote. “So we think noise is a big issue, and we’re focusing on that.”
The problem is that Anchorage is an important hub for cargo ships and for military and commercial flights. The port is expanding, which requires piles to be driven down for new docks. There are 17 oil rigs with accompanying pipelines in Cook Inlet, he says, and the deposits from glaciers require continual dredging to keep shipping channels open. Each of those activities creates noise that drowns out the whales’ whistles and calls. So Castellote aims to give Kurland’s group data on how the whales’ habitat use overlaps with human noise, helping guide mitigation measures to make human activity less detrimental to the endangered animals. The agency might work to minimize vessel activity near prime feeding areas or to reduce construction noise in certain spots during breeding season, for example.
Working with Microsoft, Castellote had a robust set of algorithms by last fall that showed a 99 percent match to the logs his team had previously classified manually. And the group is developing new technology that will make the process even more efficient.
As climate change allows human activity to move further north, Castellote’s work will help guide protective measures for other populations of whales that could be introduced to the same types of noise in the next decade or two, he says.
“The Cook Inlet belugas are a very small population that’s concentrated near the biggest human population in Alaska, so that development-related activity can be a threat,” Kurland says. “The seals are more broadly distributed over a larger area with less human activity, and are mainly threatened by climate change,” which is harder to mitigate.

The seals being surveyed rely on ice floes to breed, nurse their pups and go through their annual molt, a process that replaces their coats each spring. Ribbon seals rarely ever go ashore — when the ice melts each summer, they just swim around in the Arctic Ocean until the floes form again in the fall. So there’s nowhere that global warming is having a more pronounced impact than the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, Morris says.
Studying the population data and distribution of the seals over time will provide a first step in understanding how they’re coping with a changing environment and what they need, Moreland says.

“We’re living in a changing time, and we need all the players we can get to protect our resources,” says Tom Gray, a tribal representative who hunts Eastern Bering Sea belugas with nets and has used his knowledge to help Castellote’s team catch the endangered Cook Inlet whales briefly to attach sensors with suction cups.
When Gray was growing up in Nome, Alaska, “there were no ships going past us toward the Northwest Passage. Now there are hundreds a year and it’s projected that before long there will be a thousand,” he says.
“Alaska has beluga whales, moose, caribou, all these unique animals, and it’s like a mystique, something we talk about and love, and we’re right in the middle of it,” he says.
But amid the increased development and the whales’ persistent struggles, and despite scientists’ efforts over the past few decades, “I don’t think our people have the tools to keep these populations healthy. We’re losing the battle, and once they’re gone, it’s over. We need scientists and innovators to protect these animals so we don’t lose them.”

Creating an AI-Savvy Workforce for a Strong Future

Artificial Intelligence


To strengthen America's up-and-coming workforce and future economy, MITRE is working to integrate lessons on artificial intelligence (AI) into college courses across a broad range of fields—from the sciences to the arts.









""China and other countries are investing heavily in developing artificial intelligence [AI] expertise,"" says MITRE's Michael Balazs. ""The United States has to do likewise to stay competitive in the international arena.""
To keep the nation competitive in this increasingly influential arena, MITRE's working to create an AI-savvy workforce—starting at the college level—through an initiative known as Generation AI Nexus(link is external) (Gen AI). Our Gen AI instructional design team works with professors to integrate lessons on AI into their courses.
The Gen AI team recently worked with professors at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, to introduce AI-inspired lessons in two very different disciplines—healthcare and fashion merchandising.
Balazs leads the Gen AI initiative. The idea, he says, is to expose every student—regardless of their field of study—to AI multiple times in their academic journey. ""We're not only trying to create a talent pool around AI, we're also working to ensure that everyone in the workforce has an awareness of AI and how it might be applied in their field.""
Computer systems now perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. They permeate our daily existence. Companies use AI to track and predict our preferences and then create targeted advertising. Apple's Siri uses machine learning (a subset of AI) to improve the software's ability to respond to our questions. And driver-assistance systems like automatic braking are showing up in newer-model cars.
""The premise is that if we really want to shift the entire economy—not just an industry—we need to educate everyone who's going to be part of that economy,"" Balazs says.
Given a McKinsey & Company prediction that there will be a shortfall of up to 250,000 data scientists in the United States in a decade, the need for these scientists is clear.
Getting a Look at AI's Analytical Powers
MITRE launched Gen AI in May 2018. Since then, we've partnered with colleges and universities nationwide to incorporate AI lessons(link is external) into their courses. We then make those lessons available to other schools wishing to use them.
Our partnership with Marymount University demonstrates how we work with professors to create lessons that meet their objectives. 
Uma Kelekar, professor of healthcare management, wanted a lesson that would help nursing and business students learn how AI could be used to test hypotheses and evaluate relationships between different data factors. Kelekar chose to focus on patient visits to the Emergency Department (ED) and the factors that may lead to the prescription of opioids.
Since pain is one of the major conditions ED patients exhibit, researchers have begun exploring how the prescription of pain-relieving drugs to these patients may be contributing to the nation's opioid epidemic, an issue MITRE is also researching and working to address.
The lesson-planning process was a collaborative effort among Kelekar and Gen AI team members Joe Garner(link is external), an instructional designer, and Ali Zaidi(link is external), a data scientist.
""We work together to decide what the students need to learn, how it will be taught, and how learning will be measured,"" Garner explains. ""It's known as 'backward design,' because you design instruction with the end in mind. Once we identify the desired outcome, we decide where the lesson best fits into the curriculum, help the instructor engage students, and determine if the learning occurred.""
Among the hypotheses Kelekar wanted to test: Did prescription patterns vary with the level of pain the patient reported? Did they vary by gender? Were private-pay patients more likely to receive medication prescriptions than publicly funded ones?
Zaidi ran analyses to test those hypotheses and created graphic depictions of the results.
""The visualizations were very helpful,"" Kelekar says. ""They made it easier for the students to see relationships among the variables—such as how opioid prescription correlated with reported pain levels, gender, ethnicity, or the number of chronic conditions the patient is dealing with.""
Applying AI to Fashion Merchandising Strategies
Across campus, fashion merchandising professor Jennifer Yang and data science professor Nathan Green combined their expertise to incorporate lessons on AI into Yang's fashion research and forecasting course.
Yang needed lessons that would help her students understand that fashion merchandising is not merely a subjective exercise. ""I wanted them to see that there's a data-driven way to conduct product research, and that AI can be very helpful in informing any decisions or recommendations they might make. They may never have to actually crunch the numbers, but they do have to be able to interpret them.""
She and Green explored factors that may correlate to higher sales or ratings of women's shoes. Using his own data science expertise, Green captured and organized data on 500 shoes from a popular online merchandiser's site. Zaidi then prepared the data for analysis, programmed machine-learning models to perform that analysis, and created visualizations of the model's outputs for the students to use.
""We basically said, 'These are the outputs of the data analysis. What conclusions would you draw from this information?'"" Green adds. ""By engaging in that process, I think the students developed basic data analysis skills.""
""I love this project because it demonstrates the value of AI for students who are in non-data science disciplines,"" Zaidi says. ""If they can become familiar with how AI works now, they'll be much better equipped to do their jobs—and more competitive in their field.""
""I think everyone wants to do cross-discipline work, but getting it started can be difficult,"" Green says.  ""MITRE's curriculum development expertise helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical fields.""
Spreading the Learning Through Gen AI
As an organization that works in the public interest, one of our goals is to make the Gen AI lessons broadly available.
""We're compiling the lesson plans, the code, the data sets, the visualizations, the machine-learning models we developed—everything—so that professors from participating schools wishing to use or adapt the lessons will have what they need to teach them in their own classrooms,"" Zaidi explains.
""As Gen AI spreads and grows in the coming years, we're hoping these lessons will become a resource for students and teachers across the country. MITRE is committed to expanding awareness about the need to up the United States' game in the AI arena. That can only make our nation more competitive globally.""

Data Snapshot: Men Far More Confident About Benefits of Artificial Intelligence Than Women
















Artificial Intelligence has crept from the pages of mid-century sci-fi stories into the very mainstream of American culture – especially in the workplace. For decades now, workers have speculated about how (and when) AI will affect their own job futures: Will automation replace the need for humans, or will the AI be used in ways that will actually aid humans in their jobs, increasing efficiency all around? We asked employees, “Do you think the benefits of Artificial Intelligence will outweigh the potential risks?”
The info comes from the latest reading of an ongoing study by Comparably. Over 1,000 employees responded to the question.
Men are considerably more confident that the benefits of AI will outweigh any potential risks than women are. The gulf between genders on this question, at 16%, is notable. Speculation here would be largely reckless, but it may be that men are generally more encouraged towards futurist notions than women in our society. Men, in charge of much of the nation’s industry, may be more interested in researching the eventual positive benefits of AI on their processes.

Among ethnicities, Asian/Pacific Islanders are the most assured that AI will bring about good things for society. That segment was nearly as positive as overall male scores above. Caucasians, Hispanic/Latinos, and respondents from the “other” designation were generally more positive than overall women – but African-Americans, who may feel disenfranchised in a overall fashion similar to females – are less convinced.


Workers in Engineering are the most optimistic about AI’s effects on their jobs and the future. This makes some sense, as employees in that department may have some level of hands-on experience with AI. IT also voted with confidence for AI. On the other end, workers in the Legal department were much less sure about AI’s benefits than nearly any other group queried. Other departments that depend on human interaction, like Sales and Customer Support, also seemed unsure about what benefits the technology would bring. They may also fear AI encroaching on their jobs.

There isn’t much notable variety among different age groups in terms of responses to this question about Artificial Intelligence. There is a notable spike in positivity about AI for the 46-50 age group – that segment may have been coming of age in the workplace just as AI was becoming a reality.

With education, fears about AI decrease. Those with Master’s Degrees are far more confident that AI will benefit society than those with just a high school degree. Again, this may amount to those holding more advanced degrees having a more assured sense that their jobs are not eventually going to be threatened by automation.
While men overall are more secure about the future of AI than women, in certain departments the opposite is true. In Business Development and Communications, women are more positive about AI’s influence.

Published: Feb 23, 2020 04:34 AM ESTTrevor English4 years ago0ShareJurvetson/FlickrAs engineers, we face a time of rapid technological advancement of the tools available to us. While we spend our days innovating our designs, our tools are being innovated beyond what we ever imagined. With the drive for practical artificial intelligence embedded in our workflows, how we work may look quite different even just a few years from now.
While many professionals are wary of AI as it may steal their job, a report from the University of Oxford places Engineering and Science professions as the least threatened industries by AI. In fact, most studies point to engineers experiencing great benefits from the rise of AI tools. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

AI and machine learning will replace jobs that we know about today, but because it brings new capabilities, it will open up new industries and new jobs that aren’t even on the modern engineer’s radar. Low value and meaningless jobs currently in place will get automated away. It will allow you to spend more time on better decisions.
RELATED: 13 FREE SITES TO GET AN INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING
No matter whether you have adopted machine learning technologies and in the grander picture, artificial intelligence, most engineers recognize that a change is coming. It would seem a natural fit to incorporate artificial intelligence into CAD, into our workflows, into our engineering. This not only facilitates our forward growth as engineers, but it gives us the ability to design with complexities never before possible.
Remaining at the top of our engineering game is no easy task when the game is constantly innovating with new technologies. To remain relevant as engineers, we must understand – even predict – how machine learning and AI will change the game and adapt before we are left in the dust.
The rise of advanced engineering
AI is the next platform. The world’s top minds affirm it. Engineering innovation directs it. Now it’s the time to get on board. All of this can be scary to face as an engineer. How we engineer has shifted over the years as CAD evolved from 2D into 3D and now into a 3D design hub. In essence, CAD has shifted from a supplementary tool to engineers into now a fundamental tool of how we work. If we examine the trend of AI close enough, we can begin to see how the solidification of CAD into our daily workflow isn’t too different from what might happen with AI implementation.
Much like additive manufacturing in the past, AI implementation has been surrounded by a decent amount of hype. As engineers, we’re naturally skeptical when one innovation or technology is broadcasted as the “cure-all” to the future. Even with the hype around AI in the past, current trends place practical AI and machine learning tools right in the laps of engineers and technology leaders.

Generative design, simulation improvements, sensors, and big data design optimization – all of these areas of engineering are at the forefront of being significantly impacted by AI technologies. All of these advanced engineering technologies have the ability to impact us as engineers and our profession as a whole in 3 main ways.
Job Evolution – Every innovation in the past has created a new sector of work and research. Our modern model of technological and often, digital innovation has AI at the leading edge. This means that as engineers, the way we do our jobs and even the areas we work in may shift as the needs of the industry adapt to coming tools. Our workflows will evolve in a micro-perspective as artificial intelligence infiltrates how we design. In the macro-perspective, new industries will be created that existing engineers will need to flow into.
Capability Improvement – AI and machine learning tools bring drastic capabilities to the engineer relative to what we are capable of on our own. Through organic latticing tools, we have weight-saving capabilities like never before possible. With generative design, we can explore design options that never would have been an option. As these tools slowly are implemented into our CAD tools and engineering system, our capabilities as engineers will only be expanded.
Design and Data Management – Perhaps the most impactful aspect of AI innovation in engineering is just how it will affect our workflow management. AI extends far beyond the design process and stretches into data management. In the bigger picture, we arrive at the Internet of Things. AI will surely help us manage our designs and improve interoperability, but it will also break down barriers between departments – between tasks. 
Through AI programs managing big data, we will be able to seamlessly integrate manufacturing and design with cloud computing, smart machines, and real-time monitoring. AI can and will take on much of the supervisory side of engineering, allowing us to perform our jobs better. We can understand this idea as a whole by realizing that low-value tasks of today will now be automated, allowing us as engineers to focus our energy into higher-value areas.
Artificial intelligence will help us manage our engineering data efficiently, effectively ushering in Industry 4.0. It solves the problem of big data and makes other engineering advancements more manageable. Advanced engineering, the future of making things, in large part hinges on the implementation of AI into engineering. 
How do we adapt?
All of this advancement sounds great in the grand scheme of things, but adapting to these changing workflows is easier said than done. The beginning of the adaption and adoption process for these new technologies begins with refining how each directly impacts our lives and jobs as engineers.
Machine learning is a big player in engineering innovation right now, simply because it presents the greatest opportunity for further innovation. Machine learning surely brings job evolution. If computers and systems have the ability to learn over time, then they can optimize and conduct many tasks that we execute on a daily basis. Machine learning inherently improves our capabilities as it leverages computer learning on our own.
RELATED: MACHINE LEARNING HELPS OUT CITIZEN SCIENTISTS
Lastly, machine learning greatly impacts how we manage designs and product creation. Our entire workflow from job definition to job application can be or is already being impacted by machine learning tools. To adapt, we must embrace the changes that are already here and predict the changes that will come. For machine learning specifically, we can start getting comfortable with altering our workflows alongside computers. By doing so, we place ourselves far ahead of our competition. 
Industry 4.0 and the rise of connectivity is another poignant AI trend that is making strides in the engineering profession. It evolves our jobs by eliminating the need for constant oversight during production and creates new industries for data application. The Internet of Things improves our capability to collect and manage data through a web of AI tools and physical sensors. 
These new tools that allow us to gather data result in a significant increase in the knowledge available to us. AI and Industry 4.0 as a whole seek to help manage and apply these new tools. All of this data collection and smart management done automatically through computers finally makes the management of our designs and production thereafter, an effortless task. 
Adapting to the next generation of the industry will surely be hard for nearly every engineering profession, but the steps we can take today are clear. Embracing the cloud in engineering presents the most consequential impact. By trusting big data and cloud management of our engineering, we can become experts in the core technologies Industry 4.0 builds on.
Generative design is the last significant innovation in current AI that impacts engineers. In many senses, we have already had first-hand glimpses of this technology in our simulation and CAD tools. It evolves how we perform our jobs by allowing us to simulate and design better, which twofold improves our capabilities. 
The influence of generative design on our design management is seen in how we will begin the design process and handle the design revision process. Of all the technologies we’ve discussed, Generative design tools are perhaps the most real to you and me as engineers. To prepare for the further growth of this capability, we must accept and experiment with the tools already out there. In doing so, we become more prepared than the significant portion of engineers who haven’t used generative design before.

Adopting and adapting to innovations in artificial intelligence within engineering positions you to perform at the top of your game. Innovation will continue whether we are on board or not, and now is the time to board the train early.RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

But registrations for the gathering this week topped 1,100, and now there's now a waiting list. The city's largest employers, including UPS, Humana, GE Appliances and Norton Healthcare, are sending information technology directors, software developers, data scientists and analysts to the fifth annual summit. Several college and K-12 educators, as well as workforce and nonprofit leaders from Louisville, Lexington and Southern Indiana, have reserved spots, said Sarah Ehresman, the agency's director of labor market intelligence.Related:Free Code Louisville classes get reboot after program scores new fundingThere's no question why AI and automation are huge now, said Aaron Peabody, lead data scientist at Untitled Firm, a Louisville startup. ""The implications of this technology are massive because it will eventually be the technology, and it is not going away,"" Peabody said. With co-workers, he will demonstrate the firm's work at a tech showcase during the event at the downtown Kentucky International Convention Center.Local experts delving into AI say the technology is evolving quickly, but most of it involves crunching huge chunks of data — for instance, health care metrics on fragile patients who are released from hospitals.It's used to make predictions about problems a patient will encounter and to help doctors and providers identify more proactive ways to get an ill person back to better health.At Norton Healthcare, AI is used to help detect patients at risk for developing potentially deadly sepsis infections and for evaluating patients at higher risk for opioid addiction, among other uses, according to Dr. Steven T. Hester, system chief medical officer.""A lot of what gets lumped under AI is not AI,"" said Ben Reno-Weber, director of the local Microsoft Future of Work Initiative. Many companies do advanced data analytics, he said, but the next step, programming a machine to ""think"" in new and novel ways to complete tasks, is the holy grail in AI.ICYMI:Beshear signs bill requiring school resource officers to carry gunsAt the summit, two keynote addresses will feature Microsoft's Jacky Wright, chief digital officer and corporate vice president; and IBM's Jonathan Arneault, North America software as a service director, with University of Louisville President Neeli Bendapudi.Several panel discussions will focus on the kinds of workplaces and jobs likely to be most impacted by AI, how to use AI to solve business challenges and how AI and other technologies will reshape work in the future.  Reno-Weber said Louisville is building a robust data community, with more professionals handling predictive analytics. U of L, for instance, will soon have 68 graduates in its Master of Business Administration in business analytics.Other colleges, he added, are considering adding undergraduate degrees in the field.The interest this year from educators has increased significantly because they're searching for ""how to build a workforce whose skills are aligned with industry,"" Reno-Weber said.For details on the conference, see eventbrite.com/e/tomorrows-talent-ai-the-future-of-work-tickets-76803522403.See also:Louisville's historic Seelbach Hotel plans 11-story tower, big redoGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

We’re focusing on Generation Z, which is facing challenges from changing curriculums and new technology to financial aid gaps and homelessness.MANCHESTER, N.H. — Cruising to class in her driverless car, a student crams from notes projected on the inside of the windshield while she gestures with her hands to shape a 3-D holographic model of her architecture project.It looks like science fiction, an impression reinforced by the fact that it is being demonstrated in virtual reality in an ultramodern space with overstuffed pillows for seats. But this scenario is based on technology already in development.The setting is the Sandbox ColLABorative, the innovation arm of Southern New Hampshire University, on the fifth floor of a downtown building with panoramic views of the sprawling red brick mills that date from this city’s 19th-century industrial heyday.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is one of a small but growing number of places where experts are testing new ideas that will shape the future of a college education, using everything from blockchain networks to computer simulations to artificial intelligence, or A.I.Theirs is not a future of falling enrollment, financial challenges and closing campuses. It’s a brighter world in which students subscribe to rather than enroll in college, learn languages in virtual reality foreign streetscapes with avatars for conversation partners, have their questions answered day or night by A.I. teaching assistants and control their own digital transcripts that record every life achievement.The possibilities for advances such as these are vast. The structure of higher education as it is still largely practiced in America is as old as those Manchester mills, based on a calendar that dates from a time when students had to go home to help with the harvest, and divided into academic disciplines on physical campuses for 18- to 24-year-olds.ImageA meeting in the kitchen area of the Sandbox CoLABorative at Southern New Hampshire University, “One of the most important things we do here is disprove and dismantle ideas,” said William Zemp, the university’s chief strategy and innovation officer.Credit...SNHUUniversities may be at the cutting edge of research into almost every other field, said Gordon Jones, founding dean of the Boise State University College of Innovation and Design. But when it comes to reconsidering the structure of their own, he said, “they’ve been very risk-averse.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNow, however, squeezed by the demands of employers and students — especially the up and coming Generation Z — and the need to attract new customers, some schools, such as Boise State and Southern New Hampshire University, are starting labs to come up with improvements to help people learn more effectively, match their skills with jobs and lower their costs.More than 200 have added senior executives whose titles include the words “digital” or “innovation,” the consulting firm Entangled Solutions found; many were recruited from the corporate and tech sectors. M.I.T. has set up a multimillion-dollar fund to pay for faculty to experiment with teaching innovations.Some colleges and universities are collaborating on such ideas in groups including the University Innovation Alliance and the Marvel Universe-worthy HAIL Storm — it stands for Harvesting Academic Innovation for Learners — a coalition of academic innovation labs.If history is a guide, the flashiest notions being developed in workshops in these places won’t get far. University campuses are like archaeological digs of innovations that didn’t fulfill their promises. Even though the biggest leap forward of the last few decades, for example — delivering courses online — appears to have lowered costs, the graduation rates of online higher education remain much lower than those of programs taught in person.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“One of the most important things we do here is disprove and dismantle ideas,” said William Zemp, chief strategy and innovation officer at Southern New Hampshire University.“There’s so much white noise out there, you have to be sort of a myth buster.”But some ambitious concepts are already being tested.College by SubscriptionOne of these would transform the way students pay for higher education. Instead of enrolling, for example, they might subscribe to college; for a monthly fee, they could take whatever courses they want, when they want, with long-term access to advising and career help.The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the places mulling a subscription model, said Richard DeMillo, director of its Center for 21st Century Universities. It would include access to a worldwide network of mentors and advisers and “whatever someone needs to do to improve their professional situation or acquire a new skill or get feedback on how things are going.”Boise State is already piloting this concept. Its Passport to Education costs $425 a month for six credit hours or $525 for nine in either of two online bachelor’s degree programs. That’s 30 percent cheaper than the in-state, in-person tuition.Paying by the month encourages students to move faster through their educations, and most are projected to graduate in 18 months, Mr. Jones said. The subscription model has attracted 47 students so far, he said, with another 94 in the application process.However they pay for it, future students could find other drastic changes in the way their educations are delivered.ImageDakota Kimble, a student in Boise State University's Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology program, demonstrating a virtual reality tool developed for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to teach hunters how to field-dress big game.Credit...Alex Hecht for The New York TimesYour Teacher Is a RobotGeorgia Tech has been experimenting with a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson, built on the Jeopardy-winning IBM Watson supercomputer platform. This A.I. answers questions in a discussion forum alongside human teaching assistants; students often can’t distinguish among them, their professor says. More Jill Watsons could help students get over hurdles they encounter in large or online courses. The university is working next on developing virtual tutors, which it says could be viable in two to five years.S.N.H.U., in a collaboration with the education company Pearson, is testing A.I. grading. Barnes & Noble Education already has an A.I. writing tool called bartleby write, named for the clerk in the Herman Melville short story, that corrects grammar, punctuation and spelling, searches for plagiarism and helps create citations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Arizona State University, A.I. is being used to watch for signs that A.S.U. Online students might be struggling, and to alert their academic advisers.“If we could catch early signals, we could go to them much earlier and say, ‘Hey you’re still in the window’ ” to pass, said Donna Kidwell, chief technology officer of the university’s digital teaching and learning lab, EdPlus.Another harbinger of things to come sits on a hillside near the Hudson River in upstate New York, where an immersion lab with 15-foot walls and a 360-degree projection system transports Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute language students to China, virtually.The students learn Mandarin Chinese by conversing with A.I. avatars that can recognize not only what they say but their gestures and expressions, all against a computer-generated backdrop of Chinese street markets, restaurants and other scenes.Julian Wong, a mechanical engineering major in the first group of students to go through the program, “thought it would be cheesy.” In fact, he said, “It’s definitely more engaging, because you’re actively involved with what’s going on.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStudents in the immersion lab mastered Mandarin about twice as fast as their counterparts in conventional classrooms, said Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer.Dr. Jackson, a physicist, was not surprised. The students enrolling in college now “grew up in a digital environment,” she said. “Why not use that to actually engage them?”Slightly less sophisticated simulations are being used in schools of education, where trainee teachers practice coping with simulated schoolchildren. Engineering students at the University of Michigan use an augmented-reality track to test autonomous vehicles in simulated traffic.A Transcript for LifeThe way these kinds of learning get documented is also about to change. A race is underway to create a lifelong transcript.Most academic transcripts omit work or military histories, internships, apprenticeships and other relevant experience. And course names such as Biology 301 or Business 102 reveal little about what students have actually learned.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The learner, the learning provider and the employer all are speaking different languages that don’t interconnect,” said Michelle Weise, chief innovation officer at the Strada Institute for the Future of Work.A proposed solution: the “interoperable learning record,” or I.L.R. (proof that, even in the future, higher education will be rife with acronyms and jargon).The I.L.R. would list the specific skills that people have learned — customer service, say, or project management — as opposed to which courses they passed and majors they declared. And it would include other life experiences they accumulated.This “digital trail” would remain in the learner’s control to share with prospective employers and make it easier for a student to transfer academic credits earned at one institution to another.American universities, colleges and work force training programs are now awarding at least 738,428 unique credentials, according to a September analysis by a nonprofit organization called Credential Engine, which has taken on the task of translating these into a standardized registry of skills.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTUnlike transcripts, I.L.R.s could work in two directions. Not only could prospective employees use them to look for jobs requiring the skills they have; employers could comb through them to find prospective hires with the skills they need. “We’re trying to live inside this whole preindustrial design and figure out how we interface with technology to take it further,” said Dr. Kidwell of Arizona State. “Everybody is wrangling with trying to figure out which of these experiments are really going to work.”This story was produced in collaboration with The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 23, 2020, Section L, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Glimpses Into Education’s Future.

Dr. Arisa Ema is a Project Assistant Professor at the University of Tokyo and a Visiting Researcher at RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project in Japan. She is an academic in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) ethics and governance. She leads and participates in various initiatives in Japan and abroad, working to ensure responsible use of AI that is inclusive and beneficial for all. Dr. Ema will visit APF Canada on February 28, 2020 to talk about her work. She posts regular updates on her blog. 
Q1. Could you tell us a bit about yourself?
As an academic, my area is Science and Technology Studies (STS), with an interest in how we can organize an inclusive and diverse community through technology, which has naturally led to my academic and public engagement with the topic of artificial intelligence (AI).

Besides my academic work, I am involved in various AI ethics and policy initiatives. I am a board member of the Japan Deep Learning Association (JDLA), chairing the JDLA Public Affairs Committee, and also a member of the Ethics Committee of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI), which released the JSAI Ethical Guidelines in 2017. The ethics committee was established after JSAI’s journal cover design evoked controversy on gender issues in 2014. Prompted by this incident, my colleagues and I established an interdisciplinary group called Acceptable Intelligence with Responsibility (AIR) to discuss emerging issues on AI and society. As an international group, AIR wrote a technology assessment report for the National Diet (Japan’s Parliament) Library, providing research on AI for legislative affairs. Currently, I’m organizing a medical AI seminar with my colleagues and promoting international collaborations on AI governance and ethics. And there are many other initiatives in which I am participating. Also, my recent book introduces how various stakeholders talk about AI in their own words.

Q2. AI and Society in Japan: What is happening in this space today? 
Japan started a discussion on AI governance and ethics quite early. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) organized a committee, of which I was a member, to develop the AI R&D Guidelines that were released in 2017. Culminating from inter-governmental and multi-stakeholder discussions, the Social Principles of Human-Centric AI was later released by the Cabinet Secretariat in February 2019.
While industries also began discussions on AI governance and ethics, two incidents in 2019 caught the public attention. First, there was a scandal in August involving a recruitment management company selling users’ and students’ data to client companies. The second incident occurred in November, where the Project Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo (a director of an AI company) tweeted racist opinions regarding the company’s recruitment policy and claimed his discriminatory comments were created by machine learning. These incidents raised social concerns about machine learning. In response, three machine learning academic communities released the Statement on Machine Learning and Fairness in December, declaring that (1) machine learning is nothing more than a tool to assist human decision making, and (2) machine learning researchers are committed to improving fairness in society by studying the possible uses of machine learning. As such, we have recently seen increased interest and activities on AI and society in Japan.
Q3. What is unique about Japan’s attitude towards AI? 
Japan’s AI research community developed in the 1980s during the second AI boom – when academics engaged not only real life applications but also with more philosophical questions about human nature and intelligence rather than real life applications. Therefore, except for the new members who joined this research field in mid-to-late 2010s, the academic community’s researchers are more interested in scientific and philosophical investigation on human intelligence. In addition, Japan is rich in animation and comic contents that consider AI/robots as part of society, which have generated unique discussions on AI as well.
Currently, there is a controversy over an AI system that reproduces new performances of a singer, Hibari Misora – who passed away 30 years ago. Also, a new AI project has been launched to create a new story and characters of the late Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy. Calling back the deceased and adding new features raises not only legal, but also ethical and social issues. We are witnessing similar discussions around the world, and the ethics committee of JSAI will organize asymposium on this issue by inviting relevant people behind AI Hibari Misora and AI Osamu Tezuka in June 2020.
Q4. You travel around the world for your work. What excites and worries you the most about what is happening in Japan compared to the world? 
I am currently on a liaison committee on organizing the 2nd Japanese-German-French Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in November 2020. Compared to the Western countries, I feel the social interest on topics related to AI is more focused on economic innovation in Japan, and focus on inclusion and sustainability is still weak, although inclusion and sustainability are considered as ‘Basic Philosophy’ in Social Principles of Human-Centric AI.
For example, as I wrote in a recent essay, only 13.8 per cent of the members that created the ‘Social Principles of Human-Centric AI’ in Japan were women, while its European counterpart that created the ‘Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI’ was  43.1 per cent female. Many Japanese claim the importance of Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and social awareness are rising, but there is much more work to be done. Further, these (unconscious) biases are not AI-specific issues, but rather social issues that Japan has to tackle. For instance, Japan ranked the lowest among the G7 countries on the Global Gender Gap Report 2020.
Q5. How could Canada and Japan work together on AI? What kind of collaboration would you like to see in the near future?
Canada is one of the leading countries of not only AI technologies, but also AI ethics and governance. I am particularly interested in the intersection between AI and democracy – and this is an area that Canada and Japan could collaborate more closely with each other. Technologies implemented in critical decision-making sectors could raise serious problems, and facial recognition and deep fakes have also posed unprecedented challenges for democratic systems – a topic that will be discussed in the AI and Justice symposium that we are organizing in Tokyo this March. AI and democracy will increasingly become more important and sharing experiences of good practices would be beneficial for both Canada and Japan.

It challenges each participant to go the distance and put a diamond ring where their mouth is. They talk through a wall, unencumbered by big bad wolves like social media and physical appearances. Only when they're engaged do they get a chance to see each other. Then, they move onto the honeymoon in Mexico, meet each other's families, and have their wedding day in the finale. Participants join the experiment in search of some ideal pure love that doesn't take into consideration things like race, creed, or class but conveniently, does take gender and geographical location into account.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTIt's easy to have faith in ""the pods"" when you end up engaged to a well-off engineer with the body of a former fireman, which is exactly what contestant Lauren Speed gets when she lays eyes on her new fiance Cameron Hamilton. Yes, he is majorly clingy and yes, he holds his body in a state of permanent flex. But it looks like that just might be Lauren's speed (I had to).Like Chandler Bing from Friends, some people have super-specialized and uniquely vague job descriptions that just don't stick to your brain, even after they've introduced themselves multiple times. And it would seem  Cameron Hamilton has one of those jobs. (Thankfully, he's not a rapper.) Much to any suitor's delight, he is a fireman-turned-scientist working in the ultra-lucrative field of artificial intelligence. But what exactly does that mean?Cameron Hamilton works as a data science consultant for Weill Cornell Medicine. According to his LinkedIn page, he's been working for WCM for almost two years. He has two master's degrees: one in artificial intelligence from the University of Georgia which covers machine learning, robotics, algorithms, and a host of other specialties. And another in Neurophilosophy (the intersection of science and philosophy). Our boy is brains and brawn.You're probably wondering how much he makes, considering the mega-house he walked Lauren through their first time back from Mexico. Well, according to Glassdoor, data scientists earn an average of $113,109 a year. And while he was once a fireman, the gaggle of gaunt nerdy friends he brought to his bachelor party shows that he is mostly brains now. Suddenly, meeting your partner while sealed off from them in a pod doesn't sound so weird, does it?Related Content:

Professor John Brownstein says his team takes precautions to protect privacy.(Supplied)""The system has done really well but we're constantly retraining it, especially when you move into new languages and geographies,"" Professor Brownstein said.As technology permeates deeper into our lives, Professor Brownstein's team are finding themselves with more data today than when they began the project 15 years ago.""There's more people interacting with symptom checker chatbots, so that's a whole new source of data,"" he said.""There are people that are utilising connected devices, like a connected thermometer — that's a very useful dataset that we're getting access to.""Voice technologies become one that we spent a lot of time on, working with Amazon, as an example, and the Alexa platform.""While access to internet-connected thermometers and smart speakers might spark privacy concerns, Professor Brownstein said his team were careful with data they used.""We have to think about patient privacy and anonymising datasets, that's a big part of what we do,"" he said. Tracking the spread of coronavirus has become important for health agencies fighting the outbreak.(AP: Kin Cheung)""The good thing is, we work with a lot of public datasets, like open social media sites like Twitter which are already quite open and then we're also doing a lot of work in crowdsourcing.""[Crowdsourcing] is in our view the holy grail because we're building platforms where people can engage, put their symptoms in, but be directly involved in public health.""The artificial intelligence born from SARSProfessor Brownstein's HealthMap was born in the shadows of the SARS outbreak in 2003, which killed almost 800 people and sparked panic across the globe.COVID-19, SARS and the fluWeeks after the novel coronavirus was first discovered, experts say incomplete data from China is limiting their ability to understand it — but they are seeing some differences between it and other infectious diseases.Read moreAt the time, Google Maps and social media platforms were just taking shape and his team believed there was an opportunity to collate the information into a single model.""This idea of a mash-up that organised all the world's information about disease events,"" he said.When the teams switched on HealthMap, it started to find virus and disease outbreaks all over the world.""[We] trained it in a way to produce a living, breathing, real-time map of disease events that was sort of never seen before,"" Professor Brownstein said.""At the time, this seemed to be sort of almost looked down upon as a source of information that wouldn't be as reliable as what government agencies were putting out.""Soon the team realised the map was more useful than that and that it could actually be a tool for policymakers.""Something flipped and that data actually became a huge driver of what government agencies used to understand what's happening both within countries and in neighbouring countries and internationally,"" Professor Brownstein said. South Korea has recently reported a surge in cases of coronavirus.(AP: Kim Jun-beom via Yonhap)He said the real value of the technology, at least in the early stages, came from being able to identify outbreaks in countries that did not have a record of open transparency.""In some ways [this AI could] apply this newfound pressure for government agencies to be more transparent because the information was going to come out one way or the other.""More technology tracking the outbreakAs well as HealthMap, there are also other tools using algorithms to crunch huge amounts of data in an attempt to track coronavirus.Ricardo Soares Magales, an associate professor in population health and biosecurity at the University of Queensland, told The Signal that digital epidemiologists were able to work out where the virus could pop up by combing everything from mobile phone locations to airport departures.""These models are being updated pretty much every day as information comes in,"" he said.""Some of these models integrate movement of individuals between cities and between countries so that you have an understanding of how far the infection can go.""""If we know that a particular location has a number of cases popping up and it's highly connected to another location, we can inform services to target the surveillance and case ascertainment, the containment and isolation, in the receiving location."" Doctors have been working around the clock in Wuhan to treat patients who have contracted the virus.(AP: Chinatopix)As well as tracking the spread, researchers are also trying to identify the source of the outbreak.One theory has been that bat products sold from a Wuhan market were the origin of this outbreak, and Dr Magales said researchers were trying to get access to apps that people could have used to sell and trade wild animal products.""Using that information to understand where the sale has been happening and who has been purchasing [the products] — not from an individual point of view, but an aggregate, [to see] which locations seem to be more active in the purchase of these products,"" he said.""Now authorities from the animal side are sieving through datastreams which could point to where these bat products have been and if they've been purchased online, which locations have been more exposed to this material.""Professor Brownstein has been surprised by the number of people who have made the fight against the coronavirus a priority over other work.""I think people have put their academic aspirations on hold while they're actually trying to figure out and work together to get this thing right,"" he said.""[It] is very unique compared to other events we've seen.""Posted 22 Feb 202022 Feb 2020Sat 22 Feb 2020 at 3:04pm, updated 22 Feb 202022 Feb 2020Sat 22 Feb 2020 at 4:58pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesChristian sect reported as hotbed of 'super-spreading' coronavirus event in South KoreaWhy China is 'laundering' cash and printing new banknotesCoronavirus cases confirmed among Australian Diamond Princess evacuees in DarwinMore on:BrisbaneChinaEpidemics and PandemicsEpidemiologyInformation Technology IndustryInternetSocial MediaUnited StatesTop StoriesSally McManus issues multiple denials over whether she knew of alleged criminality in CFMEUSuspected army spy's Instagram page reveals visit to sensitive Woomera military training areaHow Trump's bandaged ear stole the show on day one of the Republican conventionAnalysis by Kathryn DissTrump's near-assassination is part of long history of violence in the US.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help every sector of the economy. There is a challenge, though, in sectors that have fuzzier analysis and the potential to train with data that can continue human biases. A couple of years ago, I described the problem with bias in an article about machine learning (ML) applied to criminal recidivism. It’s worth revisiting the sector as time have changed in how bias is addressed. One way is to look at sectors in the legal profession where bias is a much smaller factor.


Tax law has a lot more explicit rules than, for instance, do many criminal laws. As much as there have been issues with ML applied to human resource systems (Amazon’s canceled HR system), employment law is another area where states and nations have created explicit rules. The key in choosing the right legal area. What seems to be the focus, according to conversations with people at Blue J Legal, is the to focus on areas with strong rules as opposed to standards. The former provide the ability to have clear feature engineering while that later don’t have the specificity to train an accurate model.”

Blue J Legal arose from a University of Toronto course started by the founders, combining legal and computer science skills to try to predict cases. The challenge was, as it has always been in software, to understand the features of the data set in the detail needed to properly analyze the problem. As mentioned, the choice of the tax system was picked for the first focus. Tax law has a significant set of rules that can be designed. The data can then be appropriately labeled. After their early work on tax, they moved to employment.

PROMOTED
The products are aimed at lawyers who are evaluating their cases. The goal is to provide the attorneys statistical analysis about the strength and weaknesses of each case.

The Feature Engineering Challenge
It is important to note that “employment” is a category of legal issues. Each issue must be looked at separately, and each issue has its own set of features. For instance, in today’s gig economy, “Is the worker a contractor or an employee?” is a single issue. The Blue J Legal team mentioned that they found between twenty and seventy features for each issue they’ve addressed.
That makes clear that feature engineering is a larger challenge than is the training of the ML system. That has been mentioned by many people but still too many folks have focused on the inference engine because it’s cool. Turning data into information is a more critical part of the ML challenge.

Once the system is trained, the next challenge is to get the lawyers to provide the right information in order to analyze their current cases. They must enter (or their clerks must enter…) information about each case that match the features to be analyzed.

On a slightly technical note, their model uses decision trees. They did try the Random Forest model, of interest in other fields, but found their accuracy dropped.
Blue J Legal claims their early version provides 80-90% accuracy.

Removing Bias: A Plus And A Minus
By removing variables that can drive bias, such as male v female, they are able to train a more general system. That’s good from a pure law point of view, but unlike the parole system mentioned above, that could cause problems in a lawyer’s analysis of a problem. For instance, if a minority candidate is treated more poorly in the legal system, a lawyer should know about that. The Blue J Legal team says they did look at bias, both in their Canadian and USA legal data, but state that the two areas they are addressing don’t see bias that would change the results in a significant way.
One area of bias they’ve also ignored is that of judges, for the same reason as above. I’m sure it’s also ignored for marketing reasons. As they move to legal areas with fewer rules and more standards, I could see a strong value for lawyers in knowing if the judge to whom the case has been assigned has strong biases based on features of the case or the plaintiff. Still, if they analyzed the judges, I could see other bias being added as judges might be biased against lawyers using the system. It’s an interesting conundrum that will have to be addressed in the future.
How The System Should Be Used By Lawyers
There is a clear ethical challenge in front of lawyers that exists regardless of bias. For instance, if the system comes back and tells the lawyer that 70% of cases that are similar go against the plaintiff, should the lawyer take the case? Law is a fluid profession with many cases being similar but not identical. How does the lawyer decide if the specific client is in the 70% or the 30%? How can a system provide information help a lawyer decide to take a case with lower probability or reject one with a higher probability? The hope is, as with any other profession, that the lawyer would carefully evaluate the results. However, as in all industries, busy people take shortcuts and far too many people have taken the old acronym of GIGO to no longer mean “garbage in, garbage out,” but rather “garbage in, gospel out.”
One way to help is to provide a legal memo. The Blue J Legal system provides a list of lawyer provided answers and similar cases for each answer. Not being a lawyer, I can’t tell how well that has been done, but it is a critical part of the system. Just as too many developers focus on the engine rather than feature engineering, they focus on the engine while minimizing the need to explain the engine. In all areas where machine learning is applied, but especially in professions, black box systems can’t be trusted. Analysis must be supported in order for lawyers to understand and evaluate how the generic decision impacts their specific cases.
Law is an interesting avenue in which to test the integration between AI and people. Automation won’t be replacing the lawyer any time soon, but as AI evolves it will be able to increasingly assist the people in the industry, to become more educated about their options and to use their time more efficiently. It’s the balance between the two that will be interesting to watch.

As with most technological breakthroughs, the hype when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) has far preceded its widespread application in the real world. This article explores key challenges that need to be overcome over the next decade, at a global level, in order to ensure that AI’s potential can be successfully deployed to enhance our working lives and productivity gains. It also places the responsibility for AI advancement firmly in the court of “traditional” industries—radical impact will not come from the technology sector alone, rather from the innovative, timely, and systematic adoption of AI by established companies. While focused on AI’s global impact, the article also provides a Chinese perspective on challenges and opportunities of its adoption at scale. 
Introduction: The Age of AI
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum and author of The Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized the era we currently live in as defined by “a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.” 1 No previous technological revolution drew upon so many different advancements all at once, and most certainly not at a comparable speed.
The velocity of innovation caused by this multimodal transformation has prompted a heated debate about the future of humanity, asking us to examine the limits of our own capacity to understand and make use of the technological breakthroughs previously never thought possible: can our understanding keep up with the changes at hand? How do we adjust? Will machines eventually rule our lives? What does it mean to be human in the age of the machines?
Our cognitive functions have not kept up with technological advancements. Human relationship with intelligent machines is still perhaps best epitomized by Arthur C. Clarke’s and Stanley Kubrick’s HAL 9000—something to admire and fear in equal measure—prompting us to defend, while at the same time question, the supremacy of human intelligence. What do we do with the machines whose limits we may not be able to imagine?
If the rate of technological change continues at this pace, it follows that humans will soon be flanked by automatons and robots, automating every aspect of our lives.
Well, maybe someday. In reality, the science trails considerably behind the futuristic visions of a society where artificial intelligence (AI) reigns supreme. In fact, if I were to make a prediction today, based on the scientific progress at hand, I would say with confidence that true machine intelligence at human level is a very distant prospect, if ever reachable.
Advancements in AI have so far been limited to single-domain tasks. As of today, AI can more efficiently process vast quantities of information about something very specific, such as playing a game, health-care diagnostics, or speech recognition. But it cannot think laterally to apply learnings to a different domain. It cannot form an opinion about what it is doing. And it most certainly does not have any feelings about what it is doing.
But, whether we realize truly intelligent machines (often referred to as Artificial General Intelligence or AGI) or not, AI is already transforming how we live and work, finding its way into most domains of human activity. While technologists and pundits debate humans’ future relationship with machines, what is not debated nearly enough is the imminent impact of various AI-powered technologies. How do we cope with job loss? How do we ensure our education systems can keep up? What about social services?
Our understanding of ourselves and our role in society is already, if slowly, being challenged. If humans will no longer be required to perform an array of jobs, and if what we have learned at school may soon no longer apply—how do we adjust our course and our expectations of our working lives? Such questions should be front-of-mind for governments, their economic advisers, education ministers, school principals and deans, and business leaders, as well as parents everywhere.
And So It Begins
We are already at the epicenter of synchronous disruption brought upon by AI across all industries. I use a “Four Waves of AI” framework to elaborate AI’s impact on the business scenario—they do not come one after the other, but rather simultaneously, transforming the way we live (fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Four waves of AI
The first wave of AI innovation, Internet AI, began around 2010, completely transforming our use of the Internet with the breakthrough brought by the invention of deep learning. Search, online advertising, social media, e-commerce—advancements in these online activities that are now part and parcel of our everyday lives—have all been predicated on advancements in AI.
In 2014, businesses, particularly those where data is readily available, started to embrace AI, creating the foundations for the advancement of industries such as AI fintech, remote education, digitization of public services, and supply chain management. I would call this second, largely software-driven, wave of innovation— Business AI.
Perception AI began to make inroads in 2016, enhancing machines’ ability to capture human senses, analyze, and make decisions based on such data. Computer vision technology has become mainstream: machines now recognize human faces, traffic patterns, or even merchandise we select from stores. Speech recognition technology can now analyze and synthesize languages, enabling simultaneous translations and machine-generated news reporting. We will see fast development of AI in software and hardware during this wave.
Most recently, in 2018, autonomous systems saw their first applications across industries, allowing us to imagine the not-so-distant future where autonomous vehicles dominate the roads, and possibly even airways. Automation AI is already transforming traditional heavy-weight players in transportation, logistics, and manufacturing, to name a few.
In what seems like the blink of an eye, we have found ourselves in possession of a multifaceted technology whose application is as pervasive as that of electricity. In fact, it may not be an exaggeration to say that we already may not know what it means to have lived without AI.
What is more, the transformation through AI has only just begun. Leaders across industries have begun to consider AI’s application for their own businesses en masse. According to Deloitte’s “State of AI in the Enterprise” 2019 report, 2 57% of business leaders believe that AI will have a transformative impact on their own company in the next three years. While fewer, 38%, believe AI will power the same transformation across their industries, the trajectory is clear: AI is permeating most domains of human endeavor. What will separate the winners from the losers is their ability to grasp the magnitude of change and adapt in time.
The fundamental truth of our time is as follows: AI is the greatest frontier facing humanity to date and we must act now to get it right.
How Prepared Are We for AI?
AI’s potential to change the way we live and work is so vast that its current uses are a mere scratch on the surface of what is yet to come. Every aspect of our lives will be affected, and every corner of the world we live in will be implicated in the change.
But, will it affect everyone in the same way?
Research shows that AI will enable the creation of unprecedented wealth: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that the wide adoption of AI will add about $15.7 trillion to worldwide GDP by 2030 3—barely a decade from now. This growth will continue its exponential trajectory toward the year 2050.
There is tremendous business value to be gained through the adoption of AI, but wealth creation will not be even. As I indicate in my book—AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order—gains from early AI innovation are akin to winner-takes-all scenario, with two economic giants—the United States and China—already leading the way, being the homes to all of the world’s corporate AI giants. In the PwC predictions I mentioned above, the most significant growth is expected to come from China, not least due to its vast population, which accounts for almost a fifth of all the world’s people.

Inequality between countries must be tackled through international diplomacy channels, with the US and China lending their resources and know-how to avoid exacerbating global inequality. But even more pertinently, inequality within countries—stemming from job displacement, skills gap, education inequality, and lack of access—must be made a national priority for governments and businesses across the world.
While it may take fifteen or more years for AI-powered technologies to have an impact across industries, we must act quickly to put in place the infrastructure needed to avoid massive disruption and lessen human hardship that will inevitably come in the form of vast job losses and the uneven distribution of wealth.
AI Infusion
While we are enamored by great AI companies like Deepmind, the $15.7 trillion value will not be realized through them. From today’s vantage point, AI’s biggest opportunity is infusion into traditional companies. This will be greatly enhanced by the rapid development of AI platforms, so that more and more traditional companies can implement AI, without requiring deep AI expertise.
AI’s greatest potential is in infusing existing businesses with new ways of problem-solving, new levels of speed and accuracy, new efficiencies, and new ways of working and thinking about what is possible. AI can be used to optimize existing processes (such as saving costs by up to 80% on back-office outsourcing or customer service), to improve processes (such as using AI to reshape sales forecasts, logistics, and supply chain), or to disrupt industries (such as using AI to help medical scientists discover drugs many times faster than today).
Business leaders must embrace the long view. Few can afford resistance to change, as businesses must integrate AI as part of their strategy in order to stay relevant. Referring back to the Deloitte study, many more executives believe AI to play a role in offering a more competititve edge to their own companies than that of their industries overall. This suggests that a blind spot is emerging, as the pace of innovation coming from elsewhere may catch businesses off guard. The fact is, no one can remain complacent as AI moves to the top of the agenda across the board.
Anticipating where disruption may come from and upskilling to be ready to take on the level of technological and operational change caused by AI will become a part of the business strategy playbook across all industries.
Impact on Jobs
The impact of AI on job creation and loss is largely misunderstood. The doomsday narrative would have us believe that AI will cause such a level of disruption that it will mark the end of the workplace as we know it. All jobs will be gone, spelling economic hardship for most of us. I am personally against the dystopian view of AI destructing the values of mankind.
A different interpretation of the same scenario holds that AI will spare us the drudgery of work, allowing us, instead, to lead lives of leisure in some sort of utopian state.

According to Deloitte’s “State of AI in the Enterprise” 2019 report, 57% of business leaders believe that AI will have a transformative impact on their own company in the next three years

The reality is somewhere in the middle. It is true that up to half of all jobs are likely to face extinction or disruption due to the introduction of AI. What may have surprised those in industries already starting to be affected is what kinds of jobs have started to disappear first.
It may seem counterintuitive, but manual jobs, such as those in most manufacturing fields, will not be significantly affected for the time to come.
Today’s machines are much better at grasping quantitative reasoning than basic sensorimotor skills. It is extremely difficult to achieve a level of meaningful dexterity and precision in most robotic applications. So, it is repetition-rich white-collar jobs that are already being more readily disrupted than the blue-collar ones.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
A lot of human activity today is focused on domain-specific tasks that, when injected with a lot of data, can be more efficiently performed by AI. It is estimated that up to one-fifth 4 of all tasks performed by humans at work is spent on repetitive computer tasks that can be automated.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA), with the use of AI and machine learning to process high-volume repetitive tasks, has started to gain traction among companies whose employees spend a significant amount of time on manual tasks, such as query handling, calculations, data entry, or record maintenance. Jobs at the forefront of disruption include those in business process outsourcing: for example, tax examiners filling numbers into cells and tables every day in order to generate data comparison and analysis.
RPA can provide significant value for businesses by freeing up their employees to focus on more complex, higher-value tasks. At the same time, it means companies can now start to reduce the number of people they employ in certain single-domain job positions.
Employers will need to understand the trade-off between efficiency gains and impact on employee morale. Communicating with transparency about the changes in business needs and implementing retraining programs where possible will help both employers and employees transition more successfully.
Is Anyone Safe?
I have established that AI can be used to perform routine work more efficiently. But AI has no creativity, no compassion, nor the ability to connect with humans and win their trust. The higher the requirement for compassion or creativity in any given job, the less likely it is for AI to replace humans in performing such tasks (fig. 2).

Some fields, such as medical diagnostics, may experience a symbiosis between people and machines. For example, doctors can rely on AI to more accurately diagnose a disease based on data at hand, while they can provide not just the treatment plan, but also the warmth and the trust that are key for human interaction. Research 5 shows that human connection can have a significant impact on the quality of health outcomes. Equally, scientists can use AI tools to discover drugs with higher accuracy. But machines cannot replace the scientists’ ability to hypothesize and apply learnings, and communicate to patients with knowledge and trust.
With this in mind, it is critical for governments, businesses, and education institutions to determine what types of jobs will give humans an edge over the machines and make a plan to create more of these. Likewise, understanding where humans will be most needed should have an impact on curricula everywhere: how should we go about preparing children for the future in work? What skills will they need to ensure employability throughout the course of their working lives?
China’s AI Competitive Edge
The sheer size of China’s population, nearly 1.4 billion, and its embrace of mobile technology as part of everyday life has given China an edge when it comes to quality data crucial for the development of AI. Mobile phones are truly at the epicenter of everyday life in China—from food ordering to peer-to-peer payments to charity donation—the Chinese of all ages rely on mobile payments for most of their transactions. The vast amount of data generated in such a way allows merchants and services platforms to adopt a targeted approach to customer acquisition—causing, in turn, massive disruption of traditional industries.
AI is already omnipresent in China—from mobile payments as already mentioned, to AI-enriched mobile applications, face-recognition authentification, autonomous retail stores, AI personalized news aggregation, to customized product recommendations. The use of AI also plays a growing role in connecting rural school children with so-called “super teachers,” who can now be connected to classrooms across the country, offering an immersive, interactive experience for the students and making quality education more accessible even in China’s remote mountain villages, given the sheer size and resource disparity between cities and regions.

While its size and abundance of data due to mobile technology maturity certainly represent China’s fundamental advantage, its rise as an AI superpower has been predicated on painstaking promotion of entrepreneurism and infrastructure development

In short, mobile-first consumer demands are fueling AI innovation and digitization of the Chinese economy fast and at scale. Adding to this is the Chinese relentlessly dedicated entrepreneurial culture, significant venture capital funding, and government incentives for the development of AI.
While its size and abundance of data due to mobile technology maturity certainly represent China’s fundamental advantage, its rise as an AI superpower has been predicated on painstaking promotion of entrepreneurism and infrastructure development. Readily available funding for AI has attracted a huge number of AI technical talents, providing a crucial advantage in the form of a qualified workforce.
All of these combined have enabled Chinese AI companies to cover competitive ground fast and catch up with, and even surpass, the pace of innovation coming out of Silicon Valley.
AI’s Impact on China’s Labor Market
Various studies of AI’s likely impact on the Chinese labor market illustrate the difficulty in predicting AI outcomes on the workforce with any degree of certainty.
PwC offers an optimistic view of AI’s impact on jobs in China, estimating that, on balance, the adoption of AI will lead to a 12%, or 93 million, increase in jobs, an income increase of 38%, and a possible GDP increase of 1.4% per year on top of current rates. 6
While some 200 million jobs are expected to be lost to automation, there is an expectation that 300 million jobs will be created. However, both job loss and creation are not expected to be spread evenly across all sectors or synchronized in time.

McKinsey and Co., 7 in turn, ranks China among countries most likely to be affected by automation, with 51% of work activities potentially being affected by automation.
On balance, China’s economy faces the same challenges as the rest of the world when it comes to AI. While its advantage when it comes to pace of innovation delivered by its AI companies is indisputable, for all countries it is the preparedness for jobs disruption, on the national level, that will be necessary to ensure successful mitigation of imminent job losses.
While having the privilege of talking to leading policy- makers around the world, it is obvious to me that most countries are keenly aware of and deeply concerned about the collective societal impact on the workforce brought by the coming AI revolution. It is also an area where I would advocate for higher international collaboration to share best practices on policy enhancement, social programs, public-private partnerships, and innovations in the public service sector to ensure successful transition to AI across our society.
Conclusion on Jobs
The age of AI, just like the earlier technology revolutions, is expected to lead to significant job creation. But, we do not know for sure what these jobs will look like, nor when they may start to appear.
When the Internet first came into being, no one could have predicted the arrival of Uber and the impact on traditional taxi companies. Or the disruption of the hospitality industry brought upon it by Airbnb. Equally, we cannot predict what innovative ideas are yet to be enabled by AI.
AI will also transform entire business models within existing companies. It is hard to imagine that, once upon a time, Microsoft had an Internet division. Nowadays, of course, the Internet is integrated into every aspect of its business.
The key challenge in dealing with the transition period already underway is the massive job disruption that will precede job creation. Unfortunately, those affected by the former may not be the benefactors of the latter. AI is unlikely to create new routine jobs that would require humans to do them. Thus, retraining will be required to prepare the displaced routine workers for non-routine jobs at a massive scale to mitigate the effects on job losses.
At the moment, very little is being done across the world to account for pending job displacement. One of the seminal challenges of our time is finding a way to prepare new generations to not only enter the workforce, but also thrive throughout their working lives. This despite the pace of technological innovation and constantly moving goalposts when it comes to demand for skills and specialized knowledge.
Improving education has never been an easy task. Redesigning it entirely to shift the center of gravity away from knowledge transfer and toward self-awareness and self-discovery is a monumental task, yet a necessary one. We must prepare our children for an entirely new relationship between humans and machines.

Training and retraining must be a priority for business and governments, but this alone will not be enough to address the fundamental shift in what will be required to be able to ride the wave of disruption in the job market. As technology continues to disrupt existing processes and ways of working, field-specific expertise will matter less than transferable skills, adaptability, critical thinking, compassion, and self-awareness. These are the skills that will allow young people to navigate the changing world of work. What may constitute a career today may be gone tomorrow, so the ability to reskill and adapt will be more important than any domain-specific knowledge.
We must attempt to answer questions such as: what constitutes lasting knowledge and what value should we assign to it? What is the role of education in the world where ability to adapt and change ensures our survival more than holding onto what we know?
Ensuring a competitive edge in the global race to lead in AI innovation requires concerted government action: reforming education, job creation, incentivizing entrepreneurship, building the necessary infrastructure to enable innovation to thrive, enabling trustworthy data collection, and training AI application engineers should all be seen as priorities.
The End of Privacy?
It is often said that AI has put an end to privacy as we know it. With millions of digital records that we all leave behind constantly, and technologies that can differentiate our unique features, the danger of misuse is evident.
Every day, a vast quantity of personal data is being collected and stored to drive new AI technologies. On the one hand, these technologies, run by algorithms that improve themselves through consuming more and more quality data, have the potential to make our lives better and more convenient. On the other, we must ensure that personal information does not fall prey to the dangers of misuse.
In response, policy-makers across the world have sought to regulate the transfer of data, hoping to create a more transparent and trustworthy relationship between consumers and companies. Enter Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California’s Consumer Privacy Act, which both stipulate that companies must obtain consumers’ consent before collecting their data.
I do believe that these regulations play a role in protecting individual privacy; however, it is both a limiting and a limited way to deal with the issues at hand. Privacy is not binary. Any privacy regulation must proactively balance considerations of data protection with that of user convenience and value they get in return. This trade-off is largely subjective; it differs among individuals and across countries.

New data protection regulations play a role in protecting individual privacy, but it is both a limiting and a limited way to deal with the problem

How do we balance the need for scientific progress and the value (convenience, security, social good) brought about by new technologies with the need to better protect personal privacy? Policies alone will tilt the spectrum to the latter, at the expense of the former. So, while regulations are needed, we must also consider technology solutions.
We should question the hypothesis that convenience and privacy are mutually exclusive. We should investigate technologies that protect privacy yet allow the data to be used to improve AI. For example, homomorphic encryption is a method of irreversibly encrypting data to enhance privacy protection. Federated learning, a technology that allows learning to take place in trusted environments, is currently being tested in a number of places.
Consider this scenario: a thousand hospitals are interested in using the power of their collective data to train AI-powered diagnostic tools. Due to patient data privacy rules that restrict the use of data within a single health-care institution, patient information cannot be aggregated in one central place—making it impossible to train AI with sufficient data. With federated learning, AI training takes place at each of the hospitals, “federating” the resulting learnings, while “raw data” never leaves the hospital premises. These technologies are not yet perfected, but further research and testing must be encouraged.
AI as a Force for Good
AI’s impact is akin to a tidal change morphing the very axis of our lives. I fundamentally believe that AI can act as a force for good across the world. Equally, I am not oblivious to the potential for its misuse. We have a great responsibility to ensure that AI can live up to its potential—whether it be job creation, medical advancement, transformation of industry processes, access to better education, or making our everyday lives easier through countless conveniences—both big and small.
I hope that we can harness the collective concerns and enthusiasm for AI to start addressing the key questions about its impact on our world. I hope that we can tackle security concerns in a way that is sensitive to regional and cultural differences, while mindful of humanity’s future. That, as entrepreneurs, we can start shifting our business mindset from short-term profit to long-term viability by understanding AI’s transformative value and its impact on worker training and retraining. That governments can start to scrutinize education to ensure our children are equipped for the changes to come. That we can focus job creation on areas where us people, with our empathy, compassion, and creativity, will remain irreplaceable.
Regardless of global competition for technological dominance, we need concerted action across the nations to ensure that AI can live up to its potential. How we go about engaging with each other on this topic today will decide the nature of the human relationship with AI.

That doesn’t make it fair.by  Rebecca HeilweilFeb 18, 2020, 12:20 PM ESTFacebookLink Christina Animashaun/VoxRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.FacebookLinkHumans are error-prone and biased, but that doesn’t mean that algorithms are necessarily better. Still, the tech is already making important decisions about your life and potentially ruling over which political advertisements you see, how your application to your dream job is screened, how police officers are deployed in your neighborhood, and even predicting your home’s risk of fire. But these systems can be biased based on who builds them, how they’re developed, and how they’re ultimately used. This is commonly known as algorithmic bias. It’s tough to figure out exactly how systems might be susceptible to algorithmic bias, especially since this technology often operates in a corporate black box. We frequently don’t know how a particular artificial intelligence or algorithm was designed, what data helped build it, or how it works.Typically, you only know the end result: how it has affected you, if you’re even aware that AI or an algorithm was used in the first place. Did you get the job? Did you see that Donald Trump ad on your Facebook timeline? Did a facial recognition system identify you? That makes addressing the biases of artificial intelligence tricky, but even more important to understand.Machine learning-based systems are trained on data. Lots of it.When thinking about “machine learning” tools (machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence), it’s better to think about the idea of “training.” This involves exposing a computer to a bunch of data — any kind of data — and then that computer learns to make judgments, or predictions, about the information it processes based on the patterns it notices. For instance, in a verysimplified example, let’s say you wanted to train your computer system to recognize whether an object is a book, based on a few factors, like its texture, weight, and dimensions. A human might be able to do this, but a computer could do it more quickly.To train the system, you show the computer metrics attributed to a lot of different objects. You give the computer system the metrics for every object, and tell the computer when the objects are books and when they’re not. After continuously testing and refining, the system is supposed to learn what indicates a book and, hopefully, be able to predict in the future whether an object is a book, depending on those metrics, without human assistance. That sounds relatively straightforward. And it might be, if your first batch of data was classified correctly and included a good range of metrics featuring lots of different types of books. However, these systems are often applied to situations that have much more serious consequences than this task, and in scenarios where there isn’t necessarily an “objective” answer. Often, the data on which many of these decision-making systems are trained or checked are often not complete, balanced, or selected appropriately, and that can be a major source of — although certainly not the only source — of algorithmic bias.Nicol Turner-Lee, a Center for Technology Innovation fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, explains that we can think about algorithmic bias in two primary ways: accuracy and impact. An AI can have different accuracy rates for different demographic groups. Similarly, an algorithm can make vastly different decisions when applied to different populations.Importantly, when you think of data, you might think of formal studies in which demographics and representation are carefully considered, limitations are weighed, and then the results are peer-reviewed. That’s not necessarily the case with the AI-based systems that might be used to make a decision about you. Let’s take one source of data everyone has access to: the internet. One study found that, by teaching an artificial intelligence to crawl through the internet — and just reading what humans have already written — the system would produce prejudices against black people and women.Join the Open Sourced Reporting NetworkChristina Animashaun/VoxOpen Sourced is Recode by Vox’s year-long reporting project to demystify the world of data, personal privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. And we need your help. Fill out this form to contribute to our reporting.Another example of how training data can produce sexism in an algorithm occurred a few years ago, when Amazon tried to use AI to build a résumé-screening tool. According to Reuters, the company’s hope was that technology could make the process of sorting through job applications more efficient. It built a screening algorithm using résumés the company had collected for a decade, but those résumés tended to come from men. That meant the system, in the end, learned to discriminate against women. It also ended up factoring in proxies for gender, like whether an applicant went to a women’s college. (Amazon says the tool was never used and that it was nonfunctional for several reasons.)Amid discussions of algorithmic biases, companies using AI might say they’re taking precautions, taking steps to use more representative training data and regularly auditing their systems for unintended bias and disparate impact against certain groups. But Lily Hu, a doctoral candidate at Harvard in applied mathematics and philosophy who studies AI fairness, says those aren’t assurances that your system will perform fairly in the future. “You don’t have any guarantees because your algorithm performs ‘fairly’ on your old dataset,” Hu told Recode. “That’s just a fundamental problem of machine learning. Machine learning works on old data [and] on training data. And it doesn’t work on new data, because we haven’t collected that data yet.”Still, shouldn’t we just make more representative datasets? That might be part of the solution, though it’s worth noting that not all efforts aimed at building better data sets are ethical. And it’s not just about the data. As Karen Hao of the MIT Tech Review explains, AI could also be designed to frame a problem in a fundamentally problematic way. For instance, an algorithm designed to determine “creditworthiness” that’s programmed to maximize profit could ultimately decide to give out predatory, subprime loans.Related:This AI makes you look like a masterpiece — while teaching you about its own biasHere’s another thing to keep in mind: Just because a tool is tested for bias — which assumes that engineers who are checking for bias actually understand how bias manifests and operates — against one group doesn’t mean it is tested for bias against another type of group. This is also true when an algorithm is considering several types of identity factors at the same time: A tool may deemed fairly accurate on white women, for instance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it works with black women. In some cases, it might be impossible to find training data free of bias. Take historical data produced by the United States criminal justice system. It’s hard to imagine that data produced by an institution rife with systemic racism could be used to build out an effective and fair tool. As researchers at New York University and the AI Now Institute outline, predictive policing tools can be fed “dirty data,” including policing patterns that reflect police departments’ conscious and implicit biases, as well as police corruption.The foundational assumptions of engineers can also be biasedSo you might have the data to build an algorithm. But who designs it, and who decides how it’s deployed? Who gets to decide what level of accuracy and inaccuracy for different groups is acceptable? Who gets to decide which applications of AI are ethical and which aren’t?While there isn’t a wide range of studies on the demographics of the artificial intelligence field, we do know that AI tends to be dominated by men. And the “high tech” sector, more broadly, tends to overrepresent white people and underrepresent black and Latinx people, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Turner-Lee emphasizes that we need to think about who gets a seat at the table when these systems are proposed, since those people ultimately shape the discussion about ethical deployments of their technology.But there’s also a broader question of what questions artificial intelligence can help us answer. Hu, the Harvard researcher, argues that for many systems, the question of building a “fair” system is essentially nonsensical, because those systems try to answer social questions that don’t necessarily have an objective answer. For instance, Hu says algorithms that claim to predict a person’s recidivism don’t ultimately address the ethical question of whether someone deserves parole.“There’s not an objective way to answer that question,” Hu says. “When you then insert an AI system, an algorithmic system, [or] a computer, that doesn’t change the fundamental context of the problem, which is that the problem has no objective answer. It’s fundamentally a question of what our values are, and what the purpose of the criminal justice system is.” That in mind, some algorithms probably shouldn’t exist, or at least they shouldn’t come with such a high risk of abuse. Just because a technology is accurate doesn’t make it fair or ethical. For instance, the Chinese government has used artificial intelligence to track and racially profile its largely Muslim Uighur minority, about 1 million of whom are believed to be living in internment camps.Transparency is a first step for accountabilityOne of the reasons algorithmic bias can seem so opaque is because, on our own, we usually can’t tell when it’s happening (or if an algorithm is even in the mix). That was one of the reasons why the controversy over a husband and wife who both applied for an Apple Card — and got widely different credit limits — attracted so much attention, Turner-Lee says. It was a rare instance in which two people, who at least appeared to be exposed to the same algorithm and could easily compare notes. The details of this case still aren’t clear, though the company’s credit card is now being investigated by regulators.Algorithmic bias is a complicated and broad subject. To learn more, check out these sources:Ruha Benjamin, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim CodeSafiya Umoja Noble, Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce RacismRachel Thomas, Getting Specific About Algorithmic BiasBut consumers being able to make apples-to-apples comparisons of algorithmic results are rare, and that’s part of why advocates are demanding more transparency about how systems work and their accuracy. Ultimately, it’s probably not a problem we can solve on the individual level. Even if we do understand that algorithms can be biased, that doesn’t mean companies will be forthright in allowing outsiders to study their artificial intelligence. That’s created a challenge for those pushing for more equitable, technological systems. How can you critique an algorithm — a sort of black box — if you don’t have true access to its inner workings or the capacity to test a good number of its decisions? Companies will claim to be accurate, overall, but won’t always reveal their training data (remember, that’s the data that the artificial intelligence trains on before evaluating newdata, like, say, your job application). Many don’t appear to be subjecting themselves to audit by a third-party evaluator or publicly sharing how their systems fare when applied to different demographic groups. Some researchers, such as Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru, say that sharing this demographic information about both the data used to train and the data used to check artificial intelligence should be a baseline definition of transparency.Artificial intelligence is new, but that doesn’t mean existing laws don’t applyWe will likely need new laws to regulate artificial intelligence, and some lawmakers are catching up on the issue. There’s a bill that would force companies to check their AI systems for bias through the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). And legislation has also been proposed to regulate facial recognition, and even to ban the technology from federally assisted public housing. But Turner-Lee emphasizes that new legislation doesn’t mean existing laws or agencies don’t have the power to look over these tools, even if there’s some uncertainty. For instance, the FTC oversees deceptive acts and practices, which could give the agency authority over some AI-based tools.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which investigates employment discrimination, is reportedly looking into at least two cases involving algorithmic discrimination. At the same time, the White House is encouraging federal agencies that are figuring out how to regulate artificial intelligence to keep technological innovation in mind. That raises the challenge of whether the government is prepared to study and govern this technology, and figure out how existing laws apply.“You have a group of people that really understand it very well, and that would be technologists,” Turner-Lee cautions, “and a group of people who don’t really understand it at all, or have minimal understanding, and that would be policymakers.”That’s not to say there aren’t technical efforts to “de-bias” flawed artificial intelligence, but it’s important to keep in mind that the technology won’t be a solution to fundamental challenges of fairness and discrimination. And, as the examples we’ve gone through indicate, there’s no guarantee companies building or using this tech will make sure it’s not discriminatory, especially without a legal mandate to do so. It would seem it’s up to us, collectively, to push the government to rein in the tech and to make sure it helps us more than it might already be harming us.

The nature of war has changed significantly since the end of World War 2. Battle lines have now become opaque; an attack can come from terrorists who easily blend in as civilians, drones that are undetectable to the eye, or ballistic missiles launched from 500 miles away. To account for the increased lethality of war, a vast budget is required to maintain an active duty army. Simply recruiting a soldier costs $15,000; the cost of treating an injured US solider is about $2 million a year (Bilmes, 2014). We aim to determine whether it is possible to reduce those human costs through the deployment of computational agents and artificial intelligence (AI).
Robots that can understand their context, and deal with novelty in an open world could be a viable solution. In the next big war, AI will be king! Robots that are quicker, stronger, and more accurate will determine who the victor is. Such wars, however, can be unquestionably and unprecedently destructive, maybe to the extent of a global technological meltdown. Nonetheless, such advanced technologies should not fall into the hands of the immoral or the malevolent.
The use of robotics (or other forms of intelligent agents) in warfare has existed since WW2. Many of these early robots (such as the US’s ‘Aphrodite’ drones or the Soviet’s tele-tanks) were either ineffective or only useful for specialised operations. The use of robotics for military operations took off in the 1990s when the MQB-1 Predator drone was used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Instead of painstakingly controlling drones from close-up radio signals, drones “could be controlled by satellite from any command centre to bridge intelligence gaps” (Gotera, 2003). Although there has been considerable progress in making robots intelligent, autonomous robots still “lack the flexibility to react appropriately in unforeseen situations” (Nitsch, 2013). If autonomous robots are used in the battlefield, soldiers will acquire more responsibilities, not less. Soldiers will be expected to perform normal military tasks and use robotic assets as per mission requirements (Barnes et al., 2009).
Studies show that a soldier’s performance on the battlefield worsens if a second robotic task is added to their inventory. In a simulation experiment conducted by Chen and Joyner (Chen et al., 2009), researchers tested if gunners were able to maintain local security using a semi-autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The results indicated that “a gunner’s target detection performance degraded significantly when he or she had to concurrently monitor, manage, or tele-operate a UGV compared to the baseline (gunnery task only)” (Barnes et al., 2009). Researchers tested the ability of participants to identify equipment and personnel while operating a UGV. Authors of the study ran their experiments in a 1/35 scaled Iraqi city. The results similarly indicated that “having an additional semiautonomous robot did not offer any advantages for participants. In some cases, it added to their difficulties”.
These types of studies indicate that having context (also known as situational awareness —SA—in the military) is essential for intelligent computational agents. Defining context for an agent, however, is far more challenging than automating a manual or repetitive task. One of the biggest challenges for developing validated and verified SA is defining objects that are unfamiliar. Often, military operators identified an improvised explosive device (or other type of dangers) only because something didn’t look right. Operators rely on previous experiences to identify subtle cues like inconsistent soil texture or a missing vehicle. If an agent can similarly assist soldiers in identifying dangers via contextual data, robotic agents will be far more effective in the battlefield. We present soldier variables that are considered as conflict contextual constructs, namely: paralinguistic, demographic, visual, and physiological variables.
Paralinguistic variables: Military operations typically occur under noisy and stressful circumstances; speech recognition is highly inaccurate under these conditions. Studies consistently show speech recognition accuracies to drop by 50-60% for speech that is emotional (Rajasekaran et al., 1986). Focusing on acoustic (or paralinguistic) features, however, reduces complexities that commonly plague linguistic features, such as: speaking different languages and dialects, having varying accents, and using different speeds of speech. Some studies indicate that using acoustic variables like speech intensity, pitch, speaking rate, and spectral features (i.e. Mel frequency) are effective at recognising emotions from speech — even under noisy conditions (Tawari et al., 2010).
Demographic variables: Research has shown that accepting robots as partners is enhanced when robots possess human-like characteristics (Kiesler et al., 2008). Examples of soldiers ascribing feelings like empathy towards their robotic tools have already been found. Therefore, it is critical to understand how robotic agents will interact with human teammates in future human-agent teams. Using metrics like personality type, age, and gender, agents could help determine whether a soldier is overreacting to a situation or playing it too safe. Research into using personality tests, demographics, geographical data, and psychographics for context-based purposes is a field that is recently gaining more traction (Batarseh et al., 2018). In a study one of us conducted (Batarseh et al. 2018), we used context-aware user interfaces to build an intelligent emergency application. The study used the Myers-Briggs personality type indication to ‘know’ who the user is and what aspects identify their personality. Individuals with a ‘judger’ personality were provided with a more structured format for the app; ‘perceivers’ were presented with a ‘dynamic’ format and so on (Batarseh et al., 2017). In a military setting, an agent could similarly use personality metrics to personalise its interaction with soldiers.
Visual variables: In real world scenarios, object information is usually degraded due to peripheral vision and distance, shadows, and illumination. Within the computer vision field, a dominant approach towards scene recognition is object-based (Siagian et al., 2005). This approach works well indoors, but for outdoors “spatial simplifications such as flat walls and narrow corridors cannot be assumed” (Siagian et al., 2005). A context-based approach could analyse the scene as a whole and embody a sense of gist. Rather than focusing exclusively on objects, classifying image data as scenes would average out random noise in isolated regions. The structure of an area could be estimated by global image features, rather than relying exclusively on local image structures. Not only would this approach be more computationally efficient, but in certain studies it has also proven to be more accurate (Siagian et al., 2005). For various reasons, analysing image data as scenes is more applicable in military settings than the object-based approach. In the battlefield, video clips of an agent will not always be stable. Agents will have to parse thorough jittery image data (as a result of explosions, gunfire, etc.) and identify the context. Additionally, agents will be expected to quickly identify a scene despite having low spatial frequency.
Physiological variables: An agent can rely on soldiers’ emotions to determine if a situation requires intervention. If a squad of soldiers is clearly distressed, the agent needs to act. Monitoring the mean heart rate, heart rate variability, voice pitch, skin conductance, skin temperature, and respiratory rate are commonly used physiological markers of stress. Most studies attempt to predict the mental stress of working professionals using heart rate data (Wijsman et al., 2011). Few studies have focused on predicting physical and emotional stress in combat or physically involved settings (Kutilek, et al., 2017). Effectively predicting and monitoring the stress levels of a soldier is important to build a context that is relevant to the health of the soldier.
Context- driven intelligent agent (CIA) is a method that unifies all four soldier variables. CIA is a technique that allows agents to understand their environment and reduce uncertainty. Context is the mathematical aggregation of all these pillars (figure 1).
Figure 1. A theoretical agent reacting to uncertainty in a soldier-agent mission

To demonstrate how demographic variables could be used for contextual purposes, we collected a dataset from www.data.gov on veteran health conditions (made available by the Department of Veterans Affairs). The dataset contained multiple health and demographic features amongst VHA (Veteran Health Administration) patients in 2013. The dataset includes data on health issues by race (Asian, black, Hispanic, white, Native American, and Pacific Islander). Within each race, soldiers with general health issues are Asian (980,433), black (21,870,275), Hispanic (8,506,126), white (98,758,347), Native American (742,994), and Pacific Islander (868,330). The top three conditions veterans suffer from are hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes (figure 2). While genetics and age are contributing factors, lifestyle and diet are strongly correlated to whether a person will suffer from these conditions. Soldiers often “cope with the stress of battle by smoking, drinking, and eating unhealthy” (Deal, 2011). Hypertension negatively affects military readiness (Department of Defense, 2017). Agent intervention during stressful combat settings could significantly reduce the medical effort required to keep a soldier healthy.
Figure 2. Top medical issues veterans suffer from by race

Although veterans of all races suffer from various medical conditions, not all groups suffer from medical diseases uniformly. In 2013, black soldiers made up 11% of the veteran population, yet they made up 20% of all PTSD cases amongst veterans. Hispanics consisted of 8% of all PTSD cases yet represented 6.3% of all veterans in 2013. The heat-map (figure 3) also reveals differing percentages for medical conditions by race. Accounting for possible biases in healthcare outcomes should be an important consideration for agents – especially as the percentage of minorities in the military increases in the future. Physiological variables (such as stress and hypertension) affect sensor readings and other contextual constructs that create CIA outputs. For example, infrared sensors can detect high blood pressure; so if the soldier has hypertension, the agent can factor that into the context.
Traditionally, the creation of intelligent agents has focused on incorporating autonomous features without contextual intelligence. Not considering contextual intelligence has resulted in robots with sophisticated features (i.e. facial recognition) but with limited practical usage. Despite having advanced autonomous features, military forces “still perceive of robots as RC [remote-control] cars” (Singer et al., 2009). This opinion is not without cause; in many studies, participants who controlled robots under automated navigation exhibited significantly poorer SA than participants who used manual control.
Figure 3. Heat-map of soldiers’ health percentages

 
By presenting this article, we hope to push the narrative of integrating contextual intelligence for military agents. The presented method allocates patterns of context and leads to improved soldiers’ health. The holistic goal is to empower the soldier and increase the safety of military missions that eradicate evil around the world. It is most certain that wars of the future (and WW3) will be fought using AI, but that might also mean that WW4 will be fought using sticks and stones.

You are right – it is already being deployed, but we hope that it gets safer and more ethical.

Read more! via @BoschGlobal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"                   Denner’s view    Share this on:              “We have to not only develop AI, but build trust in AI as well” Dr. Volkmar Denner, Bosch CEO, on the ethics of artificial intelligence                             2020-02-19   It’s time to stop being hysterical about artificial intelligence. We need to focus on its benefits in everyday life. by Dr. Volkmar Denner           Artificial intelligence needs to serve people, not the other way around. Accordingly, it must not be allowed to escape human oversight. How can human and machine intelligence complement each other? The need to provide answers to such questions has prompted Bosch to draw up a code of ethics that examines both the benefits of AI and the ethical red lines it must not cross. It sets out criteria for making decisions about the development and use of intelligent systems. In the AI age, values are especially important: responsibility engenders trust. There is certainly a grain of truth here, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. After all, Europe has strengths that other countries do not — strengths in combining the internet of things with industrial processes, and especially in applying artificial intelligence to manufacturing. It’s high time for Europe to be more self-assertive, and to adopt an innovation policy that plays to our strengths.           “We want to make AI safe, robust, and explainable for people, whether in manufacturing or automated driving.”   Volkmar Denner, Bosch CEO      Share on X/Twitter           AI can move beyond preconceived opinions      Public opinion is still informed by misgivings, or even by dystopian science fiction. In such dystopian visions, AI outstrips human intelligence, cannot be controlled, and costs people their jobs, if not more. The Bosch vision is a different one: we want to make AI safe, robust, and explainable for people, whether in manufacturing or automated driving. What Bosch sees in the world of work is not only technological change but also of a lack of skilled workers — and in such a context, collaboration between people and intelligent machines takes on additional significance. This calls for companies that use customized HR and training policies to strategically shape the digital transformation — companies that invest in both the qualifications of their associates and the intelligence of their machines. Bosch too sees itself as a learning company. Over the next two years, we will be making nearly 20,000 associates fit for the development and use of AI.          AI can mitigate global warming       But the social benefits of AI go beyond everyday routine and the world of work: artificial intelligence will be a blessing for environmental protection and climate action. Even now, the Bosch energy management platform uses intelligent algorithms to detect and control individual machines’ energy consumption. Depending on the individual plant, this can reduce CO₂ by 10 percent within two years. And in the future, we will be able to use artificial intelligence to make long-term forecasts, and thus to reduce energy consumption. All this is reason enough to stop the endless debates about the risks of technology and focus on the opportunities instead.                     The Bosch energy management platform uses intelligent algorithms to detect and control individual machines’ energy consumption.          AI may be responsible for 75 million jobs being lost by 2022, but also for 133 million new jobs being created.   Forecast by World Economic Forum         AI creates markets      At the same time, artificial intelligence has huge economic potential. It is not only Bosch that sees this potential, but many different studies as well. The management consultants PwC, for example, project that between now and 2030, AI will boost GDP in China by 26 percent, by 14 percent in North America, and by around 10 percent in Europe. And according to a World Economic Forum forecast, AI may be responsible for 75 million jobs being lost by 2022, but also for 133 million new jobs being created. If such forecasts are even remotely realistic, they indicate the huge economic relevance of artificial intelligence. But we will only be able to tap this potential if we can convince people of the benefits of AI — and above all build trust in digital systems.          AI needs responsibility                    How can human and artificial intelligence work together?       Companies such as Bosch have to take two paths in order to make a success story out of AI. Developing technological conditions and solutions, and using innovations to open up new field of business, is the one path. The other is to convince society at large of the benefits of AI. It is precisely for this reason that Bosch has drawn up a code of ethics for responsible use of artificial intelligence. We have to not only develop AI, but build trust in AI as well, and the one cannot become established without the other. For success in digital business, trust will be crucial, just as quality is for our classic product business.           AI needs human oversight       As we move toward an ethics of AI, what are the decisive issues? First and foremost, people must not completely renounce control over artificially intelligent systems. Instead, they must remain involved in these systems’ decisions. Take the example of driver assistance, where AI supports and relieves drivers of burdensome tasks. Nonetheless, drivers retain responsibility and can override the system. On no account should the algorithms of AI models be a black box. They should be developed with due care, keeping everyone in the loop. Only in this way will automated decisions be fair, and understandable for experts. When it comes to the ethics of artificial intelligence, Bosch not only gives its own engineers guidance, but is also keen to take part in a open exchange of views. What decisions can we leave to machines? When and where should people intervene? Companies need to openly discuss questions such as these with policymakers, the scientific community, and society.          AI must also be “Invented for life”       In the end, the issue at stake here is the crucial balance that has to be struck between the economic and social strands of entrepreneurial responsibility. At first glance, there appears to be a paradox: we want to develop business with AI, but are defining ethical limits to technological development. Only if we observe these red lines can trust arise, and it is our belief that, in the long run, trust is the lifeblood of our business.  It’s as simple as that. And in our new AI code of ethics, we make no bones about our red lines. For example, we will not allow one life to be pitted against another. The code of ethics doesn’t take the easy way out. Instead, it makes Bosch’s strategic imperative fit for the future, and insists that artificial intelligence also be “Invented for life.”           First published in Handelsblatt on 2020/02/19          Bosch guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence          Code of ethics for AILearn more          Denner’s view Artificial intelligence        Share this on:               Explore more      StoryArtificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence in automated driving   CEO blogDenner’s viewWhere Europe can lead the way in AI   StorySoundSeeImproving life on the International Space Station (ISS)       ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  This article is based on a presentation given by Emerj CEO Daniel Faggella in Geneva, at the 2019 New Shape Forum: Weapons Governance for the Geneva Disarmament Platform. To learn more about Emerj’s AI presentations and speaking, visit our presentations page. There are many more AI applications than there are governments and militaries experimenting with AI. But the AI products that are becoming more commonplace in the business world do have their use in national security and defense efforts.  It will take years to update physical weapons systems, such as tanks, planes, and missiles, with machine learning technology, but there are ways to weaponize artificial intelligence without mounting it on any weapons. The fast-moving world of enterprise AI will be the origin of various dual-use applications that can be repurposed for military use-cases. At Emerj, the AI Research Company, we map the capabilities of AI across security, surveillance, and defense – including dual-use AI applications. In our work with government and enterprise clients, and in presentations for organizations like United Nations and INTERPOL, we emphasize the importance of staying abreast of general AI capabilities that have significant future impacts on security and risk. From computer vision applications in retail to text summarization technology in the legal field – AI’s capabilities are being used as both weapons and defenses. In this article, we break down the dual-use applications of three prominent AI techniques, all of which will be important for weaponizing AI in the future: Computer Vision: Image and video analysis to survey physical space and respond to behavioral patterns Natural Language Processing: Text and voice analysis for real-time translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and information extraction. Programmatically Generated Content: AI-generated 3D representations of people, places, and things. The slide deck for the original presentation is embedded below: We begin our discussion of critical dual-use applications of computer vision: Application 1: Computer Vision  Computer vision is the AI capability to analyze visual information and use it to detect changes in real-time. Computer vision capabilities include pattern detection and image analysis. Retail: Pattern Recognition Brick-and-mortar retail stores use computer vision-enabled security systems for pattern recognition, allowing them to detect shoplifting and other kinds of theft, including instances in which cashiers intentionally fail to scan an item when ringing up a customer. Computer vision applications can alert security teams when it detects a customer putting an item into their bag or coat, for example, allowing them to respond before the customer has left the building. Computer-vision enabled pattern recognition software can be repurposed for surveillance efforts. Governments and militaries could integrate computer vision software into security cameras along building perimeters or on vehicles in order to track the movements of suspicious people and enemy personnel.  Finance: Image Analysis Computer vision software can be trained to detect entities within an image or real-time video. Wealth managers might use computer vision to analyze satellite images of ports and cargo ships out at sea. The US Department of Defense’s Project MAVEN is a prominent example of computer vision in the public sector – but many private sector vision applications could be repurposed for military use. This could give them information on imports and exports, which could lead them to make better decisions about which companies to invest in for their clients. Militaries could repurpose this technology to detect the positions of key targets on a battlefield, as well as the positions of ally and enemy personnel, within satellite images and videos.  Computer vision-enabled analysis could allow militaries conducting reconnaissance missions to predict the movement of enemy vehicles, as well as the munition and fuel levels of those vehicles. Computer vision could also detect the existence of large oil containers within a satellite image, which could give militaries a better view of where they can refuel their vehicles. Healthcare: Image Analysis Similarly, in healthcare, computer vision software is starting to find its niche in diagnostics. Doctors could upload patient CT, PET, and MRI scans to a computer vision-enabled software, and the software could detect if the scans show any evidence of cancer or not. Doctors can then use this analysis in diagnosing a patient with cancer, sometimes well before they would have been able to detect a patient’s cancer had they reviewed the scans on their own. Militaries and governments could use a similar computer vision-based image analysis application to detect landmines within an image or real-time video. Militaries can integrate the software into their existing land mine-detecting robots, allowing them to more accurately find land mines before allowing their personnel to drive or run through a potentially dangerous area.  Application 2: Natural Language Processing Natural language processing (NLP) is a machine learning approach that can discern intent and sentiment from text and speech. Some of the most prominent NLP use-cases are sentiment analysis, search and discovery, summarization, and translation. Translation NLP-enabled translation tools have become ubiquitous across industries at global organizations that need to communicate with clients that speak various languages. Google Translate and similar translation applications allow employees at these companies to speak into a microphone and have their voice translated to text in another language in real-time. Alibaba has a similar application. The demonstration below shows how a supply chain manager might interact with a supplier when both speak different languages:  The most obvious use-case for translation technology in government is in diplomatic meetings. Although translators are still necessary, in the future, diplomats and other government officials may be able to communicate with each other solely through these translation apps, hearing each other’s voices in their native languages. Life Sciences: Summarization Life sciences companies looking to develop new treatments need to read through hundreds of scientific studies to determine where to focus their R&D efforts and to figure out how certain treatments might interact with each other and with different population groups. NLP-enabled summarization software serves to expedite this process by condensing studies into short snippets of information or brief abstracts. This can save researches time they can instead spend on developing and running trials for the treatments they want to test. Governments and militaries can use NLP software to summarize reports on reconnaissance efforts and other intelligence reports. They could also summarize communications between diplomats and other government officials. Pharmaceuticals: Sentiment Analysis Pharmaceutical companies use NLP-based sentiment analysis software to analyze public feedback logged on social media that can inform marketing decisions. Pharmaceutical companies may want to know which of their competitor’s drugs or generics are referenced most frequently alongside their own and how well the public is responding to their drug or pricing. This could inform how marketers at the pharmaceutical company choose to advertise and brand their drug. Similarly, governments may be able to use NLP-based sentiment analysis software to research how the public is responding to their actions by analyzing social media and news articles.  Certain governmental departments may also use sentiment analysis software to analyze the emotions laden within communications between government officials via email, text, and phone. This could better allow government officials to deescalate tense communications if necessary or push the limits of their negotiations.  Finance: Search and Discovery Wealth management firms can use search and discovery products to find all of the files the firm has on a particular customer and search the internet for news about financial markets. For example, a wealth manager could use an NLP-enabled search and discovery software to pull up all of the call center transcripts and emails that a customer has logged with the firm, allowing the wealth manager to better respond to the customer’s concerns and get a better idea of the kinds of investments that might satisfy them. The wealth manager could then use a search and discovery software to learn about acquisitions, mergers, bankruptcies, layoffs, and other events going on in the market. This could allow a wealth manager to make more informed decisions on where to invest a customer’s money. National security agencies could use search and discovery software to extract key information from text, email, and phone communications between potential bad actors, such as known international terrorists and domestic terrorists that may be plotting an attack. They could also run the software on suspicious conversations in the hopes of discovering admissions of criminal activity in order to catch criminals or intervene in the case of potential terrorism. Application 3: Programmatically Generated Content Programmatically generated content refers to computer-generated, realistic 3D representations of people, places, and things. For example, machine learning can generate “paintings” in the style of famous artists. Rembrandt never painted the piece below; an algorithm did: A Rembrandt painting generated entirely by artificial intelligence. It can also compose and arrange its own music; all a human has to do is input a music genre, and the machine learning software generates a track on its own:  Machine learning is currently the most effective technique for generating the kind of realism that has grave national security implications. Deepfakes, which involves replacing the face of one person with that of another within a video or image, is one example of machine learning-created programmatically generated content. In addition to face-swapping, machine learning is capable of generating entirely new faces. None of the people in the photos below are real. They never existed: All of these faces were generated by machine learning on ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com, courtesy of The Verge. Companies that develop machine learning for these generative purposes want to be seen as benevolent or at least ambivalent because of the technology’s potential for harm and power acquisition. Generally, they use a strategy of discouraging use and activity on other platforms while owning a large enough digital ecosystem that current users are incentivized to stay within it. There are numerous precedents for this type of strategy as outlined below: Facebook buying Oculus Rift in order to attract more attention in the virtual reality space Amazon and Google competing over the home assistant market Google and Facebook briefly competing in the social space during the advent of Google+ Both Google and Facebook also competing against Amazon within eCommerce How Countries and Governments may want to use AI A country’s goal with AI is to attain power through the means of a strong economy and military. By fostering a society that is compliant with the ethical concerns of the technology, a country’s government could encourage that society to support the goals of the ruling party. This is most effective in governments where leaders cannot be voted out. Precedents in Countries Outside the US There are numerous instances of countries taking steps to assert dominance in the digital and AI spaces. While we do not attribute these steps to any specific country, these practices indicate attempts to gain or maintain power using data acquisition and other digital methods. These practices and methods include: Countries forming their own independent internet, which can deter dissidents and inculcate society. They have also formed their own VR technology for the same reason.  Countries that are wary of relinquishing control of their virtual ecosystems to other populations have resisted outside hardware and digital ecosystems. Examples of these include 5G signal technology and social media sites like Twitter. Some countries have used digital ecosystems to interfere with the politics and societies of democratic nations with open governments. Governments that use their private virtual ecosystems can sometimes use the major players within that ecosystem as an extension of the ruling party’s will. This could be a national car manufacturer or food distribution company. A government may be able to leverage AI and machine learning to accomplish any of these tasks. The possibilities are much broader for a situation like this than would normally arise in other industries. For example, sentiment analysis may be particularly beneficial for governments looking to gain a strategic advantage in the social media domain. Its ROI in business, however, is less proven, relegated mostly to marketers that may or may not be better off directing their efforts elsewhere. Takeaways for Military Experts We hypothesize that over the course of the 21st century, all competition between the world’s most powerful nations and organizations will become more focused on controlling the computational substrate that houses human experience and AI. These organizations could be political, military, or economic in nature.  This raises concerns about how democratic nations should ethically leverage new AI capabilities. Additionally, these nations should consider how they should set up digital governance and a sense of normalcy for how this type of data acquisition should transpire. In the case of foreign policy, it is important to consider how governments will handle any malicious and abusive use of AI by autocratic states. While these concerns may not be the top priority in 2019, they will become increasingly important within the next decade. AI developers, their clients, and the governments they each answer two should consider these long term issues as they continue to move forward with AI initiatives in their business.

Will AI Replace Radiologists After All?Roxanna Guilford-Blake | February 18, 2020 | Artificial Intelligencetweetprintsharesharemail   YES. NO. MAYBE. IT DEPENDS.Polarizing debate continues to simmer over where artificial intelligence will take radiology. On one side are those who believe AI will—maybe not soon but eventually—render diagnostic radiologists obsolete. On the other are those who see any and all doomsday scenarios as so much science fiction.  To be sure, there’s plenty of middle ground between the two extremes. But don’t all arguments, if followed to their logical ends, lead to one of them as a final landing point? As of early 2020, it’s unlikely a clear debate winner will emerge before some future development makes all points and counterpoints moot. But proponents of both viewpoint categories have much to say that’s worth hearing. Robert Schier, MD, RadNet Northern CaliforniaFor starters, consider the doomsayers. In commentary published in the July 2018 edition of JACR, Robert Schier, MD, a neuroradiologist with RadNet Northern California, described the divide  this way: “There are vastly differing opinions [on AI in radiology], from the apocalyptic claim that AI will make all radiologists extinct to the delusional assertion that computers will always merely assist—and never replace—radiologists. Both extremes are mistaken, but the truth is in the direction of the first. … Unless radiologists do things other than interpret imaging studies, there will be need for far fewer of them.”While he’s not quite predicting a radiological apocalypse, Schier describes himself as an alarmist. (He emphasizes that his opinions do not reflect those of RadNet.) And he does indeed believe that the end is coming. “My guess is that in 10 to 20 years, most imaging studies will be read only by machine,” he tells RBJ. “The results will be transmitted directly to the referring physician without input from a human radiologist.” This arrangement will produce faster, better and more accurate diagnostics, Schier believes. And everyone will receive equally excellent diagnostic care. “There will be no difference,” he says, “between an exceptional radiologist and a mediocre one.”What’s good for patients will be traumatic for the practice of medicine—and, as AI expands, perhaps for all of humanity, Schier says. But that’s a different article for a different day. Shreyas Vasanawala, MD, PhD, Stanford Medicine By contrast, Shreyas Vasanawala, MD, PhD, professor of radiology at Stanford, remains optimistic, seeing AI as assistive, not at all adversarial. He agrees AI will change the way radiologists practice, butAI allows radiologists to pull information that would otherwise be left on the table, Vasanawala explains. “AI enhances the value of medical imaging,” he says, “which is great for patients as well as the field of radiology.”Resistance Can Cost Technological advances have always raised concerns among the potentially affected. Vasanawala points to the fussing and fretting that accompanied the field’s migration from films on lightboxes to images on screens. Having experienced the efficiencies of PACS, “no one is hoping to go back to film,” he notes. Falgun Chokshi, MD, MBA, a neuroradiologist formerly with Emory University who’s now on his own as a speaker and advisor, sees AI as another notable milestone on that timeline. “As with all technologies that have been introduced into our practice, from cross-sectional modalities and PACS to voice dictation-based reporting, those radiologists who have adapted and integrated the technology have fared much better than their more obstinate counterparts,” Chokshi says. Falgun Chokshi, MD, MBA, independent speaker and advisorSince AI technology is inherently neither good nor bad, he adds, many negative reactions to it are misdirected.“Its eventual uses, direct consequences and collateral effects are all based on how humans use it,” he says.The question is how the human/computer collaboration will play out. And only time can supply an answer.Known UnknownsNobody really knows what AI is capable of, Maciej Mazurowski, PhD, of Duke points out. “I think a significant disruption is a real possibility,” he tells RBJ. “However, many things have to align for this to happen.”For one thing, AI needs to perform at the level of a radiologist for a broad range of tasks. “I believe there are signals showing that this is possible,” he says. “However, we don’t know yet if that is true due to a still limited clinical validation of algorithms.”In an opinion piece published in the August 2019 JACR, Mazurowski staked out a spot in the aforementioned middle ground, suggesting AI could well displace more than a few radiologists. Maciej Mazurowski, PhD, Duke Health “[S]uch disruption is a real possibility,” he writes. “Although the radiology specialty has shown an astonishing ability to adapt to the changing technology, the future is uncertain, and an honest, in-depth discussion is needed to guide development of the field.”The radiology specialty “was born of technology and has grown around technology,” Mazurowski continues. “It has shown the ability to evolve. It is possible that AI will transform radiology into a substantially altered specialty in which a human specialist will still play an important role.” Permanently In Pointing to the mass of scientific literature published to date, Chokshi forecasts AI will increasingly focus on classification and rudimentary prediction of abnormal findings in medical images. But that doesn’t mean diagnostic radiologists will completely stop tackling those tasks themselves. Human readers “use multiple levels of nuanced perception and interpretation of images that the machines have not been able to rival to date,” Choksi says. “I believe—and some studies have shown this—that human-machine assistive hybrid teams are better for specific findings than just machines.”Vasanawala’s Stanford colleague, Curtis Langlotz, MD, PhD, has consistently insisted that radiologists’ role is eminently augmentable but will never be replaceable. At conferences he’s often noted that very few airline passengers would ever board a plane with no human pilot even though autopilot technology already handles upwards of 90% of every flight. And in commentary published in 2019 by Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, Langlotz makes this compelling point: “We often compare AI algorithms to radiology experts based on the ability to identify a single disease or a small set of diseases. But that oversimplifies things. A radiologist may be looking for numerous conditions and … anything else suspicious that might show up in a patient’s test results. That requires a human.”Eventually Out Shier, the alarmist, also sees AI as assistive—in the short term.He’s certainly correct that AI systems are constantly getting smarter and faster, steadily approaching a point at which their rewards may yet outweigh their risks. “It may help to imagine these systems not as a collection of circuits in a console but as an army of fellowship-trained radiologists with photographic memories, IQs of 500 and no need for food or sleep,” Shier writes in his JACR essay. AI will initially make radiologists more accurate and efficient, he explains to RBJ. Then AI systems will take over the reading of certain simple cases, expanding the range and complexity of cases they interpret on their own. Whether it takes another 20 years or 50, the day will arrive when machines “won’t need us,” Schier says. “The evidence that computers will become better than humans in interpreting all imaging studies and in reporting those interpretations to other physicians is, in my view, convincing.” He sees no fundamental physical or theoretical reason why computers won’t be able to do radiologists’ jobs faster, better and cheaper than humans.“I think the profession of radiology, as described by physicians who interpret diagnostic images, is going to be mostly gone at some point,” Schier adds. “Radiologists, if they exist, will have to do something else.” What about the argument that AI will open the field to new screenings and diagnostic tests currently based in non-imaging protocols? “Perhaps it will,” Schier allows. “But what role will radiologists play? It may expand the field of diagnostic imaging and at the same time contract the field of diagnostic imagers.”On the bright side of Schier’s vision, humans and machines together will continue to be better than humans or machines alone—for a few more decades or years, anyway. Tireless Assistant If Schier is overly alarmist, and humans remain in the picture throughout the lifetime of rads working in 2020, what will these human-machine assistive hybrid teams look like?Vasanawala surely speaks for many when he answers that AI will allow radiologists to work at the top of their license and to “focus on the most value-added and rewarding parts of the job.”At present, radiologists don’t have enough time in the day to get through all items on their clinical worklists—or, at least, with minimal distractions drawing eyes from images. AI can help carve out time for clinical concentration by automating dictation and report editing, gathering clinical histories, finding relevant prior imaging, making careful measurements of lesions and correlating current lesions with those from multiple prior studies. Radiologists can then increase their level of attention to detail on the complex cases, integrate the full clinical story and look up the relevant literature, Vasanawala says. They can spend more time diagnosing diseases, preparing for and participating in multidisciplinary team conferences and consultations with patients.  Beyond Reads Current discussions of AI largely focus on automated interpretation of images, such as chest x-rays. But there also are opportunities for using AI to optimize practices’ fiscal performance.Radiology practices, like other businesses, have many moving parts—intersecting workflows, bottlenecks, key performance indicators and significant resource and financial allocation and uses. “AI can help optimize many aspects of the radiology business as long as the users are cognizant of the technol-ogies’ limitations and capacities,” Chokshi notes. He adds, however, that, like any technology, “AI is only as good as its intended use.”Vasanawala, too, stresses “upstream” benefits of AI. He rattles off a handful of these: improved patient scheduling and protocoling of exams, better management of radiation dose and reconstruction of higher quality images, prioritization of studies to read and automated extraction of quantitative information imaging that is currently too time-consuming to perform routinely. “AI will enhance the value of radiology in healthcare, but the entire medical imaging department—schedulers, technologists, nurses, administrators—needs to embrace it,” Vasanawala says. Some of this is already happening “under the hood” in ways that aren’t always evident. And new areas are emerging. One of these is automated segmentation, Vasanawala points out. For example, in cardiac imaging, fully automated, highly accurate segmentation of ventricles is leading to greater radiologist efficiency. And with that is coming greater reproducibility of quantitative results. Aligned Interests Evaluating AI’s most exciting opportunities and most daunting threats, Chokshi says, comes down to asking two questions: Does the technology help improve patient care? And does it “help maintain our own sanity and mitigate burnout?” He’s wary about all the promises being made on AI’s behalf around efficiency and productivity. “I hear a lot of talk about using AI to make radiologists faster and more efficient,” Chokshi says. “I would be very cautious about such dubious notions of what AI should be doing for us.” A better opportunity, he says, is using AI to become more specific about interpretation, triage acute findings and decrease the variability of reads for different kinds of studies.“The goal should be alignment of better patient care with better radiologist care,” Chokshi say. “The threat of AI is not the technology itself. It’s using it to squeeze in more work with diminishing long-term rewards.” Misaligned Incentives Regardless of one’s position—pessimist, optimist or somewhere in between—radiologists must come together to address the relevant issues even more than they have already. That seems to be a widely held opinion, based on the literature and the interviews conducted for this report.The need for profession-wide cooperation around AI has been coming to the fore as the topic gets attention at regional, national and international conferences. As a result of the presentations, exhibits and discussions, Vasanawala, points out, viewpoints are evolving rapidly.Schier suggests there’s no time like the present to build on the momentum. He hopes one of the major academic journals serving radiology will devote a full issue to radiology thought leaders reasoning together on the question “Will intelligent computers ever replace radiologists?”  (He fleshes out his own opinion here.)But it’s not just radiologists who need to come to the table. Rads will evolve and adapt to AI being integrated into workflows and practice settings, Chokshi says, while developers, researchers and regulators work with radiologists to tap AI for streamlining workflows and optimizing outcomes. Mazurowski calls on radiologists to collaborate with AI developers in industry on ensuring that priority No. 1 remains improving patient care while holding the line on costs.And that’s not just a technology challenge, he warns. The best-case future scenario for patients is having AI interpret medical images with the highest possible accuracy and the lowest possible turnaround times—all for the lowest possible price. However, Mazurowski says, even if AI proves capable of superhuman performance across a broad spectrum of radiology tasks, that vision may not come to fruition. “One of the most challenging hurdles with implementation of imaging AI in clinical practice in the U.S. will be the complex and suboptimal structure of the healthcare system,” he says. “The incentives in the system are often misaligned with the interests of the patient.”Here to Stay Now is the time to figure out how to align systemic incentives with patient interests, the experts agree. “As with any new technology, there’s a period where the technology becomes better understood and refined, leading to a progressive uptake in that technology,” Vasanawala says.  Langlotz contends that the only radiologists who should worry about losing their jobs to AI are those who don’t use AI. (He makes his full case in a piece published online last May in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence titled “Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Radiologists?”)Meanwhile Schier exhorts radiologists to embrace AI as readily as they can. “It will make your reading of studies faster, more accurate and less stressful,” he says. “You will provide better patient care, be more valuable and do a better job.”It’s reasonable to expect those benefits to continue building for the next 10 to 15 years, he says. “Embrace AI because it will be good for your patients,” Schier concludes. “Embrace AI because it will make you a better, more efficient and happier radiologist. Embrace AI because if you don’t, you will be replaced by radiologists who do. Embrace AI because, even if you refuse to embrace AI, you will nevertheless be embraced by it.”That series of imperatives may not settle the debate over radiology’s eventual fate at the hands of AI, but the soundness of its wisdom would be hard to argue against. Roxanna Guilford-BlakeRelated ContentRayus Radiology launches whole-body MRI service in Seattle, SimonMed expands, RadNet touts legislation, plus more company newsACR opens doors of AI quality-assurance center AI critical care software revolutionizes emergency responseStrategic Radiology signs on with Qure.ai ASNC supports AMA effort to limit use of AI in prior authorization decisionsAmerican College of Radiology asks CMS to create new alternative payment pathway for high-value AI",,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Wait.

Businesses turning to AI for job interviews 











Businesses turning to AI for job interviews

If you're on the hunt for a new job, there's a new twist to the hiring process that's increasingly common: Getting judged by artificial intelligence. Major businesses like Unilever and Ikea are turning to AI programs to sniff out suitable applicants — and predict future job performance — partly as a way to cut down on the time needed to hire employees. Supporters say the tech can help companies find better job candidates and eliminate some of the inherent bias that executives may not even be aware of, such as leaning toward candidates who are white or male. 






But critics say there are issues with relying on algorithms to make complex decisions. One Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, is questioning whether AI can accurately predict job success, calling such claims ""snake oil."" And Electronic Privacy Information Center counsel John Davisson calls the AI programs are a ""nightmarish combination of privacy violations and outcomes that aren't based on any easily understood criteria."" His group earlier this month petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to start regulating AI's use in the job market and other business applications.


At stake are the roughly 7 million job openings that employers seek to fill each month. Traditional gatekeepers such as human resources professionals are increasingly turning to AI to review resumes — no small task when employment site Glassdoor says the average job opening receives about 250 resumes. Some are also relying on AI programs to score applicants' video interviews, with the goal of skimming the cream from the top.

Some companies say they see results, with one case study from Unilever finding that an AI analysis from a company called HireVue saved the company $1 million by cutting down on the time needed to sort through 250,000 applications. Relying on AI to cull the applicant pool also helped diversify new hires by 16%, it found. Yet the lack of transparency about the inner workings of these AI applications, as well as the vast amount of data they collect, are raising concerns among lawmakers and privacy experts. Of particular concern — that these programs could unfairly evaluate certain types of applicants, such as minorities and women.""It's like anything else — wine, music and food. Some of it is really good and some of it is really bad,"" said Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief talent scientist at staffing and recruitment company ManpowerGroup, which is also an adviser to HireVue. ""The big challenge and question of AI in the world of talent is: Will algorithms be better at knowing us than we do ourselves?""


Gaining traction in workplaceSo far, there appears to be more questions than answers, even as the technology gains traction in the workplace. While there's no federal government tracking or oversight of AI, surveys of human resource executives provide insight into AI's usage in the job market. Almost 7 in 10 recruiters and hiring managers told LinkedIn in 2018 that AI applications help them save time, according to a survey of 8,800 executives, while about 4 in 10 said AI tools help guard against bias in the hiring process. And employment site Glassdoor says it's increasingly likely that job candidates will encounter AI when they search for work today. It's a growing field with dozens of companies offering different AI flavors to businesses. It's also attracting venture capital, with hundreds of millions of investments plugged into firms such as HireVue, Pymetrics and Mya, according to CrunchBase.How it worksSome job applicants might not even realize they've been given the once-over by artificial intelligence. At the most basic level, AI programs analyze resumes and job applications to screen candidates, winnowing the field to top candidates. Other AI programs are more interactive, although some applicants still might not know they're dealing with an algorithm. Consignment shop ThredUp, for example, uses an AI program to text job candidates to schedule job interviews, according to Glassdoor. Other companies ask candidates to play online games, including one exercise that asks applicants to click on objects that are red balls. The data are then fed through an AI program that analyzes responses to assess a candidate's abilities. The AI program that's sparking perhaps the most concern is the video interview, where candidates are taped as they respond to recruitment questions posed via webcam. An AI tool then examines the video, analyzing everything from facial gestures to vocabulary, to determine whether the candidate is a good fit.

HireVue, one of the biggest companies in the field, said its AI assessment is partially based on data from companies' top performers: By analyzing vocabulary used by top workers, for instance, the AI program can pick out candidates whose word choices and expressions best match those high performers. It also relies on years of research into industrial and organizational psychology, which focuses on how people behave within organizations.


""We are judging the answers that the interviewee is giving,"" said Kevin Parker, CEO of HireVue. ""In a 20-minute interview, we can collect a lot of data. We have no idea who the candidate is, but we can collect a lot of data about vocal variation, personal pronouns"" and other information to make an assessment, he added. Parker said HireVue's AI programs are screened for bias, which helps level the playing field for job applicants. The AI models tend to be most effective for jobs where there's a lot of data to draw from, he added.In other words, AI isn't designed to find the best CEO — since C-suite executives are relatively uncommon in the workforce — but for rank-and-file workers like salespeople. Is it accurate?Companies in the AI space say their programs save time by weeding out low-quality applicants and singling out the best potential hires. But artificial intelligence has its limits — and probably isn't more accurate at predicting job performance than tried-and-true methods, according to Princeton's Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science. Narayanan points to an academic study that relied on family data to predict future outcomes in a number of areas, such as a child's likely academic performance and future material hardship. But the study's AI analysis failed to outperform old-fashioned linear regression in predicting future struggles or successes, he said. While AI can prove useful for simpler perception-based tasks, such as speech-to-text translation or identifying plagiarized material, it ""can't predict social outcomes,"" Narayanan concluded. At the same time, he warned, AI creates risks by transferring massive amounts of personal data to tech firms and placing a greater reliance on applications that lack transparency. 
Academic scholars writing about AI screening have taken the companies' bait and focus on ""bias"". But a random number generator that doesn't have disparate impact is still a random number generator—arbitrary, unaccountable, and demeaning to candidates. No semblance of due process.— Arvind Narayanan (@random_walker) November 15, 2019

Those concerns are echoed by EPIC, which in November asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue. It claims HireVue's algorithms are ""opaque"" and that its ""secret analysis of biometric data thus causes substantial privacy harms to job candidates.""


The FTC told CBS MoneyWatch it had received both the letter and the petition, but declined additional comment. HireVue said it believes the complaint is without merit. ""The company upholds the highest levels of rigor and ethics as its employees work every day to increase fairness and objectivity in the hiring process,"" it told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Disappointed""HireVue CEO Parker said he was ""disappointed"" with Narayanan's assessment, and said his company reached out to him to discuss his concerns but was ""rebuffed.""Asked whether he rebuffed HireVue's overture, Narayanan forwarded his email exchange with the company to CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of a private discussion, he wrote, he urged HireVue to publish its research, ""ideally in a peer-reviewed forum, and discuss it openly."" He added in the email, ""I'm not sure a private conversation is the best medium. There's a high level of public interest in AI bias since the issue affects everyone.""In a statement, HireVue said it ""was surprised that Dr. Narayanan would not welcome the opportunity for a one-on-one discussion on the facts and established science supporting HireVue's approach to assessments and AI before making public claims about efficacy and validity.""






Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence
12:54

The issue of AI in hiring is gaining more attention from lawmakers. In January, a new Illinois law went into effect that requires companies to disclose that artificial intelligence will be used to assess candidates' video interviews. Employers also must explain how the AI tool works, ask for consent from the job candidate, and destroy the video and any copies within 30 days if a job applicant requests it.Illinois State Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr., who sponsored the bill, told the Chicago Tribune last month: ""The technology hasn't been vetted fully yet. There are some concerns regarding bias. [The software] is only as good as the data it is given.""


Is it really less biased?HireVue and other hiring experts say AI has the potential to be less biased than human interviewers. Algorithms can strip out gender, race or any other protected group when analyzing candidates. Yet when algorithms go wrong, they can go very wrong, such as in the case of Amazon's recruitment engine. In that now-infamous instance, Amazon scrapped the AI application in 2018 after realizing that the program was excluding women applicants from the pool because the model was based on 10 years of data from job applicants, who tended to be men. In other words, the AI ""learned"" the biased view that men were a better fit than women, reinforcing gender stereotypes in tech. ""Even if it doesn't look at sensitive attributes, like names that can be a proxy for gender, programs can pick up on this unknowingly,"" said Glen Cathey, senior vice president and head of digital strategy and innovation at Randstad, a recruitment agency.  ""Being responsible and ethical in AI, not just in recruitment, is the measurement element.""EEOC standardCompanies that rely on AI need to measure and test for bias, and that's something HireVue studies closely, said Lindsey Anderson Zuloaga, director of data science at the company. ""Whatever biases it has, it could affect a lot of people — and that's true of who gets credit, who gets parole,"" she said, referring to other fields where AI has been used to make determinations. ""In any pre-hire assessments, you need to look at how different demographic groups are being scored, and if there are differences that may be evidence of adverse impact.""






Racial Profiling 2.0
23:22

HireVue screens for results where any group, such as different genders or races, score less than 80% of the top-scoring group, which is a yardstick for bias used by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. For example, that would happen if an AI program singles out 50 men as solid candidates, but only 30 women. ""We're lucky in this space in that our notion of what is fair is defined by law,"" Zuloaga said. ""We build the model, then we train the algorithm, then look at how is it scoring people within the group.""


Hacks for AI?Job applicants are perhaps justifiably nervous about facing an AI in a job interview, which can be nerve-wracking even with other humans. It's no surprise that YouTube tutorials have sprung up to help job candidates learn how to ace pre-recorded interviews by HireVue and others. The tips include how to set up your webcam, how to look good on the video and how to keep cool under pressure — not exactly different advice than what a job hunter would hear about an interview with a real person. In the end, there may be no secret sauce for acing an AI interview, partly because the algorithm is a black box. Even so, human judgment is typically involved in the hiring process after AI programs have screened for the best candidates, HireVue's Parker said. ""We're the first step in a process — the next step is an in-person interview,"" he added. ""It's our desire that there is always a human involved.""

Executives are bullish on the potential of artificial intelligence to improve healthcare. But they say adoption is not happening quickly enough due to a lack of workforce training, high costs, and privacy risks, according to a survey by audit, tax, and advisory services firm KPMG.KPMG's survey of healthcare leaders was part of a larger study of how executives across five industries view the future of AI in their sectors, and the steps they are taking to maximize its benefits and mitigate its challenges.""The pace with which hospital systems have adopted AI and automation programs has dramatically increased since 2017. Virtually all major healthcare providers are moving ahead with pilots or programs in these areas. The medical literature is showing support of AI’s power as a tool to help clinicians,"" Melissa Edwards, managing director, digital enablement, KPMG, said in the report.An overwhelming majority of healthcare respondents (89%) think AI is already creating efficiencies in their systems, and 91% believe it is increasing patient access to care.RELATED: Study: Google AI can outdo the experts in finding breast cancerMany of the AI-related services and solutions being advanced in healthcare today are largely in the clinical, patient-facing space.""Basic forms of automation are proving to be the ‘gateway drug’ to advanced forms of AI—such as scanning documents to determine the urgency of a referral. Applying AI to make earlier diagnoses of critical illnesses is a key area,"" Edwards said.Nine out of 10 healthcare executives are confident that AI will improve the patient experience with the greatest impacts being found on diagnostics, electronic records management and incorporating robotics into tasks.  More than two-thirds of healthcare stakeholders (68%) are confident AI will eventually be effective in diagnosing patient illnesses and conditions, and close to half (47%) believe that diagnostics will have a significant impact soon—within the next two years.  Healthcare executives also anticipate gains in process automation, with 40% seeing X-rays and CT scans being handled robotically.RELATED: Investors poured $4B into healthcare AI startups in 2019Recent findings indicate that function may be close to reality. Google Health reported that an AI model developed and deployed by its DeepMind subsidiary was more effective in screening patients for breast cancer than human doctors using recent X-rays only, despite having access to patients’ previous records.But the pace of progress is too slow, according to one-third of executives, citing barriers such as a lack of workforce talent and the high cost of implementing AI tools.To date, only 44% of healthcare insiders say their employees are prepared for AI adoption, which is substantially lower than some of the other industries surveyed. Less than half of healthcare organizations (47%) offer AI training courses to employees.Just 67% of healthcare insiders say their employees support AI adoption, the lowest ranking of any industry, according to KPMG.Many healthcare institutions lack a breadth of individuals who “speak” the language of AI, Edwards said.""Comprehending the full range of AI technology, and how best to apply it in a healthcare setting, is a learned skill that grows out of pilots and tests. Building an AI-ready workforce requires a wholesale change in the approach to training and how to acquire talent. Having people who understand how AI can solve big, complex problems is critical,"" she said.RELATED: Microsoft launches $40M AI for Health program to accelerate medical researchHealth systems have already made significant capital investments to meet electronic health records (EHR) requirements. To get AI off the ground requires even more of an investment, and, as a result, some health systems are slower to allocate full funding for AI.More than half of executives (54%) believe that AI to date has actually increased rather than decreased the overall cost of healthcare. Decision-makers are struggling to determine where to place their AI best bets.""The question is, ‘Where do I put my AI efforts to get the greatest gain for the business?' Trying to assess what ROI will look like is a very relevant point as they embark on their AI journey,"" Edwards said.Healthcare executives also are concerned that AI could threaten the security and privacy of patient data. Relatedly, 86% say their organizations are taking care to protect patient privacy as it implements AI.

Left to right: N.C. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson during a press conference Tuesday, Feb. 18, when they announced NC State will receive a $6 million grant to prepare 5,000 new artificial intelligence (AI) professionals for North Carolina and beyond.



A new four-year, $6 million project led by North Carolina State University and funded by the U.S. Department of Labor will support 5,000 workers with training, college coursework and certification to work in the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI).
Carla C. Johnson
U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia announced the project today alongside NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson during an event held at NC State’s Hunt Library on Centennial Campus. The grant is one of the labor department’s 28 public-private apprenticeship partnerships totaling nearly $100 million. The grants will support large-scale expansions of apprenticeships in industries including advanced manufacturing, healthcare and information technology.
“This project really exemplifies NC State’s ‘Think and Do’ mentality,” Woodson said. “This grant will fuel collaboration between industry and education, create new on-the-job training for students and play an important role in workforce development in a burgeoning field in North Carolina and across the nation.”
Carla C. Johnson, professor of science education at NC State, is the principal investigator of the project “Artificial Intelligence Academy (AIA): North Carolina Apprenticeships for Innovation.” The project aims to assist current information technology employees in North Carolina as well as across the U.S. who are underemployed or are seeking an opportunity to move into a different career. It will also target underrepresented workers and those from military populations.
“The greatest strength of our AIA project is the exceptional industry partnerships we have formed,” Johnson said. “Our consortium will lead and inform the important work of building a pipeline of highly qualified and well prepared AI talent for North Carolina and beyond.”
Johnson also serves as the co-principal investigator for another U.S. Dept. of Labor grant, announced last July, for cybersecurity apprenticeships in partnership with Purdue University.
“Apprenticeship: Closing the Skills Gap grants are a major investment to support the expansion of apprenticeships that lead to good paying careers and make the American workforce even stronger,” Scalia said. “Across America, I hear about the need for more skilled American workers. This funding will bolster America’s competitiveness by adding more skilled workers to fill millions of open jobs today and in the future.”
The AIA program will have multiple pathways and will prepare participants for AI careers that are in high demand nationwide. It will include two levels of training and associated certifications: Basic AI (artificial intelligence and data mining focus) and Advanced AI (machine learning and analytics focus). Apprentices will complete the entire program in one year. Industry partners will pay apprentices for at least part-time work during the program and will also pay apprentice tuition and fees for the AI credential program. Companies will benefit from additional workers in their organizations and will have the option to hire the apprentice upon completion of program.
The project will include partners from a variety of sectors. Industry partners include IBM, CISCO, Citrix, Pentair, Hazardous Software, Diveplane, Randstad Technologies, Battelle Memorial Institute and MCNC. Educational partners include N.C. Community Colleges/Apprenticeship NC, Purdue Global, MACUL and Metriks Amerique. Veterans and other recruitment-related affiliated agencies involved in the project include FASTPORT, VetsinTech, Warrior Maven, Paradigm Shift, Monster Jobs, Dice, Industrial Internet Consortium, Crosby Communications and Clearance Jobs. The NC Chamber will serve as a workforce development partner on the project.

No matter what industry you work in, you’ve probably heard that artificial intelligence is coming for your job. Factory workers, news reporters, even stock brokers have all seen A.I. move into their fields, automating some of their roles. Proponents of automation point out that it tackles the menial, repetitive tasks, freeing workers to focus on more creative aspects.

As the company puts it in its press release, “There is a specter haunting the future of work in the form of A.I. and automation enabling machines to displace people’s jobs.”
Rather than offer Andrew Yang-esque worries about the future of work, Fiverr takes an optimistic view. “The future of work is one where A.I. supports more people, to create more with less effort,” CEO Micha Kaufman explains in a statement.
The tool begins with a collection of assets made by Fiverr “community members,” the uses A.I. to quickly select and customize logos tailored to the mood of a specific business. How well does it work in practice? We spent some time playing around with it to create a “new” logo for Digital Trends.
All the logos you need in two shakes of a lamb’s tail
To start, you provide your company’s name and slogan (we took some liberties with the latter for this exercise). You then provide some industries you work in, and any keywords that can help the A.I. narrow down your business model. After that, you’ll see sliders for concepts like Fun/Serious or Simple/Sophisticated. Tune these to your liking and you’re off to the races.
The Logo Maker will spit out a selection of logos, and you can then customize them manually. In our first attempt, we went light on the keywords, and the results, to this writer’s eyes, ranged from decent to incredibly dull (one of the best had a color palette eerily evocative of The Verge, as if we’d skinned their visage and fashioned it into an ill-fitting mask). There was even a knockoff Pokéball!

The experts weigh in
Seeking expert opinions, we decided to consult the graphic designers in our office to see what they think.
First impressions? “Passable, if a bit generic, and the typefaces are pretty uninspiring,” said Digital Trends Content Specialist Chris DeGraw, adding that it’s a “good place to start, though. And hey, I’ve seen many businesses with much much worse in the real world.”

They look “like clean, modern logos, but they aren’t very company-specific and feel a bit disconnected/generic,” said Content Manager Genevieve Poblano. “Still decent but lacking that custom fit. But like I said, if you want something quick and generic or a template to base your stuff off of, this works.”
“If you want something quick and generic or a template to base your stuff off of, this works.”

Senior Designer Will Hawkins said the design reminded him of clip art in terms of “the overall inconsistency. [There are] varying line weights in the illustrations, the illustration style doesn’t necessarily match the fonts being used, and they are all so generic that they become ambiguous, which is why they can’t vary from brand to brand.”
Adding to this, Poblano referenced the logos’ “lack of soul.” [Note: She actually used Slack’s Giphy function to post a GIF for the phrase “lack of soul.”] “I think if you want something quick and generic, this might work. I would be curious to see what it does with a different industry like a restaurant.”
All around me are familiar logos
After consulting Digital Trends’ design oracles, we ventured once more into Fiverr’s underworld of bland but serviceable designs. We decided to test it out with some fake companies from various industries.

Our fake ad firm Mad Men at Work got some interesting designs (including some sort of eldritch octopus), but we noticed some repetitive themes. There was some overlap with the fake Digital Trends logos, with some even using the same colors.
The generic quality became even more apparent when we ran a search for our new sci-fi themed, royalty-free sandwich shop, The Sandolorian. Despite only using “sandwich” and “sandwiches” for tags, we got logos promising a variety of dishes including shrimp, noodles, and pizza. Most inexplicable was the nightmare octopus from our ad agency, this time with creepy, pupil-less eyes.

For now, at least, the graphic designers of the world can relax. Like all artistic pursuits, graphic design rewards a personal, creative touch that Fiverr’s tool isn’t yet ready to offer, although the app “also provides buyers the option to work with the designer who created the original logo template on any special enhancements that can’t be modified through the A.I.”
It’s possible that a tool like this will one day surpass human artists, but until then, The Sandolorian will take its business elsewhere.

As a result of recent improvements in machine learning, the dreary work that was once done by people, filtering through apparently unlimited amounts of information searching for threat indicators and anomalies would now be able to be automated. Present day AI's ability to understand threats, risks and relationships enable it to sift through a generous amount of the noise burdening cybersecurity divisions and surface just the pointers destined to be legitimate..Indeed, even as AI innovation changes some aspects of cybersecurity, the crossing point of the two remains significantly human. In spite of the fact that it's maybe unreasonable, humans are upfront in all pieces of the cybersecurity triad: the terrible actors who look to do hurt, the gullible soft targets, and the great on-screen characters who retaliate..Indeed, even without the approaching phantom of AI, the cybersecurity war zone is frequently hazy to average users and the technologically savvy alike. Including a layer of AI, which contains various innovations that can likewise feel unexplainable to many people, may appear to be doubly unmanageable as well as indifferent. That is on the grounds that in spite of the fact that the cybersecurity battle is once in a while profoundly personal, it's once in a while pursued face to face..With an expected 3.5 million cybersecurity positions expected to go unfilled by 2021 and with security ruptures increasing some 80% every year, infusing human knowledge with AI and machine learning tools gets critical to shutting the talent availability gap..That is one of the recommendations of a report called Trust at Scale, as of late released by cybersecurity organization Synack and citing job and breach data from Cybersecurity Ventures and Verizon reports, individually. Indeed, when ethical human hackers were upheld by AI and machine learning, they became 73% increasingly proficient at identifying and evaluating IT risks and threats..The advantages of this are twofold: Threats never again slip through the cracks because of fatigue or boredom, and cybersecurity experts are liberated to accomplish more strategic tasks, for example, remediation. Artificial intelligence can likewise be utilized to increase perceivability over the network. It can examine phishing by simulating clicks on email links and analyzing word choice and grammar. It can monitor network communications for endeavored installation of malware, command and control communications, and the presence of suspicious packets. What's more, it's changed virus detection from an exclusively signature-based framework which was entangled by issues with reaction time, proficiency, and storage requirements to the period of behavioral analysis, which can distinguish signatureless malware, zero-day exploits, and previously unidentified threats..In any case, while the conceivable outcomes with AI appear to be unfathomable, the possibility that they could wipe out the role of people in cybersecurity divisions is about as unrealistic as the possibility of a phalanx of Baymaxes supplanting the nation's doctors. While the ultimate objective of AI is to simulate human functions, for example, problem-solving, learning, planning, and intuition, there will consistently be things that AI can't deal with (yet), as well as things AI should not handle..The principal classification incorporates things like creativity, which can't be viably instructed or customized, and therefore will require the guiding hand of a human. Anticipating that AI should viably and reliably decide the context of an attack may likewise be an unconquerable ask, at any rate for the time being, just like the idea that AI could make new solutions for security issues. At the end of the day, while AI can unquestionably add speed and exactness to tasks generally handled by people, it is poor at extending the scope of such tasks..As it were, AI's impact on the field of cybersecurity is the same as its effect on different disciplines, in that individuals frequently terribly overestimate what AI can do. They don't comprehend that AI often works best when it has a restricted application, similar to anomaly detection, versus a broader one, like engineering a solution to a threat. In contrast to people, AI needs inventiveness. It isn't inventive. It isn't cunning. It regularly neglects to consider context and memory, leaving it incapable to decipher occasions like a human mind does..In a meeting with VentureBeat, LogicHub CEO and cofounder Kumar Saurabh showed the requirement for human analysts with a kind of John Henry test for automated threat detection. &quot;A few years ago, we did an examination,&quot; he said. This included arranging a specific amount of information, a trifling sum for an AI model to filter through, yet a sensibly huge sum for a human analyst to perceive how teams utilizing automated frameworks would pass against people in threat detection..The eventual fate of cybersecurity will be loaded with threats we can't consider today. Yet, with vigilance and hard work, the blend of man and machine can do what neither can do alone, structure an integral team equipped for upholding order and fighting the forces of evil..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

A paper published Jan. 1 in Nature suggests this day will come sooner than many of us thought. The article, “International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening,” authored by Google machine learning engineer Scott Mayer McKinney and colleagues, describes an AI system able to interpret screening mammograms more accurately than radiologists. (It’s probably no accident that this article was published online on the first day of a new decade.)Until now, AI has outperformed radiologists only in limited aspects of a larger imaging study—counting and measuring lung nodules on CT, for example, or detecting pneumothoraxes on chest X-rays. But the system described in Nature is a major advancement: It’s the first system able to interpret an entire type of study better than radiologists. The appearance of this system marks the beginning of the end of the practice of diagnostic radiology.Intelligent EnoughA machine able to interpret diagnostic imaging studies better than radiologists has long been foreseen, yet its arrival comes almost as a surprise. We have underestimated the potential of AI to perform the kinds of work we do. We continue to overestimate the amount of control we as radiologists will have over either the development of AI or the application of that technology to radiology. We’ve underestimated the potential of AI for perfectly good reasons. Our experience with the AI of 20 years ago—awkward, error-filled systems that often made radiologists’ work harder rather than easier and didn’t improve the quality of reports—was discouraging. And the term artificial made it easy to believe that the intelligence produced by machines always would be a somehow false and inferior kind of intelligence. This was a mistaken assumption. Just as in physics power is a measure of the ability to perform work, so intelligence, in cognitive science, is a measure of the ability to solve problems. Machines can be built to produce both. We are not talking here about machines becoming human. We’re talking about machines with the intelligence to solve the kinds of imaging puzzles radiologists face every day. Qualified for Our Jobs? The first commercial steam engine in 1698 sat on a platform and slowly pumped water out of a mine. Who at that time could have imagined that the descendants of that immobile machine would haul freight cross-country or fly from New York to London? Similarly, anyone who had to deal with early mammographic CAD might find it hard to believe that computers would eventually perform the varied and complex work of diagnostic imaging—analyzing images, comparing studies across modalities and time, correlating patient records and lab values, and producing clear and definitive reports. Yet these are all tasks at which computers are beginning to excel. Cognitive and computer scientists are in broad agreement on the forecast that, as machines became stronger than we are, machines will become more intelligent than we are.Radiologists are not controlling the development of artificial intelligence. Most of this work is being done by government and business. We can modify these AI systems to help us in specific tasks, but we are generally not creating the underlying hardware and software any more than farmers 100 years ago built the tractors that replaced their horses and oxen. And we will not ultimately control the use of AI in our own profession. The use of artificial intelligence in radiology will be controlled by governments, insurance companies and imaging providers who will push for ever-greater accuracy and efficiency and ever-lower costs. Picking on RadiologyAI does not need to be perfect in order to replace a radiologist. It simply needs to be better than a radiologist. If using AI allows radiologists to produce more accurate reports, then radiologists will be required to use AI. If AI by itself reads a study better than do AI and a radiologist working together—and this can happen even now, with the input of a radiologist dragging down the performance of the AI—then AI will be required to read that study alone.Diagnostic imaging studies have been increasing in number, complexity and amount of information. During the next few years AI will be a great help to radiologists in handling that difficult and sometimes overwhelming amount of work. At some point, however, the increasing use of AI will begin to reduce the number of studies that will require a radiologist to interpret them.All this raises difficult and contentious questions which so far do not have clear answers: ▲ What will this replacement process look like?▲ How should radiologists now in practice begin to prepare for this change?▲ How many radiologists are likely to be needed in five, 10 or 20 years?▲ How many radiology residents will be needed and what kind of training should they be given?No other medical profession has yet faced this kind of challenge. The radiology community is trying to find a path forward without a map. Uncertain Identity If we overestimate the speed at which AI will advance, and radiologists leave for other specialties and too many radiology residency positions go unfilled, we may end up with a shortage of radiologists. If we downplay the speed and impact of AI too much, we may end up training radiologists who will not be able to find work.The widespread use of artificial intelligence will be good for medicine. Patient care will be better, faster, less expensive and more equitable. This is our goal as physicians. But AI will not end up being good for the specialty of radiology. So, when will AI replace the first radiologist? If that experimental system described in Nature were currently being used in clinical practice, the answer would be “now.” AI will not replace every radiologist, nor will computers learn to read every type of imaging study all at once. But as computers begin to handle an ever-larger number of studies, radiologists will spend less time working in front of monitors and more time dealing directly with patients. As physicians, we can certainly do this. What is not at all clear is whether we will still be called radiologists.Dr. Schier is a radiologist with multistate, Los Angeles-based RadNet.

Artificial Intelligence in Indian Agriculture



 









 



 20 Feb 2020The agriculture and allied sectors are considered the bedrock of India’s economy. With farming employing almost half of India’s workforce, Agri Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be considered the engine of growth for the economy.The global need to produce 50% more food by 2050 cannot be accomplished if only 4% of the land is under cultivation.The vulnerabilities arising from climate change, coupled with the risk of increased dependency on unsustainable agriculture practices, can lead to agricultural distress.Artificial Intelligence (AI), along with other digital technologies, will play a key role in modernizing agricultural activities and realising the goal of doubling the farmer’s income by 2022. The global ‘AI in agriculture’ market size is expected to be worth USD 2.6 billion by 2025.India’s national AI strategy also identifies agriculture as one of the key areas where AI can enable development and greater inclusion. AI-enabled solutions in agriculture help farmers improve crop productivity and reduce wastage. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is working towards developing the agriculture sector in line with the country’s aspiration. Upgrading the technology quotient in agriculture is a key focus area. A CII-Deloitte report on ‘Artificial Intelligence – Augmenting Human Intelligence’ also highlights the role of AI in agriculture.So how can AI help in agriculture?Improving crop productivity – Climate change has resulted in making traditional agricultural know-how outdated, especially for forecasting weather patterns that determine farming practices for the season. The usage of predictive analysis with the help of AI could be extremely helpful for farmers. It could help determine appropriate crops to grow in a favourable climate on a productive terrain and the sowing methodology to enhance productivity and reduce costs.In Andhra Pradesh, India, with the help of a sowing app powered by AI developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semiarid Tropics and Microsoft, a 30% higher average in yield per hectare has been seen.Soil health monitoring – Along with favourable weather conditions, soil health comprising of an adequate level of moisture and nutrient holds the key to getting the best yield. Distributed soil monitoring performed via image recognition and deep learning models can be used to take corrective measures to restore soil health.Historical data about monsoons, local snapshots of the farm, crop-output information, history of soil health, and more serve as inputs for the creation of AI models. These models provide vital information about the farmland, assisting farmers in planning activities related to soil restoration, crop growth, farm watering, etc.Optimization of pest and weed management – AI can be used for predicting the behaviour of pests which can be beneficial for advanced planning of pest control. Efficient pest management leads to lower crop and environmental damage. A combination of remotely sensed data, efficient image classification tools, weather data, and other relevant data points can be used to distinguish the weed from the crop. This will confine the usage of weedicide only to the areas that require treatment.Remote satellites can monitor crop health and also warn against pest attacks. An AI-supported technology called ‘See & Spray’ developed by a US company is a weed controlling technology that can reduce expenditure on weedicides by 90%.Water Management – Efficient water management in agriculture can have a huge impact on the looming problem of water scarcity. Water usage in agricultural land can be optimized by using thermal imaging cameras that continuously monitor if crops are getting sufficient amount of water.AI, coupled with appropriate image classification models, when used in agriculture can result in improving yield production, reducing manual intervention, and decreasing instances of crop diseases.Price realization for farmers – Only about 6 percent of farmers in India get benefits of Minimum Selling Prices (MSP). A better price realization for farmers is possible through an effective price discovery model. Predictive modelling using AI can be instrumental in presenting more accurate demand-supply information and predicting demand for agricultural produce to farmers.With more than 500+ AgriTech start-ups in India, the agritech momentum is gaining pace in India. Many of these start-ups are leveraging technologies like AI, machine learning, etc. for improving efficiency, yield, speeding up agricultural finance, and other functions that are vital for India’s agricultural growth.

ChowFebruary 5, 2020 2:02 PM ESTIn November, the musician Grimes made a bold prediction. “I feel like we’re in the end of art, human art,” she said on Sean Carroll’s Mindscape podcast. “Once there’s actually AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), they’re gonna be so much better at making art than us.” Her comments sparked a meltdown on social media. The musician Zola Jesus called Grimes the “voice of silicon fascist privilege.” Majical Cloudz frontman Devon Welsh accused her of taking “the bird’s-eye view of billionaires.” Artificial intelligence has already upended many blue collar jobs across various industries; the possibility that music, a deeply personal and subjective form, could also be optimized was enough to cause widespread alarm. But there are many musicians who feel that the onset of AI won’t end human art, but spur a new golden era of creativity. Over the past several years, several prominent artists, like Arca, Holly Herndon and Toro y Moi have worked with AI in order to push their music in new and unexpected directions. Meanwhile, a host of musicians and researchers across the world are developing tools to make AI more accessible to artists everywhere. While obstacles like copyright complications and other hurdles have yet to be worked out, musicians working with AI hope that the technology will become a democratizing force and an essential part of everyday musical creation. “It’s provided me a sense of relief and excitement that not everything has been done — that there’s a wide-open horizon of possibility,” Arca, a producer who’s worked with Kanye West and Björk on groundbreaking albums, told TIME in a phone interview. Artificial intelligence and music have long been intertwined. Alan Turing, the godfather of computer science, built a machine in 1951 that generated three simple melodies. In the 90s, David Bowie started playing around with a digital lyric randomizer for inspiration. At the same time, a music theory professor trained a computer program to write new compositions in the style of Bach; when an audience listened to its work next to a genuine Bach piece, they couldn’t tell them apart.Progress in AI music field has rapidly accelerated in the past few years, thanks in part to devoted research teams at universities, investments from major tech companies and machine learning conferences like NeurIPS. In 2018, Francois Pachet, a longtime AI music pioneer, spearheaded the first pop album composed with artificial intelligence, Hello, World. Last year, the experimental singer-songwriter Holly Herndon received acclaim for Proto, an album in which she harmonized with an AI version of herself:But while the technology has come a long way, many say that we’re still far from an AI creating hit songs on its own. “AI music is simply not good enough to create a song that you will listen to and be like, ‘I would rather listen to this than Drake,’” says Oleg Stavitsky, the CEO and co-founder of Endel, an app which generates sound environments. Case in point: “Daddy’s Car,” a 2016 AI-penned song meant to mimic the Beatles, is a frustrating jumble of psychedelic rock tropes that fails to come together in a meaningful way. Perhaps in part due to these limitations, few straight-ahead pop songs are being created by AI. Instead, much more intriguing progress is being made in two seemingly diametrically opposed streams of music: the functional and the experimental. Meeting DemandsOn one side of the spectrum, AI music has become an answer to a simple demand: more music is needed than ever, thanks to a ballooning number of content creators on streaming and social media platforms. In the early 2010s, the composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes, and Michael Hobe were working on music for Hollywood films like The Dark Knight when they found themselves deluged with requests for simple background music for film, TV or video games. “There would be so many of our colleagues who wanted music that they couldn’t afford or didn’t have time for — and they didn’t want to use stock music,” says Silverstein.So the trio created Amper, which allows non-musicians to create music by indicating parameters like genre, mood and tempo. Amper’s music is now used in podcasts, commercials, and videos for companies like Reuters. “Previously, a video editor would search stock music and settle for something sufficient,” Silverstein says. “Now, with Amper, they can say, ‘I know what I want, and in a matter of minutes, I can make it.'” And when the company ran a recent Turing-like test, they found that, just like with the AI-generated Bach composition, consumers couldn’t tell the difference between music composed by humans and that composed by Amper’s AI. Endel was likewise created to fill a modern need: personalized soundscapes. Stavitsky realized that while people are increasingly plugging into headphones to get them through the day, “there’s no playlist or song that can adapt to the context of whatever’s happening around you,” he says. His app takes several real-time factors into account — including the weather, the listener’s heart rate, physical activity rate, and circadian rhythms — in generating gentle music that’s designed to help people sleep, study or relax. Stavitsky says users have successfully used Endel to combat ADHD, insomnia and tinnitus; a company representative said the app reached one million downloads at the end of January. Both Amper and Endel turn non-musicians into sonic curators, allowing them to become involved in a process they might have been shut out of due to lack of training or background. This year, Silverstein says, Amper will launch a consumer-friendly interface so that anyone, not just companies, can use it to create songs. “Billions of billions of individuals who might not have been part of the creative class now can be,” he says. Pushing Music ForwardOf course, creating simple ditties or glorified white noise is far different from creating great music. This is one of the main concerns that many have about AI in music: that it could flatten music into functional and generic sounds until every song sounds more or less the same. What if major labels use AI and algorithms to cram simplistic earworms down our aural cavities from now until the end of time? But musician Claire Evans of the Los Angeles-based electropop band YACHT says that sort of craven optimization already sits at the heart of the music industry: “That algorithm exists and it’s called Dr. Luke,” she says, referring to the once omnipresent producer who creates pop hits through specific formulas. It’s the job of forward-thinking musicians, then, to wield the technology for the exact opposite purpose: to push against standardization and explore uncharted territory they could not have conjured on their own. For their most recent album Chain Tripping, YACHT trained a machine learning system on their entire catalog of music. After the machine spit out hours of melodies and lyrics based on what it had learned, the band culled through its output and spliced together the most intriguing bits into coherent songs. The result was a jumpy and meandering interpretation of dance pop that was strange to listen to and even stranger to play. “I think often musicians underestimate how much the way we play is based on our physical experiences and habits,” Evans says. She says it took the band many excruciating hours to learn the new music, because many riffs or chord changes would deviate just slightly from the ones they had relied on for decades. “AI forced us to come up against patterns that have no relationship to comfort. It gave us the skills to break out of our own habits,” she says. The project resulted in the first Grammy nomination of YACHT’s two-decade career, for best immersive audio album. For the British-Iranian musician Ash Koosha, working with AI ironically led to an emotional breakthrough. He developed an AI pop star, named Yona, that writes songs through generative software. And while many of her lyrics are vague and nonsensical, some of them were shockingly vulnerable. Koosha was especially astounded by the line “The one who loves you sings lonely songs with sad notes.” “Being so blunt and so open — so emotionally naked — is not something most humans can do,” Koosha told TIME. “I wouldn’t be able to be that honest unless something triggers me.” In Berlin, the hacker duo Dadabots is hard at work creating musical chaos and disorientation with AI’s help. Berlin has become one of the global centers of AI experimentation (Endel is also based there) and Dadabots is currently in the midst of a residency in which they’re workshopping new tools with avant-garde songwriters and running AI-generated death metal livestreams. Co-founder CJ Carr says that AI acts both as a trainer for musicians — “like how a chess AI can help you improve your game,” he says — and a formidable radical creator. Dadabots’ neural networks have spit out ominous whispers, guttural howls, and furiously choppy drum patterns. For Carr, the weirder, the better. “When music is messed up, that’s better for music,” he says. “I want to see expressions and emotions and sounds that have never existed before.” For other creators, AI is not just a path forward, but also a link to a forgotten past of pre-recorded music. Last summer, a new version of the 2012 cult classic “Jasmine” by Jai Paul appeared online. While the first few bars sound the same as the original, the track gradually begins to mutate, with slippery guitar licks and syncopated hand claps drifting and out. The song continues for as long as you are listening — a taut band seemingly locked into an infinite, infectious jam session. But the track is AI-generated, a project from London-based company Bronze. Its creators, musicians Lexx and Gwilym Gold and scientist Mick Grierson, hoped to create a piece of technology that would dislodge music from the static and fossilized nature of recordings. “We wanted a system for people to listen to music in the same state it existed in our hands — as a constant, evolving form,” Gold told TIME. Jai Paul shares a label, XL, with Arca, one of pop music’s foremost transgressors (she worked on Kanye West’s Yeezus, Björk’s Vulnicura and FKA Twigs LP1). When the Venezuelan-born Arca learned about Bronze’s work, she was intrigued about how it could connect live and recorded music in an unprecedented way. “When you publish an album, that’s the way people will hear it forever more. When you play a song live, it’s unpredictable and ephemeral,” she says. “Working with tech like Bronze allows for this third thing. Lexx and I got really excited talking about what it means for the way people can listen to music, and the course of the industry.” Arca and the Bronze team soon began collaborating on an installation by the French artist Philippe Parreno that currently resides in the newly reopened lobby of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The music creaks and burbles out of swiveling speakers that seem to move along with you. The output changes with the temperature and crowd density, meaning no two days in the space will be the same.Arca says that listening to the music that she ostensibly composed is a strange and gripping experience. “There’s something freeing about not having to make every single microdecision, but rather, creating an ecosystem where things tend to happen, but never in the order you were imagining them,” she says. “It opens up a world of possibilities.” She says that she has a few new music projects coming this year using Bronze’s technology. “Still in the Very Beginning” While creators like Arca use AI to push creativity forward, many worry that the technology will displace musicians from their jobs. But Koosha says that this type of fear has accompanied every technological development of the last century. “It reminds me of the fear people had in the 70s — when guitar players started a movement to break any synthesizer they found,” he says. While some guitarists or drummers might have been displaced, a whole generation of home producers arose thanks to the lower barrier to entry, and hip-hop, house music and entire new vocabularies and sonic aesthetics rose to the fore. And Francois Pachet, the director of Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab, says that we’re still very much in the early days of experimentation with AI music. “The amount of music produced by AI is very little compared to the activity on the research side,” he says. “We are still in the very beginning.”When more AI creations are released, there will be inevitable legal battles. Existing copyright laws weren’t written with AI in mind, and are extremely vague about whether the rights to an AI song would be owned by the programmer who created the AI system, the original musician whose works provided the training data, or maybe even the AI itself. Some are worried that a musician would have no legal recourse against a company that trained an AI program to create soundalikes of them, without their permission. But until those issues arise, musicians around the world are working as hard as they can to get their tools into the hands of as many curious music-makers as possible. “I want to see 14 year old bedroom producers,” Carr says, “inventing music that I can’t even imagine.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dutch system aimed to predict the likelihood of an individual committing benefit or tax fraud, or violating labour laws. Photograph: Geography Photos/UIG via Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 4 years oldWelfare surveillance system violates human rights, Dutch court rulesThis article is more than 4 years oldGovernment told to halt use of AI to detect fraud in decision hailed by privacy campaignersJon Henley and Robert BoothWed 5 Feb 2020 08.18 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 13.30 ESTShareA Dutch court has ordered the immediate halt of an automated surveillance system for detecting welfare fraud because it violates human rights, in a judgment likely to resonate well beyond the Netherlands.The case was seen as an important legal challenge to the controversial but growing use by governments around the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and risk modelling in administering welfare benefits and other core services.Campaigners say such “digital welfare states” – developed often without consultation, and operated secretively and without adequate oversight – amount to spying on the poor, breaching privacy and human rights norms and unfairly penalising the most vulnerable.In the UK, where the government is accelerating the development of robots in the benefits system, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, Stephen Timms, said: “This ruling by the Dutch courts demonstrates that parliaments ought to look very closely at the ways in which governments use technology in the social security system, to protect the rights of their citizens.”The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, applauded the verdict and said it was “a clear victory for all those who are justifiably concerned about the serious threats digital welfare systems pose for human rights”.The decision “sets a strong legal precedent for other courts to follow”, he added. “This is one of the first times a court anywhere has stopped the use of digital technologies and abundant digital information by welfare authorities on human rights grounds.”The verdict will be watched closely by welfare rights campaigners in the UK, where the Department for Work and Pensions is engaged in a digitisation drive that vulnerable claimants fear could plunge them further into hunger and debt.Q&AWhat is AI?ShowArtificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A Guardian investigation in October found the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had increased spending to about £8m a year on a specialist “intelligent automation garage” where computer scientists were developing more than 100 welfare robots, deep learning and intelligent automation for use in the welfare system.The Dutch government’s risk indication system (SyRI) is a risk calculation model developed over the past decade by the social affairs and employment ministry to predict the likelihood of an individual committing benefit or tax fraud or violating labour laws.Deployed primarily in low-income neighbourhoods, it gathers government data previously held in separate silos, such as employment, personal debt and benefit records, and education and housing histories, then analyses it using a secret algorithm to identify which individuals might be at higher risk of committing benefit fraud.A broad coalition of privacy and welfare rights groups, backed by the largest Dutch trade union, argued that poor neighbourhoods and their inhabitants were being spied on digitally without any concrete suspicion of individual wrongdoing. SyRI was disproportionately targeting poorer citizens, they said, violating human rights norms.The court ruled that the SyRI legislation contained insufficient safeguards against privacy intrusions and criticised a “serious lack of transparency” about how it worked. It concluded in its ruling that, in the absence of more information, the system may, in targeting poor neighbourhoods, amount to discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic or migrant status.Sentencing: minister rejects European human rights convention warningRead moreThe system did not pass the test required by the European convention on human rights of a “fair balance” between its objectives, namely to prevent and combat fraud in the interest of economic wellbeing, and the violation of privacy that its use entailed, the court added, declaring the legislation was therefore unlawful. The Dutch government can appeal against the decision.Christiaan van Veen, director of the digital welfare state and human rights project at New York University School of Law, said it was “important to underline that SyRI is not a unique system; many other governments are experimenting with automated decision-making in the welfare state”.Van Veen cited Australia and the UK as countries where such concerns were particularly acute. “This strong ruling will set a strong precedent globally that will encourage activists in other countries to challenge their governments,” he said.Alston predicted the judgment would be “a wake-up call for politicians and others, not just in the Netherlands”. The special rapporteur presented a report to the UN general assembly in October on the emergence of the “digital welfare state” in countries around the globe, warning of the need “to alter course significantly and rapidly to avoid stumbling, zombie-like, into a digital welfare dystopia”.In the UK, as well as contracts with the outsourcing multinationals IBM, Tata Consultancy and Capgemini, the DWP is also working with UiPath, a New York-based company co-founded by Daniel Dines, the world’s first “bot billionaire”, who last month said: “I want a robot for every person.”His software is being deployed in an effort to introduce machine learning to check benefit claims, which suggests welfare computers will autonomously learn and alter the way they make decisions with minimum human intervention.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NetherlandsBenefitsInequalityComputingEuropePrivacynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNever doubt the instincts of Donald Trump, who just appointed ‘never Trump guy’ as his running mateMarina Hyde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, the problems that AI solves are not easy, and to work in the AI industry you will need a strong and focused set of skills. Here’s the good news: We live in a society where a shocking number of people would rather have a robot boss than a human one. We would rather be led by machines. This means that most of us are accepting of the idea of artificial intelligence, or AI.  In many sectors, machines have already taken over monotonous jobs. Automotive manufacturing is a prime example. Auto and aerospace manufacturers use machines heavily in their assembly lines. In fact, machines completely transformed the way that our cars are built. Artificial intelligence isn’t just a fad. It’s here to stay. And it’s here to stay in most industries, from consumer technology to staffing to aerospace defense.And, that means the industry will need a skilled workforce to build, test and deploy more and more artificial brains around the world. Get in early and you’ll stand to make a lot of money. Not to mention help change the world. If you are interested in a career in artificial intelligence, then you’re in the right place. What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial intelligence attempts to mimic (and surpass) the power of the human brain using nothing but machines. “Machine learning” is another common term in AI. The primary goals of artificial intelligence are:
Speed up repetitive procedures by using robots or machines instead of humans 
Out-smart human brains through “learning” and memory
Recognize patterns and make decisions instantly and efficiently
Artificial intelligence attempts to build machines that think and reason rather than operate in a relatively confined space with pre-built routines, procedures and outcomes. Smart AI systems recognize patterns and remember past events and learn from them, making each subsequent decision smarter, logical and more organic. AI is a giant paradigm shift in modern computing and requires a deeply scientific and logical approach to design computer systems that think and learn. In other words, build robots that aren’t just “robots”. And believe it or not, AI capabilities are all over the place. A few examples of artificial intelligence systems include speech recognition (available on many cell phones and smart home devices), email spam blockers, plagiarism checkers, language translation services (like Google Translate) and the auto-pilot system on airplanes. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amgen, Amazon, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Boeing, Raytheon, Humana and so many others are hiring for artificial intelligence roles. AI salaries are typically higher than average because good AI talent can be hard to find. Examples of roles in artificial intelligence include data engineers and data scientists.Artificial intelligence is everywhere in society, and the industry is growing rapidly in 2020. Here is exactly what you need to know to pursue a career in AI, and the salary of data engineers.The Skills You Need to Work in Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence is highly scientific. After all, mimicking the human brain using machines is a very tough problem to solve, much less master. The skills that you will need to pursue AI as a career are varied, but all of them require a great deal of education, training and focus. That said, there is a wide variety of career types available in AI and machine learning, and they range from higher-level research to low-level programming and implementation. For example, researchers use their breadth of knowledge in theory and study to reveal new types of systems and capabilities. Researchers hypothesize new or different ways for machines to think and test their research for real-world feasibility. Algorithm developers take AI research and transform that research into repeatable processes through mathematical formulas that can be implemented using hardware and software.Software developers and computer scientists use those algorithms to write sophisticated pieces of software that analyze, interpret and make decisions.   Hardware technicians build pieces of equipment (like robots) to interact with the world. Robots use its internal software to move and operate. Most careers in artificial intelligence require coursework and experience in a variety of math and science-related topics like:
Math: statistics, probability, predictions, calculus, algebra, Bayesian algorithms and logic
Science: physics, mechanics, cognitive learning theory, language processing
Computer science: data structures, programming, logic and efficiency
Want a career in AI? No matter what your desired job title is, you should read. A lot. Read papers and case studies. Experiment with technologies like Map-Reduce, PHP, MySQL, Postgres and “Big Data”, especially if you are targeting a computer science-related career in AI. Expose yourself to as many technologies as you can. Pro tip: Browse through AI job opportunities. Read the job descriptions and especially the requirements to get a feel for specific qualifications that you need for that job. For example, some might need experience in low-level programming languages like Python or MatLab. Others, especially in the healthcare industry, need expertise in data services like Spark and Blockchain. Regardless of the type of job that you’re after in artificial intelligence, there is no better way to figure out the exact skills you need than to read job requisitions and stay as up-to-date in the industry as possible. Use the Job Search tool here on The Ladders to find AI and machine learning jobs. The Best Non-Tech Skills for Artificial IntelligenceThough the types of careers in the AI industry are varied, most professionals in AI possess five key skills and capabilities, regardless of their individual roles. Most AI professionals: Are highly critical thinkers. They take nothing at face value and are naturally curious. They believe in trial and error and must test and experiment before making a concrete decision. Like to push the envelope. AI is all about pushing the boundaries. Pegging the capabilities of hardware and software to their max, always looking for more. More ways to improve existing systems. More ideas for inventing new ways to live. Live naturally-curious lives. Always wanting to know more, artificial intelligence pros want to know how things work. They don’t just look. They observe. They don’t hear. They listen. Don’t get easily overwhelmed. They understand that artificial intelligence is highly technical, but also realize that venturing into uncharted waters is difficult and mysterious. They enjoy the process rather than getting frustrated by it. Love math and science. AI is highly technical and it’s a natural good fit for those who are gifted and interested in hard sciences and mathematics. Artificial intelligence is not just about replacing the human component of the industry. It’s also about making it easier to make decisions based on observable patterns, use logic and reasoning to form conclusions and build pathways to boost efficiency and production. It is not an easy discipline, but that’s also why salaries in the AI industry are much higher than average. It takes the right type of person with the right skill set to excel. Are you the type of person who’s right for a career in AI? If you have many of these skill sets, then you just might be. Top U.S. cities for Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence an advantage to modern workforces

4th February 2020 



 






guest column:Emmanuel Zvada
HR in the age of disruptions needs to play the role of agile leaders with a digital and business mindset, helping their organisations stay ahead of the technological curve. Smart technologies are not just changing our homes; they are edging their way disrupting the workplaces. 
I thank IPMZ (Institute of People Management of Zimbabwe) for pioneering Digital HR Transformation last week, it was really long overdue in the Zimbabwean HR fraternity as it has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy across organisations both private and public.
What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technology used to do a task that requires some level of intelligence to accomplish. In other words, they are tools trained to do what a human can do. AI is different from ordinary software’s because it has high-speed computation, a huge amount of quality data and advanced algorithms. AI technologies offer significant opportunities to improve HR functions, such as self-service transactions, recruiting and talent acquisition, payroll, reporting, access policies and procedures. Human resources executives have faith that merging AI into HR administration functions will benefit and improve the overall employee experience.

Artificial intelligence and HRM
AI is reinventing human resources in a way not seen before by automating the repetitive task of hiring, onboarding, learning, and development, allowing HR teams to focus more on creative and strategic work. AI is being used in HR to automate repetitive, low-value tasks thus increasing the focus on more strategic work. Many fear that the rise of AI will lead to machines and robots replacing human workers and view this progression in technology as a threat rather than a tool to better ourselves. Let me clear all the fears and resistance of AI by enlightening all HR practitioners that you are not been replaced but HR processes, system and practices are just being reinvented.
Why artificial intelligenceAdopting a workplace artificial intelligence leads to more automatic processing for tasks that a company works through each day. It is crucial to note that the beauty of AI in the workplace is that the same amount of work that can be done in a day or two days by employees with the aid of AI it can be done in hours. This means productivity and efficiency is enhanced. Using AI in the workplace is also easier than many thinks. Artificial intelligence in the workplace allows a company and its employees to reach maximum efficiency levels, leaving more time for projects and networking.
Eliminate repetitive, manual processes with automationAI automates processes eliminating repetitive, manual processes replacing them with automation. Think about how much time is wasted on repetitive processes that could be performed via automation. By automating many of the physical and redundant processes performed by your workforce, you can allocate more time, resources, and brainpower to larger endeavour’s like sales strategy and customer satisfaction.
Save time especially use of chatbotsA chatbot is a service, powered by pre-programmed rules and sometimes, that you interact through a chat interface. Chatbots have actually been around for years, but they have had a recent renaissance with the rise of artificial intelligence. These easy-to-use tools are incredibly useful in the workplace since they allow for instant communication, ergo faster decision-making.
AI chatbots become smarter over time and learn better answers to frequently asked questions, freeing up time for management to focus on more strategic tasks. These virtual robots are effective and bridge the communication gap between employees and management and make internal information easily accessible.
Artificial intelligence improves employee’s productivity.
The main objective of the organisation is to earn maximum profit by utilising minimum manpower. Through the technical improvements and automation software, multiple tasks in the office are achieved effortlessly and the work of the employees become much simpler. The advancement of technology works as an important tool but at the same time, increases complexity at the workplace. Not only does AI increase productivity, it also improves overall quality. With any job, human-error is always a factor, whereas AI software is less likely to malfunction. It also enables deeper personalisation by understanding what customers want over time, resulting in better quality products and services.
Reducing human bias in decision makingHumans are normally biased in whatever choices or decision they making. Even when striving for inclusiveness, HR professionals may subconsciously lean toward a particular candidate, for example in recruitment. Now, with artificial intelligence, algorithms can be designed to help employers identify and remove these biases. That potentially translates to better hiring communication and attracting a more diverse group of candidates. Those same algorithms can also find candidates who may have been screened out due to human bias.
Artificial intelligent makes HR more humanEmbracing of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in human capital management is the only way that HR practitioners can become more human at workplaces. The automation of tasks through AI technology allows for the freeing of HR professionals to focus on uniquely human abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and empathy. While they are involved with the more human tasks, technology, at the moment, can handle the more ordinary tasks.
Besides being adaptable, flexible and agile to the ongoing changes, HR has to prepare for the innovations that are yet to occur and the development that might define the future of work. This is where a strong knowledge of current trends and the potential they come with will come in handy.
The HR department is probably the most promising field to put AI to use as they are the first line in dealing with the “human” component of their business. AI could serve as a great ally to them at each stage, right from sourcing talent, shortlisting applicants and performance assessment, making it a key tool in HR management. The journey for HR to pace up with the age of disruption starts from knowing the employees, the business, the environment the business operates in, applying analytics and data science, and then framing relevant strategies which will be then executed using new age technologies as per the requirement of business. Thus, in the age of disruptions, the first thing HR needs to disrupt is themselves.
If organisations wish to remain competitive in today’s global economy, they need to look at ways to incorporate conversational AI for HR transactions in their decision-making processes.
Organisations should rely on AI to perform administrative duties so that HR departments may become more efficient, by so doing HR professionals will be able to focus more on strategic planning at an organisational level.

Isaac Asimov, roboticist and science fiction writer, predicted in his novel I, Robot in 1950 that robots and artificial intelligence were going to be banned from Earth in the year 2030. Instead, we are seeing huge advances in AI and this is likely to continue within the next decade.
The UK’s investment in AI recently reached a record high for 2019, rising from  $1.02 billion for the whole of 2018 to $1.06 billion in the first six months of 2019. What’s more, the European Commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen recently made calls for a GDPR-style regulation for the use of AI to be put in place, signaling the predicted mass uptake of the technology amongst businesses across different industries.
There are multiple facets of AI, all with varied uses and capabilities, and one area in particular that is attracting a lot of attention is Intelligent Automation. Intelligent Automation (IA) marries artificial intelligence including natural language processing, digital workforce management and machine learning with automation.
This branch of the technology is currently boasting an expected market growth of up to $14.4 billion by the year 2024 up from $8 billion in 2019. IA leveraging the potential of fractal science will be a key branch of AI that can help companies solve the unstructured data challenge. It will essentially enable companies to not only process structured data, but also unstructured data and given that this type of data will make up 80 percent of all business data by the year 2025, more companies will be looking to utilize IA with fractal science for their business processes. AI technology such as deep automation tools including Integrated Automation Platforms (IAP) will soon become the go-to business processing tools.
AntWorks predicts that in the next decade, it will be hard to find an industry not utilizing AI to intelligently automate business processes. With countless use cases for AI across all industries, here are our predictions for 2020 and beyond.
Automated workforces and services
Companies across all industries are in most parts experiencing a never-ending demand for convenience from customers. This has certainly been characterized by the increase in the adoption of chatbots in some sectors. It is clear that consumers are unopposed to the idea, with 40 percent of them not being concerned about whether a robot or a human assists them as long as the experience is positive and their problems are solved.  However, automating customer service roles can put jobs at risk or may require a change in skillset for the human workforce. Companies need to integrate upskilling/reskilling programs into their digital transformation strategies to truly realize the value that comes when human and digital workforces come together.
 AI to advance surveillance
The safety and security of the public is very high on the agenda for most governments in the world. this is why we will likely be seeing a rise in the adoption of computer vision technology as a form of surveillance within the upcoming decade. A key challenge on the horizon for governing bodies, however, will be the ethical implementation of this technology. In 2019, the CIA’s deputy director of technology development Dawn Meyerricks confirmed the organization had 137 ongoing AI projects, including a computer vision solution that is capable of identifying and tagging objects or individuals in real-time video recordings. These findings would then be flagged to the surveillance team for further analysis.
According to Meyerricks, the CIA is also working on an AI solution that can forecast any significant future events through trends and shifts in data analysis, enabling them to then prepare accordingly. Whilst the latter use cases for AI technology are positively in line with the safekeeping of the public, it is not out of the realm of possibility that it could be used for more sinister activities. This concern naturally reinforces the need for organizations to tackle issues around the safety and responsible use of an otherwise effective and promising new AI capability in security.
AI and ethics: the debate continues
The ethics regarding the use of AI across different industries will be a hot topic throughout the 2020s. AI has the potential to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges as well as enhance the quality of our personal and professional lives. Yet there is a real risk of AI falling into the wrong hands. From being used for political fixing to corporate espionage, there are countless dangerous ways in which perpetrators could use the technology for ulterior motives. Calls for the regulation and standardization of AI have already been made and will continue to surface. This means that the increased investment and desire to expand AI regulations across all industries will likely ensure that there are greater consequences for those out of compliance.
The success of using AI for good depends upon trust, and that trust can only be built over time with the utmost adherence to ethical principles and practices. As we plow ahead into the next decade, the only way we can really see AI and automation take the world of business by storm is if it is smartly regulated. This begins with incentivizing further advancements and innovation to the tech, which means regulating applications rather than the tech itself.
Governments need to provide a framework to ensure the protection against malicious use of AI. This means that we will hopefully see a greater onus and accountability put on major organizations in delivering any form of cutting-edge AI technology, in a way that is both responsible and ethical.
 AI in healthcare to grow exponentially

The discovery and trials of drugs is an expensive endeavor. In fact, each new drug development program can cost approximately $2.6 billion to run. Given the increasing resistance of diseases and the rise of superbugs, it is starting to become a race against time for many big pharma companies in bringing new drugs to the market. AI can speed up drug trial processes.
The complexity of the molecular makeup of drugs means that finding data on new combinations for a particular medicine can be difficult as the combinations are numerous. Therefore, a lot work goes into studying research data on genes, molecular structures, and other biological information. Processing this large amount of data can be very difficult and time consuming for a human, which is why intelligent automation platforms are needed to process and analyze this catalog of data at a much faster rate using multi-tenancy bots and deep learning algorithms. Not only will this speed up the drugs time to market, but it will also save pharma companies billions in revenue
Another use case for intelligent automation in the healthcare industry is on the frontline. Currently, half of physicians’ time is spent on electronic health records (EHR) and paperwork. The use of AI to process patient data will not only enable physicians to see more patients per day, but the data insights AI can give will provide faster and more effective patient diagnosis.
AI technology has exceptional potential and is expected to create promising opportunities across all industries in the next decade. Its projected growth means that organizations will need to continue tinkering with their digital transformation strategies in order to accommodate the effective use of AI. More than anything, AI and machine learning will soon determine the fate of many companies as the markets become increasingly more saturated.

Landmark Relic of Silent Film Hauntingly Upscaled to 4K by Artificial Intelligence

Tech05 February 2020By David Nield 

 
(Denis Shiryaev/YouTube/Lumière brothers) 



Released in 1896, L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat is one of the earliest examples of movie-making we have – the 50-second silent short, which shows a mail train pulling into La Ciotat station, seems humdrum by today's standards, but would have wowed 19th century crowds seeing moving pictures for the first time.



Now this famously old, scratchy film relic has been upscaled into glorious 60 frames-per-second 4K footage thanks to the power of artificial intelligence – using neural networks to fill in missing pixels and missing frames that weren't there to begin with.



It's the work of developer and YouTuber Denis Shiryaev, and if you watch his new take it comes across as a modern-day movie filmed in black and white. Details on clothing and the train itself can be easily picked out; everything runs smoothly and in sync; and you can see far into the distance. width=""700″ height=""414″ allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"">As well as adding a new audio track, Shiryaev has used two algorithms here: the first is the Gigapixel AI from Topaz Labs, which fills in detail as pictures are made larger.



It does this by analysing huge numbers of images as they are scaled down, learning what information gets lost along the way. With this training to draw on, the AI is able to work backwards to add information as images are scaled up.



The second bit of AI magic is added by DAIN (or Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation), developed by a team of researchers and Google engineers.



DAIN also fills in detail, like Gigapixel AI, but this time it's it's inserting whole pictures rather than individual pixels, building the frame rate up to a smooth 60 frames per second.



Again, it's using an archive of existing videos as training materials, trying to work out what should be in the gaps by assessing both the before and after frames, and the different levels of depth that are in a shot.



Bear in mind that the extra details you're seeing in this restoration may not actually be what was really in the footage, down to the last pixel – instead they're the best guesses of computer algorithms trained on vast libraries of similar photos and videos.



The original L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat was filmed by the Lumière brothers, using 35mm film inside a Cinématographe camera (which also doubled as a projector).



We should also point out that compared to some very poor-looking, low-resolution copies of the film online, the source video Shiryaev used is also of a very good quality, likely thanks to previous restoration techniques.



Unfortunately, the source video doesn't come with any details about how it was made, but it looks to have been digitally enhanced in some way.



Whatever the story behind the source used, the new version adds extra resolution and smoothness to the footage, giving us another example of how AI engines can construct their own digital reality.



While there are valid concerns about deepfake photos and videos – recreating scenes that never existed – this upscaling of a classic silent film shows the positive ways that neural networks can be deployed.Check out some of the older versions of L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat floating around YouTube, and you can see what a difference digital processing and artificial enhancements can make. The film is even available in colour now too.

Much has been said about the impact of Industry 4.0 and rapid technological changes and how robots and Artificial intelligence (AI) would affect work.What is clear is the way we work in the future will be drastically different. How can workers better prepare themselves? And what can the Government and employers do to help workers?Advertisement 











Economic downturns are usually swift and unexpected, and those who have yet to re-equip themselves with new skills could face the possibility of long-term unemployment.Alexander Monge-Naranjo and Faisal Sohail from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found in 2015 that the share of older workers in the United States above 50 facing long term unemployment spells of 26 weeks or longer had doubled from 21 per cent in 2005 to 41 per cent in 2015.The rising long-term unemployment of this group of individuals reflects the mismatch between the skills they have and the skills employers demand.

      Unemployment inched up in 2019 but job growth better than expected
  







In the era of Industry 4.0, where the economic landscape is rapidly changing, we can expect the threat of long-term unemployment to also increasingly affect younger workers, not only those in their 50s. For those with dependants and a mortgage to service, a persistent unemployment spell would be catastrophic.HOW SHOULD SINGAPORE RESPOND?Advertisement 











Our best response to this uncertainty is to accept the increasing possibility of redundancies, have an open mind about re-skilling, and open, honest discussions about supporting unemployed workers using a mix of active labour market and income support policies such as limited unemployment insurance, wage insurance and maybe even some minimal form of basic income.This will prevent an economic underclass from forming and increasing inequality in our society.An example is the Danish model of ""flexicurity"", which encourages employers to restructure during downturns but supports workers with unemployment benefits.The consensus among the firms, workers and the Danish government is that firms that need to restructure will not hesitate to fire workers, but the workers themselves are not severely affected as they get to undergo retraining and receive unemployment benefits from the state for up to two years, at a maximum rate of around S$770 a week in 2018.

      Singapore’s economic growth and job creation have benefited citizens more than foreigners
  







In contrast, firms in Singapore that need to restructure tend to carry out retrenchment exercises, with employees getting a one-off payment that is costly to their employers.  Advertisement 











This is not to say that the Danish model is superior to Singapore’s or that the Republic should blindly adopt a Scandinavian model of social welfare.At the same time, active reskilling supported by the Government and tertiary institutions will help displaced workers retrain and address problems with falling cohort sizes.A mindset shift towards being more accepting of industry switchers may help improve risk-taking among the next generation of mid-career professionals in sunset industries who may not enjoy as much retrenchment benefits as older cohorts.Government support in the form of a transitionary income support paid directly to trainees, who may not have found an employer sponsor in the new industry, may help reduce hesitancy and bandwidth taxes associated with the loss of income while switching jobs.  This can complement the Adapt and Grow scheme where wage subsidies are given to employers only after they hire prospective employees, and while they wait for training to be completed.Advertisement

Such income support would also go further than the one-off Job Credit Scheme the Government implemented in 2009 to give businesses cash grants to encourage them to preserve jobs in a downturn.Indeed, an economic package for the future should incorporate some thinking about supporting industries through transformation in the longer term.In Budget 2016, the Government had launched Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to help major industries restructure to meet increasingly challenging economic conditions, global competition and disruptive technologies.While the Government has developed a set of structures for transformation, businesses should cooperate and see this initiative as an opportunity to automate, invest in other technologies or shift to different industries altogether.On the part of the Government, it can look at supporting such forms of riskier business decisions in future iterations of the ITMs to allow business owners to also switch from sunset industries to other businesses.This process, nonetheless, takes time as it requires an eventual recognition of where the future economic opportunities are, which could be very different from the present ones.

For example, healthcare, and its intersection with fintech and data analytics, would be increasingly important given Singapore’s ageing population and its ambition as a smart nation.However, in the five new banking licences that the Monetary Authority of Singapore is ready to issue, it is interesting to note that none of the consortiums applying for the digital banking licences here is focusing on the elderly.This is a departure from banks in Japan like the Kyoto Shinkin Bank, which organises music therapy sessions, lowered bank counters so services could be provided while older customers are seated and has managers and clerks who are trained to spot dementia. One current applicant in Singapore is instead focusing on the youth in an ageing population.LESSONS FROM HISTORYLearning from history, one has to readily adapt to its needs to survive and perhaps even thrive in an industrial revolution. In The Enlightened Economy, Joel Mokyr from Northwestern University argued that the First Industrial Revolution was aided by the “high quality of workmanship available to support innovation”.Innovation at that time was primarily mechanisation, which, as economic historian Karine van der Beek discovered, had led to increased demand in 18th Century England for wrights, workmen who “[erect and install] in place of use, machinery and other mechanical equipment"". British shipwrights made advances that improved sailing speeds by almost one-third in the late 1700s, compared to the Dutch who only improved by about 10 per cent. Singapore, as we know, could have been very different had the Dutch arrived first.The lesson we may learn from the First Industrial Revolution is this: Those with the skills to “support innovation” of our times, like the wright of the 18th Century, will thrive and maybe even change history, while those who don’t may find themselves left behind.This dictum may seem conceptually obvious, but are we ready to accept and proactively adapt to the major disruptions that could be coming our way? ABOUT THE AUTHORS:Nicholas Sim is senior lecturer at the School of Business, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Damien Huang is a research associate at the Institute of Policy Studies and Sabrina Heng is Adjunct Senior Research Fellow, University of Adelaide and Associate Lecturer, PSB Academy.

Artificial intelligence—code that learns—is likely to be humankind’s most important invention. It’s a 60-year-old idea that took off five years ago when fast chips enabled massive computing and sensors, cameras, and robots fed data-hungry algorithms. 


We’re a couple of years into a new age where machine learning (a functional subset of AI), big data and enabling technologies are transforming every sector. In every sector, there is a big data set behind every question. Every field is computational: healthcare, manufacturing, law, finance and accounting, retail, and real estate. We all work with smart machines—and they are getting smart fast. 

A World Economic Forum report indicated that 89% of U.S.-based companies are planning to adopt user and entity big data analytics by 2022, while more than 70% want to integrate the Internet of Things, explore web and app-enabled markets, and take advantage of machine learning and cloud computing

Given these important and rapid shifts, it’s a good time to consider what young people need to know about AI and information technology. First, everyone needs to be able to recognize AI and its influence on people and systems, and be proactive as a user and citizen. Second, everyone should have the opportunity to use AI and big data to solve problems. And third, young people interested in computer science as a career should have a pathway for building AI. 

Recognizing AI. AI4K12 is an initiative of leading computer scientists that have identified five big ideas that every student should know about AI:

Computers perceive the world using sensors. Examples include speech recognition and computer vision; emerging issues include the nature of intelligence and the limitations of human and computer perception. 
Agents maintain representations of the world and use them for reasoning. Examples include types of algorithms, the work they do and their limitations. 
Computers can learn from data. Examples include types of machine learning—yet there are concerns about issues such as bias in training data.  
Intelligent agents require many types of knowledge to interact naturally with humans. Examples include interacting with digital assistants, chatbots and robots. Emerging issues involve the nature of consciousness and limitations of AI interaction.  
AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways. Emerging issues include the use, fairness and transparency of algorithms and likely social impacts.

The MIT Media Lab developed a middle school AI+Ethics course that hits many of these learning objectives. It was piloted by Montour Public Schools outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has incorporated the three-day course in its media arts class. Montour elementary students also conduct Google AI experiments.
Harvard Professor Xiao-Li Meng suggests starting with cross-curricular conversations about data quality—including where does it come from, what bias might be incorporated, how could we gather more?
Using AI. Beyond recognizing the growing influence of AI, young people benefit from periodic application of smart tools across the curriculum. 
Montour Middle School has a six-week elective course on AI autonomous robotics in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon Professor Dr. David Touretzky (who is also the founder of AI4K12). Students are challenged to learn and use AI technology to solve real problems. The school also offers a 10-day AI music class hosted in collaboration with Amper Music. Additionally, Montour hosted the World Artificial Intelligence Competition for Youth and over 100 middle school students presented their work last year in an AI Grand Showcase. 
Renton Prep (@rentonprep) introduces all students, sixth grade and up, to computer science including AI. Head of School Michelle Zimmerman (@mrzphd) has a book, Teaching AI, that is a great resource for educators and school leaders.
Code.org developed an AI for Oceans tutorial that serves as a useful introduction for intermediate and middle grade students. 
A dozen communities offer summer programs for underrepresented youth through AI4All (@ai4allorg). In these sessions, students learn how to use AI to solve problems they care about while being mentored by top AI practitioners.
FIRST Tech Challenge is an after-school opportunity for middle school students to learn about programming robots. Google offers free resources for computer science clubs. 
Building AI. For high school students interested in AI, data science and more broadly in  computer science, a dedicated pathway or academy is a great option. A recommended course sequence includes: 


9th: Computer Science Discovery (a free introductory course from Code.org) 
10th: AP Computer Science Principles (a free course from Code.org)
11th: Introduction to Data Science (a free class from UCLA used in LAUSD)
12th: college credit Python course (AP CS Java class is an option, but Python is more commonly used in data science and AI) 


Complement the CS curriculum with three years of integrated math (with a stronger emphasis on computation than calculation) and AP (or college credit) statistics.
A new college credit option is the MicroBachelors Program in Computer Science Fundamentals from edX (the three courses are free; the credit costs $500). 
Industry certifications are an increasingly popular supplement to (or even replacement for) college credit courses. AWS Educate offers free cloud computing courses and stackable badges. Google also offers cloud training and certification. 
Microsoft offers many training classes resulting in certificates. They have bundled resources into Imagine Academy, a set of resources used by schools in 135 countries. It supports pathways in computer science, data science, infrastructure, and productivity.
Work experiences and internships are a valuable complement to classroom learning. In Dallas over 75 business partners support the 18 P-TECH academies (which combine high school, community college and work experience).    
Every high school graduate should have an appreciation of how AI is reshaping the economy and the career landscape. They should have the chance to use smart tools to attack challenges they care about. And, if they are interested in a career in AI and data science, they should have pathways that lead to college and meaningful high wage work.

Artificial intelligence is reshaping how we live, learn, and work, and this past fall, MIT undergraduates got to explore and build on some of the tools coming out of research labs at MIT. Through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), students worked with researchers at the MIT Quest for Intelligence and elsewhere on projects to improve AI literacy and K-12 education, understand face recognition and how the brain forms new memories, and speed up tedious tasks like cataloging new library material. Six projects are featured below.
Programming Jibo to forge an emotional bond with kids
Nicole Thumma met her first robot when she was 5, at a museum. “It was incredible that I could have a conversation, even a simple conversation, with this machine,” she says. “It made me think robots are the most complicated manmade thing, which made me want to learn more about them.”
Now a senior at MIT, Thumma spent last fall writing dialogue for the social robot Jibo, the brainchild of MIT Media Lab Associate Professor Cynthia Breazeal. In a UROP project co-advised by Breazeal and researcher Hae Won Park, Thumma scripted mood-appropriate dialogue to help Jibo bond with students while playing learning exercises together.
Because emotions are complicated, Thumma riffed on a set of basic feelings in her dialogue — happy/sad, energized/tired, curious/bored. If Jibo was feeling sad, but energetic and curious, she might program it to say, “I'm feeling blue today, but something that always cheers me up is talking with my friends, so I'm glad I'm playing with you.​” A tired, sad, and bored Jibo might say, with a tilt of its head, “I don't feel very good. It's like my wires are all mixed up today. I think this activity will help me feel better.” 
In these brief interactions, Jibo models its vulnerable side and teaches kids how to express their emotions. At the end of an interaction, kids can give Jibo a virtual token to pick up its mood or energy level. “They can see what impact they have on others,” says Thumma. In all, she wrote 80 lines of dialogue, an experience that led to her to stay on at MIT for an MEng in robotics. The Jibos she helped build are now in kindergarten classrooms in Georgia, offering emotional and intellectual support as they read stories and play word games with their human companions.
Understanding why familiar faces stand out
With a quick glance, the faces of friends and acquaintances jump out from those of strangers. How does the brain do it? Nancy Kanwisher’s lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) is building computational models to understand the face-recognition process. Two key findings: the brain starts to register the gender and age of a face before recognizing its identity, and that face perception is more robust for familiar faces.
This fall, second-year student Joanne Yuan worked with postdoc Katharina Dobs to understand why this is so. In earlier experiments, subjects were shown multiple photographs of familiar faces of American celebrities and unfamiliar faces of German celebrities while their brain activity was measured with magnetoencephalography. Dobs found that subjects processed age and gender before the celebrities’ identity regardless of whether the face was familiar. But they were much better at unpacking the gender and identity of faces they knew, like Scarlett Johansson, for example. Dobs suggests that the improved gender and identity recognition for familiar faces is due to a feed-forward mechanism rather than top-down retrieval of information from memory. 
Yuan has explored both hypotheses with a type of model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), now widely used in face-recognition tools. She trained a CNN on the face images and studied its layers to understand its processing steps. She found that the model, like Dobs’ human subjects, appeared to process gender and age before identity, suggesting that both CNNs and the brain are primed for face recognition in similar ways. In another experiment, Yuan trained two CNNs on familiar and unfamiliar faces and found that the CNNs, again like humans, were better at identifying the familiar faces.
Yuan says she enjoyed exploring two fields — machine learning and neuroscience — while gaining an appreciation for the simple act of recognizing faces. “It’s pretty complicated and there’s so much more to learn,” she says.
Exploring memory formation
Protruding from the branching dendrites of brain cells are microscopic nubs that grow and change shape as memories form. Improved imaging techniques have allowed researchers to move closer to these nubs, or spines, deep in the brain to learn more about their role in creating and consolidating memories.
Susumu Tonegawa, the Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience, has pioneered a technique for labeling clusters of brain cells, called “engram cells,” that are linked to specific memories in mice. Through conditioning, researchers train a mouse, for example, to recognize an environment. By tracking the evolution of dendritic spines in cells linked to a single memory trace, before and after the learning episode, researchers can estimate where memories may be physically stored. 
But it takes time. Hand-labeling spines in a stack of 100 images can take hours — more, if the researcher needs to consult images from previous days to verify that a spine-like nub really is one, says Timothy O’Connor, a software engineer in BCS helping with the project. With 400 images taken in a typical session, annotating the images can take longer than collecting them, he adds.
O’Connor contacted the Quest Bridge to see if the process could be automated. Last fall, undergraduates Julian Viera and Peter Hart began work with Bridge AI engineer Katherine Gallagher to train a neural network to automatically pick out the spines. Because spines vary widely in shape and size, teaching the computer what to look for is one big challenge facing the team as the work continues. If successful, the tool could be useful to a hundred other labs across the country.
“It’s exciting to work on a project that could have a huge amount of impact,” says Viera. “It’s also cool to be learning something new in computer science and neuroscience.”
Speeding up the archival process
Each year, Distinctive Collections at the MIT Libraries receives a large volume of personal letters, lecture notes, and other materials from donors inside and outside of MIT that tell MIT’s story and document the history of science and technology. Each of these unique items must be organized and described, with a typical box of material taking up to 20 hours to process and make available to users.
To make the work go faster, Andrei Dumitrescu and Efua Akonor, undergraduates at MIT and Wellesley College respectively, are working with Quest Bridge’s Katherine Gallagher to develop an automated system for processing archival material donated to MIT. Their goal: to develop a machine-learning pipeline that can categorize and extract information from scanned images of the records. To accomplish this task, they turned to the U.S. Library of Congress (LOC), which has digitized much of its extensive holdings. 
This past fall, the students pulled images of about 70,000 documents, including correspondence, speeches, lecture notes, photographs, and books housed at the LOC, and trained a classifier to distinguish a letter from, say, a speech. They are now using optical character recognition and a text-analysis tool to extract key details like the date, author, and recipient of a letter, or the date and topic of a lecture. They will soon incorporate object recognition to describe the content of a photograph, and are looking forward to testing their system on the MIT Libraries’ own digitized data.
One highlight of the project was learning to use Google Cloud. “This is the real world, where there are no directions,” says Dumitrescu. “It was fun to figure things out for ourselves.” 
Inspiring the next generation of robot engineers
From smartphones to smart speakers, a growing number of devices live in the background of our daily lives, hoovering up data. What we lose in privacy we gain in time-saving personalized recommendations and services. It’s one of AI’s defining tradeoffs that kids should understand, says third-year student Pablo Alejo-Aguirre. “AI brings us beautiful and elegant solutions, but it also has its limitations and biases,” he says.
Last year, Alejo-Aguirre worked on an AI literacy project co-advised by Cynthia Breazeal and graduate student Randi Williams. In collaboration with the nonprofit i2 Learning, Breazeal’s lab has developed an AI curriculum around a robot named Gizmo that teaches kids how to train their own robot with an Arduino micro-controller and a user interface based on Scratch-X, a drag-and-drop programming language for children. 
To make Gizmo accessible for third-graders, Alejo-Aguirre developed specialized programming blocks that give the robot simple commands like, “turn left for one second,” or “move forward for one second.” He added Bluetooth to control Gizmo remotely and simplified its assembly, replacing screws with acrylic plates that slide and click into place. He also gave kids the choice of rabbit and frog-themed Gizmo faces. “The new design is a lot sleeker and cleaner, and the edges are more kid-friendly,” he says. 
After building and testing several prototypes, Alejo-Aguirre and Williams demoed their creation last summer at a robotics camp. This past fall, Alejo-Aguirre manufactured 100 robots that are now in two schools in Boston and a third in western Massachusetts. “I’m proud of the technical breakthroughs I made through designing, programming, and building the robot, but I’m equally proud of the knowledge that will be shared through this curriculum,” he says.
Predicting stock prices with machine learning
In search of a practical machine-learning application to learn more about the field, sophomores Dolapo Adedokun and Daniel Adebi hit on stock picking. “We all know buy, sell, or hold,” says Adedokun. “We wanted to find an easy challenge that anyone could relate to, and develop a guide for how to use machine learning in that context.”
The two friends approached the Quest Bridge with their own idea for a UROP project after they were turned away by several labs because of their limited programming experience, says Adedokun. Bridge engineer Katherine Gallagher, however, was willing to take on novices. “We’re building machine-learning tools for non-AI specialists,” she says. “I was curious to see how Daniel and Dolapo would approach the problem and reason through the questions they encountered.”
Adebi wanted to learn more about reinforcement learning, the trial-and-error AI technique that has allowed computers to surpass humans at chess, Go, and a growing list of video games. So, he and Adedokun worked with Gallagher to structure an experiment to see how reinforcement learning would fare against another AI technique, supervised learning, in predicting stock prices.
In reinforcement learning, an agent is turned loose in an unstructured environment with one objective: to maximize a specific outcome (in this case, profits) without being told explicitly how to do so. Supervised learning, by contrast, uses labeled data to accomplish a goal, much like a problem set with the correct answers included.
Adedokun and Adebi trained both models on seven years of stock-price data, from 2010-17, for Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. They then compared profits generated by the reinforcement learning model and a trading algorithm based on the supervised model’s price predictions for the following 18 months; they found that their reinforcement learning model produced higher returns.
They developed a Jupyter notebook to share what they learned and explain how they built and tested their models. “It was a valuable exercise for all of us,” says Gallagher. “Daniel and Dolapo got hands-on experience with machine-learning fundamentals, and I got insight into the types of obstacles users with their background might face when trying to use the tools we’re building at the Bridge.”

Artificial Intelligence Gets Its Own System of Numbers

BF16, sometimes called BFloat16 or Brain Float 16, is a new number format optimised for AI/deep learning applications. Invented at Google Brain, it has gained wide adoption in AI accelerators from Google, Intel, Arm and many others.
The idea behind BF16 is to reduce the compute power and energy consumption needed to multiply tensors together by reducing the precision of the numbers. A tensor is a three-dimensional matrix of numbers; multiplication of tensors is the key mathematical operation required for AI calculations.

  As developers realize IoT systems need more intelligence deployed to the edge to overcome latency, performance data privacy/security and bandwidth challenges, we explore the pursuit of that smarter edge: the what, why and where.

Most AI training today uses FP32, 32-bit floating point numbers. While this means the calculations are very accurate, it needs beefy hardware and uses a lot of power. Inference in general uses INT8, 8-bit integer (whole) numbers. While using lower precision number systems like INT8 offers more throughput on the same hardware, and therefore saves power, the results of the calculation (the prediction) are less accurate.

The idea behind BF16 is to optimize the tradeoff between precision and prediction accuracy in order to increase throughput.
Anatomy of an FP Number
Binary numbers in computing are represented as:
Mantissa x baseexponent where the base is 2.
In FP32, each number is represented by:
1 bit representing the sign (+ or -), followed by an 8-bit exponent, followed by a 23-bit mantissa (total 32 bits).
For BF16, Google Brain proposed reducing precision by truncating the mantissa of an FP32 number to 7 bits.
BF16 numbers are therefore represented by:
1 sign bit, then 8 exponent bits, then 7 mantissa bits (total 16 bits).
Floating point number formats (Image: Google)
These 16-bit numbers offer the increased throughput that Google was after, while preserving the approximate dynamic range (the entire range of numbers that can be represented by this system) of FP32, since the exponent is the same size.
Prediction accuracy for algorithms using BF16 was similar, if not quite as accurate as FP32 (Google have said this is because neural networks are far more sensitive to the size of the exponent than the mantissa). For most applications, this is deemed to be an acceptable trade-off.
Why not use FP16?
The existing FP16 format, popular in mobile graphics applications, is also a 16-bit floating point number format. Why not just use that?
FP16 comprises:
1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, then 10 mantissa bits (total 16 bits).
With this format, the exponent is smaller than for FP32, so the dynamic range is much reduced. Also, it’s much harder to convert FP32 numbers to FP16 than to BF16 – it’s a lot more work compared to just truncating the mantissa, which is a relatively simple operation.
Another important point is the physical area of silicon required for calculations. Since the physical size of a hardware multiplier increases with the square of the mantissa width, there are significant savings in silicon area gained by switching from FP32 to BF16 (enough to convince Google to use BF16 in its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips). BF16 multipliers are eight times smaller than an FP32 multiplier, and still half the size of an FP16 equivalent.
What other formats are there for DL?
BF16 was not the only new number format proposed for deep learning. Nervana proposed a format called Flexpoint in 2017. The idea was to reduce computational and memory requirements by combining the advantages of point and floating point number systems.
Fixed point numbers use a fixed number of bits to represent an integer (whole number) and a fraction (the part after the decimal point) – in general it is simpler and faster to compute with fixed point numbers compared to the floating point formats described above. However, for a given number of bits, the dynamic range is much smaller for a fixed point number than a floating point number.
Flexpoint numbers shared the same exponent to make tensors easier to multiply (Image: Nervana/NeurIPS)
All the (floating point) numbers in a Flexpoint tensor used the same exponent (not just the same exponent size, the exact same exponent value). This exponent was shared between all the numbers in the tensor – so that communication of the exponent could be amortized across the entire tensor.
Multiplying tensors could then be done as a fixed point operation, since the exponent is the same for each calculation  — this would be simpler than the maths required for floating point numbers. These calculations represent the vast majority of deep learning maths, so the savings would be significant. However, it was complex to manage the exponents, and the dynamic range (the range of numbers that could be represented) was low, because all numbers had the same exponent.
Flexpoint never took off and even Nervana’s own chips ended up using BF16 before their demise.

BF16 is a quick hack which does sensibly prioritize exponent at the cost of the fraction.  An interesting and perhaps better system is the ""posit"" which compresses fraction more aggressively for large exponents while giving more fraction for ordinary exponents.  It leverages the intuition that models are generally normalized to work in the central range.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply chop off some bits to simulate the format and so large scale tests have been limited.  The largest I have read about were weather forecasts where stability and accuracy beat BF16 and approached FP32.  That shows some promise, but more large scale modelling would be needed to really explore the tradeoffs vs. BF16.  It does seem premature to settle on BF16 as the only contender, given how much machinery the world is building for ML.

Posits would be more complex to unpack and pack for computation but in modern machines most of the power is lost in moving the data.  The energy needed to pack and unpack and to do the computations is likely to be minor.

Researchers devise approach to reduce biases in computer vision data sets 
 By Molly Sharlach
 February 12, 2020

Addressing problems of bias in artificial intelligence, computer scientists from Princeton and Stanford University have developed methods to obtain fairer data sets containing images of people. The researchers propose improvements to ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images that has played a key role in advancing computer vision over the past decade.

Addressing problems of bias in artificial intelligence, computer scientists from Princeton and Stanford University have proposed improvements to ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images. The researchers developed a tool that allows users to specify and retrieve image sets of people that are balanced by age, gender expression or skin color.

ImageNet, which includes images of objects and landscapes as well as people, serves as a source of training data for researchers creating machine learning algorithms that classify images or recognize elements within them. ImageNet’s unprecedented scale necessitated automated image collection and crowdsourced image annotation. While the database’s person categories have rarely been used by the research community, the ImageNet team has been working to address biases and other concerns about images featuring people that are unintended consequences of ImageNet’s construction.
“Computer vision now works really well, which means it’s being deployed all over the place in all kinds of contexts,” said co-author Olga Russakovsky, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton. “This means that now is the time for talking about what kind of impact it’s having on the world and thinking about these kinds of fairness issues.”
In a new paper, the ImageNet team systematically identified non-visual concepts and offensive categories, such as racial and sexual characterizations, among ImageNet’s person categories and proposed removing them from the database. The researchers also designed a tool that allows users to specify and retrieve image sets of people that are balanced by age, gender expression or skin color – with the goal of facilitating algorithms that more fairly classify people’s faces and activities in images. The researchers presented their work on Jan. 30 at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Barcelona, Spain.
“There is very much a need for researchers and labs with core technical expertise in this to engage in these kinds of conversations,” said Russakovsky. “Given the reality that we need to collect the data at scale, given the reality that it’s going to be done with crowdsourcing because that’s the most efficient and well-established pipeline, how do we do that in a way that’s fairer – that doesn’t fall into these kinds of prior pitfalls? The core message of this paper is around constructive solutions.”
A group of computer scientists at Princeton and Stanford launched ImageNet in 2009 as a resource for academic researchers and educators. Leading the effort was Princeton alumna and faculty member Fei-Fei Li, now a professor of computer science at Stanford. To encourage researchers to build better computer vision algorithms using ImageNet, the team also created the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. The challenge focused largely on object recognition using 1,000 image categories, only three of which featured people.
Some of the fairness issues in ImageNet stem from the pipeline used to build the database. Its image categories came from WordNet, an older database of English words used for natural language processing research. ImageNet’s creators adopted the nouns in WordNet – some of which, although they are clearly defined verbal terms, do not translate well to a visual vocabulary. For example, terms that describe a person’s religion or geographic origin might retrieve only the most distinctive image search results, potentially leading to algorithms that perpetuate stereotypes.
A recent art project called ImageNet Roulette brought increased attention to these concerns. The project, released in September 2019 as part of an art exhibition on image recognition systems, used images of people from ImageNet to train an artificial intelligence model that classified people in words based on a submitted image. Users could upload an image of themselves and retrieve a label based on this model. Many of the classifications were offensive or simply off-base.
The central innovation that allowed ImageNet’s creators to amass such a large database of labeled images was the use of crowdsourcing – specifically, the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform, through which workers were paid to verify candidate images. This approach, while transformative, was imperfect, leading to some biases and inappropriate categorizations.
“When you ask people to verify images by selecting the correct ones from a large set of candidates, people feel pressured to select some images and those images tend to be the ones with distinctive or stereotypical features,” said lead author Kaiyu Yang, a graduate student in computer science.
In the study, Yang and colleagues first filtered out potentially offensive or sensitive person categories from ImageNet. They defined offensive categories as those containing profanity or racial or gender slurs; sensitive categories included, for example, the classification of people based on sexual orientation or religion. To annotate the categories, they recruited 12 graduate students from diverse backgrounds, instructing them to err on the side of labeling a category as sensitive if they were unsure. This eliminated 1,593 categories – about 54% of the 2,932 person categories in ImageNet.
The researchers then turned to MTurk workers to rate the “imageability” of the remaining safe categories on a scale of 1 to 5. Keeping categories with an imageability rating of 4 or higher resulted in only 158 categories classified as both safe and imageable. Even this highly filtered set of categories contained more than 133,000 images – a wealth of examples for training computer vision algorithms.
Within these 158 categories, the researchers studied the demographic representation of people in the images in order to assess the level of bias in ImageNet and devise an approach to create fairer data sets. ImageNet’s content comes from image search engines such as Flickr, and search engines in general have been shown to produce results that overrepresent males, light-skinned people, and adults between the ages of 18 and 40.
“People have found that the distributions of demographics in image search results are highly biased, and this is why the distribution in ImageNet is also biased,” said Yang. “In this paper we tried to understand how biased it is, and also to propose a method to balance the distribution.”
Of the attributes protected under U.S. anti-discrimination laws, the researchers considered the three attributes that are imageable: skin color, gender expression and age. MTurk workers were asked to annotate each attribute of each person in an image. They classified skin color as light, medium or dark; and age as child (under 18), adult 18–40, adult 40–65 or adult over 65. Gender classifications included male, female and unsure – a way to include people with diverse gender expressions, as well as annotate images in which gender could not be perceived from visual clues (such as many images of babies or scuba divers).
An analysis of the annotations showed that, similar to search results, ImageNet’s content reflects considerable bias. People annotated as dark-skinned, females, and adults over 40 were underrepresented across most categories.
Although the annotation process included quality controls and required annotators to reach consensus, out of concern for the potential harm of mis-annotations, the researchers opted not to release demographic annotations for individual images. Instead, they designed a web-interface tool that allows users to obtain a set of images that are demographically balanced in a way the user specifies. For example, the full collection of images in the category “programmer” may include about 90% males and 10% females, while in the United States about 20% of computer programmers are female. A researcher could use the new tool to retrieve a set of programmer images representing 80% males and 20% females – or an even split, depending on the researcher’s purpose.
“We do not want to say what is the correct way to balance the demographics, because it’s not a very straightforward issue,” said Yang. “The distribution could be different in different parts of the world – the distribution of skin colors in the U.S. is different than in countries in Asia, for example. So we leave that question to our user, and we just provide a tool to retrieve a balanced subset of the images.”
The ImageNet team is currently working on technical updates to its hardware and database, in addition to implementing the filtering of the person categories and the rebalancing tool developed in this research. ImageNet will soon be re-released with these updates, and with a call for feedback from the computer vision research community.
Princeton Ph.D. student Klint Qinami and Assistant Professor of Computer Science Jia Deng co-authored the paper along with Yang, Li and Russakovsky. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.

How countries are using AI to track employment

        Artificial Intelligence is used not only by businesses, but governments to match jobs, analyse employment trends and even track illegal hiring.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that has transformed many businesses and jobs. And with the amount of data in the employment industry, organisations and even governments are beginning to make use of the technology to match jobs and even track illegal hiring.
And with the employment market and trends going through constant changes with the rise of the gig economy and freelancers, there’s an increasing need to utilise technology to keep pace with the changes.
Let’s take a look at how some countries are utilizing AI to do so.
1) Recommend jobs
Estonia is leading the way in using AI for recruitment and employment. The government is making use of algorithm to profile candidates and “give a recommendation of where you could go next”, the country’s Chief Data Officer Ott Velsberg told GovInsider. “We could, in theory, give a heads up to you and say that you should perhaps choose another one,” he said. It can also predict what kind of jobs are in danger of redundancy. He also added that around 72% of candidates who joined new jobs through the AI system were still employed six months later, compared to 58% of those advised by officials.
2) Monitor fraud and illegal hires
Besides using AI to match jobs, governments are also using the technology to detect and track illegal hires. Singapore is using data to track the risk of employees and employers trying to break labour laws.
“Using advanced data science and machine learning on large, diverse sets of employment, business and transactional data, MOM developed agile analytics models to detect patterns and emerging risks for which early interventions in policy and regulations could be implemented,” a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson told GovInsider.
“With tighter controls, more people would try to circumvent the system. With better use of data, MOM has achieved significantly higher detection rates and greater enforcement presence in a resource lean manner. For one exercise, we saved about 20,000 man-hours but covered 650 more cases,” the Ministry added.
3) International migration and future skills
Another way that AI can be used is to analyse migration and skills trends. One example is how the United Nations Development Programme’s Regional Innovation Centre for Asia Pacific has used publicly available LinkedIn data to identify labour migration patterns to and from Thailand.
It analysed data in Thailand and found out that Thailand attracted most people to jobs in international affairs, renewables, and sports while defence, space and maritime lost the most jobs to employees migrating out of Thailand.
Between 2015 and 2018, the biggest changes in labour migration came to and from Thailand were in the US, France and Myanmar. The LinkedIn data also showed that soft skills like time management, problem solving, negotiation and leadership are on the rise in Thailand.

To Medtronic, Digital Surgery offers not just new products to sell but also capabilities that could boost its in-house development projects. (Pixabay)
Medtronic is looking to augment not only its work in robotic surgery but efforts across all of its procedural offerings through the acquisition of Digital Surgery, London-based maker of data analytics, artificial intelligence and training programs for the operating room.This includes integrating and bundling the company’s AI and surgical video education platforms with the medtech giant’s various hardware endeavors—plus co-developed digital solutions for its upcoming, modular soft-tissue surgery robot named Hugo.The plan is for Digital Surgery to retain its current leadership and headquarters in the U.K., though it will operate under the robotics arm of Medtronic’s Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which said it aims to invest and expand the workforce of the company. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. RELATED: Medtronic takes its new surgery robot out for a spin with investor debutLast year, Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak laid out his intentions to develop and apply computer-guided surgery and planning tools to multiple medical specialties, including bringing robotics to bear on “virtually every area” the company has a procedural presence.As a part of that mandate, its robotics division has been focused on developing four main technology vectors that touch Medtronic’s work across open surgery, laparoscopic and robotic procedures. They include visualization and navigation, instrumentation and implants, data and analytics, and the robotics platforms themselves.“And as we have been approaching the commercialization of our robotics platform, we've been, in parallel, focused on investing in and developing products, road maps and capabilities in those vectors,” said Megan Rosengarten, vice president and general manager of Medtronic’s surgical robotics business.RELATED: Medtronic reveals past Karl Storz vision team-up ahead of robotic surgery unveiling“For that data and analytics vector, we've been looking for quite a while and actively exploring partners in that space,” Rosengarten told FierceMedTech in an interview, describing how Digital Surgery checked a lot of boxes for the company—offering not just new products to sell, but also capabilities that could act as an in-house booster to help accelerate Medtronic’s other development projects.The deal includes Digital Surgery’s education app, Touch Surgery, with its on-demand library of hundreds of videos and procedure simulations for training surgeons and students outside the OR. The company also provides a HIPAA-certified surgical video sharing platform, which uses AI to automatically recognize and blur out images that could be used to identify patients or staff. This allows surgeons to annotate and edit videos for post-procedure team assessments, institutional training or use at conferences.“Products that assisted with the collection, storage and analysis of surgical video were specific things that we were looking for,” as well as capabilities that could be leveraged internally, such as image processing and algorithm development, Rosengarten said. Additionally, the ability to track procedure times and standardize procedures could help reduce variability as well as cost. “We’re really looking forward to learning a lot from Medtronic, as well as having access to their scale and expertise,” said Touch Surgery co-founder and CEO Jean Nehme, a surgeon himself. “We’re going to be able to work with a team who are global in surgery, and take the technology that we’ve been building to more patients.”RELATED: Digital Surgery partners with U.K. hospitals to bring GPS-style directions to the operating roomThe deal’s announcement comes the same week as robotics mainstay Intuitive Surgical’s move to acquire Orpheus Medical, an Israeli company that provides clinical video capture and archiving plus imaging documentation solutions. Its system records video from scope cameras and external monitors, including from Intuitive’s da Vinci system. “I went into this thinking we were either going to find components and products that we would commercialize and integrate into our robotic platform, or I was going to find some of these core data analytics and AI capabilities, or I was going to find a platform, a digital ecosystem and some existing assets around video and images,” Rosengarten said. “And that’s kind of the beauty—I don't want to oversell it, but the beauty of this Digital Surgery deal is that we got some elements of all of those things.”“The plans on this are to continue to grow and commercialize the products that exist within Digital Surgery today, in both laparoscopic and robotic surgery,” she added. “And they also bolster the data science capabilities that we have within the surgical robotics group—and will help develop the road map of solutions we have planned for the software that will be rolling out on our Hugo platform.”The Hugo surgical system was unveiled in a practice demonstration for investors last September, where it was used to perform a prostate procedure on a cadaver. At the time, Medtronic said it plans to secure a CE mark and 510(k) clearances for the platform, featuring up to four independent, cart-mounted robotic arms, within just two years—with the ultimate goal of offering per-procedure costs comparable to manual laparoscopy.

Computer vision and navigation have improved by leaps and bounds, thanks to artificial intelligence, but how well do the computer models work in the real world?
That’s the challenge that Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is setting for AI researchers over the next few months, with geek fame and glory as the prize.
AI2’s RoboTHOR Challenge, which kicks off today, capitalizes on years of work that’s been done to train AI agents in synthetic environments.
Ani Kembhavi, a research scientist at AI2, says RoboTHOR focuses on the next step. “If you can train a deep-learning, computer vision model to do something in an embodied environment … how well would this model work when deployed in an actual robot?” he told GeekWire.
That’s a crucial step for putting such models to work, in applications ranging from self-driving cars to robotic caregivers. But testing the models in actual robots, or cars, is expensive. “A lot of the research in this important topic can only be done by an organization with a lot of funding,” Kembhavi said.
He said AI2’s RoboTHOR Challenge aims to “democratize” the development of computer models that translate more easily to the real world, in line with the nonprofit institute’s mission to advance the state of artificial intelligence for the common good.

The challenge sets up a virtual world with 89 different apartments in it. Inside each simulated apartment is a collection of everyday objects — including, say, chairs and a table, a sofa and a lamp, even a computer manual.
AI2 will make the simulation software and training data for 75 of the apartments available to all comers via the RoboTHOR website. (For what it’s worth, “THOR” stands for The House Of inteRactions.)
“We provide all the help that you need to start training the model,” Kembhavi said.
The computer models will be judged on how well they’re able to navigate to an object of a specified category from an arbitrary location. For example, if the model is given the category “apple,” it will have to identify the apple in the room, plot a course to get close to the apple and then signal that it’s been found. Think of it as a virtual scavenger hunt.
The real trick is to see how well the model does when it’s uploaded into a real robot, conducting a scavenger hunt in a real apartment. For that phase of the challenge, AI2 has set up a room that can be quickly configured to look like any of the apartments in the repertoire.
The left half of this image shows a simulated apartment room set up for the RoboTHOR Challenge. The right half shows a real room that reflects the exact layout of the simulation. (AI2 Images)
Teams will be able to test their models on 14 apartment scenarios, using LoCoBot, a robot that was developed specifically for these kinds of experiments.
Roozbeh Mottaghi, a senior research scientist at AI2 who’s also a computer science professor at the University of Washington, said LoCoBot was selected because it has all the sensors and mobility needed for the challenge. It’s also relatively cheap, with a price tag in the range of $5,000.
Organizers of the challenge have designed the environment so that teams can construct their own real-world RoboTHOR rooms if they want, using IKEA furniture and standard objects to spread around the room. The cost of replicating the RoboTHOR room in all its incarnations would be roughly $10,000.
The top-scoring teams will be invited to demonstrate their models in a RoboTHOR room that’ll be set up for an Embodied AI workshop at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, scheduled June 14-15 in Seattle.
Winners will also be able to exercise their bragging rights in the research papers and presentations that will no doubt come out of the RoboTHOR Challenge.
“Those are the prizes,” Kembhavi joked.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has been working to improve the state of global health through his nonprofit foundation for 20 years, and today he told the nation’s premier scientific gathering that advances in artificial intelligence and gene editing could accelerate those improvements exponentially in the years ahead.
“We have an opportunity with the advance of tools like artificial intelligence and gene-based editing technologies to build this new generation of health solutions so that they are available to everyone on the planet. And I’m very excited about this,” Gates said in Seattle during a keynote address at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Such tools promise to have a dramatic impact on several of the biggest challenges on the agenda for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, created by the tech guru and his wife in 2000.
Also from Bill Gates: Coronavirus impact could be ‘very, very dramatic’
When it comes to fighting malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases, for example, CRISPR-Cas9 and other gene-editing tools are being used to change the insects’ genome to ensure that they can’t pass along the parasites that cause those diseases. The Gates Foundation is investing tens of millions of dollars in technologies to spread those genomic changes rapidly through mosquito populations.
Millions more are being spent to find new ways fighting sickle-cell disease and HIV in humans. Gates said techniques now in development could leapfrog beyond the current state of the art for immunological treatments, which require the costly extraction of cells for genetic engineering, followed by the re-infusion of those modified cells in hopes that they’ll take hold.
For sickle-cell disease, “the vision is to have in-vivo gene editing techniques, that you just do a single injection using vectors that target and edit these blood-forming cells which are down in the bone marrow, with very high efficiency and very few off-target edits,” Gates said. A similar in-vivo therapy could provide a “functional cure” for HIV patients, he said..

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence gives Gates further cause for hope. He noted that that the computational power available for AI applications has been doubling every three and a half months on average, dramatically improving on the two-year doubling rate for chip density that’s described by Moore’s Law.
One project is using AI to look for links between maternal nutrition and infant birth weight. Other projects focus on measuring the balance of different types of microbes in the human gut, using high-throughput gene sequencing. The gut microbiome is thought to play a role in health issues ranging from digestive problems to autoimmune diseases to neurological conditions.
“This is an area that needed these sequencing tools and the high-scale data processing, including AI, to be able to find the patterns,” Gates said. “There’s just too much going on there if you had to do it, say, with paper and pencil to understand the 100 trillion organisms and the large amount of genetic material there. This is a fantastic application for the latest AI technology.”
Similarly, “organs on a chip” could accelerate the pace of biomedical research without putting human experimental subjects at risk.
“In simple terms, the technology allows in-vitro modeling of human organs in a way that mimics how they work in the human body,” Gates said. “There’s some degree of simplification. Most of these systems are single-organ systems. They don’t reproduce everything, but some of the key elements we do see there, including some of the disease states — for example, with the intestine, the liver, the kidney. It lets us understand drug kinetics and drug activity.”

The Gates Foundation has backed a number of organ-on-a-chip projects over the years, including one experiment that’s using lymph-node organoids to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines. At least one organ-on-a-chip venture based in the Seattle area, Nortis, has gone commercial thanks in part to Gates’ support.
High-tech health research tends to come at a high cost, but Gates argues that these technologies will eventually drive down the cost of biomedical innovation.
He also argues that funding from governments and nonprofits will have to play a role in the world’s poorer countries, where those who need advanced medical technologies “essentially have no voice in the marketplace.”
“If the solution of the rich country doesn’t scale down … then there’s this awful thing where it might never happen,” Gates said during a Q&A with Margaret Hamburg, who chairs the AAAS board of directors.
But if the acceleration of medical technologies does manage to happen around the world, Gates insists that could have repercussions on the world’s other great challenges, including the growing inequality between rich and poor.
“Disease is not only a symptom of inequality,” he said, “but it’s a huge cause.”
Other tidbits from Gates’ talk:

When it comes to agriculture, climate change is making the challenges facing farmers in developing countries even more acute, Gates said. More extreme weather conditions could bring more floods, more droughts and more pests and plant diseases capable of wiping out crops. Gates pointed to efforts at CGIAR to develop more resilient strains of corn, rice and other crops, and at the University of Cambridge to build healthier soil. The Gates Foundation has set up an initiative called Gates Ag One to support such innovations.
Gates said he was concerned about two trends in the distribution of health information. “One is that titillating false information is more engaging than true information,” he said. The flap over the false linkage between vaccines and autism serves as an example of that, he said. “And then there’s this general notion of, hey, if the experts say something, are they somehow biased or naive?” he noted. “This is a fight. Will we go through a cycle where it’s not as acute as it is today? I don’t know. Right at the moment, it doesn’t feel that way.”
Gates said he subscribed to psychologist Steven Pinker’s view that the world is getting better. “Despite that there’s plenty to worry about … we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that the progress has been absolutely phenomenal,” he said. “Many people are literally ahistorical to think that in a meaningful sense, 20 years ago or 40 years ago, life was better. That’s just not the case. Yes, there are huge problems, but if you’re a woman, if you’re gay, if you were subject to certain diseases, if you lived in developing countries, 40 years ago was dramatically worse than it is today.”

Technology leaders such as Microsoft, IBM, Huawei and Google have entire sections of their business focused on the topic and dedicate resources to build AI solutions for good and to support developers who do. In the fight to solve extraordinarily difficult challenges, humans can use all the help we can get. Here are 8 powerful examples of artificial intelligence for good as it is applied to some of the toughest challenges facing society today.
8 Powerful Examples Of AI For GoodAdobe Stock

Accessibility

There are more than 1 billion people living with a disability around the world. Artificial intelligence can be used to amplify these people’s abilities to improve their accessibility. It can facilitate employment, improve daily life and help people living with disabilities communicate. From opening up the world of books to deaf children to narrating what it “sees” to those with visual impairments, apps and tools powered by artificial intelligence are improving accessibility.

Climate Change, Conservation and the Environment

One of the most perplexing and pressing issues the planet faces today is climate change. Artificial intelligence innovators are developing ways for the technology to be applied to help improve the climate change issue from simulations to monitoring, measuring and resource management. In addition, AI has been deployed in conservation biology. AI tools make wildlife monitoring more accurate and efficient, and data analysis streamlined. Drones are also used to monitor wildlife populations and count animals as well as catch poachers in the act.
PROMOTED
World Hunger
In order to feed the world’s population by 2050, the United Nations estimates we will need to increase the world’s food production by 70%. This gargantuan task seems more plausible with the support of artificial intelligence. In addition to developing hearty seeds, artificial intelligence can be used to automate tedious tasks, detect disease for earlier interventions, apply herbicide precisely and generally maximize crop production.
Human Rights
Artificial intelligence makes the task of identifying human rights violations such as human trafficking quicker and more comprehensive. Using face recognition technology powered by artificial intelligence photos can be analyzed to find missing people and images can be reviewed to spot other human rights violations.

Fight Fake News
Even though artificial intelligence generates a lot of disinformation campaigns and fake news content, it can also be used to battle it. Artificial intelligence can be used to verify the truth of articles. Since the amount of content generated daily is too much for humans to effectively monitor, artificial intelligence offers a solution that makes identifying fake news possible. Even though the algorithms are only as good as the input, they receive to learn from, using AI in the fight over fake news is a step in the right direction.

Education
As the pressure continues to mount for educators to customize learning for each student and hit performance benchmarks, artificial intelligence supplies valuable tools that can support learning in and out of the classroom. On a systemic level, artificial intelligence can help process educational statistics to enable decision-making for policy-makers and educational leaders.

Healthcare
Artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing healthcare. It is aiding in diagnoses and detecting illness and disease prior to the involvement of medical professionals as well as assist healthcare staff once patients are under their care. Healthcare systems create volumes of data that would go unused without the support of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Not only does artificial intelligence get used to develop innovative drug therapies and customized medicine, but robots are also increasingly being used to support surgeries.
Resilience
Not only does artificial intelligence play a critical role in detecting, monitoring and learning about natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, but it’s also leveraged for learning to make our society more resilient when faced with catastrophe. Researchers are currently using artificial intelligence to find solutions to make Los Angeles’ plumbing infrastructure less susceptible to damage from earthquakes. In this case and other applications, AI can run many scenarios and computer models to determine the best solutions for vexing issues.
There’s no shortage of challenges that need to be solved today to enable a better tomorrow for our planet, cultures and society. When humans collaborate with artificial intelligence, solutions that otherwise wouldn’t have been thought of can be developed and vetted at a pace that wouldn’t be possible if only humans were tasked with the assignment. AI provides innovative ways of solving extremely challenging problems while at the same time providing ways of significantly improving life.

Artificial intelligence tools may be able to help providers objectively diagnose and prescribe depression treatments based on analyses of brain activity, according to a study published in Nature Biotechnology.







The findings are part of a national trial initiated by UT Southwestern in 2011, which seeks to better understand mood disorders. Several studies from the trial demonstrate how advanced technologies, including AI, brain imaging, and blood tests, could help doctors choose appropriate depression therapies.
""These studies have been a bigger success than anyone on our team could have imagined,"" said Madhukar Trivedi, MD, a UT Southwestern psychiatrist who oversaw the multi-site trial involving Stanford, Harvard and other institutions. ""We provided abundant data to show we can move past the guessing game of choosing depression treatments and alter the mindset of how the disease should be diagnosed and treated.""
Researchers noted that in the US, antidepressant use has increased nearly 65 percent over a decade and a half. The increased use of this medication makes it more crucial to further understand the underpinnings of depression and ensure patients are prescribed the appropriate treatment.
""It can be devastating for a patient when an antidepressant doesn't work,"" Trivedi said. ""Our research is showing that they no longer have to endure the painful process of trial and error.""
The team evaluated more than 300 participants with depression who were randomly chosen to receive either a placebo or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), the most common class of antidepressant. Researchers used an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure electrical activity in the participants’ cortex before starting treatment.
The group then developed a machine learning algorithm to analyze and use EEG data to predict which patients would benefit from the medication within two months. The algorithm was able to accurately predict outcomes. Additionally, further research indicated that patients who weren’t likely to respond to antidepressants were likely to improve with other interventions, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation.
The researchers derived study data from the 2011 trial initiated by UT Southwestern, called the EMBARC trial. EMBARC aims to develop biology-based, objective strategies to treat mood disorders. The trial evaluates participants with major depressive disorder through DNA, blood, and other tests, and seeks to address the fact that most patients don’t adequately respond to their first antidepressant.
""We went into this thinking, 'Wouldn't it be better to identify at the beginning of treatment which treatments would be best for which patients?'"" Trivedi said.
Previous EMBARC studies identified various predictive tests, including the use of MRI to examine brain activity both in a resting state and during the processing of emotions. EEG will likely be the most commonly used tool, because it is more effective and less expensive. However, a blood test or MRI may be needed for some patients if the depression manifests itself in a different way.
""There are many signatures of depression in the body,"" Trivedi said. ""Having all these tests available will improve the chances of choosing the right treatment the first time.""
Researchers’ next steps involve developing an AI interface that can be widely integrated with EEGs across the country, as well as seeking approval from the FDA. With this new method, providers could significantly improve depression therapies.
“This study takes previous research, showing that we can predict who benefits from an antidepressant, and actually brings it to the point of practical utility,” said Amit Etkin, MD, PhD, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who worked with Trivedi to develop the algorithm.

Gamers have spent decades going up against computer-controlled opponents, whether a Pong paddle trying to prevent them from scoring a point or Bowser trying to stop Mario from rescuing Princess Peach. But recent developments in AI are pushing the gaming field even further, as researchers develop algorithms that can help fans make exciting new titles on their own.The history of AI and that of gaming are inexorably intertwined. Early AI researchers saw games like chess as markers of intelligence, and thus perfect testing grounds for their work. “One of the very earliest things that people tried to do with this sort of burgeoning field was get it to play chess and get to play chess well, and, obviously, that eventually happened with Deep Blue,” says Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. Contemporary AI researchers have focused on more complex games, particularly the ancient Chinese game of Go.As AI research moved into the subfield of machine learning — in which algorithms are “taught” how to learn on their own — video games emerged as a similarly suitable testbed. “A game is fully observable in a way that much of the real world isn’t,” says Guzdial. “Most importantly, it has rewards. It has a notion of ‘you are doing well’ or ‘you are doing badly.’ Building up those kinds of functions in life is extremely complicated.” In Super Mario Brothers, for instance, a player knows they’re doing poorly when they take damage or lose a life. They know they’re doing well when they finish a level, defeat enemies, or earn coins. That kind of feedback is key for training machine learning algorithms.Of course, simply playing a game is one thing. What about creating them, the way some musicians are using AI to generate entirely new forms of their art? Guzdial and his team are working on exactly that. They’re developing software that, working alongside human partners, creates new video games out of whole cloth.To train an AI to build its own Super Mario Bros.-style platforming games, for instance, Guzdial and his team had the software “watch” hours of videos showing people playing that game, as well as similar titles, like Mega Man and Kirby’s Adventure. After binge-watching gaming videos on YouTube and elsewhere, their software guesses at the rules of the games, then it checks its guesses by watching the videos once more. With the rules of a game sorted out, Guzdial’s algorithms follow a similar procedure to create new levels in which the rules are put to work.“Once we’ve learned both of these bits, we put them into this common representation — basically squash these two sets of knowledge together into this big representation — we call it a game graph,” Guzdial says. “And you can think of this as this dense tangled web of information about a game. But importantly, it has all the information you need to basically reproduce the game.” Finally, to generate its own games, the team’s software looks at all the information in this “game graph.” Then it begins to design, combine, and reproduce what it saw. In one example, Guzdial says the AI took the platforming styles of Mega Man and Super Mario Bros. and combined them to create something new. “Now imagine that happening over and over and over again for every piece of level design for every piece of game rule logic,” he says. That could result in entirely new AI-generated games — experiences similar to what gamers know and love, but novel enough to be notably different. Because Guzdial’s work is academic in nature, it’s protected under fair use, and thus isn’t likely to run afoul of copyright laws.Guzdial says his goal isn’t to replace game creators. Instead, he’s hopeful his work can reduce the barrier of entry around game creation. “The plan was always to use this to help people make games,” he says. Using a tool like his, he says, a gamer could start building their own levels without learning how to write code. Other level-building tools, like Nintendo’s Super Mario Maker, are already big hits with fans. “It allows the user to basically define the set of rules that the AI has learned without having to explicitly know anything about coding,” he says.Up next for Guzdial is a tool that could let gamers bored of their current selection to instantly build an entirely new game simply by deciding how they want their game to look and feel. The AI could then take that input and design a game, complete with rules and levels. All the software would need, he says, are two frames worth of data, defined by the player. “And as soon as we have more than one frame, the AI system learns rules that would explain the difference between the two frames,” he says. The AI makes predictions, the creator gives feedback, and the AI makes adjustments. At the end of this back and forth, Guzdial says, a gamer would have something brand new to enjoy. “We’re putting some finishing touches on the interface and then we’re going to run a human subject study to find out if we’re on the right track,” he says.A practical consumer version of that technology is still likely years away. The industry may be slow to adopt it, too, nervous about software outmoding human game designers. Guzdial thinks that independent developers will likely be the trailblazers who make the first compelling games using tools like his. He pointed to Lab Assistant, a machine learning-based game in which a player has to teach language to a mysterious ooze in order to solve puzzles. “I can totally imagine that what we get are some passionate indie [developers] messing around with these technologies and making weird, cool, interesting little experiences,” he says. “But I don’t think they’re going to impact triple-A game development anytime soon.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research shows artificial intelligence can accurately predict whether an antidepressant will work based on a patient's brain activity.

DALLAS – Feb. 10, 2020 – Artificial intelligence may soon play a critical role in choosing which depression therapy is best for patients.
A national trial initiated by UT Southwestern in 2011 to better understand mood disorders has produced what scientists are calling the project's flagship finding: a computer that can accurately predict whether an antidepressant will work based on a patient's brain activity.
The new research is the latest among several studies from the trial that cumulatively show how high-tech strategies can help doctors objectively diagnose and prescribe depression treatments. Although implementing these approaches will take time, researchers predict tools such as AI, brain imaging, and blood tests will revolutionize the field of psychiatry in the coming years.

What did researchers do in this study?
""These studies have been a bigger success than anyone on our team could have imagined,"" says Madhukar Trivedi, M.D., a UT Southwestern psychiatrist who oversaw the multi-site trial involving Stanford, Harvard and other institutions. ""We provided abundant data to show we can move past the guessing game of choosing depression treatments and alter the mindset of how the disease should be diagnosed and treated.""
EEG-based predictions
The study published in Nature Biotechnology included more than 300 participants with depression who were randomly chosen to receive either a placebo or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), the most common class of antidepressant. Researchers used an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to measure electrical activity in the participants' cortex before they began treatment. The team then developed a machine-learning algorithm to analyze and use the EEG data to predict which patients would benefit from the medication within two months.
Not only did the AI accurately predict outcomes, further research suggested that patients who were doubtful to respond to an antidepressant were likely to improve with other interventions such as psychotherapy or brain stimulation.
The findings were validated in three additional patient groups.

Why is this study important to patients?
“This study takes previous research, showing that we can predict who benefits from an antidepressant, and actually brings it to the point of practical utility,” says Amit Etkin, M.D., Ph.D., a Stanford University psychiatry professor who worked with Trivedi to develop the algorithm.
Among the next steps, researchers say, is developing an AI interface that can be widely integrated with EEGs across the country, as well as seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Signatures of depression
Data from the study derive from the 16-week EMBARC trial, which Trivedi initiated at four U.S. sites to establish biology-based, objective strategies to remedy mood disorders.
The project evaluated patients with major depressive disorder through brain imaging and various DNA, blood, and other tests. His goal was to address a troubling finding from another study he led (STAR*D) that found up to two-thirds of patients do not adequately respond to their first antidepressant.
""We went into this thinking, 'Wouldn't it be better to identify at the beginning of treatment which treatments would be best for which patients?'"" Trivedi explains.
Previous EMBARC studies identified various predictive tests, including the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine brain activity in both a resting state and during the processing of emotions. EEG will likely be the most commonly used tool, Trivedi says, because it's less expensive and – in most cases – will be equally or more effective.
However, a blood test or MRI may be needed for some patients if the depression is manifesting itself in a different way.
""There are many signatures of depression in the body,"" Trivedi says. ""Having all these tests available will improve the chances of choosing the right treatment the first time.""

EMBARC’s first EEG study
Growing problem
According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, antidepressant use in the U.S. has increased nearly 65% over a decade and a half – from 7.7% in 1999-2002 to 12.7% in 2011-2014. Trivedi says the expanded use of medications makes it more critical to further understand the underpinnings of depression and ensure patients are prescribed an effective therapy.
While his team continues to evaluate data from the EMBARC trial, Trivedi has initiated other large research projects to help improve the remission rate of depression. Among them is D2K, a study that will enroll 2,500 patients with depression and bipolar disorders and follow them for 20 years. In addition, RAD is a 10-year study of 2,500 participants (ages 10-24) that will uncover factors for reducing the risk of developing mood or anxiety disorders.
Utilizing some of these enrollees, Trivedi’s research team will study the results from several other tests to assess patients’ biological signatures to determine the most effective treatment.
""It can be devastating for a patient when an antidepressant doesn't work,"" Trivedi says. ""Our research is showing that they no longer have to endure the painful process of trial and error.""
About EMBARC
EMBARC (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care) was a multicenter effort that also involved researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Columbia University, McLean Hospital, Stanford University, University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Michigan.  It was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Stanford Neurosciences Institute, the Hersh Foundation, the National Key Research and Development Plan of China, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Trivedi is founding director of UT Southwestern’s Center for Depression Research and Clinical Care, a cornerstone of the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. He served as EMBARC's coordinating principal investigator. Trivedi, a professor of psychiatry, holds the Betty Jo Hay Distinguished Chair in Mental Health and the Julie K. Hersh Chair for Depression Research and Clinical Care.
UT Southwestern and Stanford have filed for a patent for the algorithm described in the Nature Biotechnology study.
Disclosures for Trivedi are included with the article's online publication.

Emerging Tech: AI & Blockchain townhall will convene entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers and corporates across Africa to examine how businesses, individuals and African countries can maximize emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain.Artificial intelligence and blockchain are changing how Africans live, work, learn, play, and do business. For instance, across the continent, banks have launched chat banking services using artificially-intelligent chatbots. Also, across sectors such as agriculture and e-commerce, African entrepreneurs are building AI-driven solutions.The use cases for blockchain in Africa has been on the increase. Organisations such as Binance Labs and Blockchain Nigeria User Group are investing in and helping stakeholders in the blockchain sector.
We have begun to see a rise of use cases across industries for Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. For blockchain, it is gaining traction in the financial services sector especially for cross-border payments. However, what we found is that organizations and policymakers still have many questions about these technologies. Our objective with this event is to completely demystify AI and Blockchain for businesses and policymakers.
