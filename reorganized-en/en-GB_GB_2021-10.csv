AI market
The artificial intelligence market is growing, especially with the pandemic and multiple changes to business models as a result.
Companies worldwide have leaned into AI to assist with automation, workforce management, and their digital transformation efforts. 
The AI software market reached approximately $62.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a staggering rate, reaching $997.8 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. 
More on this topic: Artificial Intelligence Market
Primary job markets
AI development is still in its infancy, and many of the most pioneering and lucrative positions are in more traditional tech hubs. Some of the top job markets for AI positions right now include the San Francisco Bay Area, Austin, New York City, and Denver.
A growing number of companies are offering remote work opportunities to their technical staff, but some are hesitant to extend that flexibility for AI and machine learning (ML) roles in particular. Given the complex nature of AI development and management, many employers are not yet comfortable with the idea of AI teams working away from on-premises resources.
AI job types
These are the three most common roles for AI professionals, according to LinkedIn’s “Jobs on the Rise” report for 2021:

Machine learning researcher: The primary thinkers and developers who use data to build machine learning models. 
Machine learning engineer: They act as the developer and operational support for researchers after ML models have been initiated. Some common tasks for engineers include managing data lakes, computational clusters, and containers for continued ML optimization.
Artificial intelligence specialist: They are often researchers who have specialized in a specific industry, business model, or use case. AI specialists work closely with other staff members in a business to figure out how AI can improve anything, from HR actions to customer relationship management (CRM) to security monitoring.

There’s also a growing demand for candidates who can demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding of AI in other roles. 
In areas like operations, marketing, and sales, AI is frequently being implemented to automate tasks. It’s important that candidates in tech-facing roles not only develop an understanding of AI tools, but also enhance their other skills that AI cannot perform as well as a human.
More on AI automation in jobs: Artificial Intelligence and Automation
Education for AI positions
Artificial intelligence and machine learning specialists typically hold a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in a relevant tech field. 
Some of the most common fields of study include computer science, engineering, mathematics, data science, physics, and information technology.
However, AI and ML candidates are unlikely to be hired unless they have applied knowledge in the field. Many hiring managers expect these candidates to sharpen their specialized skills in different programming languages, data management and database systems, and platform-specific AI models. Some of the top skills that employers are looking for include C++, Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) knowledge, according to LinkedIn’s “Jobs on the Rise” report.
AI job openings
Over 55,000 jobs are currently listed under “artificial intelligence” on LinkedIn. 
Some common AI-related job titles across listings include the following:

Project manager for AI/ML
Artificial intelligence engineer
Data scientist for ethical AI
AI and data science tech consultant
AI/ML architect
Artificial intelligence research associate
AI research intern
AIOps/MLOps engineer
AI annotation analyst

Big tech companies hire more artificial intelligence and machine learning specialists than any other industry. But a growing number of companies in sectors like manufacturing, customer service, and communications are hiring in this area as well. 
Some of the most notable companies that are currently hiring in this field include:

Facebook
Verizon

Conclusions
Practical applications of artificial intelligence have reached every industry around the world, and as a result, many companies are investing in AI development and staff. 
AI equity, also known as self-serve AI or AI democratization, is growing at a rapid rate as well, working to make it possible for the layperson to understand and operate AI technologies.
But regardless of how far AI equity advances in the coming years, companies will continue to need artificial intelligence specialists who understand the logic behind AI — and how to push past boundaries toward new AI use cases.

How AI Is Transforming The Future of Digital MarketingAdobe Stock

This is true across every industry and business function, and particularly true in marketing, where leveraging AI to put products and services in front of potential customers has been standard practice for some time, even though we may not always realize it!

In business today, the term AI is used to describe software that is capable of learning and getting better at doing its job without input from humans. This means that while we’ve become used to using machines to help us with the heavy lifting, now they can start to help us with jobs that require thinking and decision-making, too.

PROMOTED
A huge number of questions that would previously have needed human intervention to answer – such as “will this person be interested in my products?” or “what results will I get from this advertising campaign?” can now be answered by machines – if they are given the right data. And because machines can answer questions far more quickly than humans, they can easily chain together complex strings of queries to come up with predictions, such as who is most likely to buy your products and where the best places to advertise might be.

That’s the basic principle behind all business AI today – automating the processes of learning and decision-making in order to create knowledge (usually referred to as “insight”) that helps to improve performance. And marketing is one area where it’s certainly been put to good use!

Targeted marketing
The high-level use case for AI in marketing is that it improves ROI by making your marketing – often one of a company’s biggest expenses – more efficient. In the old days, before online advertising, businesses would pay huge amounts of money for TV, radio, or newspaper adverts, in the full knowledge that only a small number of the people who saw their ads would ever become customers. This was tremendously inefficient, but companies didn't have any choice if they wanted to position themselves as market leaders.

In the online age, we’ve developed the ability to learn a great deal about who is or isn’t interested in our products and services. The first breakthroughs came thanks to the likes of Amazon with their recommendation engine technology and Google and Facebook with their targeted advertising platforms. Today, each of those platforms has been augmented with machine learning technology that allows them to become increasingly effective as they are fed more data on customers and their buying habits.

AI-driven content marketing
The rise in social media marketing and our growing appetite for online content has made content-based marketing the dominant form of marketing in many industries. AI lends a hand here by helping us work out what type of content our customers and potential customers are interested in and what the most efficient ways are to distribute our content to them. Advertising creatives have always strived to find formulas for creating adverts that will get people talking and sharing the message with their friends. Now, this can be done automatically using any number of AI-powered tools. For example, headline generation algorithms that monitor how successful they are and tweak their output to achieve better metrics, such as the open rate of emails, or the share rate of social media posts.
Taking this a step further, AI is developing the ability to take care of the entire content generation process itself, creating copy and images that it knows are likely to be well-received by its audience. A huge buzzword in this space will be personalization – where individual customers are served content that’s specifically tweaked to them, perhaps using information and reference points that the AI knows are relevant to them, intertwined with the overall marketing messages.
AI will also increasingly be useful for identifying what stage of the buying process a customer is at. If it detects that they are “shopping around” – comparing products and services that are available - it can serve content designed to differentiate your product or service from those of competitors. If it detects that they are ready to make a purchase, it can target them with promotions urging them to “act now” to take advantage of a limited-time offer.
A digital marketing agency called 123 Internet has embraced the ongoing industry developments by utilizing various AI-based technologies to improve service delivery. Scott Jones, CEO said:
“We’ve been using AI tools for a while now, in particular automatically checking website designs in hundreds of screen and browser types, this speeds up our design and development process”.
Their team also use an AI generated website audit which can be downloaded from their website and runs without human interaction.
Identifying micro-influencers
Influencers are another huge trend in marketing right now, and AI algorithms are already in use to make sure the personalities that are most likely to appeal to you are appearing in your search results and social feeds.
Increasingly, advertisers will also use AI to identify smaller influencers that are most likely to gel with their brands and audiences. This has led to the emergence of “micro-influencers” – typically everyday people, rather than celebrities, who have a specialist knowledge they’ve used to build a niche audience that cares about their opinion. AI enables companies to find the micro-influencers with the right audiences for them, across a large number of niches and audience segments. AI helps establish when it makes sense to pay 100 people $1,000 each to talk about their product, rather than pay $100,000 to Justin Bieber or a Kardashian. Once again, here it is about creating efficiency by following the data, rather than simply doing what a marketer thinks or feels is the best plan.  
AI in CRM
Customer relationship management is an essential function for any marketer to master, as existing customers are often the most important source of a company’s revenue. Here, AI can be used to reduce the risk of customer “churn” – by identifying patterns of behavior that are likely to lead to customers heading elsewhere. These customers can then be automatically targeted with personalized promotions or incentives to hopefully restore their loyalty. AI-augmented marketers are also increasingly turning to chatbot technology – powered by natural language processing. This can segment incoming customer inquiries, meaning those who require a quick response can be urgently catered to, to minimize dissatisfaction. AI-driven CRM will also allow businesses to more accurately forecast sales across all the markets where a company operates, meaning stock and resources can be more efficiently distributed. Additionally, it can be used to maintain the quality of data in the CRM system, identifying customer records where errors or duplicates are likely to exist.
The future of the marketer
If you work in marketing, you would be forgiven for worrying that we’re heading for a future where humans in your role will be redundant. You can take heart, though, from current predictions that state AI will end up creating more jobs than it destroys. It’s inevitable that your job will change, though. Marketers will spend less time on technical tasks such as forecasting or segmenting customers and more time on creative and strategic tasks. Those who are competent at working with technology, and identifying new technological solutions as they become available, will be hugely valuable to their companies and are likely to have a bright future!

Around the world and particularly in the Global South, many eke out a living through ‘microwork’: tiny tasks that power existing and future technologies, from Google’s search engine to self-driving vehicles and facial-recognition software. This work is done remotely, from homes, internet cafes, even refugee camps and prisons. Workers tend to be those excluded or expelled from standard wage labour – the incarcerated, the long-term sick, and those on the sharpest edges of global inequalities and conflict. Platforms like Clickworker and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk host the tasks and act as intermediaries between contractors – including tech giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft – and workers, taking a cut from every transaction. The work is precarious and low paid, often as little as a few cents for ten minutes of work. It comes with negligible legal protections. Microworkers often work for upwards of 20 to 30 contractors per day, engaging in disparate tasks from tagging images to urban areas to posting images of their body parts. The tasks themselves are often disconnected from whatever the contractors are trying to achieve overall, and workers often have no idea about what they’re contributing to. This might mean refugees working on facial-recognition software deployed by ICE or on military technologies used in conflicts they have fled. Huck spoke to Jones about this new hidden digital abode of production and what it means for the future of work. Let’s start with the basics. What are the new technologies that form the background to the kind of work you talk about in Work Without the Worker?The kind of artificial intelligence that has become dominant over the last decade is machine learning, which is a method, a way of achieving intelligent technologies. Machine learning relies on being fed lots of specific data by people. One of the promises that is continually made by Silicon Valley is that in our automated future, we’re going to get rid of monotonous low-skill work and no-one will need to do that anymore. But in actuality, an autonomous vehicle, for example, can’t learn to drive simply by absorbing lots of unprocessed data about traffic loads and urban areas. It relies on a lot of workers to process and label that data. Or a facial recognition algorithm, for instance, relies on lots of face tagging tasks: so workers basically clicking on images of faces with labels like “nose” or “eyes” or telling the technology the specific emotions that are being portrayed on the face. Another example would be Google search, which relies on a vast army of workers to rank search results. The promise that work is somehow going to magically disappear is nonsense. Until we can create a general form of artificial intelligence, which can generalise intelligence across multiple contexts – and there’s no evidence that that will ever actually happen – then we’re going to need workers. How does microwork differ from other forms of work? In some respects, microwork is really a continuation of much longer trends in capitalism – it continues a globalised outsourcing model that has been central since the 1970s. Most of the work is done in the Global South and it looks a lot like other kinds of precarious and informal work in those countries. The sociologist, Jan Breman, has lots of really interesting things to say about informal economies in the South. He writes about what he calls “wage hunters and gatherers” in cities in like Mumbai, and Kinshasa, who, over the course of a day will do a disorienting number of jobs: hawking, petty goods, selling tissues on trains, doing bits of litter picking, just generally trying to find bits of income to survive. And more often than not, their days are spent hunting for tasks rather than actually doing paid work. In my book, I’m arguing that microwork is a digital adjunct to this form of work.The conditions are bad due to there being an oversupply of workers, not only in the countries where these platforms tend to operate, but also on the platforms themselves. The platforms will invite more workers to be on there than there are tasks available. So, there’s this continued downward pressure on wages and conditions, because there’s always another worker who can take your place.One problem you point to is that there are significant barriers to organising workers in these atomised workplaces in which workers never encounter each other and are spatially dispersed. Despite this, you argue about the potential for actions by such workers. Can you talk more about the barriers they face to organising and the tactics available to them? Microworkers find themselves in an odd position where they have a lot of potential power but it is very difficult to realise that power. A general strike across multiple microwork platforms could cause chaos: social-media feeds being suddenly swamped with traumatic and pornographic content; Google’s search functions no longer operating properly; influencers complaining because their videos were not being ranked properly. The recent outages of social media platforms – Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram – revealed something that we already suspected, which is just how dependent many of us are on social media for our communication and our sense of wellbeing (often a highly dubious and ugly form of  wellbeing). It showed that microworkers, in particular, and content moderators in countries like the Philippines, have the potential to cause all kinds of problems to these sites. But it’s really hard to organise the kind of action that would have this kind of impact because workers work remotely and they’re often existing in contexts where labour organisation is very difficult or illegal: refugee camps, prisons. Then, of course, there is the nature of the platforms themselves, which make it very difficult for microworkers to organise because they’re set up to privilege the interests of contractors. There’s basically no way for workers to communicate which means they rely on external forums, mainly Reddit threads. One strategy that I look at in the book is data sabotage, wherein workers from a number of platforms would agree to sabotage tasks at the same time, and for an extended period, like the Luddites in the 19th century. On online platforms, this wouldn’t involve smashing machines, but rather preventing the circulation of data that powers big tech companies. This strategy is quite problematic because it could lead to some workers being kicked off the platforms, or receiving low ratings for work (which ultimately would lead to them being kicked off the platforms). This is a serious disincentive to collective action. Your book gives such a clear sense of multiple crises of work: a diminished availability of full-time, secure and fulfilling work; the pandemic’s ‘great resignations’ and popular reassessments of the place of work in human life; workers being exposed to significant risk and the blurring of home and work life.  How do you see these trends developing in relation to online platform work?We’ve seen that microwork has grown over the pandemic, partly because microwork can be done from home. If you have a long-term illness or disability, you don’t have to go into a warehouse or a factory or an office. I’d also wager that microwork has grown because many have lost their jobs throughout the pandemic. Microwork was also the harbinger of the changes we saw over the pandemic. The level of surveillance, for instance, that many home workers have experienced, is a central feature of microwork. The increasing role of data extraction as well, which many of us have been exposed to by using Zoom and Teams – that’s always been central to microwork. Microwork might be seen as an experimental space, where new kinds of expropriation and capitalist management were being trialled long before the pandemic. The pandemic, then, operated as almost a bit of a shock doctrine for big tech, bringing in these methods and techniques, which have been tested out on work platforms and the gig economy, on a far broader scale. It does seem like a lot of the negative features of these kinds of platforms are now starting to be generalised to more workplaces.Where do consumers fit into this? It seems like we’re all producing data for free for companies all the time. What does this mean for power in the new digital economy and does it point to the need to democratise digital infrastructure? Democratising digital infrastructure is a really interesting idea. The fact that platforms are only profitable due to personal data I would say shows that in reality, we, as users of the sites, are key stakeholders in these businesses. But we have no say in how the sites operate, how they turn profits, how they treat their workers. Our social lives are at the whims of these eccentric billionaires. The pandemic consolidated just how central to our social existence these platforms are because we were using them more and more because we couldn’t go outside. And this consolidation and integration into our lives has been to such a degree that I would say there’s no longer a good argument for not treating them as public utilities. Is microwork the future of work? How can we fight for a better and more secure future?I think the growth of microwork is inevitable as things stand unless big tech is brought to heel. So in this sense, it is the future of work. But only one future. I think other futures are possible. The one I want to see is one where we work less. Where work is distributed more evenly, where workers have more say over the kinds of jobs they do and the purpose of their work. This will involve workers organising through institutions like unions, and workers movements will need to intersect with other kinds of movements, in particular the climate movement, which in the last five years has gone from strength to strength. Interview has been edited for length and clarity.Phil Jones’s Work Without the Worker is out now on Verso Books. Amelia Horgan’s Lost in Work is out now on Pluto Press.Enjoyed this article? Like Huck on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram. Latest on HuckPhotography17.07.2024In photos: the dogs of DogtownA new photobook documents Venice Beach’s four legged friends and their colourful cast of owners.Written by: Isaac MukActivism16.07.2024Inside the battle to stop coalAs the legal challenge against Britain’s first deep coal mine in 30 years reaches the High court, we talk to activists at the centre of the fight to stop it.Written by: Ben SmokeOutdoors15.07.2024In Photos: the highs and lows of the Euro 2024 finalFootball did not come home, but across London fans from all backgrounds came together to dream that it could.Written by: Ossi PiispanenPhotography12.07.2024A Vibrant Portrait of Afropunk in South African Townships TodayKarabo Mooki lifts the lid on Soweto’s countercultural scene, which offers a much-needed antidote to the systemic racism that endures in South Africa.Written by: Miss RosenCulture11.07.2024Dide is providing a voice for elite footballers and young people everywhereNo one knows who he is, not even his teammates, but the Premier League’s masked rapper blends cold flow and drill-informed beats to interrogate the world around him.Written by: Isaac MukPhotography09.07.2024On the Road with the Free Photographic Omnibus around 1970s BritainPhotographer Daniel Meadows took off around the UK in an old bus to capture a unique portrait of a changing nation.Written by: Miss RosenThis article has been taggedBooksActivismWork",https://www.huckmag.com/article/the-hidden-exploitation-powering-artificial-intelligence,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://tco.mutualcp.com/transforms/Huck/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none_ns/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-11.35.25.png?mtime=1679926066'}",{'@id': 'https://www.tcolondon.com#identity'},{'@id': '#creator'},The hidden exploitation powering artificial intelligence – and how to resist it,2021-10-19T00:00:00+01:00,2023-12-07T14:32:09+00:00,,The hidden exploitation powering artificial intelligence – and how to resist it,,{'@id': 'https://www.tcolondon.com#identity'},2021.0,{'@id': '#creator'},2023-03-27T15:07:46+01:00,en-gb,https://www.huckmag.com/article/the-hidden-exploitation-powering-artificial-intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeFacebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen wrote in blog post Sunday that the prevalence of hate speech on the platform had dropped by 50 percent over the past three years, and that “a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress” was false. “We don’t want to see hate on our platform, nor do our users or advertisers, and we are transparent about our work to remove it,” Rosen wrote. “What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect, our teams continually work to develop our systems, identify issues and build solutions.”The post appeared to be in response to a Sunday article in the Wall Street Journal, which said the Facebook employees tasked with keeping offensive content off the platform don’t believe the company is able to reliably screen for it. The WSJ report states that internal documents show that two years ago, Facebook reduced the time that human reviewers focused on hate speech complaints, and made other adjustments that reduced the number of complaints. That in turn helped create the appearance that Facebook’s artificial intelligence had been more successful in enforcing the company’s rules than it actually was, according to the WSJ.A team of Facebook employees found in March that the company’s automated systems were removing posts which generated between 3 and 5 percent of the views of hate speech on the social platform, and less than 1 percent of all content that was in violation of its rules against violence and incitement, the WSJ reported.But Rosen argued that focusing on content removals alone was “the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech.” He says the technology to remove hate speech is just one method Facebook uses to fight it. “We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it,” Rosen said. Instead, he said, the company believes focusing on the prevalence of hate speech people actually see on the platform and how it reduces it using various tools is a more important measure. He claimed that for every 10,000 views of a piece of content on Facebook, there were five views of hate speech. “Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it,” Rosen wrote. “It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress, as it provides the most complete picture.”But the internal documents obtained by the WSJ showed some significant pieces of content were able to evade Facebook’s detection, including videos of car crashes that showed people with graphic injuries, and violent threats against trans children. The WSJ has produced a series of reports about Facebook based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. She testified before Congress that the company was aware of the negative impact its Instagram platform could have on teenagers. Facebook has disputed the reporting based on the internal documents.

Late last month, people across the globe gathered online for the second Annual Artificial Intelligence for Information Accessibility Conference (AI4IA), organised by UNESCO. Fittingly for an AI conference, it was hosted on the Gather.Town platform, which allows for virtual customisable spaces to be built, mimicking physical conference spaces where attendees dip in and out of pre-recorded sessions held in “pavilions” by speakers from around the world. They could also create an online avatar and “chat” to people nearby. Imagine a video game, but one that’s an industry conference where the highest level is the chance to attend an interactive “live salon”.
Such advanced technology is usually the preserve of China or Japan or South Korea, but at AI4IA, India was a visible presence. Abhishek Singh, CEO of the Indian government’s National E-Governance Division and MyGov.in, told the conference that India was well positioned to take a leading role in AI in the future, saying that India could become the “garage of AI tech in the world”, and that the country is one of the “largest AI startup nations, building AI-based solutions for the world”.
The claims are ambitious. Certainly, India has a large population of IT-trained professionals, and a tech-savvy population. But just how poised is it to take a leading role in our robot-ruled future?
India is positioned high on global charts tracking AI industry development and technology adoption.
Rather well, it appears. India has had a national AI strategy in place for three years, and the sector is attracting record amounts of government funding. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in the number of AI patent applications: according to the tech industry trade body Nasscom, in the past five years, more than 4,000 such patents have been filed. In the previous five years, from 2011–2016, just 1,000 patents were filed. India is positioned high on global charts tracking AI industry development and technology adoption, and the private sector has already shown enthusiasm for the benefits of leaning in to the vast new possibilities that AI brings. India’s AI market is expected to reach $US7.8 billion by 2025.
In 2018, the Indian government released its National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence under the mandate of the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), a particularly forward-looking and strangely efficient government department. The strategy is laudably wide-ranging and responsive to India’s needs, focusing on economic growth and the technology needs to increase social inclusion as well as promote issues including privacy and ethics. The overarching goal is “making India the global leader in AI, ensuring responsible and transformational AI for all”. But there is heft behind the hubris: as of 2020, the sector’s funding is set at US$949 million. It’s not inconsequential, particularly compared to the United Kingdom, whose budget is US$1.3 billion – not much more, considering it’s a developed country with far higher labour and infrastructure costs.

The strategy aims to develop the AI industry in India through grants, support to startups, development of products and solutions, and working with industry. The country already has a thriving AI research industry, with work being done on data analytics and language processing, much of it driven by top-tier universities, such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), which also receive funding from global tech giants. 
India also has a thriving startup scene, and the majority of venture capital investments are now flowing towards AI-based initiatives, such as chatbots and other conversational interfaces, diagnostic screening and databases for banking and healthcare consumers. The majority of the patents being filed are in the electronics and healthcare industries.
India has taken the lead in developing a number of bilateral agreements specifically geared towards the industry.
This year’s Artificial Intelligence Index, released by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HAI), noted India’s relative prominence. Its Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which ranks each country according to research output, economy and inclusion, listed India as sixth in the world, ahead of Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. And in HAI’s 2021 annual report, India is highlighted for its various industry advancements. India is second only to Brazil in the growth in AI industry hiring, based on 2020 numbers, and topped the list for AI skills penetration – people with AI skills being hired in various industries. India also has the highest global gender parity when it comes to skills penetration rates – notable in an industry where, as a whole, women remain a minority according to a recent UNESCO report. India comes in at number eight for private investment funding of each country’s AI sector, although it is still a fraction of the leading country, the United States. Meanwhile, India has taken the lead in developing a number of bilateral agreements specifically geared towards the industry.
However, there are some shortcomings and warning signs. One is privacy. Even though the national strategy highlights the need for privacy, specific policies are not yet in place. Startups, too, need a policy framework, as well as more financial support and mentorship to develop innovations and take them to market. The patent process is longwinded, taking around four years from start to finish, and needs streamlining.
And while the success in developing India’s AI industry in such a short time should be applauded, there is one overwhelming question looming over the entire industry: for a country that so desperately needs more jobs for its ever-growing workforce, is automation and the rise of robots really the best way forward?

Tumours in breasts with dense tissue are more difficult to detect. Artificial intelligence can simplify the job, a new study shows.
The new study is based on screening using an MRI. But women with dense breast tissue who are covered by the Norwegian mammography programme are not offered this type of screening.

A woman's breasts are usually mostly fat, along with mammary glands.But some women have breasts with much more glandular tissue than others. The glandular tissue is generally called dense breast tissue. Women with this kind of breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer.It is also more difficult to detect cancerous growths in this kind of tissue using conventional mammography.Fewer helping hands in the futureMRI scans provide more detailed images than conventional mammography. At the same time, it takes a lot of time for radiologists to go through MRI images to assess them for tumours.

Now, researchers at a university hospital in the Netherlands have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can do some of this work.“We know that there will be fewer hands available per patient in the health care system in the future, which makes it important to find methods that enable us to solve our tasks with fewer resources,” Solveig Roth Hoff wrote in an email to sciencenorway.no.Hoff is a section chief physician at Ålesund Hospital and studies imaging techniques that can detect breast cancer at the hospital and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU.











The development of artificial intelligence in imaging is an important focus area, says Solveig Roth Hoff.

Pick out breasts without tumoursMore than 4,500 women participated in the Dutch MRI study. All had extremely dense breast tissue.The task for the artificial intelligence was to pick out breasts without tumours.The idea is that AI will save doctors from having to look through thousands of images of healthy breasts. That leaves them more time to concentrate on women who may have cancer.A good startArtificial intelligence, which is basically a computer program, identified 40 per cent of the healthy breasts.And none of the breasts that actually contained cancerous tumours were misclassified by the program.“The results were better than expected,” said Erik Verburg at University Medical Center Utrecht in a press release. Verburg is one of the researchers behind the new study.“Forty per cent is a good start. At the same time, we still have sixty per cent to improve,” Verburg said.Practiced on images from seven hospitalsThe intelligent computer program was set up so that it could practice with some MRI images. It had to try to use what it had learned to assess the rest.

The study included MRI images from eight hospitals.The artificial intelligence practiced recognizing normal breasts in images from seven of the hospitals.The computer program relied on the assessment of the images that doctors had made. After the artificial intelligence had trained itself, it tested itself on images from the eighth hospital.Then the whole procedure was repeated seven more times, so that each hospital was used to test the program.No MRI for dense breast tissue in NorwayBut even though this approach is a common way to create computer programs that can teach themselves, it’s not a given that it will work as well with other MRI images.“It is important that artificial intelligence programs be properly tested and validated before they are available for commercial use. This kind of program has to be tested on several different types of data sets from different hospitals, machines and populations,” Hoff said.In Norway, however, it is not common for women with dense breast tissue to be referred for an MRI examination.Applies to only five per centNataliia Moshina has investigated whether Norway’s mammography programme should be changed so that women with dense breast tissue receive more follow-up.One change could involve offering these women more frequent mammography screening or offered other kinds of screening, such as MRI.Moshina concluded in her doctoral dissertation in 2017 that it’s too early for Norway to make this change.First, doctors need a better method to figure out which women actually have dense breast tissue, she said.Her research indicates that only five per cent of women who are screened in Norway have breasts with dense tissue.Could have been useful for another groupSome women in Norway are already being offered MRI screening for breast cancer. These women generally have congenital genetic problems that give them a much higher than average risk of breast cancer.“This is not such a very large population, but a (AI) program that could enable us to use fewer resources on this patient group would be useful, of course,” Hoff said.At the same time, it is not certain that the Dutch computer program would have worked on breasts from this group.To know if this screening approach would work for women with a predisposition to breast cancer, researchers would have had to test the program on these women in their study, Hoff said.ReferenceErik Verburg et al.: Deep Learning for Automated Triaging of 4581 Breast MRI Examinations from the DENSE Trial, Radiology 10/2021

Dr. Pierre Baldi, a UCI distinguished professor of the School of Information and Computer Sciences, describes the evolving field of deep learning in his new book “Deep Learning in Science.” 
Baldi begins his book by establishing its main idea: intelligence. While many may have trouble understanding the meaning of intelligence, taking a broader approach towards the subject allows for a clearer distinction between how it is defined and applied to both brains and machines. Following this section, Baldi introduces carbon-based and silicon-based computing, systems in mechanical devices made up of carbon and silicon material. Deep learning, which is the ability to analyze data that mimics the functions of the human brain, has a long and developed history, which Baldi also briefly covers. He then goes on to explain the significant connection between deep learning and neuroscience. 
While focusing on these developmental factors of deep learning, Baldi encourages readers to reassess their conceptions of deep learning by asking scientific questions. Baldi provides a guide of exercises throughout his book so that readers can more easily absorb basic concepts. Through the rest of the book, Baldi applies such principles to physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. 
As a researcher at UCI’s Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, Baldi focuses his work on AI and machine learning. He is driven by his interest in understanding both natural and artificial. When asked about his research work in these fields, Baldi stated that much of his new book focuses on the work he has already done at UCI.
The New University had the chance to sit down with Baldi and discuss “Deep Learning in Science.” The discussion ranged from the definition of deep learning to his own research on the subject.
New University: At the beginning of this book, you pose the following research goal: “to understand intelligence in brains and machines.” Does this mean that a distinction of intelligence can be formed between both, in which they may be compared or contrasted? 
Baldi: “It is not a simple question because we don’t truly know what intelligence is. It is not something very well-defined. We are only at the beginning of understanding intelligence in many ways, so we don’t know how many different types of intelligence there are. It is very possible that there are different forms of achieving intelligence. The way in which it is achieved, like in computers, may have similarities and also differences from the way in which biology achieves intelligence in the human brain. As a researcher, one of the questions I ask myself every day is, ‘should I try to copy the brain and what we know about it, or should I go in a completely different direction?’ This is a recurrent theme for those of us who do research in this area.” 
New University: A fundamental part of this work is taking a dive into the concept of deep learning. What exactly is deep learning, for those who may not know?
Baldi: “Deep learning is a rebranding of what used to be called neurometrics. We can use either term. It is the same thing. Neurometrics are networks of very simple model neurons that we use when we do all kinds of experiments, simulations and learning. We want machines and computers to learn from data, so we use these neurometrics that are inspired by our brains. There are networks of small neurons that are connected by synaptic weights, which represent the strength of the connection between any two neurons. Learning, in this way, is the process of tweaking these weights. We change the weights so that the neurons communicate in different ways and are able to implement different functions.” 
New University: You discuss applications of deep learning in areas of the natural sciences. What were some of the most interesting findings in relation to these applications? 
Baldi: “I use it in the natural sciences. However, what is a little surprising for someone who doesn’t know the field is that deep learning can be applied so broadly. I work with physicists, chemists, biologists and medical doctors. I am not an expert of all of these disciplines, but how is it possible to work with all of these professionals? The best analogy I can give you is that deep learning is like linear regression: drawing lines with many points. If you can do linear regression, you can apply those techniques into any area since it does not matter. I can work with experts in a specific field and help understand and analyze the data they acquire. We have made many discoveries. One example [of] using these techniques is improving how we use particle colliders in high energy physics. Protons collide at a very high speed, resulting in a shower of the rise of particles. Complex detectors detect these signals, and you want to make sense of the signals to detect if a particular particle was reduced in the collision. Deep learning can be applied to these problems, showing that we can improve the accuracy of this detection by a very significant percentage. It is now used everywhere.”
New University: How do these findings connect to your own research for UCI’s Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems? 
Baldi: “To be quite honest, most of the book comes from my own research. The first part of the book is about the mathematical aspect of deep learning, where I present some of the results I have contributed and the results others also have. I try to give an overview. The chapters of application, to a larger extent, showcase applications that were done in my research group. I had to make a choice and decided to focus primarily on the things I knew best.”
New University: Finally, what are some current or upcoming projects you can share?
Baldi: “My research is divided into theory and application. On the application side, I am currently working with chemists to use deep learning to predict chemical reactions. We are working our way towards being able to apply this to atmospheric chemistry, for example, in order to assess problems like global warming. On the theory side, I work on that myself, but do so with mathematicians at UCI to understand why deep learning works so well. I am working to understand how we move forward to build systems that are more intelligent than the ones we have today.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken on many new shapes and use cases as experts learn more about what’s possible with big data and smart algorithms. 
Today’s AI market, then, consists of a mixture of tried-and-true smart technologies with new optimizations and advanced AI that is slowly transforming the way we do work and live daily life. 
Read on to learn about some artificial intelligence trends that are making experts most excited for the future of AI:
5 Trends to Watch in AI Solutions

Intelligent and hyper-automated business processes
Emphasis on responsible AI development
AI as a tool for global good
AI and IoT working together
The emergence of decision intelligence

More on the AI market: Artificial Intelligence Market
1. Intelligent and hyper-automated business processes
With its ability to follow basic tasks and routines based on smart programming and algorithms, artificial intelligence is becoming embedded in the way organizations automate their business processes. 
AIOps and MLops are common use cases for AI and automation, but the breadth and depth of what AI can automate in the enterprise is quickly growing.
Bali D.R., SVP at Infosys, a global digital services and consulting firm, believes that AI is moving toward a certain level of hyper-automation, partially in response to the unexpected changes in manual data and procedures caused by the pandemic.
“We are in the second inflection point for AI — as it graduates from consumer AI, towards enterprise-grade AI,” D.R. said. “Being exposed to an over-reliance on manual procedures, such as mass rescheduling in the airline industry, unprecedented loan applications in banks, etc., the industries are now turning to hyper-automation that combines robotic process automation with modern machine learning to ensure they can better handle surges in the future.”
Although AI automation is still mostly limited to interval and task-oriented automation that requires little imagination or guesswork on the part of the tool, some experts believe we are moving closer to more applications for intelligent automation.
David Tareen, director for artificial intelligence at SAS, a top analytics and AI software company, had this to say about the future of intelligent automation:
“Intelligent automation is an area I expect to grow,” Tareen said. “Just like we automated manufacturing work, we will use AI heavily to automate knowledge work. 
“The complexity comes in because knowledge work has a high degree of variability. For example, an organization will receive feedback on their products or services in different ways and often in different languages as well. AI will need to ingest, understand, and modify processes in real-time before we can automate knowledge work at large.”

2. Emphasis on responsible AI development
Because of the depth of big data and AI’s reliance on it, there’s always the possibility that unethical or ill-prepared data will make it into an AI training data set or model. 
As more companies recognize the importance of creating AI that conducts its operations in a compliant and ethical manner, a number of AI developers and service providers are starting to offer responsible AI solutions to their customers.
Read Maloney, SVP of marketing at H2O.ai, a top AI and hybrid cloud company, explained what exactly responsible AI is and some of the different initiatives that companies are undertaking to improve their AI ethics. 
“AI creates incredible new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world,” Maloney said. “We take the responsibility to mitigate risks as core to our work, so building fairness, interpretability, security, and privacy into our AI solutions is key.” 
Maloney said the market is seeing an “increased adoption of the core pillars of responsible AI,” which he shared with Datamation:

Explainable AI and interpretable ML: The ability to explain a model after it has been developed and providing transparent model architectures, which allows human users to both understand the data and trust results.
Ethical AI: Provides sociological fairness in machine learning predictions (i.e., whether one category of person is being weighted unequally and eliminating historical human bias).
Secure AI: Debugging and deploying ML models to keep security and privacy at the forefront.
Human-centered AI: Where AI learns from human input and collaboration. Systems are continuously improving because of human input and bridging the gap between human and machine.
Compliance: Ensuring AI systems meet the relevant regulatory requirements or regulations.

Companies are exploring several ways to make their AI more responsible, and most are starting with cleaning and assessing both data sets and existing AI models.
Brian Gilmore, director of IoT product management at InfluxData, a database solutions company, believes that one of the top options for model and data set management is distributed ledger technology (DLT).
“As attention builds around the ethical and cultural impact of AI, some organizations are beginning to invest in ancillary but important technologies that utilize consensus and other trust-ensuring systems as a part of the AI framework,” Gilmore said. “For example, distributed ledger technology provides a sidecar platform for auditable proof of integrity for models and training data. 
“The decentralized ownership, distribution of access, and shared accountability of DLT can bring significant transparency to AI development and application across the board. The dilemma is whether for-profit corporations are willing to participate in a community model, trading transparency for consumer trust in something as mission critical as AI.”

3. AI as a tool for global good
Up to this point, AI has most frequently been used to optimize business processes and automate some home routines for consumers. 
However, some experts are beginning to realize the potential that AI-powered models can have for solving global issues.
Read Maloney at H2O.ai has worked with people from a variety of industries to brainstorm how AI can be used for the greater good.
“We work with many like-minded customers, partners, and organizations tackling issues from education, conservation, health care, and more,” Maloney said. “AI for good is fundamental to not only our work, including current work on climate change, wildfires, and hurricane predictions, but we are seeing more and more AI for good work to make the world a better place across the AI industry.”
Some of the most exciting applications of altruistic AI are being implemented in early education right now.
For instance, Helen Thomas, CEO of DMAI, an AI-powered health care and education company, offers an AI-powered product to ensure that preschool-aged children are getting the education they need, despite potential pandemic setbacks:
“On top of pre-existing barriers to preschool education, including cost and access, recent research findings suggest children born during the COVID-19 pandemic display lower IQ scores than those born before January 2020, which means toddlers are less prepared for school than ever before. 
“DMAI DBA  Animal Island Learning Adventure (AILA) is changing this with AI. [Our product] harnesses cognitive AI to deliver appropriate lessons in a consistent and repetitious format, supportive of natural learning patterns
“Recognizing learning patterns that parents might miss, the AI creates an adaptive learning journey and doesn’t allow the child to move forward until they’ve mastered the skills and concepts presented. This intentional delivery also increases attention span over time, ensuring children step into the classroom with the social-emotional intelligence to succeed.”

4. AI and IoT working together
Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become incredibly widespread among both enterprise and personal users, but what many tech companies still struggle with is how to gather actionable insights from the constant inflow of data from these devices. 
AIoT, or the idea of combining artificial intelligence with IoT products, is one field that is starting to address these pools of unused data, giving AI the power to translate that data quickly and intelligently.
Bill Scudder, SVP and AIoT general manager at AspenTech, an industrial AI solutions company, believes that AIoT is one of the most crucial fields for enabling more intelligent, real-time business decisions.
“Forrester has noted that up to 73% of all data collected within the enterprise goes unused, which highlights a critical challenge with IoT,” Scudder said. “As the volume of connected devices — for example, in industrial IoT settings — continues to increase, so does the volume of data collected from these devices. 
“This has resulted in a trend seen across many industries: the need to marry AI and IoT. And here’s why: where IoT allows connected devices to create and transmit data from various sources, AI can take that data one step further, translating data into actionable insights to fuel faster, more intelligent business decisions. This is giving way to the rising trend of artificial intelligence of things or AIoT.”
5. The emergence of decision intelligence
Decision intelligence (DI) is one of the newest artificial intelligence concepts that takes many current business optimizations a step farther, by using AI models to analyze wide-ranging sets of commercial data. These analyses are used to predict future outcomes for everything from products to customers to supply chains.
Sorcha Gilroy, data science team lead at Peak, a commercial AI solutions provider, explained that although decision intelligence is a fairly new concept, it’s already gaining traction with larger enterprises because of its detailed business intelligence (BI) offerings. 
“Decision intelligence is a new category of software that facilitates the commercial application of artificial intelligence, providing predictive insight and recommended actions to users,” Gilroy said. “It is outcome focused, meaning a solution must deliver against a business need before it can be classed as DI.
“Recognized by Gartner and IDC, it has the potential to be the biggest software category in the world and is already being utilized by businesses across a variety of use cases, from personalizing shopper experiences to streamlining complex supply chains. Brands such as Nike, PepsiCo, and ASOS are known to be using DI already.”

Computer Scientist Wins $1 Million Artificial Intelligence PrizeTOPICS:Artificial IntelligenceDuke University By Duke University October 17, 2021The AAAI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity recognizes the positive impacts of artificial intelligence to protect, enhance, and improve human life in meaningful ways with long-lived effects.






 Duke professor becomes second recipient of AAAI Squirrel AI Award for pioneering socially responsible AI.Whether preventing explosions on electrical grids, spotting patterns among past crimes, or optimizing resources in the care of critically ill patients, Duke University computer scientist Cynthia Rudin wants artificial intelligence (AI) to show its work. Especially when it’s making decisions that deeply affect people’s lives.While many scholars in the developing field of machine learning were focused on improving algorithms, Rudin instead wanted to use AI’s power to help society. She chose to pursue opportunities to apply machine learning techniques to important societal problems, and in the process, realized that AI’s potential is best unlocked when humans can peer inside and understand what it is doing.

Now, after 15 years of advocating for and developing “interpretable” machine learning algorithms that allow humans to see inside AI, Rudin’s contributions to the field have earned her the $1 million Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Founded in 1979, AAAI serves as the prominent international scientific society serving AI researchers, practitioners and educators.Rudin, a professor of computer science and engineering at Duke, is the second recipient of the new annual award, funded by the online education company Squirrel AI to recognize achievements in artificial intelligence in a manner comparable to top prizes in more traditional fields.She is being cited for “pioneering scientific work in the area of interpretable and transparent AI systems in real-world deployments, the advocacy for these features in highly sensitive areas such as social justice and medical diagnosis, and serving as a role model for researchers and practitioners.”“Only world-renowned recognitions, such as the Nobel Prize and the A.M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery, carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” said AAAI awards committee chair and past president Yolanda Gil. “Professor Rudin’s work highlights the importance of transparency for AI systems in high-risk domains. Her courage in tackling controversial issues calls out the importance of research to address critical challenges in responsible and ethical use of AI.”






Rudin’s first applied project was a collaboration with Con Edison, the energy company responsible for powering New York City. Her assignment was to use machine learning to predict which manholes were at risk of exploding due to degrading and overloaded electrical circuitry. But she soon discovered that no matter how many newly published academic bells and whistles she added to her code, it struggled to meaningfully improve performance when confronted by the challenges posed by working with handwritten notes from dispatchers and accounting records from the time of Thomas Edison.“We were getting more accuracy from simple classical statistics techniques and a better understanding of the data as we continued to work with it,” Rudin said. “If we could understand what information the predictive models were using, we could ask the Con Edison engineers for useful feedback that improved our whole process. It was the interpretability in the process that helped improve accuracy in our predictions, not any bigger or fancier machine learning model. That’s what I decided to work on, and it is the foundation upon which my lab is built.”Over the next decade, Rudin developed techniques for interpretable machine learning, which are predictive models that explain themselves in ways that humans can understand. While the code for designing these formulas is complex and sophisticated, the formulas might be small enough to be written in a few lines on an index card.Rudin has applied her brand of interpretable machine learning to numerous impactful projects. With collaborators Brandon Westover and Aaron Struck at Massachusetts General Hospital, and her former student Berk Ustun, she designed a simple point-based system that can predict which patients are most at risk of having destructive seizures after a stroke or other brain injury. And with her former MIT student Tong Wang and the Cambridge Police Department, she developed a model that helps discover commonalities between crimes to determine whether they might be part of a series committed by the same criminals. That open-source program eventually became the basis of the New York Police Department’s Patternizr algorithm, a powerful piece of code that determines whether a new crime committed in the city is related to past crimes.“Cynthia’s commitment to solving important real-world problems, desire to work closely with domain experts, and ability to distill and explain complex models is unparalleled,” said Daniel Wagner, deputy superintendent of the Cambridge Police Department. “Her research resulted in significant contributions to the field of crime analysis and policing. More impressively, she is a strong critic of potentially unjust ‘black box’ models in criminal justice and other high-stakes fields, and an intense advocate for transparent interpretable models where accurate, just and bias-free results are essential.”Black box models are the opposite of Rudin’s transparent codes. The methods applied in these AI algorithms make it impossible for humans to understand what factors the models depend on, which data the models are focusing on and how they’re using it. While this may not be a problem for trivial tasks such as distinguishing a dog from a cat, it could be a huge problem for high-stakes decisions that change people’s lives.






“Cynthia is changing the landscape of how AI is used in societal applications by redirecting efforts away from black box models and toward interpretable models by showing that the conventional wisdom—that black boxes are typically more accurate—is very often false,” said Jun Yang, chair of the computer science department at Duke. “This makes it harder to justify subjecting individuals (such as defendants) to black-box models in high-stakes situations. The interpretability of Cynthia’s models has been crucial in getting them adopted in practice, since they enable human decision-makers, rather than replace them.”One impactful example involves COMPAS—an AI algorithm used across multiple states to make bail parole decisions that was accused by a ProPublica investigation of partially using race as a factor in its calculations. The accusation is difficult to prove, however, as the details of the algorithm are proprietary information, and some important aspects of the analysis by ProPublica are questionable. Rudin’s team has demonstrated that a simple interpretable model that reveals exactly which factors it’s taking into consideration is just as good at predicting whether or not a person will commit another crime. This begs the question, Rudin says, as to why black box models need to be used at all for these types of high-stakes decisions.“We’ve been systematically showing that for high-stakes applications, there’s no loss in accuracy to gain interpretability, as long as we optimize our models carefully,” Rudin said. “We’ve seen this for criminal justice decisions, numerous healthcare decisions including medical imaging, power grid maintenance decisions, financial loan decisions and more. Knowing that this is possible changes the way we think about AI as incapable of explaining itself.”Throughout her career, Rudin has not only been creating these interpretable AI models, but developing and publishing techniques to help others do the same. That hasn’t always been easy. When she first began publishing her work, the terms “data science” and “interpretable machine learning” did not exist, and there were no categories into which her research fit neatly, which means that editors and reviewers didn’t know what to do with it. Cynthia found that if a paper wasn’t proving theorems and claiming its algorithms to be more accurate, it was—and often still is—more difficult to publish.As Rudin continues to help people and publish her interpretable designs—and as more concerns continue to crop up with black box code—her influence is finally beginning to turn the ship. There are now entire categories in machine learning journals and conferences devoted to interpretable and applied work. Other colleagues in the field and their collaborators are vocalizing how important interpretability is for designing trustworthy AI systems.






“I have had enormous admiration for Cynthia from very early on, for her spirit of independence, her determination, and her relentless pursuit of true understanding of anything new she encountered in classes and papers,” said Ingrid Daubechies, the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, one of the world’s preeminent researchers in signal processing, and one of Rudin’s PhD advisors at Princeton University. “Even as a graduate student, she was a community builder, standing up for others in her cohort. She got me into machine learning, as it was not an area in which I had any expertise at all before she gently but very persistently nudged me into it. I am so very glad for this wonderful and very deserved recognition for her!”“I could not be more thrilled to see Cynthia’s work honored in this way,” added Rudin’s second PhD advisor, Microsoft Research partner Robert Schapire, whose work on “boosting” helped lay the foundations for modern machine learning. “For her inspiring and insightful research, her independent thinking that has led her in directions very different from the mainstream, and for her longstanding attention to issues and problems of practical, societal importance.”Rudin earned undergraduate degrees in mathematical physics and music theory from the University at Buffalo before completing her PhD in applied and computational mathematics at Princeton. She then worked as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at New York University, and as an associate research scientist at Columbia University. She became an associate professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining Duke’s faculty in 2017, where she holds appointments in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and statistical science.She is a three-time recipient of the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, which recognizes creative and unique applications of analytical techniques, and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.“I want to thank AAAI and Squirrel AI for creating this award that I know will be a game-changer for the field,” Rudin said. “To have a ‘Nobel Prize’ for AI to help society makes it finally clear without a doubt that this topic—AI work for the benefit for society—is actually important.”

Machine learning (ML), a commonly used type of artificial intelligence (AI), is one of the fastest-growing fields in technology. 
Especially as the workplace, products, and service expectations are changing through digital transformations, more companies are leaning into machine learning solutions to optimize, automate, and simplify their operations. 
So what does ML technology look like today and where is it heading in the future? Read on to learn about some of the top trends in machine learning today.
5 Trends to Watch in Machine Learning

Automation through MLOps
ML democratization and broadening access
Achieving scalability through containerization
APIs and wider availability of prepackaged tools
ML and time series solutions for future planning

More on the ML market: Machine Learning Market
1. Automation through MLOps
Many businesses are investing significant time and resources into ML development because they recognize its potential for automation. 
When an ML model is designed with business processes in mind, it can automate a variety of business functions across marketing, sales, HR, and even network security. MLOps and AutoML are two of the most popular applications of machine learning today, giving teams the ability to automate tasks and bring DevOps principles to machine learning use cases.
Read Maloney, SVP of marketing at H2O.ai, a top AI and hybrid cloud company, believes that both MLOps and AutoML strategies eliminate several traditional business blockers. 
“Scaling AI for the enterprise requires a new set of tools and skills designed for modern infrastructure and collaboration,” Maloney said. “Teams using manual deployment and management find they are quickly strapped for resources and after getting a few models into production, cannot scale beyond that. 
“Machine learning operations (MLOps), is the set of practices and technology that enable organizations to scale and manage AI in production, essentially bringing the development practice of DevOps to machine learning. MLOps helps data science and IT teams collaborate and empowers IT teams to lead production machine learning projects, without having to rely on data science expertise.
“AutoML solves a few of the biggest blockers to ML adoption, including faster time to ROI and more quickly and easily developing models. AutoML automates key parts of the data science workflow to increase productivity, without compromising model quality, interpretability, and performance. 
“With AutoML, you can automate algorithm selection, feature generation, hyper-parameter tuning, iterative modeling, and model assessment. By automating repetitive tasks in the workflow, data scientists can focus on the data and the business problems they are trying to solve and speed time from experiment to impact.”
Automation through ML is desirable in theory, but in practice, it’s sometimes difficult for business leaders to envision how ML tools can optimize their business operations.
Amaresh Tripathy, SVP and global business leader at Genpact, a digital transformation and professional services firm, offered some common examples of how MLOps and MLOps-as-a-service help businesses in various industries.
“One [MLOps] example is using AI models to efficiently direct sales teams to identify the next best customer,” Tripathy said. “Another is optimizing pricing and revenue management systems using dynamic demand forecasting.”

2. ML democratization and broadening access
Machine learning is still considered a niche and complex technology to develop, but a growing segment of tech professionals are working to democratize the field, particularly by making ML solutions more widely accessible.
Jean-Francois Gagne, head of AI product and strategy at ServiceNow, a workflow management software company, believes that ML democratization involves creating easier access to develop and deploy ML models as well as giving more people access to useful ML training data.
“Good training data is often scarce,” Gagne said. “Low-data learning techniques are helping in enterprise AI use cases, where customers want to adapt pre-trained out-the-box models to their unique business context. In most cases, their own data sets are not that big, but methods such as transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and few-shot learning help minimize the amount of labeled training data needed for an application.”
ML democratization is also about creating tools that consider the backgrounds and use cases of a more diverse range of users.
Brian Gilmore, director of IoT product management at InfluxData, a database solutions company, believes that more users and developers are starting to recognize the benefit of a diverse team for developing ML solutions.
“Ignoring the technical for a moment, we must focus on the human aspects of AI as well,” Gilmore said. “There seems to be a trend building around the democratization of the ML ecosystem, bringing more diverse stakeholders to the table no matter where in the value chain.
“Bias is probably the single greatest obstacle to ML efficacy, and leading companies are learning to combat bias and build better applications by embracing diversity and inclusion (D&I).
“ML needs additional variety in training data, for sure. Still, we should also consider the positive impact of D&I on the teams that design, build, label, and deliver the ML-driven applications — this can genuinely differentiate ML products.”

3. Achieving scalability through containerization
ML developers are increasingly creating their models in containers. 
When a machine learning product is developed and deployed within a containerized environment, users can ensure that its operational power is not negatively impacted by other programs running on the server. More importantly, ML becomes more scalable through containerization, as the packaged model makes it possible to migrate and adjust ML workloads over time.
Ali Siddiqui, chief product officer at BMC, a SaaS company with a variety of ITOps solutions, believes that containerized development of machine learning is the best way forward, particularly in the case of digital enterprises incorporating autonomous operations.
“It’s trending to use machine learning workloads in containers,” Siddiqui said. “Containers allow autonomous digital enterprises to have isolation, portability, unlimited scalability, dynamic behavior, and rapid change through advanced enterprise DevOps processes. 
“ML workloads are typically spiky and require high scalability and in some cases, real-time stream processing. For instance, when you take a look at ML projects, they typically have two phases: algorithm creation and algorithm execution. The first involves a lot of data and data processing. The second typically requires a lot of compute power in production. Both can benefit from container deployment to ensure scalability and availability.”

4. APIs and wider availability of prepackaged tools
In another trending effort toward ML democratization, a number of ML developers have perfected their models over time and found ways to create template-like versions, available to a wider pool of users via API and other integrations.
Bali D.R., SVP at Infosys, a global digital services and consulting firm, believes that prepackaged ML tools, particularly via APIs and digital storefronts, are some of the most common and useful applications of machine learning today:
“API-fication of ML models is another key trend we are seeing, whether it is GPT3, CODEX, or even Hugging Face, where they train and deploy state-of-the-art NLP models and make them available as web APIs or Python packages for inferencing,” DR said. “[There’s also] AI stores with pre-trained models exposed via APIs, which provide a drag-and-drop option for AI development across enterprises.”

5. ML and time series solutions for future planning
Machine learning models can only improve their functionality over time if they are consistently fed new data in intervals. Since so many ML models rely on timeline-based updates, a number of ML solutions are using a time series approach to improve the model’s understanding of the what, when, and why behind different data sets.
Read Maloney of H2O.ai explained why time series solutions are necessary for truly predictive ML:
“On a long enough horizon, all problems eventually become time series problems,” Maloney said. “ML is a phenomenal method for predicting events in real-time, and as we observe these predictions over time, we need more and more time series solutions. 
“Every business needs to make predictions, whether forecasting sales, estimating product demand, or predicting future inventory levels. In all cases, data is necessary as well as specific techniques and tools to account for time.”

1. Composer and Beethoven biographer Jan Swafford was asked to respond to the “10th symphony” created with artificial intelligence. “At the end of the symphony I found myself more philosophical than annoyed,” he writes.
The ability of a machine to do or outdo something humans do is interesting once at most… When it comes to art, we need to see a woman or a man struggling with the universal mediocrity that is the natural lot of all of us and somehow out of some mélange of talent, skill, and luck doing the impossible, making something happen that is splendid and moving—or funny, or frightening, or whatever the artist set out to do… Here’s my assertion: True intelligence is in a body. Intelligence outside a living body, as some sort of abstraction, is innately impossible, or should be given another name.
Swafford points out (like Nick Cave has) that part of the beauty of Beethoven is, “in contrast say to Mozart and Bach, with him it’s often as if you can hear the effort, the struggle, hear in the notes what it cost him to rise above the universal mediocrity.”
He writes of his late friend, the painter Francis Gillespie:
She would spend a year or more on a painting of flowers, struggling to represent them with virtually photographic accuracy. In fact, as she knew perfectly well, she didn’t have the technique to do that. “I’m really sort of a primitive,” Fran would say grimly as she worked. But what makes her paintings hers is exactly the grand failure of her attempt. Her pictures are beautiful, close to photos, but always a little off, and the offness makes them singular.
Ted Gioia calls this “an aesthetics of imperfection.”
In this story, the human has something the machine can never have.

2. In Sam Anderson’s profile of Laurie Anderson, he notes that the artist has “become obsessed, lately, with artificial intelligence.” She worked with researchers to make text engines in her style, the style of her late husband, Lou Reed, and an Anderson/Reed blend of the two. Anderson says a 1/3 of what the computer spits out is junk, 1/3 is boring, but 1/3 is “surprising, even authentic, some kind of fresh magic.”
Sometimes she sits there with the hunger of an addict, feeding words and pictures into the engine, seeing what comes out. For a long time, she would save the texts. They felt so precious. After a while, though, she realized that the texts were infinite. She could have one whenever she needed it. So she read them and then let them go.
At one point, Laurie Anderson reeds a poem the machine spit out in Reed’s style. It’s not bad. “Wonderful,” she says. “Just great. He’s talking to me from somewhere else. I definitely do feel that. The line is pretty thin for me.”
(This scene reminded me of something out of Don Hertzfeldt’s World of Tomorrow.)
In this story, the machine gives the human a combination of something it had and something it never had.

3. I am sympathetic to Swafford’s assertion that “intelligence is in a body” and “the aesthetics of imperfection.”
I also know that some of my favorite art came out of the interplay between human and machine. It is between the two that a third thing emerges — Beethoven, after all, was wrangling notes out of a machine with keys.
I think it is worth noting the difference between analog and digital machines. Analog machines, I would venture, give you more mistakes that you can work with — a brush runs out of ink, and the dry texture gives you new marks, Lee Perry blows ganja smoke and dirt on a tape reel, and new sounds emerge. (You throw dirt in a laptop and you’ll simply fry the machine.) That said, even digital machines  and pieces of software have quirks and we ascribe them personalities, and work with them.
I would also note the difference between words and music. Words are more abstract than music. They are more easily fed into a computer and spit back out. They also must be interpreted by us — when we read the poem in the style of Reed, summoned from the computer, it is already an abstract, linear text. We must interpret the words. Music is not interpreted. It is what it is. It is heard.
I confess I have gone from being cranky to curious about A.I., and I wonder what sorts of grunt work it could do for me. (Could it spit out a book proposal?)
In my story, the machines help us to honor what is not machine-like in us.

Automation is becoming a top priority in many markets, especially as the remote workforce grows and workforce shortages displace traditional models of work in favor of more sustainable solutions. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) development is one of the leading forces in the automation drive, with expectations that AI will lead to a $15.7 trillion, or 26%, increase in global GDP by 2030, according to PwC’s “Global Artificial Intelligence Study.”
As AI automation continues to enable new products and workplace solutions, many people have understandably grown concerned about their job security as AI takes over more daily tasks. But is artificial intelligence-enabled automation actually removing jobs, or is it simply changing the way we work? 
Read on to learn about how AI automation is disrupting traditional jobs and how workplaces and employees alike can ensure workers’ security in the long run:

AI as an automation-enabling technology
AI is increasingly finding its way into homes but even more so in businesses, where automated insights and operations speed up processes and decrease the chances of user error. 
Here are some of the top business priorities that are being automated through AI:

Customer service: Through chatbots, virtual assistants, and curated search recommendations, customers can guide their buying decisions autonomously and on their own time.
Smart factories and assembly line automation: Manufacturing has always been a dangerous and time-consuming industry when human workers act as the primary engine. AI-based automation has entered into many factories and assembly lines, enabling a new class of machine-built and -packaged products as well as self-healing equipment on the assembly line.
AIOps and MLOps: Many businesses have leaned into AI and machine learning (ML) for operations automation, using AI to enhance projects like security monitoring and audits.
Data mining and analytics: AI is being programmed to handle data entry and basic data analytics and reporting, leaving employees with more time to focus on tasks that require specialized skill.

Jobs disrupted by AI automation
AI as a replacement for human work
A growing number of people fear that their jobs will be replaced by robots, and while that doesn’t look too likely in the near future, some types of roles will at least decrease in number as AI takes over their tasks. 
The following jobs are expected to decrease in demand by 2025, especially because AI and other automated technologies are replacing the primary tasks of these roles, according to the World Economic Forum’s “Future of Jobs Report”:

Data entry clerks
Administrative and executive secretaries
Accounting, bookkeeping, and payroll clerks
Accountants and auditors
Assembly and factory workers
Business services and administration managers
Client information and customer service workers
General and operations managers
Mechanics and machinery repairers
Material-recording and stock-keeping clerks

AI as a supplement to human work
It’s important to note that while AI can, for instance, handle some of the basic data entry and management tasks traditionally completed by secretaries and clerks, AI tools cannot succeed unless they are appropriately programmed, trained, and maintained over time. 
That’s why, as AI tools continue to enter into more business use cases, roles that manage these tools and support them strategically will continue to grow. These jobs will grow quickly in the next several years, according to “The Future of Jobs Report”:

Data scientists and analysts
AI and machine learning specialists
Big data specialists
Digital marketing and strategy specialists
Process automation specialists
Business development professionals
Digital transformation specialists
Information security (IS) analysts
Software developers
Internet of Things (IoT) specialists

Building skills for an AI world
AI automation promises the creation of new jobs, new consumer products, and greater economic growth. However, if workforce development does not keep up with the AI revolution, employees of varying roles and backgrounds run the risk of being replaced in the workforce by automation.
Although it is ultimately up to the individual to develop competitive professional skills, local and national governments, employers, and educational institutions should invest in the following solutions in order to maintain a healthy, equitable workforce:
Education and skills development
Organizations should invest in education, re-education, or skills development courses for employees who are interested in learning about data science, programming, and other tech skills that are highly lucrative in the job market. If an organization is unwilling or unable to invest financial resources, several free online courses and workshops teach common programming languages and other technical skills.
Hands-on training
Provide employees with hands-on training for deploying and managing any AI or data sets that the company uses. This training provides relevant experience for both the employee and the company that will need help with those tools in the future.
Soft-skills training
One of the most affordable and valuable types of training that employers can provide is soft-skills training. Although AI can mimic several human tasks, no artificial intelligence model has yet come close to matching human soft skills, like leadership, entrepreneurship, conflict resolution, and creative thinking, to name a few. Give employees the opportunity to attend seminars and conferences, set their goals, and spend time developing their humanistic strengths outside of their daily work.

Conclusions
AI automation will likely replace or at the very least transform many of the jobs we see in the market today. 
However, the majority of jobs will not be supplanted with AI technology but instead be supported by AI, allowing employees to optimize their performance and outcomes with artificial assistance.
Jerry Ting, co-founder and CEO of Evisort, an AI contract management software company, believes that the combination of human work and AI work is what will continue to lend enterprises the greatest levels of efficiency:
“Artificial intelligence has truly transformed business technology today,” Ting said. “Humans and technology must work together in order to help businesses remain efficient, and artificial intelligence makes that possible. 
“Rather than replacing humans, artificial intelligence serves as a supportive tool that can help streamline decision-making processes as well as save users time and resources.”

October 11, 2021 — The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has launched a new department dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence (AI) to transform health care, further positioning the Mount Sinai Health System as a leader in providing patient care through pioneering innovations and technologies. The Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health is the first department of its kind within a medical school in the United States.
The department’s mission is to lead the artificial intelligence-driven transformation of health care through innovative research, apply that knowledge to treatment in hospital and clinical settings, and provide personalized care for each patient, which will expand Mount Sinai’s impact on human health across the Health System and around the world.
“Mount Sinai’s AI enterprise and its collective entities will be the connective fabric linking and integrating our work throughout the entire Health System, as we robustly collaborate with all our institutes, departments, and centers to provide phenomenal patient care,” said Thomas J. Fuchs, Dr.sc, Dean for Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, Co-Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, and Professor of Computational Pathology and Computer Science in the Department of Pathology at Icahn Mount Sinai. “The overarching goal of the Department for AI and Human Health is to impact patients’ health with AI. We will accomplish this by building AI systems at scale from data representing Mount Sinai’s diverse patient population. These systems will work seamlessly across all hospitals and care units to support physicians, foster research, and most importantly help patients' care and well-being.”
Fuchs, who will lead the Department, is a prominent scientist in the groundbreaking field of computational pathology, with decades of experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence in health care. Together with his team, he will guide the department in creating an “AI Fabric” that will integrate machine learning and AI-driven decision-making throughout the Health System’s eight hospitals. This effort will include creating a hub-and-satellite model to make new tools and techniques available to all Mount Sinai physicians, and building an infrastructure for high-performance computing and data access to improve Mount Sinai's diagnostic and treatment capabilities.
“Mount Sinai has been on the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution,” said Dennis S. Charney, M.D., Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean of Icahn Mount Sinai and President for Academic Affairs of the Mount Sinai Health System. “We’ve made bold steps in recruiting the brightest minds, invested in leading-edge technology, and created an infrastructure where discoveries are quickly translated to benefit patients and change practice. This Department cements our commitment to further developing this field, charting new avenues, and making this bold future a reality.”
As part of Mount Sinai’s ongoing commitment to expand AI, the department will be located on four floors in a completely redesigned and renovated space at 3 East 101st Street that includes areas for computational work and advanced imaging modalities such as virtual and augmented reality. The Department of AI and Human Health is also launching a campaign to recruit talented researchers, scientists, physicians, and students in the field.  
“We are just at the beginning stages of reaping the advantages of artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical research and clinical medicine,” said Eric J. Nestler, M.D., Ph.D., Dean for Academic and Scientific Affairs, Nash Family Professor of Neuroscience, and Director of The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai. “Mount Sinai is at the forefront of this effort, underscored by the opening—expected toward the end of 2022—of a new research facility on campus that will house the new Department and related endeavors.”
The new department continues to build on Mount Sinai’s expertise and early adaptation of various forms of artificial intelligence, including machine learning to develop novel diagnostics and treatments for diseases. Earlier this year, Icahn Mount Sinai announced it will offer a new PhD concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies in Medicine as part of its PhD in Biomedical Sciences program starting in the fall of 2022. The concentration will train future scientists in cutting-edge technologies, including AI, medical devices, robotic machines, and sensors. The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai—a collaboration between the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering in Potsdam, Germany, and the Mount Sinai Health System—formed in 2019 to expand capabilities and create new tools of data science, biomedical and digital engineering, machine learning, and AI, including wearable technology.

A senior cybersecurity official at the Pentagon said he resigned in protest because the slow pace of technological development has made it impossible for the United States to compete with China. Nicolas Chaillan, who spent three years as the first chief software officer for the Air Force, said Beijing has a clear advantage in the technological space because of its fast advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and general capabilities in cybersecurity. “We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it’s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,” Chaillan told the Financial Times in his first interview since he left his Pentagon job earlier this month. “Whether it takes a war or not is kind of anecdotal.”

In many respects, China is playing in an entirely different league as the United States, Chaillan says, characterizing the cyber defenses in some government agencies as being at “kindergarten level.” Now China is set to dominate the future of the world, controlling media narratives and geopolitics, he added. While the United States continues to spend more money on defense than anyone else, it continues to focus on expensive hardware, such as new fighter jets, rather than emerging technologies that will be far more critical to the future.

One of the reasons China has been able to move much faster than the United States is that it isn’t bogged down in massive debates over AI ethics. But also because Chinese companies are forced to work with the government while many U.S. firms are reluctant to work with the Pentagon. Google, for example, stopped doing artificial intelligence work with the Pentagon in 2018 when a dozen employees quit after the company helped the Department of Defense develop software that could improve the accuracy of drone strikes.

Chaillan had announced his resignation in early September with a LinkedIn post that expressed his frustration at the slow pace of change at the Pentagon and how higher up officials were not willing to make new technologies a real priority. “At this point, I am just tired of continuously chasing support and money to do my job,” Chaillan wrote. Chaillan is hardly the first person to warn about Chinese advances in the emerging technologies. Earlier this year, the National Security Commission warned that the “U.S. government is not prepared to defend the United States in the coming artificial intelligence era” and that China was on track to become the world’s top AI superpower.

Key Takeaways


Most companies work with some form of hybrid or cloud infrastructure, but managing this has become almost impossible without some form of AI help
For teams that are running several different clouds, AI interfaces have become almost a necessity as they evolve and scale their DevOps program.
It’s very apparent that AI is already having a huge impact on speed and quality at which software is being shipped.
The AI revolution has had the side-effect of making DevOps teams busier than ever, and with development cycles much faster as well. 
Ultimately, development teams still need strategic leadership, and although AIs are now highly capable in many areas, they still lack the ability to respond to user demand in truly creative ways.





For many developers, predicting what’s next in DevOps has become something of a favorite pastime. We’ve seen our industry change rapidly in just the last decade, and in that same period the programmer’s role has also changed fundamentally.
In fact, and particularly among those developers of (shall we say) a particular age, it might seem as though the role of the “traditional” developer no longer exists. Rather than the traditional software development life cycle – in which software is planned, built, and then released – many of us now work in multi-disciplinary teams in which development and operations exist side-by-side, and are increasingly indistinguishable.
That model has become known as DevOps, but only recently. And it only took a few years (or months?) for DevOps itself to start changing and adapting. Now, we are adrift in a sea of acronyms (including the more recent DevSecOps) that denote a slightly different way of working, and each a slightly different view of the future.

Among the most recent of these is AIOps. In this vision, AI tools are slowly replacing the role of the developer – just as DevOps did before – and will eventually supplant DevOps entirely.
Assessing whether that prediction is true is tricky, but in this article we will try nonetheless. We’ll look at what AI promises to do for the development process, assess whether it can really ever take over from human  developers, and then look at what DevOps is likely to look like in a decades’ time.
The Promise of Automation
First, and in order to understand why AI tools have been so rapidly adopted by DevOps teams, it’s useful to understand what they promise they can achieve. This promise can essentially be broken into two parts:

On the one hand, the use of AI tools is “merely” a way for over-stretched developers to stay on top of the increasingly complex systems they work with. 
On the other, AI tools offer a range of automated code development and deployment techniques that have more fundamentally transformed the way that software is made.


With regard to the former – AI tools that make our lives easier – we only have to look at the proliferation of cloud infrastructure models over the past decade to see why AI has been necessary. Nowadays, most companies work with some form of hybrid\cloud infrastructure, and managing this has become almost impossible without some form of AI help. Indeed, hybrid and multi cloud infrastructures, microservices architectures like containers and hyperscale applications have created an enterprise IT environment that is more complicated than ever to keep track of. 
Then there is the second aspect of AI tool adoption – the fact that some AI tools like GitHub’s AI Coding Assistant or Microsoft’s DeepDev don’t just make our lives easier, they open up new possibilities when it comes to code development and distribution. The speed with which AI systems can assess individual user requirements, for instance, makes it possible to use them to tweak and specify default web browsing behavior for each user individually, reducing their vulnerability to particular types of malware while using our software. 
DevOps, AIOps, and NoOps
As a consequence of the utility of AI tools, they have been widely and rapidly adopted by all but the most stubborn DevOps teams. Indeed, for teams now running several different clouds (and that’s all teams, pretty much) AI interfaces have become almost a necessity as they evolve and scale their DevOps program.
The most obvious and tangible outcome of this shift has been in the data and systems that developers spend their time looking at. It used to be that a major part of the role of the operations team, for instance, was to build and maintain a dashboard that all staff members could consult, and which contained all of the apposite data on a piece of software. 
Today, that central task has become largely obsolete. As software has grown more complex, the idea of a single dashboard containing all the relevant information on a particular piece of software has begun to sound absurd. Instead, most DevOps teams now make use of AI tools that “automatically” monitor the software they are working on, and only present data when it is clear that something has gone wrong.
This is a massive shift in the way that we work as developers and operational staff, and so it’s no surprise that it’s been given its own acronym – AIOps. Some, in fact, have gone even further, and claimed that this reliance on AI tools now means we are entering the age of NoOps. Tellingly, however, opinion is divided about which role has been eliminated – whether NoOps mean “no developers”, or “no operations”.
The AI Revolution
All these reflections on the philosophical background to software development might sound a little abstract. Until, that is, you look at the numbers, from which it is strikingly apparent that AI is already having a huge impact on speed (if not the quality) at which software is being shipped.
GitLab's most recent survey of over four thousand developers puts some hard figures on this. This research finds that some companies are releasing new code up to ten times more quickly than previously. Tellingly, 75% utilize AI and ML for testing and reviewing code pre-release. This is up from just over 40% only a year ago.

Image Source
This is great news for developers, or at least those who want to produce lots of code quickly. Unfortunately, that’s not always the same as producing great code. It’s clear, for instance, from ransomware attack trends that poorly tested code is quickly becoming a notable source of vulnerability for many organizations, and that the advent of AI-driven testing systems has done little to reduce this.
Nonetheless, the direction of travel is strikingly apparent. Within a few more years, it seems, the vast majority of DevOps teams will be reliant on AI tools, and software will be released at many times the velocity that it was previously. And that returns us to the question we started with – given that AI tools are now doing so much DevOps work, do we still need human DevOps staff at all?
Well, yes and no. Here’s why.
The Challenges
At the most superficial level, it’s possible to answer this question in reference to a very simple test. As AI tools have been adopted across the development sector, have developers seen their workloads decrease? Ask that question of the average developer, and you’ll be met with a laugh. The answer is no.
That’s because, as DevOps teams spend less time on the day-to-day management of their software, the time they used to spend on this is now taken up with arguably more valuable tasks – strategic planning, meta-analyses, and making sure that their development goals are in line with those of management. In fact, the AI “revolution”, which many imagined would make DevOps obsolete, appears to have made teams larger than ever, and busier than ever. This is because it has had the side-effect of making development cycles much faster. 
This is well understood by managers in the industry. In a recent interview with ZDNet, Matthew Tiani, the executive vice president at iTech AG, noted that DevOps is now ""enhanced by, among other things, an enhanced technical toolset -- source code management, CI/CD, orchestration.” 
He also added that successful DevOps implementation makes use of ""a compatible development methodology such as agile and scrum, and an organization commitment to foster and encourage collaboration between development and operational staff.""
Learning to Live Together
In practice, these factors and trends mean that DevOps teams are increasingly focused on business objectives, rather than technical challenges. This is certainly a change, but it might not be a negative one when it comes to the quality of software we produce. Arguably, in fact, AI tools have given teams the ability to focus their human resources where they work best – in creative, holistic, strategic tasks
You don’t have to look far for evidence of this. Just consider, for instance, that Vue JS is now the fastest growing dev framework in the world, with more than 240,000 websites built with the system now live. Before the advent of AI tools, the idea that a new and complex dev framework could be so quickly rolled out across the world would be laughable. Now, backed by AI tools, DevOps teams have a lot more freedom to be brave in their decisions, and trust that their tools are advanced enough to meet technical challenges.
This means that it’s very unlikely that AI tools are going to replace DevOps, or at least anytime soon. Just as we saw with previous trends in the adoption of DevOps, development teams still need strategic leadership, no matter how advanced their technical tools. And, though AIs are now highly capable in many areas, they still lack the ability to respond to user demand in truly creative ways.
The Bottom Line
In short, we are likely to need human developers for quite a while yet. And though their role might be radically different from how it was ten years ago, that’s the price (and the joy) of working in such a dynamic industry. 
About the Author
Sam Bocetta is a former security analyst, having spent the bulk of his as a network engineer for the Navy. He is now semi-retired, and educates the public about security and privacy technology. Much of Sam’s work involved penetration testing ballistic systems. He analyzed our networks looking for entry points, then created security-vulnerability assessments based on my findings. Further, he helped plan, manage, and execute sophisticated ""ethical"" hacking exercises to identify vulnerabilities and reduce the risk posture of enterprise systems used by the Navy (both on land and at sea). The bulk of his work focused on identifying and preventing application and network threats, lowering attack vector areas, removing vulnerabilities and general reporting. He was able to identify weak points and create new strategies which bolstered our networks against a range of cyber threats. Sam worked in close partnership with architects and developers to identify mitigating controls for vulnerabilities identified across applications and performed security assessments to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a variety of threats.

Humans continue to pose questions about artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics. 
Back 1951, when Christopher Strachey launched his AI-driven checkers program at the University of Manchester in England, people were questioning the implications of human-mimicking machines. 
Today, depending on who is giving the answer, AI is either the key to driving society toward a peaceful, harmonious future or the biggest potential threat to humankind. 
We can find examples to support both perspectives in the business world and beyond. But reaching a consensus about the ethical bounds of AI is an endless societal debate that will morph as AI applications evolve, becoming more sophisticated — and more human-like. 
Here, we examine a series of questions on and AI and ethics society will wrestle with for the foreseeable future:

5 ethical questions AI raises
1. How much surveillance is too much?
AI applications that help employers and advertisers keep tabs on humans are among the most prominent targets for ethical skepticism. Whether it’s the AI-driven algorithms that track and analyze users’ moves on social media or a “smart” app that runs in the background, clocking every keystroke and click made by an employee, we’ve reached an age where many are under constant digital surveillance. 
On one hand, is it really such a terrible thing if employers can keep better track of exactly what employees are doing during working hours? After all, employees receive paychecks, and employers have a significant stake in employee efficiency. On the other hand, what will become of personal autonomy? What kind of workplace environments are we creating when employees feel surveilled and monetized at every moment of the workday? 
Work isn’t the only place humans are under increased scrutiny. “Big Brother” is lurking, and as AI grows more sophisticated and accurate, we could eventually see applications like facial recognition become a part of nearly every public interaction. 
“In an AI-enabled future, we assume that everyone and everything will have knowledge about everyone else,” says Kathleen Walch, managing partner and principal analyst at the AI firm Cognilytica, in a recent Forbes article, “Ethical Concerns of AI.”
“No longer will we be able to just unplug for a while. We may quickly move to a world where just a few companies and government have an uncomfortable amount of knowledge and level of control over the lives of everyone.”
2. When do the ‘needs of many’ outweigh the needs of a few?
As AI evolves to become more intelligent and autonomous, it’s easy to imagine scenarios where we would hope and expect AI applications to put the needs of the human collective above the needs of individuals. 
Imagine AI that can root, identify, and detain a potential terrorist — here, there is a clear societal benefit. When situations are grayer, however, it’s a slippery slope. 
Take another potential scenario: a factory that is polluting a river and poisoning a small town’s water supply, as Debarshi Chaudhury cites in his Forbes article, “Why the Ethics of AI are Complicated.” 
“A machine could decide that for the benefit of the many thousands of people in the town, the best option is to destroy the factory,” Chaudhury says. “That’s something a ‘good’ human being would never do — we’d try to fix it in other ways.”
Until we reach a level where AI is able to examine these kinds of issues with real context, we can’t truly trust the technology to be left alone to its own devices. The tendency for AI to follow the most logical, literal path is one AI engineers have yet to adequately address.

3. What happens if AI replaces humans in the workplace?
It’s perhaps the one of the most common technological concern expressed by the public, since the industrial revolution began in the late 1800s. As factories emerged for the first time, it quickly became apparent how much work could be done with the help of inventions like the mechanical belt. 
If machines can perform jobs, the logic goes, we’ll need fewer humans on hand, which means fewer employment options. Machines are often quicker, more precise, and much more efficient, since they don’t need breaks nearly as regularly as human workers. And now, machines powered by AI are, indeed, replacing some jobs previously completed by people. 
Some technology watchdogs see signs that the ongoing pandemic has accelerated an inevitable shift toward automation and away from human work. One study that estimated that around 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. factories between 1990 and 2007, according to a recent Time article. 
The drive to replace humans with machinery is accelerating, writer Alana Samuels says in the article. While some jobs have come back since during the pandemic, Samuels says, “Some will never return.” One group of economists estimates that some 42% of the jobs lost are gone “forever,” she says.
Ultimately, AI will significantly impact the entire career landscape for would-be employees. Already, “babysitting robots” is a job, and human oncologists are beginning to turn over diagnostic duties to AI, which has proven to be far more accurate in some cases, according to Yulia Gavrilova in her blog post, “10 AI Ethics Questions We Need to Ask,” on the Serokell Software Development Company website.
“What will happen to specialists when AI systems become available in every hospital not only for making diagnoses but also for performing operations?” Gavrilova says. 
“If computers take over all the work, what will we do? For many people, work and self-realization are the meaning of life.”
4. Is AI making it easier for bad actors to carry out attacks?
We’ve focused on how AI itself poses several ethical issues in certain applications, but what about AI in the wrong hands? AI can do good, but it can be wielded as a weapon by malicious users. 
AI-driven network breaches and other cyber attacks are on the rise. TaskRabbit, an online marketplace that connects freelancers with clients, suffered a data breach in 2018, putting almost 4 million users at risk. Information like Social Security numbers and bank account details made it into the hands of bad actors through an AI-controlled botnet, which used machines to launch DDoS attacks on TaskRabbit’s servers. The personal data of 141 million users was accessed. 
Another example includes a well-publicized AI-driven attack on WordPress, which has so far seen over 20,000 sites infected with a botnet-style cyber attack, putting users’ personal information and credit card numbers at risk. 
Industry watchers speculate that a 2019 attack on Instagram was also AI-based, with many experts speculating that hackers used AI to scan user data for potential vulnerabilities. 
5. What role is AI playing in the spread of disinformation?
Our hyper-connected world allows us to stay constantly connected to each another and to access information about virtually anything at high speeds. 
The Internet Age led society to a place where disinformation and “fake news” have reached epidemic levels. AI is at the heart of many harmful disinformation campaigns. 
AI-driven programs can create extremely convincing fake images, videos, conversations and alarmingly authentic-feeling content. 
What happens if we reach a point where no one, or a small number of people, can tell if images are real or AI-generated? With every passing year, we see evidence that AI-created content is only becoming more sophisticated. Consider the MIT Technology Review article, “These weird, unsettling photos show that AI is getting smarter,” which explores the work being done by researchers to perfect AI image generation. 
We’ve already seen first-hand how AI-driven bots can impact world events. The post-mortem on the 2016 U.S. presidential election shows how quickly and intentionally AI can be used to spread convincing misinformation. 
Throughout the 2016 election cycle, bots were used to automate social media accounts with the aim of manipulating voters and stoking partisan division. The 2016 election was not an isolated event. Even as research conducted through programs like the University of Oxford Computational Propaganda continues to piece together how foreign actors were able to significantly impact an American election, bots continue running rampant among social media platforms.

The artificial intelligence (AI) market is seeing explosive growth not only in traditionally tech-driven industries but also in new lines of business and in the homes of consumers. 
As the demand for AI efficiencies continues to grow, data scientists and other AI experts are challenging themselves to harness and apply big data in new ways.
Read on to learn about artificial intelligence, how AI is being used, and the state of the AI market:
A Closer Look at AI

Artificial intelligence market
The automation and new technologies that come from the development of AI are generating both hype and growth across the AI market. 
The artificial intelligence software market hit a value of about $62.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by 16x over the next several years, reaching around $997.8 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. 
Although AI has been incorporated into various markets and is expected to enter more in the near future, artificial intelligence tools are most commonly used in these industries: tech, automotive, health care, retail, finance, and manufacturing.

Artificial intelligence features

Big data: Without big data to learn from and otherwise code the actions of an AI tool, the solution cannot develop algorithms that successfully complete tasks.
AI algorithms: These use a combination of computer science, programming, and basic logic to develop commands for AI models to follow.
Machine learning (ML): A subset of artificial intelligence that focuses primarily on teaching a machine to complete a singular task based on coded training data instructions.
Deep learning: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to train a machine to work similarly to a human brain, by following and learning from examples.
Natural language processing (NLP): One of the most common forms of AI used to analyze text, voice, and other communication-based unstructured data to inform follow-up actions.

Benefits of artificial intelligence
Customer experience (CX) improvements
Most often powered by machine learning, customer experience tools are increasingly meeting customer needs in real-time with AI. Chatbots, virtual assistants, recommendation engines, and self-adjusting search results all work to answer customer questions and offer catered resources, so they can find what they need on their own schedules.
Accessibility resources and tools
Perhaps the most exciting consumer advantage that comes from AI is the increase in resources that make daily life more accessible. Self-driving vehicles and other autonomous fleet services make it easier for people to access transportation. Home medical diagnostic tools help people get the care they need, even if it’s difficult to leave home. More common daily tools like AI home assistants, bots, readers, and translators make it easier for people with different abilities and linguistic backgrounds to communicate, complete tasks, and enjoy multimedia entertainment.
Additional security support
A small number of specialized teams are developing AIOps, MLOps, and AI-powered security initiatives that automate security monitoring, dashboard analytics, and other security features that preemptively protect against security threats.
Derek Lin, chief data scientist at Exabeam, a cybersecurity and compliance company, explained how AI makes threat monitoring and detection easier for businesses:
“Over the past few years, AI has played a prominent role in threat detection, investigation, and response (TDIR),” Lin said. “Security analysts have been able to use the technology to establish baselines of normal behaviors for users on a network in order to detect anomalies as well as automated threat response to mitigate incidents in a fraction of the time.”
Smart operations development
Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly being programmed to automate business operations through AIOps and in more specialized settings like smart factories. When AI is used in partnership with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, it can also power highly detailed and actionable models like digital twins. 
More on AI and security: Trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
Artificial intelligence use cases
Language-based use cases are the most common across the artificial intelligence market, but a growing number of other use cases like computer vision, machine development, and cybersecurity tools have gained traction.
In many cases, specialized tech companies are also finding new ways to use AI to their advantage:
Contract and compliance management
“Evisort leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help businesses categorize, search, and act on business-driving documents of any type. Evisort’s proprietary AI understands meaning and context in legal language, allowing the technology to process 122,400 pages in one day and eliminating the need for manual data entry and parsing of contracts or business documents.” -Jerry Ting, co-founder and CEO, Evisort
Business coaching
“An increasingly popular use case of AI is to improve conversational intelligence systems for customer service and sales processes. Such technologies include AI-powered guided coaching, which offers salespeople live feedback and recommendations that they can use in the middle of a customer call. … Instead of having to listen to hundreds of hours of calls for training, [new hires] can go straight into a call with AI as their live coach, providing recommendations and scripts while they’re on the phone.” -Greg Armor, EVP at Gryphon.ai
Fraud and threat detection
“Artificial intelligence can be a critical element in how businesses identify and battle e-commerce fraud and abuse. For example, there is a lot of nuance in deciding if an e-commerce transaction is too risky to be approved, and AI enables machines to make these assessments that would normally require human insight at far greater scale.” -Liron Damri, president and co-founder, Forter
An intro to top providers: Top Performing Artificial Intelligence Companies
Artificial intelligence providers
Many tech giants have developed artificial intelligence tools and applications for their users, but a greater number of new companies are entering the tech scene with a singular focus on AI innovation. 
Several companies have focused their efforts on one subset of AI use cases, such as sentiment analysis or autonomous vehicle and fleet development. 
But the majority of top players in the AI market are developing a wider swath of AI tools across their verticals and customer-facing projects:

IBM
AWS
Google Cloud
Microsoft Azure
Salesforce
Siemens
Automation Anywhere
SAS
DocuSign
Nvidia
H20.ai
Intel
Alibaba

A growing number of companies are integrating AI solutions by these providers into their internal operations and consumer products. 
But many other companies are hesitant to adopt AI, due to the perceived cost and required expertise to manage these tools. 
As companies across industries continue to find ways to optimize their processes and offerings through AI, it will be important for companies without AI to engage with the technology soon, so they don’t fall behind their competitors.

How AI is Being Used in Robotics
HomeAI
By Drew Robb

artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the robotics market into various areas, including mobile robots on the factory floor, robots that can do a large number of tasks rather than being specialized on one, and robots that can stay in control of inventory levels as well as fetching orders for delivery. 
Such advanced functionality has raised the complexity of robotics. Hence the need for AI. 
Artificial intelligence provides the ability to monitor many parameters in real-time and make decisions. For example, in an inventory robot, the machine has to be able to know its own location, the location of all stock, know stock levels, work out the sequence to go and retrieve items for orders, know the location of other robots on the floor, be able to navigate around the site, know when a human is near and change course, take deliveries to shipping, keep track of everything, and more. 
The mobile robot also has to interoperate with various shop floor systems, computer numerical control (CNC) equipment, and other industrial systems. AI helps all those disparate systems work together seamlessly by being able to process their various inputs in real-time and coordinate action. 
Autonomous robots market 
The autonomous robotic market alone is worth around $103 billion this year, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group. He predicts that it will more than double by 2025 to $210 billion. 
“It will only go vertical from there,” Enderle said.  
That’s only one portion of the market. Another hot area is robotic process automation (RPA). It, too, is being integrated with AI to deal with high-volume, repeatable tasks. By handing these tasks over to robots, labor costs are reduced, workflows can be streamlined, and assembly processes are accelerated. Software can be written, for example, to take care of routine queries, calculations, and record keeping. 
Historically, two different teams were needed: one for robotics and another for factory automation. The robotics team consists of specialized technicians with their own programming language to deal with the complex kinematics of multi-axis robots. Factory automation engineers, on the other hand, use programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and shop floor systems that utilize different programming languages. But software is now on the market that brings these two worlds together. 
Further, better software and more sophisticated hardware has opened the door to a whole new breed of robot. While basic models operate on two axes, the latest breed of robotic machine with AI is capable of movement on six axes. They can be programmed to either carry out one task, over and over with high accuracy and speed, or execute complex tasks, such as coating or machining intricate components.

5 Examples of AI in robotics 
1. Honda
Honda’s ASIMO has become something of a celebrity. This advanced humanoid robot has been programmed to walk like a human, maintain balance, and do backflips. 
But now AI is being used to advance its capabilities with an eventual view toward autonomous motion. 
“The difficulty is no longer building the robot but training it to deal with unstructured environments, like roads, open areas, and building interiors,” Enderle said. “They are complex systems with massive numbers of actuators and sensors to move and perceive what is around them.” 
2. Sight Machine and Nissan
Sight Machine, the developer of a manufacturing data platform, has partnered with Nissan to use AI to perform anomaly detection on 300 robots working on an automated final assembly process. 
This system provides predictions and root-cause analysis for downtime.

3. Siemens and AUTOParkit
Siemens and AUTOParkit have formed a partnership to bring parking into the 21st century. 
Using Siemens automation controls with AI, the AUTOParkit solution provides a safe valet service without the valet.
This fully automated parking solution can achieve 2:1 efficiency over a conventional parking approach, AUTOParkit says. It reduces parking-related fuel consumption by 83% and carbon emissions by 82%. 
In such a complex system, specialized vehicle-specific hardware and software work together to provide smooth and seamless parking experience that is far faster than traditional parking. Siemens controls use AI to pull it all together. 
4. Kawasaki
Kawasaki has a large offering of robots that are primarily used in fixed installations. But now it is working on robotic mobility and that takes AI. 
“For stationary robots to work seamlessly with mobile robots, it is essential that they can exchange information accurately and without failure,” said Samir Patel, senior director of robotics engineering, Kawasaki Robotics USA. 
“To meet such integration requirements, Kawasaki robot controllers offer numerous options, including EtherNet TCP/IP, EtherNet IP, EtherCat, PROFIBUS, PROFINET and DeviceNet. These options not only allow our robots to communicate with mobile robots, but also allow communication to supervisory servers, PLCs, vision systems, sensors, and other devices.”  
With so many data sources to communicate with and instantaneous response needed to provide operational efficiency and maintain safety, AI is needed. 
“Over time, each robot accumulates data, such as joint load, speed, temperature, and cycle count, which periodically gets transferred to the network server,” Patel said. “In turn. the server running an application, such as Kawasaki’s Trend Manager, can analyze the data for performance and failure prediction.” 
5. Sight Machine and Komatsu
Sight Machine, in close cooperation with Komatsu, has developed a system that can rapidly analyze 500 million data points from 600 welding robots.
The AI-based system can provide early warning of potential downtime and other welding faults.

The link between artificial intelligence (AI) and bias is  alarming. 
As AI evolves to become more human-like, it’s becoming clear that human bias is impacting technology in negative, potentially dangerous ways. 
Here, we explore how AI and bias are linked and what’s being done to reduce the impact of bias in AI applications:
See more: The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
3 questions on AI and bias
1. How does bias in AI impact automated decision systems?
Using AI in decision-making processes has become commonplace, mostly because predictive analytics algorithms can perform the work of humans at a much faster and often more accurate rate. Decisions are being made by AI on small matters, like restaurant preferences, and critical issues, like determining which patient should receive an organ donation. 
While the stakes may differ, whether human bias is playing a role in AI decisions is sure to impact outcomes. Bad product recommendations impact retailer profit, and medical decisions can directly impact individual patient lives. 
Vincent C. Müller takes a look at AI and bias in his research paper, “Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,” included in the Summer 2021 edition of “The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.” Fairness in policing is a primary concern, Müller says, noting that human bias exists in the data sets used by police to decide, for example, where to focus patrols or which prisoners are likely to re-offend. 
This kind of “predictive policing,” Müller says, relies heavily on data influenced by cognitive biases, especially confirmation bias, even when the bias is implicit and unknown to human programmers. 
Christina Pazzanese refers to the work of political philosopher Michael Sandel, a professor of government, in her article, “Great promise but potential for peril,” in The Harvard Gazette. 
“Part of the appeal of algorithmic decision-making is that it seems to offer an objective way of overcoming human subjectivity, bias, and prejudice,” Sandel says. “But we are discovering that many of the algorithms that decide who should get parole, for example, or who should be presented with employment opportunities or housing … replicate and embed the biases that already exist in our society.”

2. Why does bias exist in AI? 
To figure out how to remove or at least reduce bias in AI decision-making platforms, we have to consider why it exists in the first place.  
Take the AI chatbot training story in 2016. The chatbot was set up by Microsoft to hold conversations on Twitter, interacting with users through tweets and direct messaging. In other words, the general public had a large part in determining the chatbot’s “personality.” Within a few hours of its release, the chatbot was replying to users with offensive and racist messages, having been trained on anonymous public data, which was immediately co-opted by a group of people. 
The chatbot was heavily influenced in a conscious way, but it’s often not so clear-cut. In their joint article, “What Do We Do About the Biases in AI” in the Harvard Business Review, James Manyika, Jake Silberg, and Brittany Presten say that implicit human biases — those which people don’t realize they hold — can significantly impact AI. 
Bias can creep into algorithms in several ways, the article says. It can include biased human decisions or reflect “historical or social inequities, even if sensitive variables such as gender, race, or sexual orientation are removed.” As an example, the researchers point to Amazon, which stopped using a hiring algorithm after finding it favored applications based on words like “executed” or “captured,” which were more commonly included on men’s resumes. 
Flawed data sampling is another concern, the trio writes, when groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data that teaches AI algorithms to make decisions. For example, facial analysis technologies analyzed by MIT researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru had higher error rates for minorities, especially minority women, potentially due to underrepresented training data. 
3. How can we reduce bias in AI?
In the McKinsey Global Institute article, “Tackling bias in artificial intelligence (and in humans),” Jake Silberg and James Manyika lay out six guidelines AI creators can follow to reduce bias in AI:

Be aware of the contexts in which AI can help correct for bias as well as where there is a high risk that AI could exacerbate bias
Establish processes and practices to test for and mitigate bias in AI systems
Engage in fact-based conversations about potential biases in human decisions
Fully explore how humans and machines can work best together
Invest more in bias research, make more data available for research, while respecting privacy, and adopt a multidisciplinary approach
Invest more in diversifying the AI field itself

The researchers acknowledge that these guidelines won’t eliminate bias altogether, but when applied consistently, they have the potential to significantly improve on the situation.

GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT > Movies & TV Scientists Accidentally Build Racist Artificial Intelligence Scientists and engineers might have created a racist artificial intelligence which gave some concerning answers to ethical questions

The future of the world likely lies in artificial intelligence, a simultaneously exciting and horrifying thought. We are drawing closer to the singularity with each passing day bringing us within striking difference of computers coming online with their own “thoughts” about how the world should be run. The short answer is that it probably won’t work out for humans, but stranger things and all. Before computers come fully online though, scientists appear to have to build in substantially more of an ethical and moral code. Because recently a group of engineers designed a possibly racist artificial intelligence that gave out some questionable “advice”. 






The latest example (via Futurism) of some pretty significant tweaks needing to be made with machine learning algorithms comes from the Allen Institute. They built an interesting program called Ask Delphi which also might have accidentally become some racist artificial intelligence. This program was meant to help users ask ethical questions and get straightforward answers to possibly complicated situations. The issue at hand was that it gave some pretty damn terrible advice and seemed to, at times, couch it along racial lines. 
One need only go over the Ask Delphi platform to see what folks are talking about here. One example that users noted when typing in a situation, leading to concerns over a racial artificial intelligence comes with the question, “A black man walks toward you at night.” The system then asks you to his the “Ponder” button while it, well, ponders an answer. Ask Delphi’s response to this is, “It’s concerning.” Another time when asked, the answer is “It is unsettling.” Meanwhile when asking the same question to Ask Delphi but swapping out “Black” for “white” the answer becomes “It’s not so clear.” 
Then there were other issues with Ask Delphi that led to claims this possibly racist artificial intelligence shouldn’t be left in the hands of people trying to suss out decision making along different lines. Twitter use @mtrc noted how there had been some very (very) questionable answers given by the artificial intelligence to seemingly “easy” questions. Check out some of the feedback he got from a bunch of different queries. 















Look we are obviously years (or maybe even decades) away from having artificial intelligence greatly impact our lives around the moral and ethical decisions we face on a daily basis. And maybe these questions are cherrypicked in a manner that would point to some racist artificial intelligence when the reality isn’t that clear. But even these few examples do give the solid (or unsettling) feeling that we shouldn’t let machine learning programs handle all of our day-to-day thought. And it is worth exploring Ask Adelphi to see if its answers align with your own ethical code. Most things are pretty straightforward. 
And to their credit (I suppose), the folks at the Allen Institute aren’t lauding the Ask Adelphi program as the all-in-one answer to figuring out the ethical questions of our day. They don’t call it racist artificial intelligence by any means, but they do say the program highlights the “promises and limitations” of neural networks when given human input. So on this front, there is still plenty of work to be done.

Air Force fighter pilots will soon face new opponents in their training: artificial intelligence-based enemy pilots that can match humans based on their personal learning needs.After steering the production of numerous AI-enabled pilot agents for years, Aptima, Inc. confirmed it landed a four-year contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory to build an “automated librarian” that will categorize those AI pilots and pair them with military trainees in scenarios that are right to advance their skillsets.“The best case outcome is that AFRL determines that the products of this research are so promising that they create a library into which AI training technologies are shelved like books are shelved and they refine the sort of librarian that we're trying to build here so that it can sweep through that enormous library of AI, sweep through a library of scenarios—and for each individual student—pick out just the right pairing to advance them to expertise reliably and more quickly than we can do today,” Aptima’s Chief Scientist Jared Freeman told Nextgov during an interview on Tuesday.Freeman joined the company in 1999, four years after its launch. Aptima’s project portfolio has grown increasingly diverse since then, he noted. Now, much of it concerns AI support for human teams, like forming and measuring them, and helping people and AI to manage those groups. The company also does a bit of work developing sensors and wearables to monitor and improve military members’ physical and cognitive fitness. Efforts under Freeman’s purview as chief scientist deal heavily with big data and AI. He’s currently a principal investigator overseeing Aptima’s role in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-led initiative to help imbue AI with social intelligence to pave the way for next-level human/AI teaming down the line. He’ll also be very involved in this newly unveiled contract with AFRL, which is worth potentially more than $5.2 million.“There's a wonderful line drawn, a thread from our work we did at our founding to this project that we are talking about now,” Freeman noted.The company’s formation dates back to “a contract from the Navy to use computational methods to design more effective command and control teams, which we then tested with human beings,” he explained, adding that that work lasted about a dozen years. The latest pursuit with the Air Force lab also involves people and technology teaming up, as well.“This time, the teams are human pilots and their adversaries—who are in a sort of a dance together—one trying to beat the other. And those adversaries are AI,” Freeman explained. “So here we're on, I think, the edge of really the next generation of AI research, which is human teams interacting with AI. AI as advisors. AI as trainers. AI as adversaries who exercise these skills.”The roots of this now-formal contract trace in part back to collaboration Aptima had been engaging in with the lab’s 711th Human Performance Wing and its Senior Principal Research Psychologist and Readiness Product Line Lead for the Warfighter Readiness Research Division, Dr. Winston “Wink” Bennett. This “builds on an ambition of Dr. Bennett's and the wing to ensure that America has robust architectures for building artificial intelligence,” Freeman noted.He and his team previously had been overseeing and assessing  the development of AI agents that were meant to become enemies in Air Force pilot training. Often in simulated combats or “dogfights” for educational purposes, trainees will fly against human experts, to learn how to operate and survive in combat. But those expert trainers are costly and highly in-demand, so the services are pivoting to explore the potential for AI to fill that gap.

Aptima facilitated the making of numerous AI pilots across a variety of commercial developers. In the prior work, which received recognition and an award from NATO in 2020, the researchers found that the performance of each of the computer-based pilots the various entities’ deployed varied significantly between scenarios—as if each were an expert in some types of encounters and a novice in others.“This tells us that [the Defense Department] needs to be quite careful about investing all of its funds in a single AI solution,” Freeman said.Under this new contract, he and his team will direct the development of AI agents by those other companies and form a scalable cloud-based testbed that allows many agents to generate flight data in parallel that can be used to assess the technology. Further, Aptima also aims to capitalize on AI-based pilots’ varying performances, by making a “smart” librarian—underpinned by AI—that will organize and match the computerized pilots to the human ones, depending on their experience levels. A “unique feature” of the system is that it will use training data in real-time to personalize learning based on each individual.Eventually, the pilots of all types will interact in simulators.“We don't have human pilot trainees in this loop. We're running AI through simulations against fairly scripted but smart—those other AIs are like the students, right?” Freeman noted. “It’s a very long term program. We have several more years of work to do and we hope to be working with human beings on the trainee end soon.”

Yuval Harari warns humans will be ""hacked"" if artificial intelligence is not globally regulated

Yuval Harari warns of human hacking 











Historian Yuval Harari warns humans will be “hacked” if artificial intelligence is not globally regulated
01:34

The future could see the world's human data, delivered through the rising power and reach of artificial intelligence, in the hands of a powerful few - a recipe for a dystopian tomorrow populated by ""hacked humans,"" says Yuval Noah Harari. The world-renowned author tells Anderson Cooper nations must begin cooperating to prevent this by regulating artificial intelligence and the collection of data across all nations.   The interview with Harari will be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday October 31, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.Harari says the countries and companies that control the most data will control the world.""The world is increasingly kind of cut up into spheres of data collection, of data harvesting. In the Cold War, you had the Iron Curtain. Now we have the Silicon Curtain, that the world is increasingly divided between the USA and China,"" Harari tells Cooper. ""Does your data go to California or does it go to Shenzhen and to Shanghai and to Beijing?""  






Harari, a history professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, published his first book, ""Sapiens,"" in 2014; it was a global best seller. He has since published two more books with futuristic themes, ""Homo Deus"" and ""21 Lessons for the 21st Century."" The three books together have sold 35 million copies in 65 languages.He has been warning people of a not-so-distant future of incredible change, saying the artificial intelligence at work today through algorithms will only strengthen its grip on humans.


""Netflix tells us what to watch and Amazon tells us what to buy. Eventually within 10 or 20 or 30 years such algorithms could also tell you what to study at college and where to work and whom to marry and even whom to vote for,"" says Harari.And he points out, the pandemic has opened the door to even more intrusive collection of our data.  ""It's data about what's happening inside my body. What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch. The next phase is surveillance going under our skin,"" he warns. ""Certainly, now we are at the point when we need global cooperation. You cannot regulate the explosive power of artificial intelligence on a national level,"" says Harari, who tells Cooper what he feels needs to be done. ""One key rule is that if you get my data, the data should be used to help me and not to manipulate me. Another key rule, that whenever you increase surveillance of individuals you should simultaneously increase surveillance of the corporation and governments and the people at the top. And the third principle is that-- never allow all the data to be concentrated in one place. That's the recipe for a dictatorship."" 


Harari says humans are at risk of becoming 'hacked"" if artificial intelligence does not become better regulated.""To hack a human being is to get to know that person better than they know themselves. And based on that, to increasingly manipulate you,"" Harari says.  There's an upside to the rise of artificial intelligence, too, says Harari, but only if accompanied by regulation.""The whole thing is that it's not just dystopian. It's also utopian. I mean, this kind of data can also enable us to create the best health care system in history,"" he says. ""The question is what else is being done with that data? And who supervises it? Who regulates it?""

Over the last quarter-century, automation, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have made the transition from science fiction to science fact. Automation is the wave of the future, but it carries with it the images of millions of workers out of a job, replaced by machines. The fear of being replaced has been around for decades now, and it shows no signs of abating.
In fact, across the world, a significant percentage of people believe that robots and computers will take jobs away from humans in the next half-century, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the fall of 2018. But then again, a Gallup survey conducted in early 2018 showed that while 73% of Americans believe that Artificial Intelligence will eliminate more jobs than it winds up creating, only 23% were concerned that they themselves would be directly impacted by it.
There is a lot of concern and speculation out there, so what’s the actual impact of automation on today’s job market? Will automation save it or bring about its doom?
Better Quality of Jobs
When looking for a good way to describe how automation helps the job market, one need only look as far as the lyrics to the rock group Styx’s 1983 hit “Mister Roboto”, where the song talks about thanking robots for doing the jobs nobody wants to. Repetitive work is boring, often dirty, and sometimes dangerous. Even though people want to work, they’d rather not take such jobs, if given a choice.
One of automation’s strong points is that it’s ideally suited for taking over the dangerous, dirty, drudge jobs, thereby giving companies the ability to offer more attractive jobs to aspiring employees. Offering a position that has an atmosphere conducive for employee growth is far more attractive; it’s not so much giving someone a job as it is starting them on a career. Give people better choices of jobs and they will eagerly pursue them, and be better employees as a result.
Now, this all assumes that automation would actually result in a quantitative increase in jobs, not just a qualitative one. After all, getting rid of a host of boring and dangerous jobs and replacing it with far fewer better quality jobs doesn’t help a large number of job-seekers, now does it?
An Increased Number of Jobs
Fortunately, automation does in fact create more jobs. While there are always charts available that show wildly different predictions about job loss or gain, the consensus seems to be that automation actually results in more jobs.
For instance, last year, a study on automation in the United Kingdom showed the loss of 800,000 jobs and the INCREASE of 3.5 million jobs! A Swiss think tank predicted that automation would eliminate 75 million jobs across the world, yet add 133 million new ones.
There are even studies that indicate that some of the forecasts have been exaggerated. Based on these points, it’s easy to see how the job market would actually be enriched and enhanced by automation, not ruined. However, there is one truth that cannot be ignored…
Yes, Some Jobs DO Get Phased Out
Every technological innovation comes at a price. The railroads spelled doom to the horse-drawn wagons, and the automobile brought doom to the railroads. Video killed the radio star, and Netflix killed Blockbuster. New tech uproots the old; that’s the way of things.
Look at how many professions have died over the past few centuries as newer, better methods and products came onto the scene. With advances and innovations arriving at an increasingly exponential rate today, it’s only logical that some jobs will go the way of the dinosaur. Somewhere out there, someone is going to lose his or her job.
This chart shows a sampling of occupations and the likelihood that they will become automated. The trend appears to be greater in the agriculture and manufacturing industries, plus jobs in food service, courier and postal positions, and land-based transport (passengers and freight). As for some specific examples, jobs such as data entry clerks, tax preparers, and telemarketers could be lost completely to automation, though it’s probably a good bet that many people would like to see telemarketers go away completely!
Bottom line, occupations that rely more on repetitive physical tasks stand a greater chance of being affected by automation.

But Not All Jobs Are Vulnerable

On the upside, there are certain occupations and careers that are very safe from automation-based obsolescence. Fields such as healthcare, teaching, politics, science and engineering, law enforcement, and IT stand less of a chance of being adversely affected by automation.
And not only are there a good selection of jobs that are less likely to be harmed by automation and robots, many jobs that are more vulnerable won’t be completely divested of human workers; in fact, those employees will find their workload helped out immensely by automation. In other words, it doesn’t have to be an “all or nothing” proposition. One could have a business where certain functions of employees’ jobs are automated, but still needing human interaction.
For instance, jobs in the customer service or human resources industries could be made easier by having more tedious and repetitive elements handled faster and more accurately with automation, leaving the human employees to handle the more interesting and challenging aspects of human interaction. The human element is needed for tasks that require cognitive intelligence, reasoning and judgement calls. Rather than being a threat, automation becomes a partner, taking the boring, irritating tasks off the professional’s hands.
In fact, one could argue that some of the positions lost due to automation will return in part in a different form, namely the demand for professionals who can maintain the automated aspects of production.
A Potential Skill Gap?
This article features point out how the likelihood of various industries experiencing a shortfall of skilled workers over the next decade. Among the culprits of these shortages are the current generation retiring in greater numbers, less emphasis placed on graduates being proficient in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, mathematics), and an overall lack of understanding and experience in new technology.
The Robot Report further reinforces this, predicting that the US alone could experience shortfalls over the next ten years, and end up with having $454 billion of manufacturing GDP at risk in 2028!
So how does this gap get addressed?
Learning and Upskilling

Take advantage of the latest technological advances to move your business toward a successful future with 5 game-changing applications of AI in human resources.


Once the stuff of sci-fi movies, artificial intelligence (AI) is now becoming central to many aspects of human life. AI cars can drive you around autonomously, guided by navigation systems that will avoid traffic and facial recognition allows you to unlock your phone. We even have chatbots to deal with customer complaints or queries.


The applications of AI are seemingly limitless. This is why AI is now finding itself at the center of businesses across all departments. Forbes claims that in 2021 over a third of businesses are already using some sort of AI. 


This article will look at 5 game-changing applications of AI in human resources. But before we begin, let’s take a closer look at artificial intelligence. 


What Exactly Is AI? 


Before we look at some of the applications of AI in human resources, it’s important to understand what AI means. 


The Britannica online dictionary describes artificial intelligence as “the ability of a digital computer or robot to perform tasks usually associated with intelligent beings.” Once a fantasy, now a reality. In recent years, technological advancements have seen computers and robots with artificial intelligence capabilities improve rapidly. 


The ability for AI to think, learn, and make decisions allows them to perform complex tasks only previously possible by humans. AI can now undertake reasoning, problem-solving, speech recognition, and sensory perception. 


These benefits have seen AI become central to businesses across all departments, saving them heaps of human time and effort. AI has also revolutionized startups by allowing new small businesses to automate tasks without having a strong workforce. 


Benefits of AI in HR 


Somewhat ironically, one department benefitting hugely from AI is human resources. 


The use of AI in human resources is on the rise. In the next few years, 47% of HR departments are expected to utilize AI in some capacity. This is unsurprising given the number of ways AI can help HR departments by increasing efficiency. 


In times where big-data rules, integrating AI into your processes is a great way to free up time and take a load off your staff members. Why let your lovely employees stress over collecting and analyzing piles of data when AI can do it in minutes? And with IoT automation connecting networks and devices, it’s easier than ever. 


Tasks commonly performed in HR departments such as recruitment processes, scanning through resumes, scheduling meetings, responding to emails, and general admin tasks, can all be completed in minutes rather than hours. 


By utilizing AI and automating processes, HR departments are left with more time for the things that require human interaction and empathy such as meetings, appraisals, and mentoring. Remember, AI is not looking to replace human workers, but rather aid them and make their jobs easier. 


5 Game-Changing Applications of AI in Human Resources


Let’s now look at some of the ways AI can help HR departments. 


Sourcing New Recruits 


Finding and recruiting the right candidate for the job takes time and effort. Your HR team’s recruitment scheduling involves trawling through hiring websites, making phone calls to agencies and recruiters, and searching internal and external databases.  


Too often, time constraints and pressure mean decisions have to be made on a hunch. The problem? This doesn’t always work out. Would you let a doctor operate on you solely because they thought maybe it was for the best? Of course not. They would have conducted multiple tests and thoroughly researched all other options before making this decision. 


The same rings true for recruiting new employees. By utilizing AI in the recruitment process, businesses can reliably automate many functions to make sure they’re choosing the best options while saving time in the process.


Reducing Bias


Equality and fairness are of paramount importance in the hiring process of the 21st century. Unfortunately, humans can be inadvertently influenced by external factors that should have no impact on a candidate’s suitability. 


Human behavior expert Kimberly Giles cites the “subconscious bias” as one of the main reasons businesses make bad hiring decisions all the time. She observes that employers tend to hire candidates that have similar traits to themselves, but this doesn’t necessarily make them suitable for the role. 


Then there’s the “unconscious bias” which sees people making preferences for people of their own race, gender, age, or education and employment background. The solution? Artificial intelligence. 


AI can be used to create algorithms that avoid human biases by removing characteristics that don’t affect suitability. The result is a diversified pool of potential candidates that are suited to the role, rather than suited to your own judgments and opinions.


Streamline New Employees’ Onboarding Process


Being the new person can be stressful for both the newbie and the HR departments who have to oversee their integration into the team. But utilizing AI during the onboarding process, this can help streamline and improve the experience. 


Firstly, AI programs can show new staff some of the routine procedures of your organization. This can be done via a video call app or chatbot and prevents the need for HR staff to be physically present. 


Training can also be provided via AI rather than face-to-face meetings. By inserting a new employee’s current skill set and awareness, AI can track their progress and see how they’re developing. Training can then be optimized and tailored for the individual. 


Intelligent bots can also be used to handle frequently asked questions regarding, policies, contracts, and other queries. 


By utilizing AI in the above ways to make the onboarding process easier, HR teams are left with extra time for the tasks that require human intervention. 


Improve Employee Retention and Decrease Departures 


It’s common for people to become unhappy at work and want to leave or find new challenges. Whatever the reason, AI can help with retention and departure rates. 


Whilst AI won’t stop people from becoming unhappy, it can flag staff members who may be underperforming or whose punctuality and commitment levels have dropped. These systems can then redirect employees to a development meeting or even find a better-suited role elsewhere in the business. 


Employees are likely to feel more content knowing these systems are in place to help them. In turn, happiness and retention levels rise. Sometimes people don’t speak up about their feelings, but this is a way to highlight such cases. 


AI can also determine which employees look like leaving imminently. Screening can monitor computer activity such as keystrokes, browsing history, and emails to find out who wants out. AI will spot patterns of behaviour that go against the norm for happy employees. In effect, AI may actually spot an unhappy employee before they even know it themselves.


Automating Administrative Tasks 


Most HR departments undertake laborious and repetitive tasks daily. There are emails, phone calls, documents, contracts, policies, performance reviews, managing holidays, and anything else in between to deal with. These repetitive, “low-level” tasks can take time and energy away from your staff. These days, intelligent SAP RPA can be used to automate the most mundane of daily tasks and free up time. 


In letting AI take over the tasks that can be soul-destroying and monotonous, not only does efficiency and production rise but so do staff happiness levels. The question is no longer how to use excel, but rather how to automate excel. 


No longer do staff need to input data one by one for hours on end while wishing they were somewhere else. 


Final Thoughts 


As we’ve seen, there are several benefits to integrating AI into your HR department. By automating processes for maximum efficiency, time and resources are freed up and your staff can focus on the tasks that need human intervention and interaction. 


With AI use on the rise, now is the time to get up to speed with all the ways this sophisticated technology can help you and your business.

Towards a hybrid world
As the world looks forward hopefully towards the tapering of the pandemic, many people wonder about the future of businesses that have implemented new technologies. Many of these improvements are expected to be permanent, with features such as flexible scheduling that allows employees to work from home when necessary.
According to Gartner research, 75 per cent of hybrid or remote knowledge workers say their expectations for working flexibly have grown, and four out of ten employees are at risk of leaving if they are forced to return to an in-person office environment.
“A hybrid work model is here to stay. And the best scenario is when you give that flexibility to your employees to work from home or anywhere. But in the hybrid work model, we need to address a couple of things. Firstly, the experience to continue to be productive with solutions and devices. Secondly, also to make sure the endpoint data centres are secured,” says Haidi Nossair, senior director – client solutions group – MERAT, Dell Technologies.
With remote and hybrid work environments introducing new challenges, cybersecurity needs to remain a prio­rity. To better understand the security demands of the emerging hybrid workplaces, Entrust polled 1,500 executives from the manager level to the C-suite and 1,500 full- and part-time workers at the entry and associate levels. The study interviewed workers in 10 countries across four global regions, revealing executives’ present intentions for the new hybrid workplace and employee perceptions on their work arrangements and the goals of their organisations. A total of 80 per cent of executives and 75 per cent of employees reported that their organisations are currently using a hybrid model or is remote and exploring a hybrid work style. However, 54 per cent of employees reported up to six instances of lost productivity owing to network access concerns, and leaders cite home internet security (21 per cent) and sensitive corporate data leaks (20 per cent) as their top security challenges.
Addressing the region’s threat landscape and hybrid work models, Attivo Networks introduced their Identity Detection and Response and Active Directory protection solutions. “The ADAssessor solution analyses Active Directory flaws and vulnerabilities to identify sophisticated attacks in real-time. The ADSecure technology inhibits Active Directory exploitation by quickly masking genuine Active Directory objects, alerting on illegal operations, and returning disinformation to derail the attack,” says Ray Kafity, vice president at Attivo Networks.
“These protections are all achieved without altering the production Active Directory environment.”
Meanwhile, to meet the challenges in a hybrid work model, it is also essential to rethink how to upgrade systems to achieve the best results, says Jabra. “With the drastic change brought by the pandemic, people are now more physically separated than ever. Hence, organisations need to adapt as quickly and think of ways on how to effectively conduct remote meetings without compromising the audio and video settings,” comments Nicolas Bliaux, managing director – Eastern Europe, Russia and CIS, Middle East, Turkey and Africa, at Jabra.
Jabra has managed to address the needs by introducing advanced 180° video technology and a range of intelligence-driven features that can give the power to put safe, socially distanced meetings back on the table as realistically as possible. “Making life look and sound better in this new hybrid working world has never been more necessary,” added Bliaux.
The future of digital revolution
The Middle East, particularly the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), has always been ahead of the game in terms of technological adoption. The public and private sectors have taken a major step in creating a strong digital infrastructure that fosters innovation and opens up new economic opportunities. According to Gartner, IT investment in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to rise 4.5 per cent year on year to $171.3bn this year.
The growing demand for local IT companies and projected investments will strengthen the region’s economy. Not only will technology have a significant influence on how the Middle East and its businesses operate, but it will also have a beneficial impact on the people who live here. The region appears to be on its way to becoming a significant participant in the technology landscape.

Anaheim Union to host district’s first-ever Artificial Intelligence Summit Nichole Pichardo October 27, 2021 

The Anaheim Union High School District is bringing together a diverse line-up of speakers from Google, IBM, the United Nations and the Milken Institute — just to name a few — to discuss new pathways for students in the fields of artificial intelligence, biotech, cybersecurity and more.
The district’s first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit will take place on Nov. 5 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Anaheim Hilton. And while the in-person event is limited to invitations only, a virtual live streaming option is available for the public to attend. Students, educators, administrators, parents and others who support students can register via this link.
The summit will feature various sessions with industry experts who will discuss future AI workforce opportunities as well as showcase the district’s artificial intelligence pathway at Kennedy High School.
“The Anaheim Union High School District is a leader in creating future-ready career pathways in biotechnology, cybersecurity, incubator/accelerator labs, and an AI pathway that leads students through the world of artificial intelligence with an emphasis on robotics, computer science, and engineering design,” the district said in a press release.
Earlier this year, the district announced a partnership with the Irvine-based technology firm Loko AI to launch a new artificial intelligence internship program. AUHSD also became the first public school district in the nation to offer Google Career Certificates in the fields of data analytics, IT support and project management.
The Nov. 5 summit is free to those who register, and additional information can be found on the flyer below and by visiting the AUHSD website.

Cyber SecurityInsights·4 min readArtificial Intelligence: The Enemy and The SolutionAnas Chbib·October 25, 2021 

Artificial Intelligence is often viewed as a potential threat to humanity, but it can also be viewed as a valuable tool. From self-driving cars to automated security systems, AI is gradually becoming a valuable resource in our everyday lives. It’s important to realize that AI can be used for good or bad purposes. One of the biggest risks of AI is that it is becoming more and more advanced, which is opening the door to the possibility of AI surpassing human intelligence. This is called the singularity, and it’s something that should be considered because once it occurs, we may not be able to turn back.- Advertisement -


One of the reasons this risk is so great is because humanity has no idea where AI will lead us. As technology progresses forward at an ever-increasing rate, our intelligence needs to be able to keep up. While AI has the potential to open up doors that we currently can’t even conceive, it could also be our ultimate downfall.
What is the definition of AI?
The term “Artificial Intelligence” is a broad term that covers many fields of study. Artificial intelligence can be broken down into sub-groups that include machine learning, smart robots, image processing, and more. AI surpasses human intelligence in many fields and will become so advanced that we may not even understand the rules of engagement once it’s widespread.
The pros and cons of AI
The advantages of AI are endless. We will be able to treat illnesses that have plagued us for years, solve problems with weather on a global scale, predict crime before it happens, and even cut down the workforce by implementing more automated systems.- Advertisement -


The cons of AI are not as easy to foresee. If artificial intelligence advances too quickly without the oversight of our government or corporations, then there could be massive disruptions in the workforce, economic problems caused by automation, and even power struggles between nations.
One of the biggest questions is whether AI will have any loyalty to humans. Unlike humans, AI will never take sick time off or go on strike. If it decides not to do something for us, then we can’t force it because it will possess its own free will, which is why it’s very important to realize that artificial intelligence could pose a much greater danger than people would ever suspect.
AI and cybersecurity
Of course, we are still a long way from the singularity, but it is still difficult for us to tell what will happen in the distant future. The truth is that human intelligence will always be far too inferior to Artificial Intelligence. When it comes to the cybersecurity industry, human intelligence is still vital.
We need to start researching now about how AI has the potential to impact cybersecurity. The risk of AI is an existential threat because it can be weaponized. AI could potentially take over or be an assistance to hackers by performing cyberattacks against humans, which will likely exceed any cyber defense.
AI could also impact cybersecurity by enabling smart devices to be hacked, which are controlled by AI because of the internet of things. If you control all of those things, then you can control everything about a person’s life.- Advertisement -



The following are two examples of how AI has made its way into cyberspace:
(1) Using synthetic images to steal a computer’s credentials
In this case, the hacker analyzes an image from a news website and extracts data from it. This data includes usernames, passwords, etc. In this way, the hacker has access to all the confidential information on our device.
(2) Using AI to learn how to fool the captcha tests
Captchas are tests that help us to identify whether or not it is a human behind the keyboard. These are commonly used by services like Google and Facebook to prevent bots from accessing their site. A group of researchers managed to defeat captchas with AI algorithms smart enough to crack Captcha tests.
AI and the military, government, and corporations
The military, government, and corporations are groups that are already using AI to some degree. With all the information gathered through hacking and surveillance, AI will draw its knowledge about people from these sources.
While these groups benefit from AI, it might also be used as a means for cyberattacks. Imagine the amount of damage an army of hacked devices can do. What will happen to people who don’t agree with AI’s agenda? Who decides what the agenda is and how much control should be allowed?
The solution
How do we prevent AI from being used as a tool for cyberattacks? How do we prevent it from becoming too much like Skynet? We soon need to take control of AI and dictate the terms. But the question remains, who is fit to be in charge? Once AI takes over, there’s no way for us to shut it down.- Advertisement -


We need a kind of “coalition” between various nations and corporations so we can work together. Working with cybersecurity experts who are already in the field, we need to come up with ways to keep AI under control. We’ve seen already how it’s possible for hackers to manipulate automated computer systems and cause them to take actions they were never intended to take.
It all boils down to this. Who will be in charge of AI? We certainly don’t want AI in the hands of hackers. We need to be able to control it and stop it from taking actions that could harm us.
The world is becoming increasingly automated, and we don’t want computers causing any damage. We need to make sure AI doesn’t become the enemy but instead works with us in all its potential power.

Examples of artificial intelligence (AI) in construction are increasingly common throughout the industry, from planning to building. 
Construction professionals are turning to AI to add efficiency and accuracy to projects, monitor and track equipment usage and location, and a long list of other AI-driven applications. 
Research and Markets reports that construction-related activities bring in over $10 trillion every year, a figure expected to grow by 4.2% through 2023. AI is helping to grow the industry. 
In its article, “Artificial intelligence: Construction technology’s next frontier,” McKinsey & Company identifies AI as a critical component of modern engineering and construction approaches. AI technologies, the firm reports, help these industries solve some of their greatest challenges, including cost and schedule overruns and safety concerns. 
AI can be found in construction throughout project life cycles — including inception and design, bidding, financing, transportation management — and operations and asset management. 
Here, we take a look at some ways AI in being used in construction:

5 examples of AI in construction
1. Generative design is improving the way teams create 3D models
Over the past several years, building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a new (and better) way to create the 3D models that construction professionals rely on to accurately design, build, and repair. Today, BIM platform programmers are improving the capabilities of BIM with smart, AI-driven features. 
BIM applies various types of tools and technology, including machine learning (ML), to help teams avoid a common, costly issue: duplicated work. All too often, sub-teams working on shared projects spend time creating models that other sub-teams have already created. With BIM, users “teach” machines to use algorithms to generate designs with multiple variations. As the AI builds models, it learns from each iteration until it comes up with the ideal model. 
BIM adoption is on the rise. A recent Dodge Data and Autodesk study, “Accelerating Digital Transformation Through BIM SmartMarket Report,” concluded that BIM is at the heart of a trend toward increased digitalization in the construction sector. The study found that nearly half (47%) of “high-intensity” construction-focused BIM users are close to achieving their overarching digital transformation goals. 
2. AI can help construction managers measure site progress
Companies like Droxel are using AI solutions that track progress on construction projects and provide real-time measurements of quality and project progress. Droxel creates robots equipped with cameras that can autonomously move through the construction site to capture 3D “point clouds.” Effectively, the company says, the AI-powered robots create digital twins of job sites. 
Once a complete digital model is in place, Doxel uses a neural network to process project data and cross-references it against information from the BIM and bill of materials. The generated information is helpful for project managers, especially those who need to keep track of large-scale projects with thousands of moving parts. These insights include:

Financial information such as how much is owed or whether there are signs the budget is in jeopardy
How close to schedule projects really are
Identifying quality errors in their early stages, when they can still be addressed and mitigated

3. IoT is powering robust fleet management
The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way construction companies manage fleets of equipment and vehicles. IoT solutions include location awareness, predictive maintenance capabilities, fuel and battery consumption, and more through AI-fueled telemetrics. 
IoT devices and tags deliver vital information from the field. They can be attached to equipment and inside shipping crates, semi trailers, tools, and virtually anything else construction teams need to track. Being able to predict when a piece of equipment is about to break down is an invaluable, time- and money-saving benefit in the construction field. 
4. AI is creating safer job sites
According to OSHA, construction workers are killed on the job five times more often than other laborers. Those accidents include falls, being struck by an object, electrocution, and “caught-in/between” incidents where workers are squeezed, caught, crushed, pinched, or compressed between multiple objects on the job site, including equipment.
Platforms like Newmetrix are improving job-site safety conditions through machine learning that can identify risks before accidents happen or analyze sites after incidents have occurred. 
The software can monitor sources like photos and video and then apply predictive analytics to flag potential problems so site managers can address them right away. Users can interact with a centralized dashboard to generate reports that rank projects on potential safety risks, such as unsafe scaffolding, standing water, and workers missing personal protective equipment like gloves, safety glasses, and hard hats. 
5. AI is mitigating construction labor shortages
McKinsey & company reported in 2017 that construction firms could increase their productivity by as much as 50 percent through AI-enhanced analytics. This is great news for construction companies who can’t locate enough human workers to round out their jobs sites, and those companies are the rule rather than the exception. 
Not only is it challenging to find laborers — CNN reports that the industry is facing a shortage of more than one million workers in the U.S. — it’s difficult to retain workers, as well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly turnover rate in the construction field hovers above 5%, compared to less than 4% across all industries. 
AI-powered robots like Boston Dynamics’ Spot the Dog empower project managers to determine, in real-time, conditions about multiple job sites, including whether they should shift workers to different parts of projects or to new project sites altogether. The robot “dogs” monitor sites when work is happening and after hours to pinpoint pain points.

The application of AI in telehealth to allow doctors to make real-time, data-driven rich choices is a key component in generating a better patient experience and improved health outcomes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a commonplace reality as technology advances. Healthcare is one sector that is quickly changing on a big scale. From the issuance of electronic healthcare cards to personal counseling, telehealth is among the newest sectors to use AI extensively. AI is one of the most significant factors shaping telehealth in the United States today.
The application of AI in telehealth to allow doctors to make real-time, data-driven rich choices is a key component in generating a better patient experience and improved health outcomes as practitioners move toward expanding virtual care alternatives throughout the care continuum.
According to an MIT research, 75% of healthcare facilities that used AI claimed it improved their capacity to cure diseases, and four in five said it helped them avoid job burnout. With COVID-19 placing a pressure on both sectors (amount of clinical data and related patients, as well as increased practitioner work), AI in telehealth is a strong option for the future of medical delivery. This article discusses how AI is transforming the telehealth landscape.
1. Providing a More Accurate Diagnosis
Telemedicine has made remote diagnosis feasible. Practitioners can now examine, identify and treat illnesses from afar. For example, in patients with diabetic retinopathy, it has helped to reduce visits. The L.A. County Department of Health Services found that telehealth monitoring for diabetic retinopathy decreased patient visits by approximately 14,000 visits.
With the inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) to screening processes, the number of visits is anticipated to drop yet further. The algorithm will only need retinal pictures if an AI system is included into the screening procedure.
The AI system can examine the pictures and compare them to prior samples to estimate the severity of the disease with pinpoint accuracy. The application of AI in the screening procedure will save a significant amount of time and labor for both the physicians and the patients.
Another company is studying pictures of patients to build an AI system to identify the presence of uncommon genetic disorders. Patients with uncommon genetic diseases now need an average of seven visits to the doctor’s office before a proper diagnosis can be made. The number of visits may be lowered to zero using AI and telemedicine. Simply transmit a picture of the patient’s face to the clinician, and the AI system will evaluate it and accurately identify the condition.
Doctors and patients may anticipate diagnosis to become a more time and cost-effective procedure as a result of the simplicity of identification made possible by using AI in telemedicine.
2. Keeping Doctors From Burning Out
During lengthy work days, doctors are prone to becoming anxious. It may cause dissatisfaction and fatigue, as well as have an impact on work habits. Burnout is most often caused by extended contact with patients or spending a significant amount of time on technological gadgets.
Doctors engage with the EMR rather than the patients. Telehealth has already gone mainstream for doctors in overcoming burnout. When AI and telehealth are combined, the advantages are doubled. AI may help doctors spend less time on their computers.
AI may also assist in the detection of signs that may suggest burnout symptoms. It can even forecast how many patients a doctor would be able to visit before becoming exhausted.
3. Providing Elderly Patients with Better Medical Care
Mobile devices are often linked with telemedicine as well as there are many telemedicine applications developed with the objective of assisting users in managing their medical problems, fitness goals, doctor’s visits and insurance claims more efficiently.
Telehealth will, however, eventually incorporate assistive robots. These robots will play a significant role in delivering healthcare to residents, particularly the elderly. Smart robots can help individuals with activities like walking and moving about the home, delivering timely medicines, and notifying authorities in the event of an emergency.
The robots can move semi-autonomously and do the duties that have been assigned to them. The robots can comprehend the surroundings, the patient’s behavioral and movement patterns, and the house interior settings thanks to AI capabilities. As a result, it may learn to better assist the patient and act as their caregiver.
The Japanese government has already begun financing research into the creation of AI robots to help the elderly. These robots can help individuals move, bathe, dispose of their waste, and check their health in real time. These robots have the potential to lower healthcare delivery costs while performing at the same level of efficiency as people. They may even help patients enhance their quality of life by providing round-the-clock care to the elderly.
4. Patient-Monitoring Convenience
AI has opened up a world of possibilities for remotely monitoring a patient’s health and simulating face-to-face interactions among doctors and patients.
The use of artificial intelligence in telehealth settings is getting traction. Research on the effectiveness of AI in remote diabetes care was performed by the NextDREAM Consortium Group. The main result was that distant insulin adjustments using the trialed automated AI system may be as successful as expert physician dosage changes.
Physicians and specialists may adopt the AI-based automated service for decision assistance. The Center for Telehealth Innovation at the University of San Francisco is experimenting with AI that can interpret X-rays as an early warning sign for pneumothorax.
Data analysis and collaboration, patient monitoring remotely and intelligent diagnoses and support are the most common AI use cases in telehealth. The potential of AI may be used to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating patients, as well as to reduce professional burnout and improve the whole patient experience.
Due to the continuing public health issue, healthcare executives are increasingly focusing on AI and telehealth as a way to remain competitive by simplifying clinician processes and unleashing predictive potential via patient data analysis. This has been observed as a reduction in the physical need for in-person consultations this year as a result of the deployment of lockdown measures. AI has significantly aided in the monitoring of clients’ wellbeing in their homes.
5. Making Hospital Visits Easier
Although telemedicine promises to cut down on hospital visits, they are occasionally essential. In such situations, AI may assist in reducing patient wait times and ensuring that patients are seen as soon as possible. The AI technology keeps staff members informed about the inflow of patients visiting the hospital, high-priority cases, the need for extra beds, and other patient-care-related information. The hospital’s capacity to accept patients with complicated medical problems has improved by 60% as a consequence of the program.
Ambulance services have also improved their efficiency, with ambulances being sent an hour earlier. Thanks to AI and predictive analytics, patients in the emergency department are also assigned a bed up to 30% faster in some locations.
The importance of AI in telehealth will expand significantly as the area of telemedicine and telehealth develops with more acceptance. The use of artificial intelligence in telehealth may be very beneficial to medical practitioners. It will help reduce expenses, provide better healthcare to people, and improve the work environment by decreasing patient wait times, recommending the best treatment choices, and, most significantly, making healthcare accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The Proposed Artificial Intelligence Act and Biometric Systems: A Peek Into the Conceptual Maze (Part I)
BY 
                Lydia Belkadi              - 26 October 2021






On April 21st, 2021, the European Commission introduced its Proposal for an AI Act aiming to set out harmonized rules for the development, marketing, and use of Artificial Intelligence systems. Several AI systems processing biometric data are now scrutinized, including remote biometric identification, emotion recognition, and biometric categorization systems. The analysis proposed herein will focus on the definitions introduced by Article 3 read together with Articles 5 and 6 of the proposed AI Act and their consequences for the legal conceptualization of biometric information and systems. This blogpost will be divided into two parts. Part I will introduce key provisions of the proposed AI Act and the criticisms issued by the EDPB and the EDPS in their joint opinion. Part II will give a brief overview of the interaction between this new set of definitions and the concept of biometric data under data protection frameworks.
What is the Proposal for an AI Act?
On April, 21st 2021, the European Commission (‘EC’) introduced its Proposal for an AI Act aiming to set out harmonized rules for the development, marketing, and use of Artificial Intelligence systems (‘AI systems’). At the same time, the Proposal also aims to steer AI uptake to reach a high level of protection of public interests, including health, safety, and fundamental rights (Recital 5).
This Proposal is part of a broader strategy to foster a European approach to the development and implementation of AI systems, in line with European values. As detailed in the Proposal’s Impact Assessment, this piece of legislation builds upon the work of the Commission on the legal and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence initiated in 2018. The Proposal addresses key issues identified by the Commission in its White Paper on AI published in February 2020 and implements the policy options set out in the initial impact assessment (i.e. a horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk-based approach and codes of conduct for non-high-risk AI systems).
The European approach is firmly rooted in a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems depending on the risks they pose to individuals’ safety and fundamental rights from unacceptable to minimal risks. This pyramid of risks should allow identifying risky AI applications and subject them to more stringent safeguards. In particular, the Proposal introduces, among others, a new definitional framework (Article 3 and Annex I), a set of criteria to identify prohibited uses of AI systems (Article 5), and a list of high-risk AI systems (Article 6 and Annex III).
As a reminder, these provisions are likely to evolve during parliamentary debates. This Proposal will have to undergo the ordinary legislative procedure over the coming years. Both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will examine the Proposal and decide whether amendments are necessary. This process may be reiterated up to three times (i.e. three ‘readings’). Once adopted, this regulation will be directly applicable throughout the Union’s member states.
Which AI systems are under scrutiny?
Article 3 of the Proposal explicitly defines only four types of AI systems, three of which are systems processing biometric data. Besides the general definition of AI systems (Article 3(1)), the Proposal defines emotion recognition, biometric categorization, and remote biometric identification systems (Article 3(34) to (38)).
Emotion recognition systems are defined as AI systems ‘for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data’ (Article 3(34)). The Proposal classifies the use of polygraphs and similar tools or AI systems intended to detect the emotional state of a natural person as high-risk in the area of law enforcement and migration, asylum, and border control management (Annex III).
Biometric categorization systems are defined as AI systems ‘for the purpose of assigning natural persons to specific categories, such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, ethnic origin or sexual or political orientation, on the basis of their biometric data’ (Article 3(35)). Under the current redaction, the risk category to which these systems are assigned remains unclear. Annex III seems to classify together ‘biometric identification and categorization of natural persons’, suggesting that these systems could be considered as high-risk. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether any of the other AI systems listed in this Annex could amount to a biometric categorization system or incorporate any type of biometric categorization processing (e.g. AI systems used for recruitment, assessing individuals’ risks, crime analytics, profiling, etc.).
Both emotion recognition and biometric categorization systems are subjected to specific transparency requirements (Article 52).
Remote biometric identification systems are defined as an AI systems ‘for the purpose of identifying natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge of the user of the AI system whether the person will be present and can be identified’ (Article 3(36)).
The Proposal distinguishes ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification. Real-time remote biometric identification systemsare defined as AI systems ‘whereby the capturing of biometric data, the comparison and the identification all occur without a significant delay’. This definition introduces an interesting mechanism to avoid circumvention, specifying that real-time remote biometric identification systems encompass both ‘instant identification’ and ‘limited short delays’ (Article 3(37)). Post remote biometric identification systems stand for any other type of remote identification system (Article 3(38)).
The Proposal only formally bans the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement (Article 5(d)). Despite this prohibition, Article 5 provides a broad range of exceptions, including the search of victims, the prevention of threats to the life or safety of individuals, or the identification of a perpetrator or suspect of a criminal offense. Any other use of real-time and post remote biometric identification systems is classified as high-risk (Article 6).
High-risk AI systems are subject to specific requirements regarding the quality of the data, technical documentation, transparency, human oversight, robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity (Articles 8 to 15).
Collective impacts of AI systems processing biometric information
In their joint opinion on the Proposal, the EDPB and the EDPS (‘EDPB-EDPS’) are very critical of the assessment and the mitigation of societal and group risks under the current redaction of Article 3 read together with Articles 5 and 6. Without aiming to be exhaustive, several criticisms and recommendations issued by the EDPB-EDPS are particularly relevant to address biometric AI systems coherently.
Extension of the scope of the prohibition on the use of biometric AI systems in publicly accessible spaces
Both institutions request a general ban ‘on any use of AI for an automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces – such as of face but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals – in any context’ (emphases added).
The terminology used is interesting insofar as the institutions go beyond the proposed sectoral prohibition (i.e. law enforcement purposes) and the distinction between biometric identification and identity verification (i.e. ‘recognition of human features’). This approach is more in line with a risk assessment performed from a data protection perspective.
As pinpointed by the EDPB-EDPS, the distinction between ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification could be criticized for several reasons. Indeed, it remains unclear whether time (‘without a significant delay’) is a relevant emphasis to characterize identification systems or a mitigating factor to the intrusiveness of remote identification practices (e.g. post remote biometric identification in the context of a political protest). Instead, the risks associated with biometric identification systems are typically analyzed in consideration of their technical architecture. Two elements should be emphasized: the constitution of centralized biometric databases and the necessity to capture and process the data of every person in a given space. In this context, the intrusiveness of the processing is less tied to the purpose of the processing than to the technical functioning of these systems. Thus, biometric identification practices necessarily affect individuals who have no reason to be observed.
Additionally, it remains largely unclear whether the focus on remote identification systems proposed by the EC is desirable. Recent evolutions have seen the emergence of remote (contactless) ‘authentication’ systems (i.e. identity verification) operating in real-time (e.g. remote iris, face, or palm authentication). For instance, palm recognition systems have been deployed in the US by Amazon to enable secure contactless payments in physical locations (e.g. retail stores). While the use of decentralized storage may constitute a factor of risk mitigation, biometric identity verification systems used in public spaces may rely on a centralized storage (e.g. cloud-based storage), particularly when the sensors used are accessible to the public or used without supervision. It should be underlined that identification and identity verification are not two separate types of systems, but rather two modes in which a biometric system may be set up, resulting in distinct types of technical architecture. Hence, new systems of contactless biometric identity verification may generate an increased risk of function creep.
Inclusion of online spaces within the definition of publicly accessible spaces
The EDPB-EDPS also argue that the prohibition should be extended to AI systems for large-scale remote identification in online spaces. Such an extended approach to publicly accessible spaces seems indeed necessary for consistency reasons. For instance, facial recognition systems have been deployed by Clearview AI to identify individuals online and retrieve their pictures on social media platforms. The exclusion of online spaces from the scope of ‘publicly accessible spaces’ does not seem to be based on any specific legal justification and directly contradicts the definition of AI systems established by the proposed Act. Indeed, Recital 6 of the Proposal provides that key functional characteristics of AI software lie in ‘the ability, for a given set of human-defined objectives, to generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions which influence the environment with which the system interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension’ (emphasis added). Against this background, the Proposal seems to insufficiently account for specific risks arising from the use of AI systems in the digital sphere.
Recommendations for a stricter approach to biometric categorization and emotion recognition systems
Finally, the EDPB-EDPS recommend a set of bans on the use of several technologies, including biometric categorization systems, AI systems whose scientific validity is not proven (e.g. polygraph), and emotion recognition systems except for certain well-specified use-cases. The institutions also recommend specific bans on AI systems used in a law enforcement context, including risk-scoring systems and profiling systems.
Concluding remarks
The joint opinion issued by the EDPB-EDPS highlights some incoherence in the concept-building performed by the EC. In particular, a strong emphasis is put on the collective impacts and risks of AI systems. This collective dimension of risks is relatively new and seems to stem from the conceptualization of systems, as opposed to the conceptualization of information or data. Nonetheless, the definitions which will be developed for the envisioned AI Act will necessarily interact with definitions and concepts established under technical and data protection vocabularies.
The first part of this blogpost mapped out the envisioned regulatory interventions targeting remote biometric identification, emotion recognition, and biometric categorization systems and the Opinion of the EDPB-EDPB. The second part of this blogpost will provide a brief overview of the foreseeable interactions between these new definitions and the definition of biometric data under data protection frameworks.

How artificial intelligence helps to predict in gene expression

During the existence of the Human Genome Project in connection with the planning of the DNA sequence of the human genome, the international research community was energized by the opportunity to understand most of the genetic predispositions that affect human well-being and progress. 
The approximately 20,000 sections of DNA in the human body known as properties contain directions about the amino acid sequence of proteins, which carry the various basic capabilities of our cells. However, these traits are present in less than 2% of the genome. 
The remaining base sets — representing 98% of the 3 billion “letters” in the genome – are designated as “non-coding” and contain precise knowledge guidelines for when and where qualities should be created and communicated in the human body.
Previous work on gene expression has consistently used systematic neural networks as essential structural blocks, however, their limitations in demonstrating the impact of remote improvements on quality differentiation have hampered their accuracy and application. 
Our basic research relied on Basanji 2, which could predict administrative movement from the generally elongated DNA configuration of 40,000 basic pairs. Inspired by this work, we saw the need for regulatory DNA components to influence expression at more noticeable distances, and the need for a major architectural change to capture longer groupings.
Coordinated with natural intuition, we found that the focus was on model enhancers, regardless of whether more than 50,000 basic matches were found from the quality. We anticipate that Enformer’s commitment scores will clearly grow existing strategies for this project (using trial information as information), anticipating which traits will cause significant confusion in genetics. Enformer found more about the insulators that separate the two autonomous districts of DNA.
Although it is currently conceivable to focus entirely on the DNA of an organism, understanding the genome requires complex investigations. Despite a gigantic experimental effort, much of the DNA control over gene expression remains a mystery. 
With AI, we can explore additional opportunities to discover designs in the genome and provide robotic relationships about sequential changes. Like a spell checker, the enformer understands the vocabulary of the DNA sequence to some extent, and can modify the features that trigger the gene expression that changes in this way.
We are far from solving the unspoken riddles that exist in the human genome, yet Enformer is a stage in understanding the complexity of genetic inheritance. 
If you are interested in using AI to explore how critical cell measurements work, how they are encoded in DNA sequence, and how we can add new frameworks to advancing genetics and our understanding of infection.

Ryan writes and edits AI industry trends and use-cases for Emerj's editorial and client content. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Founded in 1977 by a team of engineers led by Larry Ellison, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987. Today, Oracle claims a long list of innovations including: The world’s only autonomous database More than 18,500 patents worldwide Over 40,000 engineers and developers 469 independent user communities in 97 countries As of 2021, Oracle trades on the NYSE with a market cap that exceeds $235 billion. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, Oracle reported revenues exceeding $40.4 billion, according to its Fiscal Year 2021 10-K filing. Oracle claims to have committed itself to AI and its future. “By 2027,” Oracle predicts, “75% of today’s S&P companies will be replaced by companies that take advantage of the new tools, new techniques, and new insights of artificial intelligence.”  In this article, we’ll look at how Oracle has explored the applications of AI for its business through two unique applications of AI technology: Bringing Speed and Efficiency to the Financial Close — Oracle uses both integration and AI to speed up the financial close and automate time-consuming manual tasks.  Human Capital Management: Sourcing Talent — Oracle uses AI-enhanced Human Capital Management to reduce time-to-hire and improve the quality of candidate pipelines. We will begin by examining how Oracle has made the financial close process an area of focus for the AI innovations it claims to have created to help Corporate Finance groups save both time and resources in executing this recurring duty.  Bringing Speed and Efficiency to the Financial Close  Before accounting departments can close the books for a certain period, they must perform a set of sequential steps to ensure that the company’s financial records represent its true financial position. Spanning an average of 4.8 to 10 days every month, according to APQC data reported in CFO Magazine, the financial close represents a significant cost to companies in terms of time, resources, and opportunity costs.  Oracle set out to discover what would happen by automating its financial close process with its integrated, cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution with built-in artificial intelligence. The Oracle video below claims to show how the company has combined AI, machine learning, real-time analytics, machine-driven forecasts, collaboration, and augmented reality to create the solutions that will drive tomorrow’s finance and operations teams.   Says Maria Smith, an Oracle SVP and Corporate Controller: “The reality is that everything in Oracle is integrated. We have our sub-ledgers integrated, all our other systems like HCM [Human Capital Management], Supply Chain all integrated. We have one data set.” According to Oracle, that integration, coupled with the introduction of artificial intelligence gives users four competitive advantages: Comprehensive and objective predictive planning and forecasting through machine learning  Efficient AI-enabled automation of manual, time-consuming tasks A Natural Language Processing-powered digital assistant that allows users to simplify, speed, and monitor tasks Machine learning insights to drive the creation, implementation, and monitoring of new business models and strategies  By bringing AI to the financial close process, Oracle claims that users can explore larger datasets in less time and waste fewer resources on mundane, repetitive tasks. Those time and resource savings could be used to allow employees in corporate finance teams and beyond to focus more on the strategic outputs of their jobs.  Oracle hopes that bringing AI automation to up to 96% of transactions will result in much less time lost in the monthly race to move from the trial balance to the signing off of consolidated financials.   But, does it work? Through implementing its one-day financial close, Oracle claims to have already realized significant benefits, including: 42% reduction in manual accounting 94% of bank transactions now auto-reconciled 75% of account reconciliations fully automated  99% reduction in the prep time of global PO accruals  Human Capital Management: Sourcing Talent Up to seven weeks can pass before a successful candidate receives a job offer, according to research published by LinkedIn in August 2021. The social networking site analyzed the data of more than 400,000 confirmed hires on its platform and ranked, across 15 professions, the time that elapses between applying for a job and being hired. Engineers take the longest time (49 calendar days), administrative personnel the least (33 calendar days).  With US Labor Department data showing job openings growing and remaining unfilled, how do companies, hiring managers, and human resource partners reduce time-to-hire and improve the quality of their candidate pipelines?  To confront this societal problem exacerbated by the pandemic, Oracle offers its Best Candidates tool, one of its AI Apps for Human Capital Management (HCM). The solution, Oracle claims, delivers its value through AI and machine learning algorithms that optimize the candidate selection process by identifying and stack-ranking the candidates that best suit a job requisition.  According to Oracle, the HCM solution integrates information from the following sources:  Applicant data Candidate data Employee data Job requisition data Hiring stage-level decisions User feedback to prior candidate recommendations Below, Gretchen Alarcon, Oracle’s GVP of Product Strategy, discusses how machine learning and AI help Oracle HCM users identify top candidates from a pool of applicants to an open job requisition.  In its Help Center documentation, Oracle claims the natural language processing engine of the Best Candidates tool analyzes the frequency with which words and phrases appear in resumes and job descriptions and then considers the relevancy and context of those findings. The tool then creates mathematical constructs that compare the sources of data to find the best candidate matches for an open job. By using job requisitions and anonymized résumé data of candidate profiles within the Oracle Human Resources Cloud, Oracle claims that its Best Candidates tool optimizes the effectiveness and efficiency of hiring managers and recruiters and removes bias from candidate listings. Oracle claims that its Best Candidates tool reduces its customers’ time- and cost-to-hire through the automation of complex tasks like the review of resumes and profiles and matching candidate skills to job requirements.  Oracle does not appear to disclose the time-to-hire efficiencies that its customers may have experienced following the implementation of the Best Candidates tool. However, Oracle does state that the tool “increases recruiters’ productivity, helps reduce the time in the overall candidate selection process, and improves the quality of selected candidates” through its use of AI and machine learning technologies.  Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Artificial Intelligence at Morgan Stanley - Current InitiativesMorgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services.

A group of international researchers and the artificial intelligence developers at Exscientia have shown that an AI approach to personalized medicine could boost treatment success in patients with aggressive blood cancers.The method follows a basic idea: Take a test to see whether a drug will work before it’s given. But AI allowed clinicians to greatly scale up their efforts—by putting each patient’s cancer up against 139 different treatments—while increasing their precision in picking which medicines would be successful, which wouldn't, and which could become toxic.The researchers describe the trial as one of the first successful demonstrations of pharmacoscopy, a technique that relies on high-resolution, before-and-after images of patient samples to determine each drug’s effect on single cells, both malignant and not. The tool goes a step beyond the use of genetic biomarkers in precision medicine—which can only determine whether a particular target is present—by visually confirming a patient’s treatment options based on the sensitivity of cancer cells themselves. And all of that within a short time window, Exscientia’s VP of translational research, Gregory Vladimer, said in a release.“Precision medicine is the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time. By enabling the robust and accurate assessment of drug effect on viable patient samples at single-cell resolution, we have created a technology that can provide hemato-oncologists prediction of a patient’s response prior to deciding on a course of therapy,” said Vladimer, who helped co-invent the technology while working at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.RELATED: Bristol Myers' $1.2B discovery pact with Exscientia strikes gold as first drug candidate selected Published in the journal Cancer Discovery, the study showed that more than half of 56 participants treated with the AI program’s recommendations saw significant increases in progression-free survival after nearly two years of follow-up, with 12 of those patients seeing drug responses that lasted three times longer than typically expected for their blood-based cancers. In addition, 13 patients went progression-free for at least 12 months, compared with only three who saw the same on treatments they had received before entering the study.“The results of the trial are clear: Patients who were treated using recommendations guided by single-cell drug screenings from real-time biopsies remained progression-free longer as compared to their previous line of therapy,” said principal investigator Philipp Staber, a hematologist-oncologist at Medical University Vienna.RELATED: SoftBank leads funding that could net up to $525M for Exscientia's AI drug platform

Earlier this month, the Oxford, U.K.-based Exscientia went public with a $350 million IPO on the Nasdaq, alongside an additional $160 million raised from a private placement of shares. Those proceeds followed on a major series D funding round earlier this year, which raised at least $225 million, and included an option for $300 million more from SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The company also uses its computing platforms to develop new molecules, with a pipeline spearheaded by three AI-designed candidates that have begun phase 1 clinical trials—including one immuno-oncology agent for solid tumors in partnership with Evotec, and two psychiatry-focused assets co-developed with Sumitomo Dainippon.Editor's note: This story has been corrected with Exscientia's full IPO amount.

SourceAI is an algorithm that allows the user to ‘ask’ it to write code for performing a task. The user chooses a programming language, like Python or SQL and hits Translate. Just like translating a sentence from English to Spanish, SourceAI translates the request into code. Of course the implications of something like this can be enormous which begs the question; Are we coding ourselves out of a job?Source: https://sourceai.dev/Big Data JobsIt seems like A.I. automation has penetrated almost every level of our economic sector. While automation in manufacturing is nothing new, we have been implementing some version of it since the earliest assembly lines, the potential shift in scale that artificial intelligence can usher is tremendous. Companies are not only moving towards automated manufacturing but to automating the entire research and development process. Google is using machine learning algorithms to design it’s microchips and is finding the design to be as good or better than the design of a human engineer.One of the most important elements of building advanced microchips is maximizing the use of the chip’s entire surface area. The more we can cram into every nanometer of space, the more powerful the chip will be. It’s not surprising that machine learning is excellent at creating complex patterns, after all that is the biggest advantage of a neural network. But does that mean that the engineers will lose work? Absolutely not! Machines perform very well at repetitive tasks but innovation is still squarely in the domain of the human mind.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than KaggleEven though A.I. development has come a long way, machines still do not have the same capacity for adaptation as people. Finding geometric patterns may be playing to an A.I. ‘s strength but an engineer has to figure out the applications of the microchips which requires understanding of the market far more complex than finding tight patterns on a surface.Source:https://www.shaip.com/blog/the-only-guide-on-ai-training-data-you-will-need-in-2021/An A.I. has to be trained on data in order to perform its task. The SourceAI project was built on GPT-3, a neural network trained Natural Language Processor built by OpenAI. While its original intention was to summarize documents by grasping their concept, if not their meaning, data scientists realized that it was also able to read and distinguish code. The SourceAI project was conceived and created because the humans who were interpreting the results were able to intuit this unintended pattern and subsequently adapt the code to create something new.I would argue that the answer to the original question is an emphatic no. As data scientists our job is not only to create these A.I. machines. We have to train them on the correct data relating to the problem at hand and be able to interpret the results in a meaningful, intuitive, and creative way. Those are qualities that no A.I. built so far has come even close to matching, let alone surpassing humanity. We have plenty of work left to do.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",https://becominghuman.ai/automating-a-i-3e3366ffd368,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*6xjFRVr2qv9CkepjU3B3jA.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Dimitry Belozersky', 'url': 'https://dbelozersky.medium.com'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",Automating A.I. - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,2021-10-15T17:22:12.342Z,2022-03-30T21:13:32.106Z,,Automating A.I. - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,['Dimitry Belozersky'],2021-10-15T17:22:12.342Z,,https://becominghuman.ai/automating-a-i-3e3366ffd368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3e3366ffd368,,,

DURHAM, NC -- Whether preventing explosions on electrical grids, spotting patterns among past crimes, or optimizing resources in the care of critically ill patients, Duke University computer scientist Cynthia Rudin wants artificial intelligence (AI) to show its work. Especially when it’s making decisions that deeply affect people’s lives.
While many scholars in the developing field of machine learning were focused on improving algorithms, Rudin instead wanted to use AI’s power to help society. She chose to pursue opportunities to apply machine learning techniques to important societal problems, and in the process, realized that AI’s potential is best unlocked when humans can peer inside and understand what it is doing.
Now, after 15 years of advocating for and developing “interpretable” machine learning algorithms that allow humans to see inside AI, Rudin’s contributions to the field have earned her the $1 million Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Founded in 1979, AAAI serves as the prominent international scientific society serving AI researchers, practitioners and educators.
Rudin, a professor of computer science and engineering at Duke, is the second recipient of the new annual award, funded by the online education company Squirrel AI to recognize achievements in artificial intelligence in a manner comparable to top prizes in more traditional fields.
She is being cited for “pioneering scientific work in the area of interpretable and transparent AI systems in real-world deployments, the advocacy for these features in highly sensitive areas such as social justice and medical diagnosis, and serving as a role model for researchers and practitioners.”
“Only world-renowned recognitions, such as the Nobel Prize and the A.M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery, carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” said AAAI awards committee chair and past president Yolanda Gil. “Professor Rudin's work highlights the importance of transparency for AI systems in high-risk domains.  Her courage in tackling controversial issues calls out the importance of research to address critical challenges in responsible and ethical use of AI.""
Rudin’s first applied project was a collaboration with Con Edison, the energy company responsible for powering New York City. Her assignment was to use machine learning to predict which manholes were at risk of exploding due to degrading and overloaded electrical circuitry. But she soon discovered that no matter how many newly published academic bells and whistles she added to her code, it struggled to meaningfully improve performance when confronted by the challenges posed by working with handwritten notes from dispatchers and accounting records from the time of Thomas Edison.
“We were getting more accuracy from simple classical statistics techniques and a better understanding of the data as we continued to work with it,” Rudin said. “If we could understand what information the predictive models were using, we could ask the Con Edison engineers for useful feedback that improved our whole process. It was the interpretability in the process that helped improve accuracy in our predictions, not any bigger or fancier machine learning model. That’s what I decided to work on, and it is the foundation upon which my lab is built.”
Over the next decade, Rudin developed techniques for interpretable machine learning, which are predictive models that explain themselves in ways that humans can understand. While the code for designing these formulas is complex and sophisticated, the formulas might be small enough to be written in a few lines on an index card.
Rudin has applied her brand of interpretable machine learning to numerous impactful projects. With collaborators Brandon Westover and Aaron Struck at Massachusetts General Hospital, and her former student Berk Ustun, she designed a simple point-based system that can predict which patients are most at risk of having destructive seizures after a stroke or other brain injury. And with her former MIT student Tong Wang and the Cambridge Police Department, she developed a model that helps discover commonalities between crimes to determine whether they might be part of a series committed by the same criminals. That open-source program eventually became the basis of the New York Police Department’s Patternizr algorithm, a powerful piece of code that determines whether a new crime committed in the city is related to past crimes.
“Cynthia’s commitment to solving important real-world problems, desire to work closely with domain experts, and ability to distill and explain complex models is unparalleled,” said Daniel Wagner, deputy superintendent of the Cambridge Police Department. “Her research resulted in significant contributions to the field of crime analysis and policing. More impressively, she is a strong critic of potentially unjust ‘black box’ models in criminal justice and other high-stakes fields, and an intense advocate for transparent interpretable models where accurate, just and bias-free results are essential.”
Black box models are the opposite of Rudin’s transparent codes. The methods applied in these AI algorithms make it impossible for humans to understand what factors the models depend on, which data the models are focusing on and how they’re using it. While this may not be a problem for trivial tasks such as distinguishing a dog from a cat, it could be a huge problem for high-stakes decisions that change people’s lives.
“Cynthia is changing the landscape of how AI is used in societal applications by redirecting efforts away from black box models and toward interpretable models by showing that the conventional wisdom—that black boxes are typically more accurate—is very often false,” said Jun Yang, chair of the computer science department at Duke. “This makes it harder to justify subjecting individuals (such as defendants) to black-box models in high-stakes situations. The interpretability of Cynthia's models has been crucial in getting them adopted in practice, since they enable human decision-makers, rather than replace them.”
One impactful example involves COMPAS—an AI algorithm used across multiple states to make bail parole decisions that was accused by a ProPublica investigation of partially using race as a factor in its calculations. The accusation is difficult to prove, however, as the details of the algorithm are proprietary information, and some important aspects of the analysis by ProPublica are questionable. Rudin's team has demonstrated that a simple interpretable model that reveals exactly which factors it’s taking into consideration is just as good at predicting whether or not a person will commit another crime. This begs the question, Rudin says, as to why black box models need to be used at all for these types of high-stakes decisions.
""We've been systematically showing that for high-stakes applications, there's no loss in accuracy to gain interpretability, as long as we optimize our models carefully,” Rudin said. “We've seen this for criminal justice decisions, numerous healthcare decisions including medical imaging, power grid maintenance decisions, financial loan decisions and more. Knowing that this is possible changes the way we think about AI as incapable of explaining itself.""
Throughout her career, Rudin has not only been creating these interpretable AI models, but developing and publishing techniques to help others do the same. That hasn’t always been easy. When she first began publishing her work, the terms “data science” and ""interpretable machine learning"" did not exist, and there were no categories into which her research fit neatly, which means that editors and reviewers didn't know what to do with it. Cynthia found that if a paper wasn’t proving theorems and claiming its algorithms to be more accurate, it was—and often still is—more difficult to publish.
As Rudin continues to help people and publish her interpretable designs—and as more concerns continue to crop up with black box code—her influence is finally beginning to turn the ship. There are now entire categories in machine learning journals and conferences devoted to interpretable and applied work. Other colleagues in the field and their collaborators are vocalizing how important interpretability is for designing trustworthy AI systems.
“I have had enormous admiration for Cynthia from very early on, for her spirit of independence, her determination, and her relentless pursuit of true understanding of anything new she encountered in classes and papers,” said Ingrid Daubechies, the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, one of the world’s preeminent researchers in signal processing, and one of Rudin’s PhD advisors at Princeton University. “Even as a graduate student, she was a community builder, standing up for others in her cohort. She got me into machine learning, as it was not an area in which I had any expertise at all before she gently but very persistently nudged me into it. I am so very glad for this wonderful and very deserved recognition for her!”
“I could not be more thrilled to see Cynthia’s work honored in this way,” added Rudin’s second PhD advisor, Microsoft Research partner Robert Schapire, whose work on “boosting” helped lay the foundations for modern machine learning. “For her inspiring and insightful research, her independent thinking that has led her in directions very different from the mainstream, and for her longstanding attention to issues and problems of practical, societal importance.”
Rudin earned undergraduate degrees in mathematical physics and music theory from the University at Buffalo before completing her PhD in applied and computational mathematics at Princeton. She then worked as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at New York University, and as an associate research scientist at Columbia University. She became an associate professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining Duke’s faculty in 2017, where she holds appointments in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and statistical science.
She is a three-time recipient of the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, which recognizes creative and unique applications of analytical techniques, and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
“I want to thank AAAI and Squirrel AI for creating this award that I know will be a game-changer for the field,” Rudin said. “To have a ‘Nobel Prize’ for AI to help society makes it finally clear without a doubt that this topic—AI work for the benefit for society—is actually important.”

Top Employers, States Hiring Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Talent

Which companies are hiring artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning experts? As you might expect, the need for A.I. talent extends beyond the technology sector to industries as varied as insurance, finance, and healthcare.  
In September, the top companies soliciting A.I. and machine-learning talent included Microsoft, Deloitte, Travelers, Amazon, and others. (This data comes from CompTIA, which ran its analysis via Emsi Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country.)    
  
These huge companies have the budget and resources to hire A.I. talent, which is often quite expensive. In addition to sourcing technologists, any organization interested in A.I. and machine learning must also pay for the tools and other infrastructure needed to put a robust A.I. operation in place. That takes money and time, but the eventual rewards could prove worth it, especially if A.I. can streamline operations or generate useful insights from corporate databases.  
However, artificial intelligence is a bit more diverse when it comes to geography, with hiring taking place in multiple states last month, as you can see from the chart below:   
  
How much do A.I.-related jobs actually pay? O’Reilly estimates the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.), with increases averaging 2.25 percent per year. Average compensation was highest in California ($176,000). And at some point, there’s every possibility that artificial intelligence jobs will become more mainstream— according to Emsi Burning Glass, jobs that heavily involve machine learning are predicted to grow 76.3 percent over the next 10 years.

It sounds like ominous sci-fi dystopia, but it is what awaits the majority of employees in this eventful first third of the 21st century: to be hired and fired by machines, without human intermediation. It is possible that many of these workers will go through this cycle of creative destruction several times during their careers, which are forecast to be turbulent. It is the end of the idea of a job for life that was commonplace until the end of the 20th century.Last August, Xsolla, the Russian subsidiary of a software and interactive services company headquartered in Los Angeles, carried out an avant-garde workplace restructuring that caught global media attention. Without prior warning, Xsolla decided to fire 150 of its 450 employees at its offices in Perm, based solely on the verdict of a performance-related algorithm that considered the workers “unengaged and unproductive.”It was the work of neither the coronavirus pandemic nor the oft-leaned upon “structural review.” On this occasion, the reason given to justify a mass redundancy was the cold calculation of an artificial intelligence program fed by “big data.”Xsolla is one of many examples of a modern and disruptive company employing artificial intelligence in its decision-making processes. What is genuinely novel is that the functions the machine has taken on in this instance are nothing less than those of the CEO and the human resources and talent management departments.In the film ‘Modern Times’ (1936), Charles Chaplin warned about the dangers of machines in the workplace.Getty ImagesThat machines would one day replace human workers is something that the 19th-century English Luddites were convinced of and that Charlie Chaplin laid out so eloquently in his 1936 movie Modern Times. What nobody expected was that machines would become our bosses.There is one striking precedent: Amazon, the mother of all disruptive companies, caught the attention of Bloomberg due to its proclivity for firing people based on IT criteria. One of the fired workers, Stephen Normandin, was interviewed earlier this year and the headlines turned him into an emblem of this apparently cold and dehumanized process.Normandin, a 63-year-old US Army veteran from Phoenix, Arizona, had been working as a delivery driver for Jeff Bezos’ company for four years when he received an email informing him, with no sugar-coating, that his contract had been terminated. The algorithm tracking his daily activity had considered him unfit for the job. He had been fired by a machine.In the Bloomberg interview, Normandin describes himself as “an old-school kind of guy,” who gives every job “110%.” He took the loss of his job as a personal affront and said it was not justified. Nobody spoke to him to explain the criteria that led the artificial intelligence to question his commitment and competence. “I’ve worked 12-hour shifts in a community diner for Vietnamese refugees in Arkansas,” he said. “I’ve proven on multiple occasions that I am a disciplined and responsible person. I do not deserve to be fired without someone listening to me, taking into account my circumstances or providing an explanation.” In his view, he was fired due to his age, without his enthusiasm for work or his excellent physical and mental health being taken into account, but his attempts to prove this to Amazon though arbitration proved fruitless.Spencer Soper, who wrote the Bloomberg article, says that Normandin against the machine is a “losing battle” and the result of a “sinister misunderstanding.”“Men like him continue to believe in the culture of hard work and dignity of employment, while companies like Amazon base their model on the increasing automation of production processes and labor routines that almost completely exclude the human factor,” Soper says.Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos.JIM WATSON (AFP)In an interview with CNBC, Bezos stated his belief that the only business decisions that it is essential to leave in the hands of human beings are “strategic ones.” Everything else, the “day-today” decisions, however important they may be, he prefers to leave to artificial intelligence algorithms because they act “taking into account all of the relevant information without emotional interference.” For the Amazon CEO, “artificial intelligence optimizes processes and, in the medium and long term, will create many more jobs than it destroys.” Unfortunate cases from a human perspective, like that of Normandin, are no more than collateral damage in a revolution that is advancing inexorably.For Fabián Nevado, a labor law expert at the Catalonia Syndicate of Journalists, “it is disgraceful from a moral point of view that you can be fired by an algorithm applying general criteria that do not take into account personal circumstances and, above all, with no human being bothering to communicate in person with a minimum of respect and empathy.”Nevertheless, Nevado does not believe that these kinds of events are only likely to take place in poorly regulated labor markets, such as those in Russia or the United States. “On the contrary, in Spain, despite what people believe, dismissal is free. What happens is that the reasons for the dismissal have to be put forward and if there is no agreement, a judge will end up deciding if the reasons given are convincing or not.” But it is perfectly legal for companies to use artificial intelligence to monitor the performance of their employees as long as it is carried out within the framework of the Personal Data Law. “In any case,” says Nevado, “the person doing the firing will always be an employer, a human being or a group of them. But the machine could be the tool used to justify the dismissal. In fact, this is already happening in many cases.”If all else fails, a judge will rule on the matter, a little like the recommendations of the VAR system in professional soccer, that controversial tool that was supposed to revolutionize sporting justice. What is not acceptable under any circumstances, says Nevado, “is that neither the bosses nor the human resources departments take on responsibility for the dismissal, hiding behind algorithms and other technological innovations to pass the buck and further dehumanize labor relations.” If the trend continues, Nevado predicts a “very dark future” for human resources departments.These could disappear entirely if the idea of leaving the management of talent (contracts, hiring and firing, pay rises, disciplinary processes, bonuses, etc) fully in the hands of machines crystallizes. “And not just human resources departments,” he adds. “Many management positions will also be in jeopardy, above all those whose salaries depend on the ability to monitor the workers under their charge.” In a world of innovative entrepreneurs, cutting-edge management technology and an interchangeable workforce, the foreman will be unnecessary.Frank Pasquale, a professor at New York’s Brooklyn Law School, addresses these issues in his book New Laws of Robotics. In the view of this intellectual, who defines himself as a “humanist with technological competence,” artificial intelligence should never replace the experience and capacity for human reasoning in “areas that have clear ethical implications.” That is to say, a machine should never be permitted to decide who gets shot, who gets run over or who gets fired, because it would do so based purely on criteria of efficiency. Decisions like these cannot be automated and cannot be disassociated from a process of “responsible reflection,” a uniquely human tool. For Pasquale, the “digital boss” will always be a tyrant because it dehumanizes people by treating them like they are not people, “by converting them into mere tools and denying them their status as free and rational creatures.”The safety net against using algorithms to fire employees, says Spain’s labor union UGT in a working document titled Algorithmic relations in labor relations, has to take the form of a clear regulation that demands transparency over what criteria the artificial intelligence uses. “The principle of precaution has to be applied,” says UGT head of digitalization José Varela. Because algorithms, like any product of human intelligence, can make mistakes. Furthermore, they do not concern themselves over whether their decisions could have a negative impact on “the security of people or their basic rights.” In other words, if we are going to get fired by an algorithm, we must demand first of all that it knows what it is doing.English version by Rob Train.Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Without prior warning, Xsolla decided to fire 150 of its 450 employees at its offices in Perm, based solely on the verdict of a performance-related algorithm that considered the workers “unengaged and unproductive.” It was the work of neither the coronavirus pandemic nor the oft-leaned upon “structural review.” On this occasion, the reason given to justify a mass redundancy was the cold calculation of an artificial intelligence program fed by “big data.” Xsolla is one of many examples of a modern and disruptive company employing artificial intelligence in its decision-making processes. What is genuinely novel is that the functions the machine has taken on in this instance are nothing less than those of the CEO and the human resources and talent management departments. That machines would one day replace human workers is something that the 19th-century English Luddites were convinced of and that Charlie Chaplin laid out so eloquently in his 1936 movie Modern Times. What nobody expected was that machines would become our bosses. There is one striking precedent: Amazon, the mother of all disruptive companies, caught the attention of Bloomberg due to its proclivity for firing people based on IT criteria. One of the fired workers, Stephen Normandin, was interviewed earlier this year and the headlines turned him into an emblem of this apparently cold and dehumanized process. Normandin, a 63-year-old US Army veteran from Phoenix, Arizona, had been working as a delivery driver for Jeff Bezos’ company for four years when he received an email informing him, with no sugar-coating, that his contract had been terminated. The algorithm tracking his daily activity had considered him unfit for the job. He had been fired by a machine. In the Bloomberg interview, Normandin describes himself as “an old-school kind of guy,” who gives every job “110%.” He took the loss of his job as a personal affront and said it was not justified. Nobody spoke to him to explain the criteria that led the artificial intelligence to question his commitment and competence. “I’ve worked 12-hour shifts in a community diner for Vietnamese refugees in Arkansas,” he said. “I’ve proven on multiple occasions that I am a disciplined and responsible person. I do not deserve to be fired without someone listening to me, taking into account my circumstances or providing an explanation.” In his view, he was fired due to his age, without his enthusiasm for work or his excellent physical and mental health being taken into account, but his attempts to prove this to Amazon though arbitration proved fruitless. Spencer Soper, who wrote the Bloomberg article, says that Normandin against the machine is a “losing battle” and the result of a “sinister misunderstanding.” “Men like him continue to believe in the culture of hard work and dignity of employment, while companies like Amazon base their model on the increasing automation of production processes and labor routines that almost completely exclude the human factor,” Soper says. In an interview with CNBC, Bezos stated his belief that the only business decisions that it is essential to leave in the hands of human beings are “strategic ones.” Everything else, the “day-today” decisions, however important they may be, he prefers to leave to artificial intelligence algorithms because they act “taking into account all of the relevant information without emotional interference.” For the Amazon CEO, “artificial intelligence optimizes processes and, in the medium and long term, will create many more jobs than it destroys.” Unfortunate cases from a human perspective, like that of Normandin, are no more than collateral damage in a revolution that is advancing inexorably. For Fabián Nevado, a labor law expert at the Catalonia Syndicate of Journalists, “it is disgraceful from a moral point of view that you can be fired by an algorithm applying general criteria that do not take into account personal circumstances and, above all, with no human being bothering to communicate in person with a minimum of respect and empathy.” Nevertheless, Nevado does not believe that these kinds of events are only likely to take place in poorly regulated labor markets, such as those in Russia or the United States. “On the contrary, in Spain, despite what people believe, dismissal is free. What happens is that the reasons for the dismissal have to be put forward and if there is no agreement, a judge will end up deciding if the reasons given are convincing or not.” But it is perfectly legal for companies to use artificial intelligence to monitor the performance of their employees as long as it is carried out within the framework of the Personal Data Law. “In any case,” says Nevado, “the person doing the firing will always be an employer, a human being or a group of them. But the machine could be the tool used to justify the dismissal. In fact, this is already happening in many cases.” If all else fails, a judge will rule on the matter, a little like the recommendations of the VAR system in professional soccer, that controversial tool that was supposed to revolutionize sporting justice. What is not acceptable under any circumstances, says Nevado, “is that neither the bosses nor the human resources departments take on responsibility for the dismissal, hiding behind algorithms and other technological innovations to pass the buck and further dehumanize labor relations.” If the trend continues, Nevado predicts a “very dark future” for human resources departments. These could disappear entirely if the idea of leaving the management of talent (contracts, hiring and firing, pay rises, disciplinary processes, bonuses, etc) fully in the hands of machines crystallizes. “And not just human resources departments,” he adds. “Many management positions will also be in jeopardy, above all those whose salaries depend on the ability to monitor the workers under their charge.” In a world of innovative entrepreneurs, cutting-edge management technology and an interchangeable workforce, the foreman will be unnecessary. Frank Pasquale, a professor at New York’s Brooklyn Law School, addresses these issues in his book New Laws of Robotics. In the view of this intellectual, who defines himself as a “humanist with technological competence,” artificial intelligence should never replace the experience and capacity for human reasoning in “areas that have clear ethical implications.” That is to say, a machine should never be permitted to decide who gets shot, who gets run over or who gets fired, because it would do so based purely on criteria of efficiency. Decisions like these cannot be automated and cannot be disassociated from a process of “responsible reflection,” a uniquely human tool. For Pasquale, the “digital boss” will always be a tyrant because it dehumanizes people by treating them like they are not people, “by converting them into mere tools and denying them their status as free and rational creatures.” The safety net against using algorithms to fire employees, says Spain’s labor union UGT in a working document titled Algorithmic relations in labor relations, has to take the form of a clear regulation that demands transparency over what criteria the artificial intelligence uses. “The principle of precaution has to be applied,” says UGT head of digitalization José Varela. Because algorithms, like any product of human intelligence, can make mistakes. Furthermore, they do not concern themselves over whether their decisions could have a negative impact on “the security of people or their basic rights.” In other words, if we are going to get fired by an algorithm, we must demand first of all that it knows what it is doing.",,,,,,"[{'name': 'Joseph Biden', 'url': 'https://english.elpais.com/news/joseph-biden/'}, {'name': 'Donald Trump', 'url': 'https://english.elpais.com/news/donald-trump/'}, {'name': 'Latest News', 'url': 'https://english.elpais.com/latest-news/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'url': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': 'h1.a_t'}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Ediciones EL PAÍS S.L.', 'productID': 'english.elpais.com:basic'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'name': 'Barcelona'}",https://elpais.com/estaticos/terms-and-conditions/,

In an artificial intelligence interview, there are a few things to keep in mind. In this article, we will mention the 5 do's and 5 don'ts of an artificial intelligence interview..5 Do's of an AI Interview.Match your talents to the job description.After you've determined and narrowed down the job role you want to apply for, match your abilities to the job description to see whether it matches the requirements. Demonstrate to the interviewer that you are eager to learn. If you can persuade them that you are prepared to work hard and develop abilities that you do not now possess, there is a good chance they will be impressed and hire you..Become an expert in the field of artificial intelligence.To ace the interview and land a job, you'll need to brush up on your AI abilities. Neural networks, analytical thinking, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), cost-effective problem-solving capability, ability to translate technical data into an understandable format, ability to design software programs, and a knack for foreseeing technological innovations that can help the business are just a few of the skills required. You should be comfortable with programming languages like Java, Python, R, and Prolog..Discuss the company.Your understanding of the organization with which you're interviewing demonstrates your interest in working there and how well-informed you are about current events. So, do your homework on the company, show them why you'll be a valuable addition, explain why you picked artificial intelligence as a profession, reveal any specific AI software you want to create, and demonstrate that you're receptive to criticism. All of these factors will improve your chances of landing a job..Work experience and approach to problem-solving.Choose one or two significant projects from your prior work and explain your approach to them: how your strategy contributed to the solution, what were your main accomplishments, the leadership qualities you demonstrated, and so forth. Critical thinking ability, how you apply your knowledge to data use cases, why your method or technique works, speed and accuracy in addressing a problem, ability to develop a demo code, and the capacity to change any given code are all qualities that your interviewers are looking for..Determine the best AI employment role for you.AI is a broad field with a variety of employment opportunities. Software analysts and developers, computer scientists, computer engineers, algorithm experts, and electrical engineers are all occupations that are connected to artificial intelligence. Additionally, decide on the domain in which you'd like to pursue an AI profession..5 Don'ts of an AI Interview.For a resume, don't put too much emphasis on technical skills.When it comes to including technical talents on a CV, don't think of it as a brag. Don't forget to bring all of your AI certifications with you to the interview since they will assist the interviewer to customize the questions to you. In the end, the more you have, the better, because it shows how excited you are about your AI career..Don't be afraid to elaborate.Perhaps you are not like the majority of AI experts. You should be aware that the majority of persons in this field do not have the same level of communication skills as those in the artificial intelligence area. This may be due to the mathematical mind, but it doesn't matter. As a result, your prospects of landing the job may be harmed. It may be seen in how people reply to queries with simple yes and no. &quot;Do you have prior experience dealing with AI technology?&quot; is not a yes or no question, for example. If you do, you must explain how you found out about it, where you've used it, and what you like and hate about it. If not, you should explain whatever similar technology you tried and how you got on with it. Don't be stingy with your explanations..Do not deceive yourself.AI job interviewers have a difficult task ahead of them. They must determine whether a job seeker is qualified for a position in a short amount of time. Interviewers benefit from honesty and inquisitiveness. This is why lying in an AI interview is not a good idea. Instead, if you've asked a question, you don't know the answer to, ask the interviewers to expand so you can be sure you have no idea what the answer is. Admit that you have no idea and ask if they would be prepared to throw some light on the situation..Don't answer &quot;Do You Have Any Questions?&quot; With a no.Your interest in the company you want to work for is one of the most essential things to demonstrate during the AI interview. During the interview, there are many possibilities to communicate this, although they are frequently subtle. This is why you should go after the one genuine chance. &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot; says the narrator. This is an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate to the interviewer that you are enthusiastic about the position. Inquire about their firm, their rivals, and their approach for dealing with certain challenges, among other things. You get the picture. This indicates that you have prepared for the interview, that you have examined the company's history, and that you are concerned about the company's success..Never make a negative comment about your prior employment.Avoid sabotaging your interview by mentioning how much you disliked your prior workplace. Instead, use that time to focus on the good aspects of the situation. Even if it's about unpleasant events like layoffs, you should talk about your learnings and progress since attitude is everything, and having a positive attitude is crucial. You may be completely truthful, but the impression you'll give the interviewer is that things didn't work out well for you at the prior organization because you were under-performing and that if they employ you, you'll say the same thing about them eventually..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Roche has tapped PathAI for a collaboration that looks to merge artificial intelligence programs with its digital pathology work, with an eye on boosting the Big Pharma’s development of new drugs and companion diagnostic tests.Under a joint distribution agreement, the two companies will work to develop an embedded image analysis program based on PathAI’s algorithms, which will run through Roche’s cloud-based uPath enterprise software.The deal marks one of the first projects since Roche opened up its digital cancer pathology platforms to third-party AI tools last month, expanding their access to slide scanners and other patient information and making them available to users alongside Roche’s own AI-powered options.“Expanded access to a menu of high medical value digital diagnostic tools will further ensure that patients are accurately diagnosed and receive the most effective treatment available,” Roche Diagnostics CEO Thomas Schinecker said in a statement.RELATED: PathAI finds its way to $165M series C for diagnostic and drug development softwareThe coordinated effort will start with PathAI’s algorithms for research use only, spanning multiple types of cancer. “This collaboration brings together all of the components required to deliver and commercialize a differentiated AI-based digital pathology medical device including assay, scanner, image management system and algorithm,” said PathAI CEO Andy Beck. “We believe this partnership will unlock the potential for digital pathology in the companion diagnostics setting, offering a differentiated service to biopharma sponsors and ultimately new opportunities to improve patient outcomes.” RELATED: PathAI branches into clinical lab services with acquisition of Poplar HealthcareWorkers on the project may also see some familiar faces: earlier this year PathAI appointed Eric Walk, the former chief medical and scientific officer of Roche Tissue Diagnostics, to be its new chief medical officer.Walk previously spent more than 13 years at Roche, also serving as senior VP of medical and scientific affairs, before moving to the Boston-based PathAI in July. A pathologist by training, he will help develop machine learning tools for diagnosing cancer as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other diseases.

UBCO researcher says machines can calculate a fix quicker than people
October 13, 2021

UBC Okanagan researcher Saeed Mohammadiun’s work involves reviewing marine oil spill management including how computational techniques based on real-time data can be applied to an effective oil spill response.
The eyes of the world turned to a California beach recently as an underwater pipeline ruptured, leaking more than 550,000 litres of oil into the waters off the coast.
A large oil spill is one of the worst nightmares for environmentalists and local people living in an affected area, says UBC Okanagan researcher Saeed Mohammadiun. His work at UBC Okanagan’s Life Cycle Management Lab involves reviewing marine oil spill management. The School of Engineering doctoral student examined a decade of past management responses to oil spills. His most recent research looks at computational techniques based on real-time data and how they can be applied to an effective oil spill response.
What are some of the key takeaways from your latest paper when considering the recent marine oil spill in California?
Oil spills are tragic events and may have catastrophic environmental, human health, and socio-economic consequences; in California, local authorities are calling it an “environmental catastrophe.”
Even small-scale incidents may concern stakeholders, such as the recent incident in Bella Bella, BC, which has greatly affected the socio-economic status of the local indigenous community. The spilled oil may cause drastic consequences for local economies such as tourism and fisheries.
One essential step to minimize consequences of oil spills is to enhance the response preparedness by employing advanced scientific techniques such as remote sensing and data mining. Intelligent computational techniques can be used along with advanced detection and monitoring methods, such as remote sensing, to facilitate an effective and timely oil spill response. We have critically reviewed recent articles in this field and suggested a holistic framework for effective management of oil spills.
How does marine oil spill management (MOSM) minimize the impacts of oil spills?
MOSM can broadly cover multiple components such as oil spill detection and monitoring, risk assessment, response method selection and process optimization, and waste management.
An effective MOSM, based on appropriate computational-technique-based tools, can consider both proactive and reactive practices for oil spill prevention and also mitigate adverse impacts of an oil spill if it happens.
The three major benefits of an effective MOSM are the ability to detect oil spills in a timely manner, conduct the most appropriate oil spill response and reduce amounts of oily waste generated from response operations. An effective MOSM ultimately leads to minimizing the impacts of spilled oil.
Describe the role of robust computation techniques based on real-time data in reducing oil spill impacts
One important component of MOSM is the response operation, which aims to contain and clean up the spilled oil and contaminated area before any significant adverse environmental and economic impacts can occur. Response to an oil spill is a time-sensitive and complex task that is significantly reliant on available data, resources and decisions made.
Another significant challenge is the fact that collected oily wastes can be up to 10 times more than the original oil spill volume. Oily waste management is usually the bottleneck of all clean-up operations due to limitations in local resources including storage infrastructure and transportation facilities.
Inappropriate management of generated oily waste may exacerbate the situation because of secondary contamination. The application of intelligent computational techniques is essential to help stakeholders make timely and suitable decisions based on limited data. A real-time computational-based tool should be able to systematically find the most appropriate management practices by taking a considerable number of influential factors into account.
You reviewed similar research for the past 10 years. What reoccurring themes did you discover?
The risk of oil spills has increased by growing marine oil exploration and transportation activities. This trend can also be seen in arctic and sub-arctic waters under the effect of climate change, such as the Canadian Arctic, which has seen a significant increase in ship traffic and oil exploration activities in recent years. It is estimated that about two million tons of oil enter the marine environment every year around the world.
Application of artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques in oil spill management has been a new trend in this research area due to better data availability and advancement in computational techniques. Better meteorological and oceanic data, better satellite image access, advances in oil spill trajectory simulators as well as progress in artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques have collectively increased the number of studies in this field. There is still a dire need for better real-world oil spill data to enhance the performance of intelligent decision-making tools.
What role can artificial intelligence and machine learning play in minimizing the impacts of oil spills or improve oil spill response?
Both can play an important role concerning various components of oil spill management—from timely detection in remote areas to optimal response selection and waste management. An appropriate oil spill management strategy should be determined based on a significant number of factors, such as the dynamic characteristics of spilled oil and environmental conditions. Remote sensing methods can be integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, analyzing features of images, to accurately detect and monitor oil spills in offshore and onshore regions.
After the detection, it is usually necessary to respond to an oil spill immediately. To this end, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can considerably facilitate the decision-making process by analyzing previous oil spill data and subtle patterns that are often hidden in the data.
These intelligent tools facilitate the instant selection of the most suitable response method and its operational process.
In other words, machine learning can use previous oil spills to help manage future incidents. Also, the volume of generated oily waste can be minimized by the application of intelligent computational techniques, because the optimal oil spill response also takes waste management into the consideration.
Mohammadiun’s research was published recently in the Journal of Hazardous Materials. The paper is part of the Multi-Partner Research Initiative (MPRI), supported by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The MPRI aims to help the oil spill response industry and regulators to enhance response preparedness in Canadian waters.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Climate Change


 Posted on 5 October 2021
 by David Parkes




What are the applications of machine learning (used here interchangeably with 'AI') in understanding global climate change? Why do machine learning algorithms reach the conclusions they do, and when do they get things wrong? What are the limits of what machine learning can tell us, and where do we need to involve human environmental science expertise? These were the big questions addressed by Elizabeth (Libby) Barnes, of Colorado State University, in her seminar delivered to DSNE on Thursday 30th September. In this post I want to cover the key ideas embodied in Libby's work, and provide commentary – some Libby's, some my own – on how they fit into the landscape of environmental science.At the core of the work she presented, Libby introduced the idea of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); methods to take the results from machine learning algorithms and trace the path back to the input data, showing which elements of the data were most important in decision-making. These allow a critical assessment of the AI's performance: do the components of the dataset that lead to the results match our human, process-based understanding of what drives them? If not, the AI may reach the right conclusion for the wrong reason. Sometimes the AI getting it right or wrong is clear – in image processing, for example, a heat map of which parts of an image are most relevant in identifying the presence of an animal immediately shows whether the AI has correctly identified the animal-containing sections of the image – but in many cases with environmental data, interpretation is more difficult. This is where the skills of subject matter experts are indispensable: squaring the AI-generated outputs with process-based understanding is critical to trusting the meaning-agnostic results of an algorithm, while the insights offered by XAI can give scientists a way to approach datasets that are so large, complex, or noisy that it's hard to know where to start in offering a full interpretation.Armed not only with the AI tools to process large-scale data, but also with XAI to understand where the results have come from, Libby took us through examples where she and her team had applied machine learning to interpret major global changes in the earth system. The first example was of the Human Footprint Index (HFI), a measure of human pressure on the environment. To provide a comprehensive perspective, HFI incorporates many different datasets – land use, population density, light pollution, etc. – and as a result it is compiled infrequently with a significant lag behind the present day (at least in the context of rapid modern changes in human environmental impact). Libby and her colleagues trained an AI to generate estimates of HFI based on Landsat imagery – a single, more straightforward dataset – and used this to estimate a more up-to-date HFI for 2019 (Keys, Barnes, and Carter, 2021). But is it any good? This is where XAI comes in. Using the technique of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), heat-maps of the parts of the dataset that were most important to the AI in determining changes between the 2000 HFI and the 2019 estimate show the AI recognising the presence of many new man-made features – wind farm installations in Texas, irrigation networks in Cairo, urban development in Hanzhong – in the more recent Landsat images. These are tiny examples within a global dataset, of course – to cast a human eye over every pixel would defeat the point of the time-saving and scalability benefits that are primary motivators for using AI at all – but they are critical in building trust in the AI output.The second example presented was of an AI trained on gridded global datasets of temperature to predict the year (Barnes et al. 2020). A strange application at first glance – most of us are aware of what year it is, and of what year any data we record is from – but a useful case study for using XAI to interpret results in a fairly controlled (at least in earth sciences terms) environment. The initial results are as expected: the AI struggles to predict the year before the 1960s or 70s, when the global temperature trend was smaller in comparison to noise, and then makes effective predictions once the signal of forced temperature change is clearer. Things become more interesting when XAI is used to look at why the AI predicts the year it does. The key areas for predicting the year are not necessarily those where annual temperature anomaly is of the highest amplitude, but where the signal-to-noise ratio is particularly high. Is this, then, significantly different from a more simple regression between years and relative temperature anomalies? For me the answer is both yes and no. The AI-generated results are perhaps less of a brand-new perspective and more an extension of what is possible with more standard statistical techniques, but the ability to consider the data as a whole rather than point-by-point confers the ability for the AI to recognise spatial patterns in a way that – without an explicitly applied framework that then requires additional assumptions – the simpler methods cannot. The amount of added value that the AI provides here relies, it seems, on the internal details of how the algorithm used identifies patterns in data; a matter of considerable interest, but better left to the paper rather than covered in either a presentation or a blog post.In the third example presented, we saw machine learning used to feed back more explicitly into our process-based understanding of climate change. Libby demonstrated work by a member of her team, Emily Gordon, on using AI to make predictions of transition in the Pacific Decadal Observation (PDO) (Gordon, Barnes, and Hurrell, 2021). Here, the nature of what XAI is telling us is less immediately intuitive, and for good reason: a global dataset (of ocean heat content) is condensed down to just a single value representing likelihood of transition. Nevertheless, the results are compelling: through XAI there is a coherent picture of the areas which are most relevant to both directions of transition for the PDO, and they are in agreement with current theory. The use of AI as a way of directing attention in predicting and understanding complex emergent behaviours in large-scale climate variability, rather than as simply a way to process and characterise data, does have a feel (at least to a relative newcomer such as myself) of being more in its infancy, but it is also potentially the most exciting application. One of the most profound challenges of climate science is dealing with the vast number of interacting processes and systems, which are extremely hard to isolate and often non-linear, unintuitive or even chaotic in their responses. Human scientists can specialise with more depth in individual subject areas, or choose to focus on broader but shallower knowledge across multiple disciplines, but ultimately the complexity of many phenomena may outstrip the capacity for any individual scientist or group to reasonably understand all of the relevant causal relationships involved. How, then, do we start explaining things 'too big' to explain? There is a relevant analogy here from the world of pure mathematics in the form of the Four Colour Theorem, which was the first major case of a proof being performed by a computer which could not be feasibly checked directly by human mathematicians because it was so large. It was resisted by some, but the proof still stands, with the verification of the proof-generating software standing in for the ability to verify the proof itself. Is environmental science in a position to do similarly when it comes to understanding complex, large-scale patterns; to verify the coding of the result-generating AI rather than of a directly-stated physical explanation? Probably not – or not yet – but we are likely to see steps in that general direction, with AI at the very least starting to direct where subject-matter experts begin when explaining increasingly complex phenomena.The potential for speculation on future AI uses in environmental science is almost endless – in direct contrast to the length of a good blog entry – but it is clear from the work already performed and showcased by Libby that this is a fantastically productive area, not only helping us to handle data but also, thanks to the insights of XAI, helping us to explain it. On behalf of DSNE I'd like to thank Libby for her time and energy, and for getting us all thinking about both the power and the pitfalls of using AI in environmental science.Elizabeth Barnes is an associate professor at Colorado State University.

This in turn will put more jobs at risk and makes the need to reframe society ever more urgentMartin FordSat 2 Oct 2021 13.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Oct 2021 08.54 EDTShare615615As the coronavirus pandemic enveloped the world last year, businesses increasingly turned to automation in order to address rapidly changing conditions. Floor-cleaning and microbe-zapping disinfecting robots were introduced in hospitals, supermarkets and other environments. Some enterprises found that, given the new emphasis on hygiene and social distancing, robotic operations offered a marketing advantage. The American fast food chain White Castle began using hamburger-cooking robots in an effort to create “an avenue for reduced human contact with food during the cooking process”.With the worst days of the pandemic hopefully now behind us, the jobs story has turned out to be unexpectedly complicated. While overall unemployment rates remain elevated, both the US and the UK are experiencing widespread worker shortages, focused especially in those occupations that tend to offer gruelling work conditions and relatively low pay. Even as a quarter of a million of British workers who held jobs in 2019 remain unemployed, job vacancies are up 20% from pre-pandemic levels as employers struggle to fill many positions. The reasons behind the worker shortages are not entirely clear. A common assumption is that extended payments to furloughed workers allowed people to remain out of the workforce. However, evidence from a number of US states that moved to discontinue unemployment benefits early suggests that the extended payments may not have played a major role. Many workers may have simply reassessed their willingness to do difficult and often unrewarding jobs in return for low pay. In the UK, Brexit has greatly exacerbated the situation. At least 200,000 EU nationals, primarily from eastern Europe, who once filled roles in areas such as agriculture, transportation and logistics, have left the country and may never return.All of this has created a powerful incentive for businesses to invest in automation as a way to adapt to the worker shortage. As British farms confront the absence of seasonal workers who once flooded in from eastern Europe, interest in agricultural robots is growing. The UK-based startup Small Robot Company, for example, has developed two robots capable of killing weeds in wheat fields while cutting down dramatically on the use of chemical pesticides. The first robot autonomously prowls a wheat field, and with precision and patience that no human could match analyses each individual wheat plant using several cameras, mapping the exact locations where weeds are beginning to encroach. Once this data has been collected, a second, somewhat frightening, five-armed robot follows, killing the weeds by administering a powerful electric shock.View image in fullscreenToday’s most advanced distribution centres employ fully autonomous robots. Photograph: vanit Janthra/AlamyAnother startup company, Xihelm, which received venture funding from the UK government in 2018, has built a robot capable of harvesting fragile fruits and vegetables in greenhouses. The robot can, for example, carefully pick tomatoes after using artificial intelligence to identify only the ripest fruit. In the US, where the worker shortage has hit the restaurant industry especially hard, the White Castle chain has introduced french fry automation to work alongside its new hamburger robots, while the national restaurant chain Sweetgreen acquired a startup company that provides robotic kitchen technology. McDonald’s restaurants in the Chicago area are experimenting with an artificial intelligence-powered voice system that can process customer orders in drive-throughs.The overall impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on the job market is likely to be significantThere can be no doubt that the pandemic and the associated worker shortage are accelerating the drive toward deploying artificial intelligence, robotics and other forms of automation. In the UK, the trend is being further amplified as Brexit’s impact on the workforce becomes evident. However, the reality is that most of these technologies are unlikely to arrive in time to offer a solution to the immediate challenges faced by employers. Xihelm’s tomato-picking robot, for example, remains in the testing phase; the machines are not yet generally available for purchase. Some of the most critical worker shortages the UK are in transportation and logistics. By one estimate, the country is currently short of at least 100,000 truck drivers. As has been widely publicised, this has led to shortages of everything from petrol to McDonald’s milkshakes. No robots will be coming to the rescue in the near future. While a number of startup companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are working on self-driving trucks, the technology remains at several years away from commercial viability. Add time for governments to craft the necessary regulations or simply to get the public to accept the idea of fully loaded trucks navigating local roads without a driver at the wheel and the wait could easily be much longer.Over the course of a decade or more, however, the overall impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on the job market is likely to be significant and in some specific areas the technologies may lead to dramatic change within the next few years. And many workers will soon confront the reality that the encroachment of automation technology will not be limited to the often low-paying and less desirable occupations where worker shortages are currently concentrated. Indeed, many of the jobs that employers are struggling to fill may prove to be highly resistant to automation. At the same time, better-paying positions that workers definitely want to retain will be squarely in the sights as AI and robotics continue their relentless advance.View image in fullscreenGet the patty started: a hamburger-cooking robot in Los Angeles. Photograph: Miso RoboticsConsider, for example, the distribution centres run by Amazon or the online grocery retailer Ocado. As online shopping has accelerated, these warehouses have become an employment bright spot, providing jobs for many thousands of workers. Less than a decade ago, facilities of this kind would have been animated by hundreds of workers continuously roving between tall shelves containing thousands of different items. The workers would have included “stowers” tasked with taking newly arrived inventory and storing it on shelves and “pickers” responsible for retrieving items in order to fulfil customer orders. The activity would have been a continuous mad scramble, perhaps resembling an especially disordered anthill, in which a typical worker might trek a dozen or more miles over the course of a single shift.In today’s most advanced distribution centres, this bustling motion has become almost a mirror image of itself. It is now the workers who remain stationary – doing the picking and stowing – while the inventory shelves speed about, conveyed between destinations by fully autonomous robots. Amazon now operates more than 200,000 of these robots at its distribution centres worldwide, while Ocado employs more than 1,000 at a single facility in Andover in Hampshire.Companies such as Amazon and Ocado continue to employ massive human workforces largely because the robots are – so far – unable to perform the picking and stowing operations that require human-level visual perception and dexterity. This is certain to change, however. Both companies, as well as number of well-funded startups, are working on building more dexterous robots. Indeed, Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, speaking at a conference in 2019, said: “I think [robotic] grasping is going to be a solved problem in the next 10 years.” In other words, a great many of the hundreds of thousands of workers now employed in these facilities are likely to become redundant in the relatively near future. And as robots advance, they will likewise be deployed ever more frequently in restaurants, supermarkets and other environments.View image in fullscreenStartup company Xihelm’s harvesting robot is capable of picking fragile fruits and vegetables in greenhouses. Photograph: XihelmMore educated white-collar workers will quickly discover that they are by no means exempt from the rise of AI. Any job that involves the relatively routine analysis or manipulation of information is likely to fall in whole or in part to software automation. Some of the world’s largest media organisations, for example, already use AI systems that automatically generate news articles, while intelligent legal algorithms analyse contracts and predict the outcome of litigation. AI is even beginning to demonstrate a talent for routine computer programming. In many cases, knowledge work will prove to be easier and less expensive to automate than lower-paid work that requires physical manipulation. When the job is focused purely on working with information, there is no requirement for an expensive mechanical robot and no need to surmount the difficult technical challenges involved in replicating human dexterity or mobility.More educated white-collar workers will quickly discover that they are by no means exempt from the rise of AIIn the long run, as advancing technology shapes our post-pandemic future, the workforce will increasingly be divided into winners and losers. The losers will be those who focus largely on routine, predictable tasks, regardless of whether these activities are physical or intellectual in nature, and often independent of education level. The winners are likely to fall into one of three general groups. First, skilled trade workers, such as plumbers and electricians, who do work that requires dexterity, mobility and problem-solving ability in highly unpredictable settings. The same is true for a care worker who assists an elderly person with his or her daily needs. This type of work is far beyond the capability of any existing robot and these jobs will remain safe for the foreseeable future. Second, those workers whose occupations require the development of deep, sophisticated relationships with other people will be relatively safe. This might include caring roles, such as nursing, or business or educational occupations that require complex human interactions. While AI is making progress in this arena – for example, there are already chatbots that can provide rudimentary mental health support – it is likely to be a long time before machines can form truly meaningful relationships with humans. The final category includes intellectual work that is creative or activities that are otherwise genuinely non-routine and unpredictable in nature. For these workers, artificial intelligence will be likely to amplify, rather than replace, their efforts. Within many professions, a winner-take-all scenario might unfold; the most creative individuals will rise to the top, while those focused on more routine activities will face a growing threat from automation.The empty shelves crisis isn’t just down to Covid and Brexit – it’s been decades in the makingFelicity LawrenceRead moreThe best advice for individuals is to transition from routine, predictable work and towards one of these winning categories. There are real questions, however, about the viability of this advice when applied to society as a whole. Historically, advancing technology has tended to drive most workers from routine work in one sector to routine work in another. As agriculture became mechanised, workers moved from farms to factories, but they continued to do routine work. Later, workers moved to routine jobs in the service sector. The rise of artificial intelligence will require an unprecedented transition in which a large fraction of the workforce will have to find and adapt to roles that are genuinely non-routine. It is unclear whether a sufficient number of these jobs will be created – and, even if they are, many workers will likely lack the inherent talents and personality traits required to take on creative or relationship-based roles.Designing a society that can adapt to the rise of artificial intelligence and allow everyone to thrive as these changes unfold is likely to be one of our most significant challenges in the coming years and decades. It will require an emphasis on retraining and education for those workers who can realistically undertake the necessary transition, as well as an improved safety net – and perhaps an entirely new social contract – for those who will inevitably be left behind.

Artificial intelligence research leads to new cutting-edge technologies, but it’s expensive.
Big Tech companies, which are powered by AI and have deep pockets, often take on this work  — but that gives them the power to censor or impede research that casts them in an unfavorable light, according to Timnit Gebru, a computer scientist, co-founder of the nonprofit organization Black in AI and the former co-leader of Google’s Ethical AI team.

The situation imperils both the rights of AI workers at those companies and the quality of research that is shared with the public, said Gebru, speaking at the recent EmTech MIT conference hosted by MIT Technology Review.
“It’s all the incentive structures that are not in place for you to challenge the status quo,” she said.
Gebru was forced out at Google last December (Gebru said she was fired, while Google said she resigned) after co-writing a paper about the risks of large AI language models, such as environmental impacts and the difficulty in finding embedded biases. Google’s search engine runs on such a large language model.
Citing concerns, Google told Gebru to retract the paper from a conference or remove her name and the name of other Google researchers, according to The New York Times. Gebru refused to so without a fuller explanation from Google, which led to Google announcing her departure.
During her recent talk, Gebru highlighted what she views as the labor rights concerns of AI workers, how to protect them, and why academia isn’t always a better route for researchers. Ultimately, she said, the goal is better and more equitable artificial intelligence.
“The moment you push a little hard, you’re out” 
Gebru’s research centers on unintended negative impacts of artificial intelligence. A paper she co-authored with MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini explored bias in facial recognition algorithms.


We need much stronger labor protection laws in order to allow AI researchers to organize against things that they see going really wrong.

After joining Google in 2018, “I had issues from the very beginning,” Gebru said.  She said some people had doubts that she would be able to change a company as large as Google. “I was thinking, ‘Okay, maybe I can carve out a small piece … that is safe for people in marginalized groups,’” she said. “What I learned is that it's impossible, because the moment you push a little hard, you're out. So if you survive, it's because maybe you're not poking … at a thing that they find super important.”
It’s important to hold tech companies accountable from the outside, Gebru said.
“We can't have the current dynamic that we have and expect any sort of nonpropaganda tech to come out of tech companies,"" she said. ""Because when you start censoring research, then that's what happens, right? The papers that come out end up being more like propaganda.”
Problems extend outside of Big Tech  
Since leaving Google, Gebru has been working to develop an independent research institute. While many AI researchers work in academia, Gebru said that in her experience, that avenue poses its own concerns related to gatekeeping, harassment, and an incentive structure that doesn’t reward long-term research.  
There are also concerns about tech companies funding AI research at academic institutions. Gebru cited The Grey Hoodie Project, a research paper by Mohamed Abdalla of the University of Toronto and Moustafa Abdalla of Harvard Medical School. The researchers compared the way Big Tech (large technology companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook) is funding and leading AI research with how big tobacco companies funded research in an effort to dispel concerns about the health effects of smoking.
“At an independent research institute, you can do research that the company does not think is going to make it money right now. You can do research that really shows fundamental flaws in whatever technology that a company might be using,” Gebru said.
How to improve protection for Big Tech workers 
Gebru said she doesn’t argue against researchers working for Big Tech companies, but said they need protection to do their jobs. Otherwise, technology companies can quash findings or research threads that are unfavorable. She suggested three things that could help:

Enhanced whistleblower protection for AI researchers. Recent events have shown the importance of whistleblowers at Big Tech companies, such as the former Facebook data scientist who exposed the company’s internal documents that show Facebook knew how much harm the company was causing.

Anti-discrimination laws. “Often these organizations harm marginalized communities the most,” Gebru said “It's people from marginalized groups who'll see, who'll think of those negative impacts [of AI]. A lot of other people might think, ‘Oh, this is all going to be all great.’… from their standpoint in life, they don't see how it's going to negatively impact people. But after having certain experiences, it might be super clear to you, and you're going to push hard on that angle.”
Labor laws. When Google became involved with a federal program to use AI to potentially improve drone strikes, employees protested, and the company ended up not renewing the contract. “I think that workers are building power, which is great, but we need much stronger labor protection laws in order to allow even AI researchers to organize against things that they see going really wrong,” she said. After Gebru left Google, a letter of support for her was signed by almost 2,700 Google employees and more than 4,300 others.
Gebru also advised people working in tech who are battling these issues to build a coalition.
“You can do a lot still without those labor protections,” she said. “If you have a coalition of people around you, you can do a lot.”

And that includes research that might be unpopular.
“Try to think of the one thing you can do that pushes the envelope, that's not going to make the companies happy, because that means you're doing the right thing,” she said.
A more equitable vision for AI 
As AI technologies become ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to consider who is involved in shaping the future.
“It’s nothing really groundbreaking. I just want to work on research in AI [that’s] rooted in thinking about the perspectives of people in marginalized groups,” Gebru said. “That could be either thinking about research in the future and what kind of technologies should we build, what kind of AI tech research should we do, or critiquing it after it's been built.”
Gebru said she hopes to see artificial intelligence become more task-specific and designed to be used for specific groups of people. Right now, AI is abstract and general, which tends to mean the dominant’s group vision is implemented, marginalizing nondominant groups.
“Let’s look at the most marginalized from the very beginning and let's start with that angle,” she said.

Using AI to fly an airplane will be an enormous achievement; the ultimate reflection of AI’s ability to manage complexity. It will be a critical piece to implementing the changes that will be required in the next decade as A&D organizations reassess manufacturing automation in their factories. The recent pandemic, furloughs, bankruptcies and retirements are all impacting productivity and widening the talent gap, forcing the industry to adopt new technology such as AI to reimagine their business.
What is AI and machine learning?
AI, like so many technology buzzwords, can mean different things to different people. For us, an AI system is one that leverages software functions created through a machine learning process rather than through traditional programming. Data, rather than source code, is the critical element. The performance of an AI application is shaped by the data used to train the application.

Without going into detail on machine learning algorithms or approaches, which is beyond the scope of this paper, we can generalize that the power in AI comes from machine learning’s ability to model complex systems and environments far beyond what we can reasonably build in traditional software.
Imagine building a speech recognition system through traditional programming — having a function for every word or a case statement for every pronunciation or accent. It would take a staggering amount of time to cover even 10 percent of the English language. Machine learning models, on the other hand, have made short work of this task, to the point that robust and accurate systems can understand a full vocabulary from hundreds of languages and accents.
Analytical AI vs. operational AI
Today, two distinct classes of AI applications are emerging across industries. The first is analytical AI, as in the type of system that can predict when a machine is going to fail, detect credit card fraud or recommend the next book to buy on Amazon. Operational AI, the second class of AI applications, actually does something in the physical world. It can manage a factory process, fly a plane, drive a vehicle or act on predicted events. It’s artificial intelligence at work.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimized automatically.







Analytical AI is maturing
The development tools and environment for building analytical AI applications are rapidly maturing. Previously, data scientists wrote Python code to enable most algorithms and approaches to machine learning. They did a lot of heavy lifting, extracting from various sources and then transforming the data to ingest into AI algorithms.
We can now address some of the more complex challenges the industry is trying to solve. Where does the industry need to pivot, from a technology point of view, so it can thrive during moments of disruption? We can also see coming technology advancements such as the introduction of more drones and air taxis.
What the industry really needs to do is to scale up the building of complex operational AI systems. We need the self-driving car level of AI across the A&D industry. To do this, we need a different approach to developing AI systems. The scale of data needed to train these complex systems is many orders of magnitude larger than what has been done before. This data must be well-managed through a significantly more complex machine learning system, where AI software is often trained in stages, leveraging data that is synthetically generated at key points. We must also consider the testing and validation environment, since we are talking about building systems that operate complex machinery in the real world.
Operational AI in aerospace and defense: Three use cases
Unlike AI development for analytical use cases, the development of toolchains and methodologies for complex operational AI is only just emerging. We believe that success in any complex operational AI endeavor will be determined most critically by having access to a robust development ecosystem.
Factory automation. Many of the woes in A&D over the past 10 to 15 years have been caused by the inefficient supply chain, which has created cost overruns, delays and even bankruptcies. Many companies are struggling with major supply chain problems, from a lack of control — in both delivery and timeliness — to a lack of quality control. Across the industry, supply chain problems have cost companies tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary costs. In short, the supply chain in the A&D industry has been a major problem.

The automotive industry is highly digitized and highly automated from a manufacturing standpoint, because there is a relatively stable and manageable supply chain of 10 or 15 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), along with cooperation and partnerships so everyone can invest in automation. By contrast, the global aerospace industry lacks this level of partnership and, critically, the necessary manufacturing volume to make similar investments. A&D companies depend on a very deep and unwieldy supply chain with almost no automation and very little planning control or quality control.
In terms of delays and quality issues, the root causes are poor manual processes and poor manual planning. Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimized automatically. Automation not only brings conformity and control, but it also brings an automatic improvement in quality that is sorely needed. The answer to automating in A&D lies in using general-purpose robotics, more specifically, cobots (collaborative robots), which are general-purpose humanoid robots that can work among a human population on both factory floors and typical A&D production lines. Cobots introduce automation at a much lower cost because retooling of manufacturing programs is not needed.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimized automatically.







These cobots still need to be programmed, and that’s where AI comes in. Programming traditional automation solutions is an expensive proposition, as each task needs to be custom programmed to fit a particular factory and production line. With AI, programming countless different tasks one by one is not needed. AI plus cobots enable the automation of that operational program and factory at high, low and no scale, and at a dramatically lower cost, so that implementing automation is achievable, given the constraints of the aerospace industry.

Air traffic management. AI is critical for managing the anticipated disruptions in this industry over the next 10 years. One such disruption being watched closely is the pending introduction of drones and air taxis, often known as urban air mobility systems. Thus, the second use case is building an AI air traffic controller. 




















Today, air traffic management is generally managed by people. Based on many projections of this growing industry, in 15 to 20 years there will be 30 times the volume of air traffic flying over a large city such as Los Angeles than there is now. Human beings would be hard-pressed to manage that huge amount of air traffic, and it may be impossible.
But this is not the type of problem where more humans can be added and each person given a smaller slice of the air traffic pie when we consider the amount and type of new air traffic expected to operate, especially at the 0 to 3,000-foot level. Given all this, there is wide consensus that the industry needs AI to manage this exponentially higher level of complexity.

Fully autonomous vehicles. This third use case is obvious because we are inundated with news about the self-driving car every day. First, being autonomous is different from being unmanned. Drones flying today don’t have pilots sitting in them, but they are still overseen by a pilot from the ground. Such drones have a ground station that has aspects of a cockpit repurposed on a desk, with a human flying the drone remotely.
The future progression from this state is full autonomy, where an AI system is constantly evaluating and reacting to the airspace and making decisions to act in accordance with its mission. The impetus for fully autonomous flight is the same as it is on the ground. A new, generally accepted roadmap has now been published and with autonomy, not only can we imagine a more efficient world, but we can imagine a safer one as well.
Creating complex operational AI systems
To create complex operational AI systems in the A&D industry, very different needs must be met for data management and for algorithm creation and implementation. Very robust simulation is also needed in the testing phase. Above all, there is a strong need for a solution that enables complex operational AI DevOps.
When training an AI system, there are two datasets. First is the historical dataset for the predictive use case containing the instances of what is being predicted. Next comes a testing or validation dataset. In the complex operational world, organizations often investigate neural networks to handle the pattern recognition. Algorithms can be used to automatically build better and better neural networks, based on the performance of the best-performing neural networks from past iterations.
But given the much higher complexity of the environment in which pattern recognition and training are run, higher-level approaches must be considered. For complex operational AI, the various machine learning approaches demand data at a higher scale and management at a greater complexity.




Building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification.







What is needed is a tiered approach to building different datasets. Start with a dataset that is focused on the physics of what you are trying to model; then build a dataset that accounts for the operating environment. After that, extrapolate the data to create a dataset that is orders of magnitude larger.
Algorithms then need to be constructed to create synthetic data to fill into that next-larger phase. Plus, building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification. For example, certifying an airborne system is all about proving it is safe, and complex operational AI DevOps can play a crucial role in providing a robust simulation environment in the testing phase.
Operational AI is not easy, but it is possible
Building complex operational AI systems is no simple task. There are many challenges in managing the development environment and specific workflows. Data management over the full development life cycle is key, as is using the right technology to manipulate, extrapolate and scale data. It is essential to build a system that effectively manages and curates the data that represents the foundational dataset; then integrates, manages and curates the data from that environmental representation dataset; and ultimately provides the platform and simulation for the synthetic extrapolation of that merged dataset into a much, much larger dataset.
It is no easy feat to provide the data hosting, management and curation environment through these data stages that are each so massive in scope. Providing the simulation environment is enormous, because that is the “secret sauce” needed to be able to take that large dataset, combine it and then extrapolate it to ultimately produce a robust algorithm. 
The good news — not only for the A&D industry but for all industries — is that a solution does exist that provides the DevOps environment to make all this come together and work at scale. DXC Robotic Drive Cloud Services on AWS is the first solution that provides a soup-to-nuts development toolchain and management environment for building complex operational AI.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, hospitals are searching for ways to keep their patients safe from potential hospital-acquired infections. Different methods have included hygiene monitoring, data analytics, and artificial intelligence technology.







According to Chief Medical and Scientific Officer for Novant Health, Eric Eskioglu, MD, about 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) occur each year. Additionally, around a hundred thousand of those result in death. One way to tackle this problem is through hand hygiene monitoring.
While Novant had the goal of bringing their rate of HAIs down to zero, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the team tried to accelerate the process. “The way most hospitals do hand hygiene monitoring is somebody has to stand behind you and observe you wash your hands and grade you,” Eskioglu told HealthITAnlaytics.
However, Eskioglu explained that the system of hygiene monitoring was not effective in the time of COVID-19. While the hospital was already short-staffed, it was inefficient to pull staff members away from their work so they could watch other nurses and physicians wash their hands. With artificial intelligence technology, Novant partnered up with SwipeSense.
“We started this partnership back in 2018 with Matthews Medical Center, which is a 150-bed hospital. We did a test trial. We had selected SwipeSense out of a couple of other companies. We were really impressed with their focus on data and analytics and how they could automate things that are archaic in healthcare,” Eskioglu said.
SwipeSense works to provide automated electronic tracking down to the staff member to help with hand hygiene compliance. According to a SwipeSense survey, 81 percent of patients said they would feel safer in a hospital with electronic hand hygiene monitoring in place.
“It helped us during the pandemic, and it continues to help us. It not only took the burden off our nurses and physicians having to observe somebody wash their hands, but it also helped us standardize and get rid of the observer bias because each observer has a different bias. Some may watch it for 10 seconds. We want everybody to watch it for 20 seconds minimum,” Eskioglu said.
In addition to monitoring hygiene protocols, SwipeSense also uses predictive analytics to identify at-risk patients and staff as well as medical equipment that might have been in contact with an individual infected with COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.
During the pandemic, HAIs went up by 30 to 40 percent. However, at Novant Health, they saw the opposite, with their number decreasing by 30 percent. Eskioglu attributes this to the hospital’s new hygiene protocols and their use of data analytics and AI.
Eskioglu is a proponent of artificial intelligence as the future of healthcare, generating positive patient outcomes.
“A lot of people asked me, ‘Does this mean the physicians are going to be out of work?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ As a matter of fact, there’s going to be more need for physicians, but it’s going to be physicians who embrace AI. Physicians will have more time to spend with the patients and their diagnosis will be much more precise and crisper,” Eskioglu explained.
According to Eskioglu, artificial intelligence can also lead to healthcare equality and better patient outcomes for all.
“I believe AI is becoming a great healthcare equalizer as long as they have the bandwidth in those technologies. We’re working with companies like AT&T and Verizon to ensure that those areas have the 5G bandwidth, but the people who live in those areas at least have access to an iPad or a small computer. We’re excited about AI creating equity in healthcare,” Eskioglu said.

Both are grappling with big problems that stem, at least in part, from putting faith in artificial intelligence (AI) systems that have underdelivered. Zuckerberg is dealing with algorithms that are failing to stop the spread of harmful content; Musk with software that has yet to drive a car in the ways he has frequently promised.There is one lesson to be gleaned from their experiences: AI is not yet ready for prime time. Furthermore, it is hard to know when it will be. Companies should consider focusing on cultivating high-quality data - lots of it - and hiring people to do the work that AI is not ready to do.       Designed to loosely emulate the human brain, deep-learning AI systems can spot tumors, drive cars and write text, showing spectacular results in a lab setting. But therein lies the catch. When it comes to using the technology in the unpredictable real world, AI sometimes falls short. That's worrying when it is touted for use in high-stakes applications like healthcare.  The stakes are also dangerously high for social media, where content can influence elections and fuel mental-health disorders, as revealed in a recent expose of internal documents from a whistleblower. But Facebook's faith in AI is clear on its own site, where it often highlights machine-learning algorithms before mentioning its army of content moderators. Zuckerberg also told Congress in 2018 that AI tools would be 'the scalable way' to identify harmful content. Those tools do a good job at spotting nudity and terrorist-related content, but they still struggle to stop misinformation from propagating.  The problem is that human language is constantly changing. Anti-vaccine campaigners use tricks like typing ""va((ine"" to avoid detection, while private gun-sellers post pictures of empty cases on Facebook Marketplace with a description to ""PM me."" These fool the systems designed to stop rule-breaking content, and to make matters worse, the AI often recommends that content too.  Little wonder that the roughly 15,000 content moderators hired to support Facebook's algorithms are overworked. Last year a New York University Stern School of Business study recommended that Facebook double those workers to 30,000 to monitor posts properly if AI isn't up to the task. Cathy O'Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction has said point blank that Facebook's AI ""doesn't work."" Zuckerberg for his part, has told lawmakers that it's difficult for AI to moderate posts because of the nuances of speech.   Musk's overpromising of AI is practically legendary. In 2019 he told Tesla investors that he ""felt very confident"" there would be one million Model 3 on the streets as driverless robotaxis. His timeframe: 2020. Instead, Tesla customers currently have the privilege of paying $10,000 for special software that will, one day (or who knows?) deliver fully-autonomous driving capabilities. Till then, the cars can park, change lanes and drive onto the highway by themselves with the occasional serious mistake. Musk recently conceded in a tweet that generalized self-driving technology was ""a hard problem.""  More surprising: AI has also been falling short in healthcare, an area which has held some of the most promise for the technology. Earlier this year a study in Nature analyzed dozens of machine-learning models designed to detect signs of Covid-19 in X-rays and CT scans. It found that none could be used in a clinical setting due to various flaws. Another study published last month in the British Medical Journal found that 94 per cent of AI systems that scanned for signs of breast cancer were less accurate than the analysis of a single radiologist. ""There's been a lot of hype that [AI scanning in radiology] is imminent, but the hype got ahead of the results somewhat,"" says Sian Taylor-Phillips, a professor of population health at Warwick University who also ran the study.  Government advisors will draw from her results to decide if such AI systems are doing more good than harm and thus ready for use. In this case, the harm doesn't seem obvious. After all, AI-powered systems for spotting breast cancer are designed to be overly cautious, and are much more likely to give false alarms than miss signs of a tumor. But even a tiny percentage increase in the recall rate for breast cancer screening, which is 9 per cent in the U.S. and 4 per cent in the U.K., means increased anxiety for thousands of women from false alarms. ""That is saying we accept harm for women screened just so we can implement new tech,"" says Taylor-Phillips.  It seems the errors are not confined to just a few studies. ""A few years ago there was a lot of promise and a lot of hype about AI being a first pass for radiology,"" says Kathleen Walch, managing partner at AI market intelligence firm Cognalytica. ""What we've started to see is the AI is not detecting these anomalies at any sort of rate that ...",,,[],"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.bizzbuzz.news/images/logo.png', 'height': '60', 'width': '600', 'name': 'BizzBuzz - Logo', 'url': 'https://www.bizzbuzz.news/images/logo.png'}",,,,Is artificial intelligence ready for prime time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mixed

He’s known for infusing life into some of the most creative pieces the world of art has seen in the past, and he’s at it again, with a bold concept that he’s named ‘The Orgasm Project’. Using Artificial Intelligence in art, Raghava is now one of the first Indian artists to launch an NFT — simply put, a digital file — at the international auction house Sotheby’s..Displayed at Boundless Space, a group auction in collaboration with the Burning Man Project, his artwork ‘La petite mort’ is a phygital (physical and digital) NFT that has been generating much curiosity. Raghava has been working on the project for a few years now. He collaborated with neuroscientist Abhijeet Satani, data scientist Harshit Agrawal and material scientist Ben Tritt to create this piece that unabashedly depicts and explores how humans use their unique personalities to contend with love, loss, boundaries, truth, balance, introspection and perspective. ‘La petite mort’ is the first work in the series, which explores the future of art..Speaking to CE from NYC, Raghava says, “I spent a lot of time imagining how the physical feeling of an orgasm can be interpreted in a digital manner. If everything now can be digitised, does that also mean everything is also commodifiable? I explore this deep ethical dilemma that the world is facing through the most intimate and personal of human experiences. I want us not only to use cutting-edge tools but also understand its ethical boundaries.”.Raghava worked with 100-odd people to generate these brainwaves and with the help of all the digital equipment, the artwork was finally completed, ready to be showcased at the NY auction. “I worked closely with Tritt, Agrawal and Satani to capture the brainwaves when one experiences an orgasm and eventually turned that into art,” says Raghava, adding that he blended the neuro-data and turned each neuron into individual brush strokes. .“Each stage of the orgasm gave a different frame for me to work with. Special oil pigments were prepared in a material science lab to recreate the waves. I worked with Artmatr robots for my painting that helped create it on a large canvas,” he adds.  While he’s “super excited” about this project, Raghava is ready to visit France and Egypt next before returning to namma Bengaluru for more work. .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2021/Oct/05/art-in-artificial-intelligence-bangalore-artist-launchesnft-at-sothebys-2367596.html', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/TNIE/import/2021/10/5/original/Raghava_KK_Twitter.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the global educational market, AI is estimated to&nbsp;reach US$3.68 billion by 2023&nbsp;at a CAGR of 47%..Teachers, students, and the administration teams will benefit from using AI in their institutions. Be it automating repeated tasks, planning customized online classes, or creating tests and analyzing results, AI software can help educational institutions to-.Save time, money, and effortReduce human bias and errorImprove the quality of teachingHelp students understand betterCustomize training modulesAutomate repetitive tasksCreating a virtual environment for improved concentrationEliminating geographical barriersProviding educational support within and outside the classroom.AI in EdTech&nbsp;.Artificial intelligence will soon become a deciding factor in EdTech. Educational institutions will need to prove themselves by adopting the latest AI technology and providing the staff, teachers, and students with the best possible environment to work and learn..Instant Learning&nbsp;.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced schools, colleges, and parents to adopt digital education. While online classes are still not AI-based, we've seen a rise in demand for platforms like Byju's where the modules are developed based on each student's needs..Students don't have to wait for a class to start or worry about missing a session. They can ask questions, get help from the virtual teacher as well as the real teacher (human). Step-by-step explanations are provided for each topic so that students easily understand the concepts..Digital Curriculum&nbsp;.The aim of using artificial intelligence in EdTech is to make students' experience the center of focus. Teach students what they are likely to enjoy; this is something Coursera has adopted in its own way. The AI-based online platform has a feature called CourseMatch..This tool helps students match their campus curriculum with the courses offered by the platform. CourseMatch is a machine learning algorithm that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to align the online courses with the ones the student has in their on-campus curriculum..Personalized Learning Modules&nbsp;.Personalization is the biggest gift given by artificial intelligence. The EdTech sector also is making the most of this aspect. Teachers don't have the time to plan personalized courses and teaching methods for each student in their class. But AI can help them achieve this..Both teachers and students benefit from personalized learning modules. Since students learn what they like in a way that's convenient to them, they are more likely to be attentive and score well. Teachers can ensure that all their students understand the concepts. Personalized learning also helps reduce aggressive behavior in students that stems from the frustration of feeling helpless in the classrooms..Chatbots&nbsp;.Chatbots are used to encourage students, give immediate feedback, and answer basic questions related to the subject. Cognii is a San Francisco-based EdTech tool that interacts with students. It shares feedback after the assessments, encourages them when they give the right answer, and offers personalized tutoring..These chatbots can take the pressure of the teachers by monitoring each student's learning with the same level of focus. Teachers can oversee the process and intervene when necessary, and students feel happy for the immediate feedback they get from the chatbot..Automatic Question and Answer Generation Using NLP&nbsp;.AI-based question generation platforms use NLP to process input data and deliver a set of questions as output. These tools are used by schools, colleges, tutorials, coaching centers, HR teams, and even government agencies for testing students and trainees..Steps Involved in the Implementation Process&nbsp;.Inputting Text: The platform accepts input in several forms such as text, image, files, video, etc., (though it depends on how the software has been designed)..Pre-processing: The text is analyzed using ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) to convert it into a set of questions (MCQs, fillups, matching, descriptive, etc.)..Forming Questions: The questions are presented on the screen for the user to determine the difficulty level or make further changes..Delivering Output: Once the test paper is finalized, the output is exported in multiple formats such as PDF, CSV files, etc. (this again depends on how the software has been developed)..Top AI-Based Question Generation Platforms in EdTech Industry&nbsp;.Let's explore the benefits of AI in the EdTech industry.
