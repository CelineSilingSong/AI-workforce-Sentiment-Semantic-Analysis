As we are at the cusp of technological change, history shifts its pace when touched with scientific vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such technical field that is transforming human society into one of robots and machines. AI includes machine learning, natural language processing, big data analytics, algorithms, and much more. However, as human intelligence is marked by intrinsic bias in decision-making, such characteristics can also be found in AI products that work with human-created intelligence. These phenomena of bias and discrimination – rooted in a cluster of technologies and embedded in social systems – are a threat to universal human rights. Indeed, AI disproportionally affects the human rights of vulnerable individuals and groups by facilitating discrimination, thus creating a new form of oppression rooted in technology.
AI as a tool of discrimination
With the advancement of AI in our organic societies, the issue of discrimination and systemic racism has taken increasing space in political debates about technological growth. Article 2 of the UDHR and Article 2 of the ICCPR both articulate individual entitlement to all rights and freedoms without discrimination. Of course, this is difficult to apply in practice when considering the multitude of discriminatory opinions and oppressive practices that characterise human interaction. Though some naively perceive AI as the solution to this challenge, a technological tool that frees us from the bias of human decision-making, such opinions fail to account for the traces of human intelligence in AI technology.
Indeed, AI algorithms and face-recognition systems have repeatedly failed to ensure a basic standard of equality, particularly by showing discriminatory tendencies towards Black people. In 2015, Google Photos, which is considered an advanced recognition software, categorized a photo of two Black people as a picture of gorillas. When keywords such as ‘Black girls’ were inputted into the Google search bar, the algorithm showed sexually explicit material in response. Researchers have also found that an algorithm that identifies which patients need additional medical care undervalued the medical needs of Black patients.
Facial-recognition technology is now being adopted in the criminal justice systems of different states – including Hong Kong, China, Denmark and India – to identify suspects for predictive policing. Sceptics have pointed out that instead of mitigating and controlling police work, such algorithms instead enhance pre-existing discriminatory law enforcement practices. The unevaluated bias of these tools has put Black people at bigger risk of being perceived as high-risk offenders, thus further entrenching racist tendencies in the justice and prison systems. Such racial discrimination inherited in AI disgraces its transformative implementation into society and violates equal treatment and the right to protection.
While communities are now standing up for the rights of Black people through the Black Lives Matter movement, the increased implementation of AI in society is fostering digital bias and replicating the harm that is currently being fought against. In that sense, this technology disproportionately affects the vulnerable by exacerbating discriminatory practices already present in modern society.
Technology as a source of unemployment
The right to work and protection against unemployment is guaranteed under Article 23 of UDHR, Article 6 of ICESCR, and Article 1(2) of the ILO. Though the rapid increase of AI has transformed existing businesses and personal lives by improving the efficiency of machinery and services, such change has also birthed an era of unemployment due to the displacement of human labour. Referring to the exponential growth in technology, Robert Skidelsky writes in his book Work in the Future that “Sooner or later, we will run out of jobs”. This was also reiterated in a seminal study conducted by Oxford academics Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, which estimated that 47% of U.S. jobs are at risk of future automation due to AI.
In 2017, Changying Precision Technology, a Chinese factory producing mobile phones, replaced 90% of its human workforce with machines, which led to a 250% increase in its productivity and a substantial 8% drop in defects. Similarly, Adidas has moved towards ‘robot-only’ factories to improve efficiency. Thus, business growth no longer relies on a human workforce; in fact, human labour may negatively affect productivity. Until now, technology has had a more detrimental effect on low and middle-skilled workers, with decreasing employment opportunities and falling wages, leading to the emergence of job polarisation. However, as technology continues to advance, many jobs that we would today consider protected from automation will eventually be replaced by AI. For example, AI-based virtual assistants software such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google, have steadily replaced personal assistants, foreign language translators, and other services that were previously reliant on human interaction.
The COVID-19 pandemic has already impacted millions of jobs, and a new wave of AI revolutions may further aggravate the situation. By increasingly introducing AI in different job sectors, it seems that the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer. Indeed, AI represents a new form of capitalism that strives for profit without the creation of new jobs; instead a human workforce is perceived as a barrier to growth. There is thus an urgent need to address the consequences of AI on social and economic rights, through the development of a techno-social governance system that may protect the employment rights of humans in an AI era.
Controlling populations and movement
Freedom of movement derives itself from many international declarations and has been recognized as a fundamental individual right by many countries. AI’s ability to limit this right is specifically related to its usage for surveillance purposes. A report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace pointed out that at least 75 of 176 countries globally are actively using AI for security purposes, such as border management. There have been concerns regarding the disparate impact of surveillance on populations that are already discriminated by police – such as Blacks, refugees and irregular migrants – as predictive policing tools end up factoring in “dirty data” reflecting conscious and implicit bias. The Guardian reported that to keep a check on illegal immigration, dozens of towers equipped with feature laser-enhanced cameras were installed at the US-Mexico border in Arizona. In addition to this, the US government deployed a facial recognition system to record images of people inside vehicles entering and leaving the country.
Technological shifts have also impacted the military and humanitarian sectors. The increasing use of armed drones in warfare – in particular by the US in Pakistan and Afghanistan – has been repeatedly denounced as a violation of International Humanitarian Law in a 2010 UN report. An investigation by The Intercept of US military operations against the Taliban and al Qaeda in the Hindu Kush revealed that nearly nine out of ten people who died in drone strikes were not the intended targets. The rapid development of autonomous technology and AI has also resulted in fully autonomous weapons such as “killer robots”, which raise a host of moral, legal, and security concerns. The lack of ethical judgment of such machines has raised concerns about the reliability and error in judgement of these weapons, which might result in accidental deaths and the rapid escalation of conflicts. Indeed, Zachary Kallenborn’s article highlights the incapability of these weapons to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants.
Moreover, the advent of ‘humanitarian drones’ – for which military technology may be used for humanitarian purposes – has raised ethical dilemmas in regards to how this technology may negatively affect populations in need. There are decidedly adverse consequences for vulnerable groups, whose personal data has put them at further risk of violence. Biometrics has been used to register refugee populations with the UNHCR; while it is assumed to be an objective identification method, there is ample evidence that these tools simply codify discrimination. For example, biometric data collected from Rohingya refugees in India and Bangladesh was used to facilitate their repatriation rather than to integrate them into society, further exacerbating the suffering experienced by this community.
The rapid increase in dependency on AI to enforce social control during the present pandemic has also raised many privacy concerns. Arogya-Setu dangerous mix of health data and digital surveillance.technologies are a potent threat to basic human rights and can be used as tools of exploitation and oppression. In fact, if the use of AI continues to remain widely unregulated, the human rights of vulnerable groups will undoubtedly suffer.
Conclusion
With the continuing expansion of the AI reign, the tension between AI and human rights is increasingly manifesting itself as technology becomes central to our everyday lives and the functioning of society. As AI is perceived as an improvement of modern society, the lack of stringent Data Protection policies offers Tech companies a society ready to be digitally exploited. With little regulation or accountability, these companies freely intrude into the lives of citizens and increasingly infringe on human rights. From fostering discrimination to invasive surveillance practices, AI has proven to be a threat to equal protection, economic rights, and basic freedoms. To reverse these trends, proper legal standards ought to be implemented in our digitally transforming societies. Increased transparency in AI decision-making processes, better accountability for Tech giants, and the ability for civil society to challenge the implementation of new technologies in society are sorely needed. ‘AI literacy’ should also be encouraged through investment in public awareness and education initiatives, which would help communities to learn not only about the functions of AI, but also its impact on our day to day lives. Unless suitable measures are enforced to safeguard the interests of human society, the future of human rights in this era of technology remains uncertain.

The article has vividly brought out the conflict between technology ie AI and HR at a base level. However my take is that instead of villifying the adverse consequences of AI we as a global community should focus on integrating this key resource in the hands of the governments and the corporations towards betterment of human lives. Whenever there is a conflict between usage of AI and HR the rules of international behaviours as promulgated for internet and WWW should also be codified for AI as this will.ensure that no frankestiein monster is let loose on the human race. Technology should be for holistic betterment of mankind and not for domination over the resources be it human or natural resource

Totally agreeing with you Deepak. There is a need for AI regime to flourish but that should not be unfettered. We cannot read HR laws and AI laws in the shadows of mutual exclusivity. We have to adopt a culture where there is AI development but within the HR framework so that there can be sustainable development of the technological advanced society.

This is an excellent article. Poor nations must come up with a system to defend their rights of their citizens against the deployment of AI. AI experiments are done in rich nations by  rich individuals to perpetuate to protect the interests of the rich against the poor. Those deploying IA must be heavily taxed by Governments.

“All possible universes exist, even triangular ones”. These were the words on the cover of New Scientist on 6 June 1998, when Max Tegmark made one of his first appearances in the magazine. Inside, the then 31-year-old expanded on his idea of a multiverse on steroids, in which all logically possible universes not only can but must exist.
Tegmark, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is known for his provocative ideas. As he explains in the “Crazy” section of his website: “Every time I’ve written ten mainstream papers, I allow myself to indulge in writing one wacky one.” But the outlandish elements shouldn’t overshadow his serious track record in cosmology, quantum information science and the study of some of the very deepest questions about the nature of reality.
Recently, Tegmark has shifted his focus to intelligence, both human and artificial. He conducts front-line research in artificial intelligence (AI), most recently working with fellow MIT researcher Silviu-Marian Udrescu to create an AI that was able to rediscover some of the most fundamental equations of physics by studying patterns in data. In 2014, he co-founded the Future of Life Institute, which aims to understand and mitigate existential risks to humanity, particularly those associated with the rise of AI.
Richard Webb: What made you switch from cosmology to working on artificial intelligence?
Max Tegmark: I’ve always been fascinated by big questions, the bigger the better. That’s why I loved studying the universe, because there were philosophically very big questions like where does everything come from, what’s going to happen, what is our place in the grand scheme…

Autonomous vehicles are starting to become a real possibility in some parts of industry. Agriculture, transportation and military are some of the examples. The day when we are going to see autonomous vehicles in everyday  life for the regular consumer is quickly approaching. Many of the operations that vehicles have to perform are based on sensor information and some AI algorithms. Vehicles need to collect data, plan their trajectory and execute the trajectory. These tasks, especially the last two require non-traditional programming approaches and rely on machine learning techniques, which are part of AI.
There are many tasks for autonomous vehicles that are still presenting significant challenges and require sophisticated approaches. Replacing the cognitive and motor abilities of a human is not easy and will continue to be work in progress for years to come. There are different tasks that AI needs to solve so that we achieve reliable and safe autonomous drive.
The purpose of this two-part series is to illustrate the AI applications that make autonomous vehicles a reality, presenting their challenges and accomplishments. The nature of AI, compared to traditional software, is also explored and the specific challenges for developing, testing and deploying AI technologies in the autonomous vehicle arena is further discussed in Part 2.


1. Analysis of AI in the Autonomous Vehicle
The autonomous vehicle segment is the fastest growing segment in the automotive industry. Artificial Intelligence is indeed the most important and sophisticated component of self driving vehicles (Carmody, Thomas, 2019). A typical autonomous vehicle is shown on figure 1.




Figure 1: Self Driving Vehicle (Lentin, 2017)
The number of sensors with real time data and the need for intelligent processing of the data can    be overwhelming. AI is used in the central unit as well as in the multiple electronic control units (ECU) of the modern automobile.
Since AI has been used in many areas,  including robotics this is a natural fit of the technology which promises to master autonomy.   The promise of the technology    is that AI and perception technologies will provide a safer and more deterministic behavior which will lead to benefits such as fuel efficiency, comfort and convenience (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019).
The challenges  in developing AI systems for something as complex as a self driving vehicle are many. The AI has to interact with multitude of sensors and has to use data in real time. Many AI algorithms are computationally intensive and are therefore hard to use with CPUs that have memory and speed restrictions. Modern vehicles are an example of real time systems that have to produce deterministic results in the time domain. This is related to achieving safety while driving the vehicle. Complicated distributed systems like these require a lot of internal communications that are prone to latency which can disturb the decision making of the AI algorithms. In addition there is the issue of power consumption of the software running in the car. The more intensive AI algorithms consume more power, which is an issue, especially for electric vehicles that depend only on the charge of the battery (Carmody, Thomas, 2019).
AI is used for several important tasks in a self driving automobile. One of the main tasks is path planning.   That is the navigation system of    the vehicle (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Another big task for  AI is the interaction with the sensory system and the interpretation of the data coming out of sensors.
It is now apparent that providing a complete solution to replace a human behind the steering wheel is a formidable task (Boucherat, 2019). That is the reason why many manufacturers have started dividing the problem into smaller pieces and solving each one and thus taking smaller steps to achieve complete autonomy. There are always the startups, the disruptive companies in the industry, that try to solve to complete self driving problem and have vowed in the past that will have completely ready vehicles on the roads by 2020. Now it is clear that the reality is much more complex and many of the hurdles come from some of the issues that AI intrinsically has.
As AI develops and becomes better we will get closer and closer to having secure and autonomous transportation. Until then we have  to cope with many hours of development and testing and adoption will be determined by how confident consumers are and will depend on market forces. It is all going to happen even if it takes longer than was originally anticipated. The demand and the need are there and the technology is almost there. Adoption may be faster or slower based on regulation and doing it in phases, starting from simpler and more deterministic use cases such as driving in a known environment. The algorithms used can be sufficiently relieved if the vehicle operates in only specific conditions that present fewer unknowns.
2. AI Applications in Vehicles
2.1. Sensor Data Processing
There are numerous sensors providing data for the central computer of the vehicle during operation. Sensors provide information for the road, other vehicles on the road as well as any other impediments that can be noticed similarly to how a human can perceive them (Khayyam et al., 2019). Some  of these sensors can provide better perception than the average human, but for this to happen we need smart algorithms that can make sense of the data streams generated in real time.
One of the main tasks is to detect and identify objects ahead and around the vehicle (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Artificial neural networks (ANN) are the algorithms typically used for this task. Another term for this field is deep learning, because a neural network contains many layers that contain many nodes. A deep neural network is shown on figure 2 although the number of nodes and layers in practice  can be much higher.

Figure 2: Deep Neural Network Diagram. (Beachler, 2019)
The analysis of video input uses machine learning algorithms and most likely neural networks in order to classify objects. Since we have multiple sensors of different kind it makes sense to have dedicated hardware/software modules for each sensor. This approach allows for parallel processing of data and therefore faster decision making. Each sensor unit can utilize a different AI algorithm and then communicate its results to the other units or the central processing computer.
2.2. Path Planning
Path planning is important in order to optimize the trajectory of the vehicle and to lead to better traffic patterns.  This can help reduce delays  and avoid congestion on the road (Abduljabbar and Dia, 2019). Planning is a very suitable task for artificial intelligence algorithms. It is a dynamic task that can take into consideration a lot of factors and can solve an optimization problem while executing the path. The following definition of path planning is given: ”path planning for AVs enables self-driving vehicles to find the safest, most convenient, and most economically beneficial routes from point A to point B by using the previous driving experiences which help the AI agent make much more accurate decisions in the future” (Khayyam et al., 2019, p.56).
2.3. Path Execution
After the path is planned the vehicle is able to navigate the road conditions, by detecting objects, pedestrians,  bicycles and traffic lights in order  to reach the destination (Khayyam et al., 2019). The object detection algorithms are a primary focus of the AI community as they make it possible for human like behavior. The challenges come when different road and weather conditions come into play. Many accidents with testing vehicles happened because the simulation environment is different from the real world conditions and the AI software may react unpredictably when given unknown data.
2.4. Monitoring Vehicle’s Condition
The most promising type of maintenance is predictive maintenance. It can be defined in the following way: “Predictive maintenance employs monitoring and prediction modelling to determine the condition of the machine and to predict what is likely to fail and when it is going to happen” (Prytz, 2014, p.2). It tries to predict future problems, not problems that already exist. In this respect predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money. Both supervised and unsupervised learning can be used for predictive maintenance. The algorithms can use on-board and off-board data to make decision for predictive maintenance. The machine learning algorithms used for this task are classification algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines and random forest algorithm.
2.5. Insurance Data Collection
Data logs from a vehicle can contain information about the driver’s behavior and this can be used in the analysis of traffic accidents. These data can be used for processing of claims (Carol, 2017). All this can contribute  to decrease in prices for insurance, since the safety is more deterministic and guaranteed. For fully automated cars the liability will shift from the passenger, who is no longer a driver, to the manufacturer. In the semi-autonomous vehicle, we will still most likely have some liability of the driver. Proving these type of cases will rely more and more on smart data captured by the  AI system of the vehicle. Data from all sensors generates enormous amounts of information. Saving all the data at every moment may not be practical,  but saving snapshots of relevant data seems the right balance of obtaining evidence that could be used for post analysis of a certain traffic event. This approach is similar to how black box information is stored and analyzed after a crash.
The next article in this two-part series discusses artificial intelligence algorithms and challenges for autonomous vehicles.

Clemson University is strengthening its ability to conduct research and offer courses in artificial intelligence, a fast-rising technology that is beginning to revolutionize industries ranging from advanced manufacturing to healthcare.
About 80 faculty members are banding together to launch the new Clemson Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Science and Engineering, or AIRISE.
Clemson researchers have been developing and using artificial intelligence for years, and the institute will build on projects already underway. 
Feng Luo meets (center) is the director and founder of the new Clemson Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for Science and Engineering.
Artificial intelligence is widely regarded as crucial to enhancing economic and national security.  A presidential executive order last year called for more training on AI technologies, and several major companies have established AI labs, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Mitch Shue, executive director of AIRISE and a professor of practice, said the institute will serve as the umbrella for AI research, education and STEM workforce development at Clemson.
“AI is pervasive now, and we have to prepare our students for a different world,” said Shue, who formerly served as chief technology officer for Morningstar. “Combining all of Clemson’s resources in one institute will help us recruit top students and faculty and better compete for federal grants that fund cutting-edge research.”
Feng Luo, the institute’s director and founder, said that AIRISE will help Clemson meet industry demand for AI-related research and talent.
“I think we have some big opportunities,” said Luo, who is also a computer science professor. “The requirement for AI from industry has dramatically increased. When a company has data, it wants to make sense of the data, and AI is one of the ways to help them.”
Luo is among the Clemson researchers who have deep experience in artificial intelligence. He and his team started a project in 2017 with a $4.3-million federal grant aimed at using artificial intelligence to combat citrus-greening disease, which poses a serious threat to Florida’s citrus industry.
Other Clemson researchers have deployed artificial intelligence to protect self-driving vehicles from cyberattack, inspect vehicles for defects as they travel an assembly line, safeguard reputations on social media, detect cyberbullying, and diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier than currently possible, just to name a few examples. (Read more about those projects here.)
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said that advances in computing power, new algorithms and an explosion of data are opening new possibilities in artificial intelligence.
“With AIRISE, Clemson will be well-positioned to play a key role in conducting cutting-edge research and creating the STEM workforce of the future,” she said. “We have a real opportunity to help enhance economic development and U.S. competitiveness.”
A top goal of the institute will be to position Clemson as a leader in advanced manufacturing, materials sciences, bio- and medical-informatics, cyberinfrastructure and intelligent transportation.
“Those are all core to Clemson, and applying this AI umbrella over those specific areas is going to be a big differentiator for Clemson and for the effects on society in general,” Shue said.
Shue will lead the effort to build industry collaborations for AI research and education in AIRISE. 
“Industry is sitting on tons of data, some underutilized or not used at all,” he said. “We can help with that.” 
AIRISE is Clemson’s latest effort to work across disciplines and institutions to expand research and education in artificial intelligence. About 150 officials from Clemson University, the Medical University of South Carolina and Siemens Healthineers joined together in November for a summit aimed at finding new ways to improve healthcare with artificial intelligence.
Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, said the new institute will further position Clemson for success in one of the globe’s most transformative fields.
“AIRISE will enhance the ability of Clemson’s engineers and scientists to work collaboratively across disciplines and institutions, including industry, to strategically enhance artificial intelligence and prepare the leaders of tomorrow,” he said. “I congratulate Mitch and Feng on the launch of AIRISE and look forward to working with them on this important initiative.”

AI has already become a crucial part of recruiting and hiring processes, emerging as a significant HR technology aimed at reducing and even removing time-consuming activities like screening resumes manually. Organizations increasingly use this tech to confiscate unconscious bias from hiring decisions as well as to attract applicants, and envisage whether a candidate fit for the position and company..As AI is trained on data collected about previous or similar applicants, it has the potential to expurgate the effort recruiters need to spend to make a hire. A 2018 LinkedIn report highlights that 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters surveyed reported AI was saving them time..Looking and hiring new employees that can fit an organization's requirements is an expensive endeavor. In this way leveraging AI and machine learning can be an effective approach, helping in making valuable long-term employees for a good return on businesses' recruitment investment. HireVue that assists global enterprises to gain a competitive advantage in the modern talent marketplace, for instance, allows companies to screen candidates via automated video interviews. By integrating video interviews with predictive, validated IO science and AI, the company gives the ability to hiring managers to make productive decisions by scaling cognitive capabilities, determining language structure, and distinguishing emotions. This will help them find the most suitable potential candidates..Today, there are a different number of online applications that assist aspirants to improve resumes and apply for jobs that fit them. In addition to this, the availability of the underlying technology that makes modern job boards possible is also helping in improving a candidate's job search. For example, the AWS cloud infrastructure, which has developed from an internal network into an operating system for the internet. The use of AI by Amazon Web Services to predict server usage enables job boards to quickly display job seekers geotargeted openings that align with their profession, skills, interests and career goals..Using AI for Recruiters.Reports show that a majority of talent acquisition leaders or hiring managers' biggest challenge is screening resumes efficiently. Implementing artificial intelligence in recruiting processes helps them streamline or automate some part of the recruiting workflow, particularly repetitive, high-volume tasks. While manually screening resumes is still the most time-consuming part of recruiting, most of the resumes received for a role are unqualified..On the other side, AI holds much promise for improving the quality of hire as it uses data to standardize the matching between candidates' experience, knowledge, and skills and the job requirements. AI and machine learning can also enable thousands of applications to be processed in a short period of time compared to humans that do so manually..The arrival of robots in recruiting workflow is making this process even easier for HR teams. For instance, in Sweden, a robot named Tengai, the brainchild of Furhat Robotics, is making waves by conducting job interviews. This robot is designed to conduct unbiased interviews in an effective manner as possible..Briefly, the promises AI brings to the recruiting and hiring process can drastically improve and enhance both individuals' job hunting and companies' effort to hire. The technology will not only become more creative and effective over time, but also frees up hiring managers to focus more on agile work and on getting to know their top applicants and make decisions based on that..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This includes advanced tech skills such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and wireless technologies among others. Merely 2.5% of engineers in India possess skills in artificial intelligence while only a handful of engineers (5.5%) are qualified with basic programming, the report assessed.This means, overall, only 1.5% of engineers in India have the required skills for new-age jobs. The findings match other reports about the shortage of digital skills in India. The emerging sector has nearly 4,000 vacant jobs in India due to lack of qualified talent.This may be because of the education system imparting theory-based knowledge. The data collected has revealed that only 40% of the total graduate engineers opt for internships for hands on experience with 36% taking up projects other than their coursework. While 47% of students attend industry talks to boost their knowledge.""We find that a low proportion of engineers take up projects beyond curriculum and do internships. Also, there is a lack of faculty talking about industry application of concepts in class or students getting exposure through industry talks,"" Varun Aggarwal, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Aspiring Minds told PTI.The report analysed engineers across India, China and the US. As per the conclusions drawn, US job applicants were found to be ahead of Indians in terms of good coding skills, while China and India compete almost at the same levels.See also:Google will groom these 10 Indian startups that use AI and machine learningThese core subjects are the biggest winners in IIT-Delhi's record campus placement seasonThese 5 sectors are the only ones projected to see double digit salary hikes this year",,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}","['https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderIndia', 'https://twitter.com/BiIndia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second plenary meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) will be held from 6 to 8 July 2020, bringing together representatives of the 47 Council of Europe member states, observer states (Canada, Holy See, Israel, Japan, Mexico, USA) as well as civil society, academia and the Council of Europe's Internet partners. 
The CAHAI observer group is expanding with the participation for the first time of Israel and 12 new stakeholders. Other international organisations (EU, OECD, UNESCO) will also contribute to CAHAI’s work. 
CAHAI members will make concrete proposals on the feasibility study of a future legal framework on artificial intelligence (AI) based on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In this connection, they will address issues such as the mapping of legal instruments applicable to AI and the opportunities and risks arising from the design, development and application of AI on human rights, rule of law and democracy, which have already been subject of a preliminary analysis.
Other issues such the scope and main elements of the above-mentioned legal framework will also be discussed.
This will provide the necessary impetus for the preparation of the first draft of the feasibility study, which will be presented at the CAHAI plenary meeting in December 2020.

AI is poised to transform nearly every industry, and with it will come significant changes for many job functions. Many roles across organizations will require at least some use of artificial intelligence technologies in the coming years, creating massive new opportunities for the AI-savvy regardless of discipline.
Alongside this transformation of how many IT and business staff do their work will be the emergence of new jobs targeted at making the most of organizational AI strategies. Machine learning engineers have already cemented their place as must-have members of AI teams, taking first place in Indeed’s best jobs list last year. AI specialist was also the top job in LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs report, with 74 percent annual growth in the last four years, followed by robots engineer and data scientist.

“Because of the pandemic, IDC believes that AI spending and employment will increase among healthcare providers, education, insurance, pharmaceutical companies and federal governments,” she says.
We reached out to IT leaders, AI experts, and industry analysts to get a sense of the kinds of AI roles they see emerging as AI takes firmer hold of the enterprise. Some leading-edge companies are already filling these positions, lending insight into the mix of skills necessary to succeed in them.
 
 
 













 
 

Chief AI officer
AI leadership roles fall under an array of titles: vice president of AI and machine learning, chief innovation officer, chief digital officer, and many more.
Whatever the name, these “chief AI officers” must understand how cognitive technologies impact the busines, develop the company’s AI strategy, and explain it to the board, company executives, employees, and customers. And they work with the CIO to implement this strategy to best meet the needs of the business and all stakeholders.
Nicole Eagan, chief AI officer at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, splits her time working with in-house technology teams, talking to customers, and evangelizing the firm’s AI strategy, which includes figuring out how to augment human efforts with AI, for example, in detecting and investigating threats.
 
 
 













 
 

“I work with the CTO and our AI lab to explore new areas for research and development,” says Eagan, who previously worked up the ranks of Oracle’s strategy group to become senior director of strategic marketing.

Eagan continuously augment her technical AI skills through online classes, but her role at Darktrace is more business-focused, applying AI to real-world problems, rather than creating algorithms and writing code. “We do have over 35 PhDs with advanced math, machine learning and AI expertise who are working in our labs,” she says.
Howie Xu, vice president of AI and machine learning at Zscaler, rose up the technical ranks, supplementing his experience with business skills. The former head of Cisco’s cloud and networking services business unit has an MBA from Stanford and a deep product background.
 
 
 













 
 

“When I first joined Zscaler, my role was more about the technology,” he says. “But in order to take full advantage of AI and ML, I had to evolve to think more about business impact.”
He recommends chief AI aspirants focus on areas where AI and ML can bring a ten-fold business value improvement to the table. “Be disciplined about the business metrics before the technology,” he says.
AI ethics officer
AI ethics officer is another high-level position that requires extensive work with stakeholders. The role may also cover risk and governance, and may need to coordinate with government agencies, nonprofits, legal teams, users, and privacy groups, in addition to technology teams.
 
 
 













 
 

Kathy Baxter, architect for ethical AI practice at Salesforce.com, says AI ethics officers must have a passion for technology but also a healthy skepticism. “AI is not magic and is not appropriate for every challenge. You need to frequently ask not just ‘can we do this?’ but ‘should we do this?'” says Baxter, who previously worked at Google, eBay and Oracle in user experience research.
Although technical literacy is extremely helpful, AI ethics officers do not need to be computer scientists or data scientists, she says. “What is more important is to have a humanistic background like psychology, sociology, philosophy, or human-computer interaction,” she says. “It is critical to focus on understanding everyone impacted by technology, their needs, context, and values.”
Baxter, who has a masters in human factors engineering and a bachelor’s in applied psychology, also credits the ability to de-escalate emotional debates as helpful. “When we talk about ethics, people can feel like their values are being challenged,” she says. “Being able to have healthy debates in an inclusive manner can be the difference between success and failure.”
 
 
 













 
 

Companies that pay attention to ethics when deploying AI create safer, more just environments, she says. Moreover, unbiased AI is more accurate and leads to better business performance.
“AI regulation is coming so creating an ethical AI practice now will better prepare you to be in compliance,” she adds.
AI business analyst
To reap value from AI models, data scientists must be paired with business analysts, says Shuman Ghosemajumder, global head of artificial intelligence at Shape Security, who has already hired someone from this role, and will be expanding the area over time.
 
 
 













 
 

“An AI business analyst should have a strong understanding of the company, its business model, and the business processes or product they are hoping to develop AI solutions for,” he says, adding that they also need to speak tech to work with data scientists and data engineers.

A related role, AI business operations manager, works on the business side to manage and improve business processes that use AI. “An AI business operations manager should have foundational knowledge in operations and experience in the particular business processes which are being automated through AI,” Ghosemajumder says.  They should also be able to analyze data generated by those operations.
Finding people to take on business-oriented AI roles may be harder than it sounds, says Anand Rao, partner and global AI leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 
 
 













 
 

“Universities and other vocational training institutions are competing to train a number of entry-level technical jobs,” he says. “However, the business and executive jobs need to be grown and cultivated within the firm and will pose a significant challenge to fill.”
Chief data scientist
Typically the top technical AI job at a company, the chief data scientist role has been evolving to include more engineering and business skills.
“Data scientists five years ago were statisticians,” says Brian McCarthy, head of analytics transformation at McKinsey & Co. “What we’re seeing now is that data scientists come from more of a technology background.”
 
 
 













 
 

Data scientists know what data to use and what algorithms to deploy to get the best results, working with data engineers and software developers to turn this know-how into working applications — and with business units to ensure the technology meets business needs.
Michael Roytman, chief data scientist at Kenna Security, got his masters in operations research in 2012 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he studied stochastic processes and optimizations. He then signed on to be a data scientist at Kenna Security, where he eventually was promoted to chief data scientist.
“Chief data scientists are moving into applying their skills sets to enhance analytics capabilities across the organization,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

AI architect
AI architects — also known as AI or ML engineers — are responsible for creating the systems to operate and manage AI and ML projects.
“These are people who can look at AI projects at scale,” says Steve Whittaker, head of strategic U.S. academic research partnerships at BT, and the head of its research partnership with MIT. IT architects who acquire AI and ML skills are good candidates for these jobs, he says.

“If you’re building an AI engineer platform, you need DevOps skills,” he says. “You need to know how to execute at scale, understand agile development, and have a sense of process and data.”
 
 
 













 
 

AI architect may also be responsible for rebuilding business processes, thus aligning them closer to the business.
Any company building its own AI or ML infrastructure will need AI architects or AI platform engineers. “It’s not just the Googles, Facebooks, and Amazons,” he says, adding that the recency of the role means that backgrounds vary widely, from new grads with new ideas, to people with 40 years of practical project management experience.
eSentire CTO Dustin Hillard expects ML engineers to have several years of experience working with large data sets and cloud data processing frameworks, and have the ability to design, build, and deploy complex AI systems.
 
 
 













 
 

AI data engineer
Both AI and machine learning live and die on data. But the data required can differ in kind and scale from that needed by other systems, so any organization that wants to perform advanced analytics, ML or AI will need an AI data engineer.

“Large organizations are the natural thing that springs to mind,” says Kevin Brown, managing director of security at BT, of the kinds of companies that should be looking to hire for this emerging role. “But also other organizations that have massive data. Health care, for example, is seeing exponential growth in data as a result of the pandemic.”
At BT, for example, the quantity of data processed is staggering. On the cybersecurity side, for example, there are millions of events per second, and about 4,000 cyberattacks per day. The company employs a managing director focusing solely on AI and strategy, Brown says, as well as AI developers, researchers, data scientists — a broad range of AI functions.
“We have a vast amount of data that we quickly need to sift through to find the anomalies,” he says, and this is where AI data engineers come in. “We’re always looking for the needle in the haystack.”
 
 
 













 
 

Data manufacturing architect
Companies in the data business offer even more specialized roles. For example, Bloomberg recently hired someone to fill a new role of data manufacturing architect on its CTO Data Science team.
The data manufacturing architect helps Bloomberg create high-quality structured data for its financial services customers, including more than 325,000 Bloomberg Terminal clients. The data comes out of unstructured, noisy sources, says Gideon Mann, head of data science, in Bloomberg’s Office of the CTO.
“These numbers must be precise and accurate, with standards beyond those of most industries and academics,” he says.
The data manufacturing architect works deep domain specialists in Bloomberg’s global data department, he says. Bloomberg is also hiring for a number of other specialized AI jobs right now, including AI research scientist, AI quantitative research scientist, human computation architect, senior ML engineer for media data science, and senior software engineer for distributed systems.
These roles require experience in AL, ML, natural language processing, information retrieval and quantitative finance, says Anju Kambadur, head of AI engineering at Bloomberg, and they should have expertise in programming languages such as Python, Java and C++. But communication, collaboration and product development skills are also important, he adds, “in particular the ability to work and communicate across organizational boundaries and across disciplines.”
AI quality assurance manager
Additional AI-related jobs are emerging to fill the needs of bleeding-edge companies, as they try to figure out how to allocate responsibilities around nascent AI practices. Some of these jobs don’t really exist yet on the job market, and most won’t have a standardized curriculum or typical career development path.
Take, for example, the emerging role of AI quality assurance manager, which could be viewed as evolving from a traditional software quality assurance job, but quality assurance for AI projects is dramatically different. The code itself is rarely the issue, for example, although a company may choose the wrong algorithm for the project at hand. What is more important are incomplete, out of date, or biased training data sets.
Biased data is a particularly thorny problem that can lead not only to bad results, but also regulatory implications, bad publicity, fines, or lawsuits.
“Nobody really understands how bias gets into the data, and how to try to get it out of the data,” says John O’Neil, chief data scientist at Edgewise Networks, recently acquired by Zscaler. “It’s an active area of research. As far as I know, there’s not a place you can go and say, here are the rules, and if you follow the rules, you’ll be okay.”
Citizen data scientist
According to Gartner, by 2024, AI power users will fill the talent gap for data scientists. These “citizen data scientists,” as Gartner calls them, will be able to perform AI-related tasks because the tools needed to deploy advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence will become easier and easier to use.
Don’t look for this as a job title, however. Instead, experience with “citizen data scientist” tools, such as Auto ML, will be part of job descriptions for a range of job functions.
“The traditional data scientists are expensive to hire, scale and train,” says Ryohei Fujimaki, CEO and founder at DotData, an AI platform company.
But around 28 percent of AI and machine learning initiatives have failed, according to IDC’s March survey, in large part due to skills shortages. “Lack of staff with necessary expertise is reported as one of the primary reasons for the failure,” IDC’s Jyoti says.
That means that there is pent-up demand for reskilling of workers for AI and ML skills, she says.
And more and more of a need for “citizen data scientists,” says DotData’s Fujimaki.

After a hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IPO market has come roaring back. Just look at yesterday’s offering for Lemonade (NYSE:LMND). The shares spiked by 139% to $69.41—putting the market cap at over $3 billion.


Part of the success has been the overall bullishness in the equities markets. But there is something else that is important: Lemonade is a next-generation AI company. The technology is all-pervasive across its operations.

The AI Foundation
Keep in mind that the insurance industry was actually the first industry that was data driven. The roots go back to 1662 when John Graunt helped to create modern statistics, which he used to calculate the probabilities for life expectancies for those living in London. The framework would lead to the creation of Lloyd's of London.

PROMOTED
The result is that the insurance industry has turned into one of the most valuable the world has ever seen. As of today, property, casualty and life premiums represent a whopping $5 trillion and account for 11% of the GDP in the US. 

Yet the insurance industry has lagged with AI, as the legacy IT systems have been a burden. So yes, Lemonade’s founders saw this as a huge opportunity. 
Here’s what the company has built:

“Lemonade’s revolutionary model has completely changed the way we think about an antiquated industry,” said Nick Liuzza, who is the CEO and co-founder of Beeline. “By implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning directly into its model, the company can keep its costs low and bring savings back to the customer—and this result rings true across many industries.”

More Than About AI
Lemonade also has built something called the Forensic Graph, which uses AI and behavioral economics to predict, detect and block fraud. So far, the company has avoided millions in potential losses. 
“In the case of Lemonade, we’d expect the company’s loss ratio and customer acquisition cost to be superior to legacy insurance carriers as a result of its AI technology,” said Nima Wedlake, who is a Principal at Thomvest Ventures. “To date, that isn’t the case, though. For example, its loss ratio in Q1 2020 was about 80% vs. about a 50% industry average. However, Lemonade is still in its early days and I expect its unit economics to improve as the company scales. If Lemonade can prove that it is more effective at underwriting risk using AI vs. legacy approaches, I expect more carriers to adopt similar approaches. Many are already leveraging AI or ML as part of the underwriting process.”
Yet there are skeptics. In other words, AI may be more hype than substance.
“At best AI could only help the company improve its actuarially ability, not see into the future and predict loss, which is of course, by definition, unknowable,” said Kristopher Marsh, who is the editor of Discoverdando.com. “Otherwise there would be no need for insurance in the first instance. On the claims side, there may be some ability to automate payments, but this comes at the cost of leakage without human oversight. If the company can process information to an above average quality, there may be a slight pricing advantage. Otherwise, their true advantage lies is in being able to operate without high labor overhead—particularly in underwriting.”
Regardless, Lemonade does show that an immersive digital approach can be effective with customers. Besides, when it comes to AI, there continue to be many breakthroughs. The industry is still in the nascent stages.
“Lemonade’s successful IPO is about a new generation of digital insurance carriers coming to market and giving insurance incumbents, handicapped by technology constraints, a run for their money,” said Michael Yang, who is the Managing Partner at OMERS Ventures. “Lemonade is leveraging new consumer interactions and creating data sets that allow it to offer the right product to the right person on the right proportional risk basis that the incumbents can’t. Whether that’s through AI or not, or alternatively, through a pretty user experience or not, is less the material point. It’s that Lemonade eschews the traditional broker and agent channel and has a direct relationship with the insured, which affords it more flexibility to innovate.”

Construction has traditionally been seen as slow,,Using technology to drive efficiencies and reduce costs on construction projects is not a new challenge. Construction has traditionally been seen as slow,,,,"



Technology firm Buildots is using artificial intelligence to help transform the industry’s approach to project delivery.
Using technology to drive efficiencies and reduce costs on construction projects is not a new challenge. Construction has traditionally been seen as slow on the uptake when it comes to engaging with new technologies and innovation. 
But there has undoubtedly been a shift in recent years. And the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has led businesses to increasingly explore how new technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and digital twins, can support the delivery of projects. 
 “There are a lot of industries that have adopted new technology in a much better, quicker and more efficient rate than construction,” says Buildots senior project manager Patrick Scannell. 
“Coronavirus has perhaps been the catalyst that the industry needed to be more tech aware and savvy. Now is the time to explore those different routes to adopting new technologies, and making that jump.”
The actual innovation is the software behind the analysis that we do on the videos recorded on site
Israel-based technology firm Buildots was founded in 2018. It focuses on helping businesses take that step and ultimately turn construction sites into fully digitised environments. Having recently expanded into Europe with a new London office, the company is hoping to drive the uptake of AI technology through its data platform. 



The platform has been designed to provide better control of construction processes and involves using hard hat-mounted 360° cameras to collect live information on site. This data is then processed using AI and is integrated into building information modelling (BIM) systems to create a digital twin of the construction site.
It is not necessary to wear the camera constantly during a shift on site, as data can be captured during regular quality control walkthroughs – usually between 30 minutes to one hour, once or twice a week, depending on the size of and activity on site. 
“But it’s not about the camera itself,” explains Buildots customer success manager Sophie Morris. “The actual innovation is the software behind the analysis that we do on the videos recorded on site.”
Data captured on site is uploaded to a Dropbox folder, which is then analysed by Buildots. The company uses visual coding, AI and machine learning to compare what is recorded in the videos with the BIM model. 
This analysis is then uploaded to a secure website which can be accessed by the client. 



The tool helps to provide a clear link between the model and the construction phase, providing better visibility of whether the design is accurately delivered on site.
The idea is that people still do their jobs, but they’re able to actually focus on the more complex decisions on site
“Basically, it’s a real time comparison of what is physically on site and what is supposed to be on site,” Morris says. “It points out where something is right or wrong, and how much progress has been made.”
The ability to virtually explore sites and keep track of the delivery of work has become ever more critical during the pandemic. 
“Staff who have had to work from home can use the tool to virtually walk through the construction site,” Scannell says. 
“In terms of added value, it helps site managers and project directors because they now have this huge amount of information that they can feed back to their clients and the
sub-contractors themselves.”
Scannell is keen to see the increase in flexible working patterns and engagement with new technologies continue beyond the pandemic. “It’s important that people don’t go back to old habits,” he says. 
For Buildots’ clients, the visual aspect of the tool and not having to physically be on site to check everything was a major benefit, pre-coronavirus. 
Lockdown business
“But during the lockdown, we’ve been getting calls from businesses saying ‘what else can you show us?’,” says Morris. 
The company is working closely with businesses to get a better understanding of what they need and how the tool can be adapted to meet those requirements. 
The team has recently helped to improve a client’s monthly payments process, for example. 
“We looked into what evidence – site photos or emails, etcetera – is needed to make those payments,” explains Morris. “With that understanding, we’ve created a tailored page in the system and we’re able to analyse the data for different trades on site and track the work that has been done in the last month.” 
“It’s taken away the need to walk through the site,” she adds. “We’re not coming up with any crazy information. We’re just giving the client the opportunity to remotely check something that they would traditionally have to go back out on site to check. 
“There’s so much data. We’re just tailoring it to the client’s needs.”
Not a staff replacement tool
But the tool is no replacement for staff. Morris insists the aim is not to take people away from construction sites but to make their work more efficient. “Buildots wouldn’t exist if people didn’t wear the camera,” she says. “The idea is that people still do their jobs, but they’re able to actually focus on the more complex decisions on site.”
While some site workers might fear the proliferation of digital tools, firms that resist engagement with new technologies risk getting left behind. 
Looking beyond the current pandemic, the tool has the scope to help contractors benchmark and have better visibility of performance and delivery across the supply chain. The data collected could provide useful insight into how subsequent projects are planned.
“We’re hoping contractors will see beyond just the profit margin for one individual project. If they roll [the Buildots tool] out, then as a company they’ll have a better understanding of how to function and improve on a bigger scale,” says Morris.
On average, Buildots collects around 80,000 images over the course of a project’s lifecycle. Scannell believes this mountain of data could open myriad opportunities to further improve efficiencies for clients. 
“The platform we started with in December has now advanced significantly. But it’s not a mature product yet,” he says. 
“We’re still growing. There’s so much more to come.”

Normally, it flies engineers to its clients’ factories to identify and solve quality-control problems.That’s not an option in a world where flights are grounded, borders closed, and security tightened. So in some plants, P2i now relies on a system that uses artificial intelligence to look for even the slightest defects.“Over the last four months, since the coronavirus, we've had to reevaluate how we are going to service and deploy our machines worldwide,” says Neal Harkrider, chief operating officer at P2i.Trending NowThe Robot Hand of the Future To spot problems, P2i is using technology from a company called Instrumental. Cameras dotted around P2i’s nano-coating machines examine smartphones after they’ve been treated, and an algorithm sounds an alert if the process appears to have gone awry.“That vision system is our primary quality-control methodology now,” Harkrider says. He says the company can adjust its tolerance for error on the fly, “and we can do that remotely, which is fantastic.”AdvertisementThe pandemic has forced many manufacturers to rethink established practices. In some places, remote sensing and machine learning substitute for fewer visits, overnight package deliveries, and manual inspections. Robots may be far from displacing humans in manufacturing that requires nimble fingers and flexibility. But systems like the one used by P2i show how AI can help machines carve out niches in manufacturing.Instrumental’s software lets manufacturers check the performance of a production line and automatically flags problems.
Courtesy of InstrumentalBefore Covid-19, Harkrider says, most companies were reluctant to allow outsiders—including their own partners—to connect to their manufacturing equipment, for security reasons. Now, he says, five plants have allowed P2i’s machines, and Instrumental’s inspection technology, to be monitored and controlled remotely.Bruce Lawler, managing director of the MIT Machine Intelligence for Manufacturing and Operations program, says the pandemic came as manufacturers already were warming to deploying automated inspection technology. “One of the big problems in manufacturing is ‘Where did the problem occur?’” he says. “If you can do more inspection more often, and have a camera on every robot, for every step, then you can say, ‘Well OK, that was here.’”Manufacturers have long used computer vision to inspect products for defects or other problems, but this traditionally involved hand-coded rules for identifying flaws, making it time-consuming to deploy and change the equipment. Using AI, inspection systems can be fed examples of particular flaws or—as with Instumental’s system—be trained on what a product is supposed to look like and asked to identify abnormalities.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDA form of AI known as deep learning has transformed computer vision in recent years and is rapidly spreading through manufacturing.

Researchers at University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Virginia Tech were awarded a $5 million National Science Foundation grant to synergize two complementary technologies -- large-scale data visualization and artificial intelligence -- to create the Smart Amplified Group Environment (SAGE3) open-source software.
SAGE, soon to be on its third iteration as SAGE3, is the most widely used big-data visualization and collaboration software in the world.
Video: https://youtu.be/Rmg9YnXLBsM
SAGE and SAGE2 are software to enable data-rich collaboration on high-resolution display walls. SAGE2 moved SAGE into cloud computing and SAGE3 ushers in the inclusion of artificial intelligence.
Principal investigator Jason Leigh is a computer and information science professor at University of Hawai'i at Mānoa  and the inventor of SAGE. SAGE is software to enable teams of collaborators to work together with data in the form of data visualizations.
SAGE3's novel interactive artificial intelligence methods will learn from human analytic activity and use the knowledge gained to assist people in synthesizing relevant data connections that lead to new hypotheses and findings, explained Chris North, a professor of computer science in the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech and a co-principal investigator.
Scientists analyzing their data in SAGE3 will collaborate with each other and with artificial intelligence through large interactive visualization spaces, such as multi-monitor workstations, tiled display walls, and virtual reality headsets. 
Leigh said the applications for the SAGE3 technology are endless. ""It will be tremendously useful to enable evidence-based response during natural disasters and events like the current COVID-19 pandemic,"" Leigh said. 
He created SAGE in collaboration with researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago 16 years ago. They've since further developed SAGE and SAGE2 with 15 years of research funding by the National Science Foundation.  
""This new funding provides us with an opportunity to take SAGE to the next level -- providing smart end-user services to amplify users' productivity making commercial and open-source artificial intelligence solutions available that can autonomously and transparently analyze data while continually learning and improving through user interactions,"" said Maxine Brown, director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Brown has been involved with SAGE since its inception. 
""SAGE3 also supports resource orchestration services that integrates these smart services with applications, workflows, and visualizations and collaboration services, and makes it easy for users to connect to local and remote display walls and computational systems and to securely run reproducible work models,"" explained Luc Renambot, Electronic Visualization Laboratory associate research professor and co-architect with Leigh of the SAGE software since its inception.
""As a 'co-pilot' to individuals or teams who are trying to examine large datasets, SAGE3 will provide a discovery pathway from data sources to human insights and knowledge, which is currently a gap in the e-Science pipeline that the National Science Foundation has called the 'missing middle,'"" said Mahdi Belcaid, assistant professor at University of Hawai'i at Mānoa and the artificial intelligence co-principal investigator on the project.
According to the researchers, SAGE3 will make artificial intelligence technologies broadly accessible, not just a privilege for the technically savvy. North said the project will conduct user-centered design research studies to ensure usability of this novel combination of data visualization and artificial intelligence in SAGE3.  
Through seed funds provided by Virginia Tech's Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology and the Hawai'i Data Science Institute, North had the opportunity to work side-by-side with Leigh in the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications at the University of Hawai'i during the spring 2020 semester. This in-person exchange, and numerous video-teleconferences with the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, was essential to helping plan and initiate the five-year SAGE3 collaboration, noted North. SAGE3 will serve the Institute's missions of bringing together computer scientists, domain scientists, engineers, artists, and designers to tackle some of the world's most complex challenges. 
The user base goes well beyond scientists. Leigh said he sees SAGE3 helping teachers use and share artificial intelligence concepts to future generations of students. And for those who work in creative media, such as filmmakers and video game designers, Leigh envisions it being a highly visual tool to brainstorm new ideas and analyze all forms of digital media to see how they relate to each other, which ones were most popular and why.

Is this artificial intelligence or a time machine?
Bas Uterwijk, an Amsterdam-based artist, is using AI to create extremely lifelike photographs of historical figures and monuments such as the Statue of Liberty, artist Vincent van Gogh, George Washington and Queen Elizabeth I.
Using a program called Artbreeder, which is described as “deep learning software,” Uterwijk builds his photographs based on a compilation of portraits, reports the Daily Mail. The program pinpoints common facial features and photograph qualities to produce an image.
“I try to guide the software to a credible outcome. I think of my work more as artistic interpretations than scientifically or historically accurate,” the artist tells the outlet. On Instagram, he details the many variations that go into creating his work.
So far, he’s created more than 50 of these images.

It’s not all technology: “The software tends to drift to averages easily because of its nature, so for that last one, I sometimes need some extra tricks and methods to get what I want,” Uterwijk says. His portraits need to stay true to the original person and what they looked like and also have expressions worth looking at.


Some of his creations feature real people, such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Niccolò Machiavelli. Others are of important but made-up characters, such as Lady Liberty and the Girl with the Pearl Earring, a figure from a famous Johannes Vermeer painting.

“I work on many images at the same time, sometimes leaving them for weeks to pick them up later when I have new inspiration or have stumbled on additional source material,” says Uterwijk.
His next work of art will be a photograph of Anne Frank: “There are several known photographs of her — so I might make her older, at an age she never reached.”

Tuladhar·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·12 min read·Jul 6, 2020212ListenShareImage by Andrey Suslov from 123rf.comArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning seems to be the current buzzword as everyone seems to be getting into this subject. Artificial Intelligence seems to have a role in all fields of science. According to Britannica , “Artificial intelligence (AI), is broadly defined as the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” By intelligent beings it basically means humans … but maybe not all humans…so anyway,It is usually classified into three subsets as shown below.Artificial Intelligence and its subsets ( Source: Edureka)Artificial Intelligence is a broader term which in cooperates Machine Learning. Machine learning uses statistical methods to allow machines to improve with experience.Deep Learning, again, is the subset of Machine Learning which uses multi layer neural networks that mimic the human brain and can learn incredibly difficult tasks with enough data.We are going to talk about Deep learning methods and its possible role in the field of Mechanical Engineering. Some common examples could be Anomaly Detection(Machine Learning) and Image based Part Classification(Deep Learning). The focus will be on Image based part classifiers and why we need them.Firstly, what is an image classifier? The ever famous AI which recognizes cat-dog pictures should come to mind. Here’s a link to the code of such a program. The data-set used contains images of cats and dogs, the algorithm learns from it and then is able to guess with 97% accuracy whether a randomly shown image is a cat or a dog.Cat or Dog? (Source: medium article)We will attempt a similar code but using Nuts, Bolts, Washers and Locating Pins as our Cats and Dogs….. because mechanical engineering.Bolt or Nut or Locating Pin or Washer? Will the AI be able to tell?So how does it work? An algorithm is able to classify images(efficiently) by using a Machine Learning algorithm called Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) a method used in Deep Learning. We will be using a simple version of this model called Sequential to let our model distinguish the images into four classes Nuts, Bolts, Washers and Locating Pins. The model will learn by “observing” a set of training images. After learning we will see how accurately it can predict what an image (which it has not seen) is.A flowchart of a Machine Learning algorithm trained on Images of Nuts and Bolts using a Neural Network Model. (Original Image: pngfind)Go directly to the code in githubData-setWe downloaded 238 parts each of the 4 classes (Total 238 x 4 = 952) from various part libraries available on the internet. Then we took 8 different isometric images of each part. This was done to augment the data available, as only 238 images for each part would not be enough to train a good neural network. A single class now has 1904 images(8 isometric images of 238 parts) a total of 7616 images. Each image is of 224 x 224 pixels.Images of the 4 classes. 1 part has 8 images. Each image is treated as single data.We then have our labels with numbers 0,1,2,3 each number corresponds to a particular image and means it belongs to certain class#Integers and their corresponding classes{0: 'locatingpin', 1: 'washer', 2: 'bolt', 3: 'nut'}After training on the above images we will then see how well our model predicts a random image it has not seen.MethodologyThe process took place in 7 steps. We will get to the details later. The brief summary isData Collection : The data for each class was collected from various standard part libraries on the internet.Data Preparation : 8 Isometric view screenshots were taken from each image and reduced to 224 x 224 pixels.Model Selection : A Sequential CNN model was selected as it was simple and good for image classificationTrain the Model: The model was trained on our data of 7616 images with 80/20 train-test splitEvaluate the Model: The results of the model were evaluated. How well it predicted the classes?Hyperparameter Tuning: This process is done to tune the hyperparameters to get better results . We have already tuned our model in this caseMake Predictions: Check how well it predicts the real world dataData CollectionWe downloaded the part data of various nuts and bolts from the different part libraries on the internet. These websites have numerous 3D models for standard parts from various makers in different file formats. Since we will be using FreeCAD API to extract the images we downloaded the files in neutral format (STEP).Flowchart of the CAD model downloadAs already mentioned earlier, 238 parts from each of the 4 class was downloaded, that was a total of 952 parts.Data PreparationThen we ran a program using FreeCAD API that automatically took 8 isometric screenshots of 224 x 224 pixels of each part. FreeCAD is a free and open-source general-purpose parametric 3D computer-aided design modeler which is written in Python.A flowchart of how the data was createdAs already mentioned above, each data creates 8 images of 224 x 224 pixels. So we now have a total of 1904 image from each of the 4 classes, thus a total of 7616 images. Each image is treated as a separate data even though 8 images come from the same part.8 isometric images of a 2 bolts. Each row represents a different part.The images were kept in separated folders according to their class. i.e. we have four folders Nut,Bolt, Washer and Locating Pin.Next, each of these images were converted into an array with their pixel values in grayscale. The value of the pixels range from 0 (black), 255 (white). So its actually 255 shades of gray.Example of an Image converted to an array of pixel values. (Source: openframeworks.cc)Now each of our image becomes a 224 x 224 array. So our entire dataset is a 3D array of 7616 x 224 x 224 dimensions.7616 (No. of images) x 224 x 224 (pixel value of each image)Visualization of our pixel array using matplot.libSimilarly we create a the label dataset by giving the value of the following integers for the shown classes to corresponding indexes in the dataset. If our 5th(index) data in the dataset(X) is a locating pin , the 5th data in label set (Y) will have value 0.#integers and the corresponding classes as already mentioned above{0: 'locatingpin', 1: 'washer', 2: 'bolt', 3: 'nut'}Model SelectionSince this is an image recognition problem we will be using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is a type of Neural Network that handles image data especially well. A Neural Network is a type of Machine learning algorithm that learns in a similar manner to a human brain.A basic neural network. (Source: Medium article by Conor McDonald)A Convolutional Neural network. A basic visualization of how our algorithm will work (Original image source : Article by Adit Deshpande)The following code is how our CNN looks like. Don’t worry about it if you don’t understand. The idea is the 224 x 224 features from each of our data will go through these network and spit out an answer. The model will adjusts its weights accordingly and after many iterations will be able to predict a random image’s class.#Model descriptionModel: ""sequential_1""_________________________________________________________________Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   =================================================================conv2d_1 (Conv2D)            (None, 222, 222, 128)     1280      _________________________________________________________________activation_1 (Activation)    (None, 222, 222, 128)     0         _________________________________________________________________max_pooling2d_1 (MaxPooling2 (None, 111, 111, 128)     0         _________________________________________________________________conv2d_2 (Conv2D)            (None, 109, 109, 128)     147584    _________________________________________________________________activation_2 (Activation)    (None, 109, 109, 128)     0         _________________________________________________________________max_pooling2d_2 (MaxPooling2 (None, 54, 54, 128)       0         _________________________________________________________________flatten_1 (Flatten)          (None, 373248)            0         _________________________________________________________________dense_1 (Dense)              (None, 64)                23887936  _________________________________________________________________dense_2 (Dense)              (None, 4)                 260       _________________________________________________________________activation_3 (Activation)    (None, 4)                 0         =================================================================Total params: 24,037,060Trainable params: 24,037,060Non-trainable params: 0Here is a YouTube video of Mark Rober (a NASA mechanical engineer) explaining how neural networks work with very little coding involved.Model TrainingNow finally the time has come to train the model using our dataset of 7616 images. So our [X] is a 3D array of 7616 x 224 x224 and [y] label set is a 7616 x 1 array. For all training purposes a data must be split into at least two parts: Training and Validation (Test) set (test and validation are used interchangeably when only 2 sets are involved).Data being split into training and test set. (Source: researchgate.net)The training set is the data the model sees and trains on. It is the data from which it adjusts its weights and learn. The accuracy of our model on this set is the training accuracy. It is generally higher than the validation accuracy.The validation data usually comes from the same distribution as the training set and is the data the model has not seen. After the model has trained from the training set, it will try to predict the data of the validation set. How accurately it predicts this, is our validation accuracy. This is more important than the training accuracy. It shows how well the model generalizes.In real life application it is common to split it even into three parts. Train, Validation and Test.For our case we will only split it into a training and test set. It will be a 80–20 split. 80 % of the images will be used for training and 20% will be used for testing. That is train on 6092 samples, test on 1524 samples from the total 7616.Visualization of the model training. (Original Image Source : Medium article by Yufeng G)For our model we trained for 15 epochs with a batch-size of 64.The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.One epoch means that each sample in the training dataset has had an opportunity to update the internal model parameters. An epoch is comprised of one or more batches.You can think of a for-loop over the number of epochs where each loop proceeds over the training dataset. Within this for-loop is another nested for-loop that iterates over each batch of samples, where one batch has the specified “batch size” number of samples. [2]That is our model will go through our entire 7616 samples 15 times (epoch) in total and adjust its weights each time so the prediction is more accurate each time. In each epoch, it will go through the 7616 samples, 64 samples (batch size) at a time.Evaluate the modelThe model keeps updating its weight so as to minimize the cost(loss), thus giving us the best accuracy. Cost is a measure of inaccuracy of the model in predicting the class of the image. Cost functions are used to estimate how badly models are performing. Put simply, a cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y. [1]If the algorithm predicts incorrectly the cost increases, if it predicts correct the cost decreases.After training for 15 epochs we can see the following graph of loss and accuracy. (Cost and loss can be used interchangeably for our case)Graph generated from matplot.lib showing Training and Validation loss for our modelThe loss decreased as the model trained more times. It becomes better at classifying the images with each epoch. The model is not able to improve the performance much on the validation set.Graph generated from matplot.lib showing Training and Validation accuracy for our modelThe accuracy increased as the model trains for each epoch. It becomes better at classifying the images. The accuracy is for the validation set is lower than the training set as it has not trained on it directly. The final value is 97.64% which is not bad.Hyperparameter TuningThe next step would to be change the hyperparameters, the learning rate,number of epochs, data size etc. to improve our model. In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are derived via training.[3]For our purpose we have already modified these parameters before this article was written, in a way to obtain an optimum performance for display on this article. We increased the dataset size and number of epochs to improve the accuracy.Hyperparameters affect parameters and eventually the final score (accuracy). ( Source: deepai.org)Make PredictionsThe final step after making the adjustments on the model is to make predictions using actual data that will be used on this model. If the model does not perform well on this further hyperparameter tuning can commence.Machine Learning is a rather iterative and empirical process and thus the tuning of hyperparameters is often compared to an art rather than science as although we have an idea of what changes will happen by changing certain hyperparameters, we cannot be certain of it.The machine learning algorithm flowchart(Original Image: pngfind)ApplicationsThis ability to classify mechanical parts could enable us to recommend parts from a standard library based only on an image or a CAD model provided by the customer. Currently to search for a required part from a standard library you have to go through a catalogue and be able to tell which part you want based on the available options and your knowledge of the catalogue. There are serial codes to remember as a change in a single digit or alphabet might mean a different type of part.Example of a part number from the website of TOREX.If an image can be used to get the required part from the standard library, all we will need to do is to make a rough CAD model of it and send it through our algorithm. The algorithm will decide which parts are best and help narrow down our search significantly.Visualisation of how the recommendation algorithm would workIf the classification method gets detailed and fine-tuned enough it should be able to classify with much detail what type of part you want. The narrowed search saves a lot of time. This is especially useful in a library where there are thousands of similar parts.ConclusionDeep Learning (Artificial Intelligence) is a field of study that has immense possibilities as it enables us to extract a lot of knowledge from raw data. At its core it is merely data analysis. In this age of the internet, data is everywhere and if we are able to extract it efficiently, a lot can be accomplished.This field has a lot of possible applications in the domain of Mechanical Engineering as well. Since almost all studies in Deep Learning need a domain expert it would be advisable for all engineers with interest in Data Analytics, even though they haven’t majored in Computer Sciences, to learn about data science, machine learning and examine its possibilities. The knowledge of the domain plus the skills of data analysis will really help us excel in our own fields.AcknowledgementsI am thankful to Pro-Mech Minds for letting me do this and specially to its data science team which includes Gopal Kisi, Bishesh Shakya and Series Chikanbanjar for their immense help with this project.

The Veteran Benefits Administration was spending too much time processing its mail. So it turned to artificial intelligence-enabled systems to slash its processing time.
By applying AI that could more quickly sort incoming claims from multiple inputs — mail, fax and electronic submissions — the Department of Veterans Affairs was able to reduce the time just sorting the claims from 10 days to about half a day, Paul Lawrence, the head of the VBA, said during the IBM Think Gov digital event, produced by FedScoop.
“We realized we had far too many people doing old-fashioned manual labor,” Lawrence said.
Veterans send in documents to the VA that pertain to the type of benefits they are eligible for and to settle disputes over services. More than 5 million veterans file claims, and the current backlog runs more than 150,000, a number that has dropped drastically in recent years.

Now that sorting times are reduced with the assistance of technology, Lawrence said the VBA is focused on other workflow challenges. He wants to reskill employees away from manual, tedious tasks and have them work with technology that can help sort and leave the complex decision making to humans. Much of the work around settling claim disputes and making decisions about benefits is not something AI has the ability to tackle.
The initial successes of technology have not solved all of the VBA’s challenges, however. The administration still takes almost 100 days to process claims on average, according to its website.
Lawrence also wants to be able to be more transparent about where claims are in the process, much like how pizza delivery services can now show customers where their orders are in the cooking and transport process, Lawrence said.
The lessons learned from using AI to improve initial processing times will stick around, he said.
“It is now something we are really proud of, we are happy to talk about how good we are,” Lawrence said.

Editor’s note: In this ongoing series for IT job hunters, we'll explore in-demand roles, necessary skills, and how to stand out in an interview. Here, Ashwin Bharath, co-founder and CEO of Revature, shares insights on getting a job as an AI developer.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) developer salary range:
$85,662 - $102,435 per year. Source: Salary.com.
In a nutshell: What is an AI developer?
Artificial intelligence developers build AI functionality into software applications. The role is generally focused on integrating and implementing AI algorithms and logic into the deliverables of an IT project.
Typically a full-stack developer position, this role requires creating, testing, and deploying code. These developers also assist in converting machine learning APIs so that other applications can use them. 
[ Want to learn to speak AI? Download our cheat sheet: AI glossary ]
What skills are needed?
Successful AI developers tend to be natural programmers, and job seekers should be prepared to showcase their knowledge of Java, Python, and R. However, applicants often mistake complex programming logic as AI – which it is not.
Developers need to be able to teach the machine to solve problems the way a human would through the use of programming. This position requires soft skills too – problem-solving (both autonomously and as part of a team), logic, and the ability to successfully collaborate are a few qualities that are critical to success in this role.
Finally, it’s also important to demonstrate cloud experience. Many companies rely on this infrastructure, and it shows a well-rounded skill set. 
How to stand out in an AI developer interview
Prospective candidates can stand out by proving that they can do more than write code. While it is a highly technical role, real success requires creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and in-depth problem solving.
Share examples of previous work experience or projects that focused on a challenge where AI was used or could have been used. Additionally, candidates should remain informed on current trends within the industry, know how AI is being applied, and be ready to discuss case studies and solutions with the interviewer. 
Bonus: Sample AI developer interview question
Question: How would you describe artificial intelligence in a way that would make sense to a non-technical person?
Answer: Artificial intelligence is training a computer to simulate human intelligence. A common example of AI that you may have already interacted with is a chatbot; they typically can be found on the front pages of websites that people visit every day. The bot can respond to a user’s questions because it was programmed with answers to commonly asked questions that a developer programmed into it initially, along with previous interactions that it has had with prior users.
[ How is AI like learning to ride a bicycle? Read How to explain AI in plain English. ]
As the bot continues to respond to more questions, it becomes better at interpreting questions and can provide more accurate answers. The goal is for the AI to take the place of what traditionally would be a human, at scale and with perfect accuracy.

For many entrepreneurs, starting their startup is the most significant thing they do. For Rana el Kaliouby, it’s one achievement in a series of unpredictable things that this self-described “nice Egyptian girl” has accomplished in her life.  


In her remarkable book Girl Decoded, el Kaliouby shares her inspiring academic and professional journey.  Alongside this, it is an intimate meditation about what it took from her personally to accomplish all that she has. 

Born in Egypt to conservative Egyptian parents, the family spent several years in Kuwait and eventually fled back to Cairo when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Raised by her parents and grandparents, she ultimately got her Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, barely pausing while giving birth to her first child. “I practically coded my way into the delivery room,” she said in her book. From there she was invited to the MIT Media lab to do her post-doc. She started Affectiva, an Emotion AI company, with cofounder Rosalind Picard stemming from their research, in 2009. 

PROMOTED
I asked her why she wrote the book. “It was a journey of self-reflection,” she told me. “I realized that my own personal story of overcoming the inner voice of doubt and reconciling my culture and who I want to be is a story of inspiration to many people out there.” 

Her startup Affectiva, where she is now the CEO, creates artificial emotional intelligence (Emotion AI) software that detects “nuanced emotions, complex cognitive states, behaviors, activities, and interactions.” The technology is used by  25% of the Fortune Global 500 companies and is in 90 countries.

El Kaliouby said that the mentors she had throughout her life were invaluable in helping push her when she needed it and overcome self-doubt. Her academic advisor Peter Robinson helped her navigate challenging experiences and her mentor at MIT Rosalind Picard became her cofounder of Affectiva.

After the success of her TED talk (which has 1.6 million views) and receiving the 2015 Ingenuity Award from the Smithsonian Institute she spoke to another key mentor who told her directly “You need to become the CEO.” Initially she couldn’t take that in, but he encouraged her to visualize the path she would need to take to get there and see herself as CEO in the mind’s eye. 
“You have to find people that you look up to, that you trust, who you can have these really open conversations with, and that you know believe in you,” she told me. “I had never voiced ever that I wanted to be CEO. But I could with him.” 
El Kaliouby added that she didn’t always understand the importance of relationships.  “I have a strong work ethic,” she said. “I always worked really hard and I thought the solution to everything was to just work more. And I realized in the last few years that relationships really matter. Making time to have coffee with this mentor even though he was never going to invest in Affectiva turned out to be so important.” 
Building those kinds of relationships takes time, so you have to invest in them and cultivate them. It’s not always easy to do but it pays off.
Don’t be somebody else’s idea of a CEO
As she describes in her book, el Kaliouby was raised in a family that stifled emotions. She learned in her family not to complain, and that hard work would solve all problems.  
As the cofounder and now CEO of her own company she had to find her own leadership style. 
“I’m very empathetic,” she said, “and I’ve decided to own that as opposed to try to be another Nick (the former CEO). He was the archetype picture of what a CEO is like. I wanted to do it my own way and I let my intuition be my guide.” 
In this time of the pandemic, el Kaliouby feels even more committed to this leadership style. Her advice to other CEOs is to start with empathy and be flexible. “Make extra time to check in on people,” she said. “I said early on that physical health is important but mental health is just as important, so I asked people to block out time for themselves.” 
She also used technology to pair people to have coffee breaks together to replicate the organic connections people build at the office. And she uses deadlines to create camaraderie.  “People want to feel they are productive and doing meaningful work, and so when we take the time to connect everyone they turn around and rally to hit deadlines.”
Stand by your core values
Early on el Kaliouby and her cofounder decided on a set of core principles that were important to them. El Kaliouby told me that as CEO she has kept coming back to those values to guide her decisions. 
“For example, we don't do any work in surveillance and security because that's not in line with our core values of respecting people's privacy.” At one point Affectiva had an opportunity to raise about $40 million with the condition that they would sell to surveillance and security companies. “It was scary,” she said. “Literally we didn't know if we were going to make payroll in a couple of months. I was thinking, okay, when do we tell the team? And who could cover if we need to? At the same time, I couldn’t reconcile this investment offer with our core values. We had to walk away. But then we hunkered down when we were able to raise money from investors that shared our vision and values and they're still very engaged. It worked out. It was powerful because you see you can do it your way.”
Eradicate imposter syndrome
El Kaliouby has dealt with imposter syndrome – feelings of being a fraud or that she would fail –regularly throughout her career. When she began to see herself as the CEO she had to “negotiate with the voice in my head telling me ‘Don’t do it Rana. You will fail and bring the company down with you.” 
When she wrote her book she had a similar critic in her head. “I thought that nobody is going to want to read my book or people are going to hate it. I had to say ‘wait a second. People liked it, reviewed it, blurbed it.’ I have to come up with data points as a rebuttal to my self doubt.” 
El Kaliouby told me that she thinks this self-doubt is always present because she is always pushing herself outside of her comfort zone. She’s learned to have a dialogue with herself and use her journal to navigate the negative voices in her head and build conviction in her own capability. 
Ultimately we all have to decode ourselves, to identify our personal obstacles and  overcome them. As el Kaliouby says in her book: “The voice in my head was filled with self-doubt. It whispered ‘you can’t. you shouldn’t. you won’t’ For the longest time I listened to that voice. But the journey that has taken me from ‘nice Egyptian girl’ to strong ‘woman in charge’ has been one of finding my own voice.”
Everyone who reads this book will be inspired to take on the rewarding journey of finding their own voice.

More than a decade ago, Nicholas Carr, in his work Does IT Matter, suggested that the widespread availability and low prices of technology made it more of a utility like electricity or water, versus a competitive differentiator.  This may be happening with artificial intelligence to some degree.


“It appears that AI’s early adopter phase is ending; the market is now moving into the ‘early majority’ chapter of this maturing set of technologies,” write Beena Ammanath, David Jarvis and Susanne Hupfer, all with Deloitte, in their most recent analysis of the enterprise AI space. “Early-mover advantage may fade soon. As adoption becomes ubiquitous, AI-powered organizations may have to work harder to maintain an edge over their industry peers.”

Seventy-four prevent of 2,727 executives responding to a Deloitte survey agree that AI will be integrated into all of their enterprise applications within three years. “Although adopters are still bullish on AI, their advantage may wane as barriers to adoption fall and usage grows, Ammanath and her co-authors state. “Organizations are finding it easier and easier to employ AI technologies. Data science and machine learning platforms have proliferated; AI-optimized hardware is providing greater compute power. It is now easier to train algorithms through self-service data preparation tools, synthetic data, small data, and pretrained models.”

PROMOTED
It is increasingly clear that “we are on the path toward an era of pervasive AI,” they add. The challenge now is leveraging AI in innovative ways to maintain its advantages, the study finds. For example, much of the work with AI is still confined to managing IT systems. In addition, there still isn’t enough AI talent to go around.

At least 26% of the companies surveyed can be considered “seasoned” AI adopters, meaning they “have undertaken a large number of AI production deployments and have developed a high level of AI expertise across the board. These AI leaders are still seeing competitive advantage — 45% of this group said that AI technologies have enabled them to establish a significant lead over their competitors, versus 26% of the entire sample.

Still, this means a majority of even the most advanced AI companies, 55%, still aren’t seeing competitive advantage. Part of this may be due to the fact that AI is still confined to IT departments and functions, including cybersecurity Forty-seven percent of respondents indicated that IT was one of the top two functions for which AI was primarily used, the survey shows.

“This could mean that companies are using AI for IT-related applications such as analyzing IT infrastructure for anomalies, automating repetitive maintenance tasks, or guiding the work of technical support teams,” Ammanath and her co-authors note. Tellingly, business functions such as marketing, human resources, legal, and procurement ranked at the bottom of the list of AI-driven functions.
An area that needs work is finding or preparing individuals to work with AI systems. Fewer than half of executives (45%) say they have “a high level of skill around integrating AI technology into their existing IT environments,” the survey shows. “This could include data science and machine learning platforms, enterprise applications powered by AI, tools for developing conversation interfaces, and low-code or no-code tools. Across all these different technology areas, 93% are using cloud-based AI capabilities, while 78% employ open-source AI capabilities.
Ammanath and her team offer some suggestions for keeping the edge with AI:
Pursue creative approaches.  “Take inspiration from inventive use cases to develop solutions that are both useful and novel.”
Push boundaries. “Expand your view of what may be possible to accomplish with AI technologies. Try to pursue a more diverse portfolio of projects that could potentially enhance multiple business functions across the enterprise.”
Create the new. “Look to develop new AI-powered products and services that take advantage of the technologies’ ability to learn and solve problems that humans can’t.”
Expand the circle. “Move AI beyond the IT department by involving more of the business in AI efforts. Look for new vendors, partnerships, data sources, tools, and techniques to advance your efforts.”
Leverage a diverse team. “Include both technical and business experts in selecting AI technologies and suppliers. Having a broad perspective from developers, integrators, end users, and business owners can help ensure organizational alignment and a focus on business outcomes.” Along with any vendor support consider using working groups, dedicated leaders, or communities of practice.
Actively address risks. “Developing a set of principles and processes to actively manage the range of AI risks can help build trust within your business and with customers and partners.”
Challenge vendors. “While it is important to build trust and transparency with providers of your AI-powered systems, it can be equally essential to ensure that what they provide is aligned with your organization’s ethical principles.”

With major companies banning the sale of facial recognition technology for law enforcement, this may be a good time to examine the applications of facial analysis in recruitment and whether recruiters really need it. 
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology is only going to become more pervasive in recruitment and other HR functions. And why not? It promises to improve efficiency and accuracy and allow human recruiters to spend more time where it matters – in building relationships with candidates and ensuring they have a positive candidate experience. 
Taking a data-driven approach to recruitment is now the norm. But how much data is necessary, and what are the guidelines for its interpretation? When facial recognition technology has been created with a seemingly large data set – albeit one that is still limited – does it simplify a recruiter’s job? It possibly can, or can it perpetuate more bias? 
The aim of using facial recognition in recruitment, or as some experts call it – facial analysis or facial expression recognition – is to capture a candidate’s emotions because of the gap in what candidates may say and what they express through their face. But reading emotions is hard. And getting a machine to do it – while in theory seems like the most practical idea – is not without its challenges. 
Facial recognition is part of a growing subset of artificial intelligence technology called emotion AI. When applied in recruitment, the technology goes a step further and becomes facial analysis or facial expression recognition technology. It deciphers facial expressions, even micro-expressions like eye movements, the curve and the corners of the mouth, and the body gestures. It also assesses tone of voice, for example, the enthusiasm in the voice, and helps recruiters evaluate whether a candidate may be a good fit for a job or organization. This begs a serious question.

Are We Using Facial Analysis Technology in Recruitment to Eliminate Bias, or Can It Perpetuate Bias Further? 
Facial analysis is applied in different ways in recruitments. Some companies use providers that allow candidates to record their responses to a predefined set of questions. Following this, facial analysis tech is applied to identify a candidate’s suitability for the job. In other cases, the technology may be used in a live interview, where it assesses candidates as they respond to the interview questions. 
This brings up serious concerns. Does the facial analysis software account for the context of a facial expression – for instance, the cultural significance of expressions, fear, awkwardness, inability to make contact in the case of perhaps a neurodiverse candidate? 
One studyOpens a new window  found that two separate facial recognition algorithms consistently highlighted black professional basketball players as having more negative emotions than white players, with one interpreting ambiguous facial expressions of black players as contemptuous. However, when all players smiled, regardless of race, the disparity between negative emotions reduced. 
Consider the ramifications of such analysis in the workplace, where an algorithm consistently identifies individuals from certain groups as exhibiting negative emotions and, therefore, ineligible candidates for a job. AI algorithms pick up on micro-expressions, and if a candidate was in distress during the interview, those expressions might be captured differently from a smile of politeness or friendliness. 
The growing use of AI in video assessments has led to a whole series on YouTube on how employees can prepare for such interviews. In South Korea, applicants are learningOpens a new window  how to use AI bots that use facial analysis for assessments. Experts conduct talks that teach candidates to master AI interviews that assess them for “fear” and “joy.” 
Some video AI assessments remove the human checker from the process entirely and may not even allow videos that don’t pass its checks to be reviewed by humans. And the real question to ask here is what the candidate is being assessed against? What is the standard that they are expected to meet? Has that been established anywhere? Does your own organization have it? And what does that person look like? 
If all employees were to meet this standard, would it culminate in a company that has the same type of employee in the guise of a “cultural fit”? What does that do to eliminate bias in recruitment? Some expert opinions believe that the technology is too nascent to have a real impact and may result in increasing the divide rather than closing it. 

A3 Facial recognition in recruitment to screen candidates is not a tested solution and companies should not be using it.#AXSChatOpens a new window  – Most startups don’t have the resources or experts to create such solutions. Using them is a risk.

The application of facial analysis, particularly in recruitment, can result in the perpetuation of bias, but the promise is that it can alleviate it, too. Human biases play out at a very subconscious level, and sometimes recruiters may just not like the “the look” or the “vibe” of a person if it doesn’t conform with their idea of what the ideal candidate should be. In such cases, a supposedly unbiased software can eliminate the initial layer of bias and possibly present a candidate for what they are. 
Facial analysis software may prove useful for companies that need to hire for customer-facing roles. For instance, HireVue’s – a popular name in AI-powered recruitment video assessments – biggest clients are Hilton and Unilever, and they claim to have minimized their hiring timeOpens a new window  from weeks to days. In 2019, HireVue also started training neurodiverse candidatesOpens a new window  to ace video interviews. However, the company has received some negative publicity for its facial analysis technology for some of the reasons mentioned above.

So, How Much Does Facial Analysis Help a Recruiter?
Not enough data exists to assess whether facial analysis perpetuates bias or eliminates it. It demonstrates the potential for both.
The challenge with facial recognition and analysis is not just that the data is limited, but that AI is a field that already has a diversity crisisOpens a new window . Not enough women and other marginalized groups work in the field. So, the concern is that not enough diversity is translating into rigid outcomes from running AI algorithms. Facial recognition or any form of AI is not just as weak/strong as its data set, but also as weak/strong as who is preparing, creating, cleaning, and streamlining these data sets. 
Facial analysis may not be most effective when applied in isolation. It will have to be combined with multiple methods and points of assessment. Human interviewers need to handhold technology as much as they are helped by it to make the right decisions.

Previously I explained how the team at byteLAKE took their first steps into the world of CFD somewhat 10 years ago. I summarized how we tried different approaches as we progressed and delivered projects focused on both GPU and FPGA adaptation work. While moving to heterogeneous computing seemed like the right and the only choice at that time to speed up the calculations, we always knew something was missing in the equation. Nevertheless, we listened to the voice of our clients and partners and eventually decided to start building a cross-platform solution with the option for extra benefits offered by heterogeneous architectures rather than build a solution that is tied to any particular hardware. Also, having completed several research projects, we saw a great and at the same time uncharted potential for applying AI (Artificial Intelligence) in one more area, this time HPC (High-Performance Computing) industrial simulations.Based on all of these experiences we always asked the following question within the byteLAKE team: could AI enable tremendous acceleration of calculations across the CFD industry? Well, it seems that AI has a lot to offer for CFD. Follow this blog post series to stay up to date with byteLAKE’s CFD Suite development work.byteLAKE’s AI for CFD, CFD Suite is a cross-platform solution and is not tied to any particular hardware. It can work on CPU-only as well as heterogeneous architectures though. We designed in a way that our partners can use CFD Suite in their existing environments and so that no adjustments are needed.So what is byteLAKE’s CFD Suite? It’s a collection of innovative AI Models for CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). We believe we are on our way to offer, through AI, the level of calculations acceleration that is beyond what’s achievable with hardware upgrades or algorithms adaptation to hardware accelerators alone. Needless to say, that the latter approach comes at a huge cost which we aim to eliminate.Trending AI Articles:1. Natural Language Generation:The Commercial State of the Art in 20202. This Entire Article Was Written by Open AI’s GPT23. Learning To Classify Images Without Labels4. Becoming a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Financial Analyst and Research AnalystOur strategy is to replace the numerical solvers with equivalent AI models or enable interaction between AI and solvers for much faster analysis and reduced cost of trial & error experiments. In other words, the CFD Suite will make it possible to run many more experiments and better explore the design space before decisions are made. All within radically lower budgets related to the time and resources needed. We are working on solver specific AI models to ensure high accuracy of predictions. Also, byteLAKE’s CFD Suite will become a foundation for bringing the Digital Twin concept to the world of CFD simulations. The models will be generalized so that they can work across various use cases or geometries. We have already reached a milestone where the same model can be successfully used when simulation input parameters change.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite is a collection of innovative AI Models for CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). Ultra-fast results, radically lower TCO. Explore new possibilities. One model even if simulation parameters change.One can say that byteLAKE’s CFD Suite is a collection of plug & play modules or add-ons for your existing CFD software or a collection of tools that can work in parallel to your existing toolchain or simulation workflow. There is no need to make any adjustments to your existing infrastructure. It can work on CPU-only architectures, CPU+GPU, FPGAs being on the roadmap as well, on your laptop/PC, on-premises data center, will be available through our Cloud Computing partners and what have you. In other words, when byteLAKE says you will eventually get an AI model that is trained to handle your simulation(s), you will get a tool that:takes input data which is the same as you now provide to your existing CFD toolsoutput generated will also be compatible with what you are getting through your existing toolchain, meaning can be directly used for visualization purposes in your tools.Artificial Intelligence JobsBottom line is that byteLAKE’s CFD Suite has been designed as a cross-platform solution to address your CFD acceleration needs. Full compatibility with existing environments makes the learning curve as short as possible.AI Models within byteLAKE’s CFD Suite work as plug & play modules or tools, fully compatible with your existing toolchains or infrastructure (no hardware-specific requirements). Their ultimate purpose is to generate CFD simulation results much faster than their counterpart CFD solvers.How does the CFD Suite work? Although it is still a work-in-process with the first product being scheduled for launch in November 2020, let me tell a few words about the underlying architecture as of July 2020. High level view is as illustrated below.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite (High Level)You typically create a line-up of input data describing the phenomena, objects, and related characteristics like i.e. velocities. Such data is then transferred into CFD solvers which produce results sequentially, each iteration or a time step becoming an intermediate result of your simulation. All such intermediate results wrap up into what’s called the simulation result. Then such a result is becoming a foundation for further analysis (and calculations) to answer the designer’s questions, dispel doubts and establish optimal configurations.Process-wise this is unchanged in the case of AI. Only the results (both simulation result, intermediate results if needed, and further calculations) can be produced much faster. It must be noted that AI is just a tool here, used to accelerate the calculations. Thus, there is again no need for any adjustments on your side and it really does not matter if your organization is ready for AI or not. It does not matter whether you have already considered AI within your roadmaps or strategies either. AI is a hidden layer within byteLAKE’s CFD Suite, designed to work seamlessly. As mentioned, its only purpose is to accelerate the calculations and not generate any requirements in terms of organizational changes, infrastructure upgrades, etc.On the inside, you will find byteLAKE’s proprietary combination of various CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), the latter mostly being LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. For time being we are mostly simulating the results for 2D and 3D meshes of sizes respectively from 32x32(x32) to 128x128(x128). The algorithm we are starting with is the general advection algorithm (which is MPDATA in our case; used i.e. in weather simulations as part of the COSMO Model). So far (July 2020) we have successfully predicted the next 8, 16, and 32 steps. Regarding the accuracy, example results are as follows:Pearson’s correlation: 0.75–0.98MSE: 0.03–0.6Relative error: 0.2–15%Depending on scenarios, our neural networks consist of 2–14 layers and we usually train ~10 epochs for quick testing and 100 for general usage. To ensure that the AI Models are not overfitted or under fitted we have also designed a dedicated software auto-tuning mechanism (machine learning) that allows us to optimize the hyperparameters automatically. Software automatic tuning (auto-tuning) is a paradigm enabling software automatic adaptation to a variety of computational conditions.byteLAKE’s software autotuning mechanism, powered by Machine Learning is another tool that ensures optimal configuration and maximum performance of the AI Models within the byteLAKE’s CFD Suite.As pictured below, auto-tuning analyzes the neural networks and for instance, ensures that the AI Models produce accurate results optimally.byteLAKE’s CFD Suite — training history (July 2020)X-Axis: epochsY-Axis: MSEBlue: loss (MSE for training dataset)Red: val-loss (MSE for validation dataset)Currently, the main challenge is to increase the accuracy of predictions of time steps that are based on already predicted intermediate results.Thank you for reading another blog post in the series!

ADVERTISEMENT               What's the news — In a study published this week in the journal Science Robotics, mechanical engineers from the University of Utah designed a way to control the movement of prosthetic limbs that allow for more natural interaction with new environments like balls bouncing into your path or stepping over rocks. Previous work with powered prosthetics relied on preprogrammed behaviors based on the movements of non-amputee individuals, but the authors write that this approach -- while effective -- limits the use of the prosthetic to pre-mapped areas and obstacles. This would work great if you were only walking to the same places every day, but it's not practical to retrain your prosthetic every time you want to go someplace new.See also: Smart, made-to-order limbs are the future of prostheticsInstead of relying on preprogrammed movements to drive their prosthetic, the team turned to an adaptive A.I. that could better learn in the moment how to move.In this study, the researchers used a prosthetic dubbed the ""Utah Lightweight Leg.""Mendez et al., Sci. Robot. 5, eaba6635 (2020)How it works — Coauthor and assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Utah, Tommaso Lenzi, tells Inverse that their A.I. works by collecting information about the user's hip movements and using that to reinterpret the motion of the residual limb. ""When we walk, no two steps are the same,"" says Lenzi. ""If we encounter an obstacle, we lift our foot up and then forward to cross over it without stumbling. All these movements may look very different but have one thing in common: our joints move in synchrony and maximize smoothness... [This is the] principle that our AI system uses. One thousand times a second, the AI looks at the movement of the residual limb (i.e., the user’s biological hip, above the amputation) and plans new movements of the bionics joints that optimize smoothness, mimicking the biological leg.""See also: Soft robotics learned to mimic limb function, changing lives for amputeesThe team recruited three amputee participants and three non-amputee participants to test the A.I. limb in several different scenarios, including walking continuously on a treadmill with obstacles of varying sizes being tossed at them (the smallest being 4 in by 31 in by 2 in and the largest being roughly 1 foot by 2.5 feet by .6 feet) or walking across a short stretch of lab and stepping over obstacles.Using an A.I. powered prosthetic, users were able to clear obstacles with ease.What were the results — In a video released along with the study, the researchers show that participants wearing this A.I. prosthetic were able clear obstacles of increasing size much easier than other participants using passive (or, non-powered) prosthetics. From the video, you can see that the prosthetic limb anticipates the distance needed to clear the obstacle and purposefully bends its knee to accommodate.See also: Researchers just developed a way for prosthetic hands to ""feel""Having the ability to intelligently bend the prosthetic knee can help users' avoid using potentially damaging compensating actions, like swinging their whole leg over the obstacle, as the authors explain in the video.Lenzi tells Inverse that amputee participants were able to traverse obstacles with a similar success rate to their non-amputee counterparts -- though a little bit slower. In theory, Lenzi says their no reason a prosthetic limb like this couldn't be used to help somebody dance at their wedding in the future.What's next — That said, Lenzi tells Inverse that there's still a long path ahead for this research.""[E]very day, we are one step closer to viable bionic legs but we are not there yet,"" says Lenzi. ""Moving from the lab to real-life is not only a scientific challenge but also an engineering challenge. AI and neural interfaces are fundamental but are not going to succeed without strong, efficient, and lightweight designs for these bionic legs. There is still a lot we need to do for the latter.""Going forward, Lenzi says he's excited about working with next-generation prosthetics that users can take home with them as well as developing neural controls that will let users more intimately control their prosthetic.Abstract: Powered prostheses aim to mimic the missing biological limb with controllers that are finely tuned to replicate the nominal gait pattern of non-amputee individuals. Unfortunately, this control approach poses a problem with real-world ambulation, which includes tasks such as crossing over obstacles, where the prosthesis trajectory must be modified to provide adequate foot clearance and ensure timely foot placement. Here, we show an indirect volitional control approach that enables prosthesis users to walk at different speeds while smoothly and continuously crossing over obstacles of different sizes without explicit classification of the environment. At the high level, the proposed controller relies on a heuristic algorithm to continuously change the maximum knee flexion angle and the swing duration in harmony with the user’s residual limb. At the low level, minimum-jerk planning is used to continuously adapt the swing trajectory while maximizing smoothness. Experiments with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed control approach allows for volitional control of foot clearance, which is necessary to negotiate environmental barriers. Our study suggests that a powered prosthesis controller with intrinsic, volitional adaptability may provide prosthesis users with functionality that is not currently available, facilitating real-world ambulation.Learn Something New Every DaySubscribe for free to Inverse’s award-winning daily newsletter!SubmitBy subscribing to this BDG newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyMore Like ThisRelated TagsHealthBiologyA.I.",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Article', 'headline': 'Artificial intelligence: Engineers reveal a prosthetic leg with a mind of its own', 'description': '""Every day, we are one step closer to viable bionic legs.""

Our Hamlyn researchers review the recent influential applications of AI in surgery as well as note the major challenges in the future development.
Owing to recent advances in medicine, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played an important role in supporting clinical decision-making and is now increasingly used for risk stratification, genomics, imaging and diagnosis, precision medicine, and drug discovery.
AI was introduced into surgery more recently, with a strong root in imaging and navigation and early techniques focusing on feature detection and computer-assisted intervention for both pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance.
That is to say, AI is gradually changing the practice of surgery with technological advancements in imaging, navigation, and robotic intervention.

An overview of popular AI techniques, as well as the key requirements, challenges, and sub-areas of AI used in preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and surgical robotics.


Our researchers at the Hamlyn Centre review the recent successful and influential applications of AI in surgery from pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance to its integration into surgical robots.
This review paper not only presents an overview of the requirements, challenges and sub-areas of each surgical application segment that applied AI techniques, but also brings attention to the main challenges and provides the potential solutions for the future development of AI in surgery.
AI for preoperative planning
Pre-operative planning where surgeons plan the surgical procedure on the basis of existing medical records and imaging is essential for the success of a surgery.
Our researchers highlighted four routine tasks based on medical imaging that involve AI techniques: (1) anatomical classification, (2) detection, (3) segmentation, and (4) registration.

AI for intraoperative guidance
Surgical trauma is reduced through minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which is now progressively combined with robotic assistance. Computer-aided intra-operative guidance has always been a cornerstone of MIS.
In light of this, learning strategies have been extensively integrated into the development of intra-operative guidance to provide enhanced visualisation and localisation in surgery.

AI techniques for computer-aided intraoperative guidance in MIS.


There are four main areas of computer-aided intra-operative guidance in MIS that involve AI techniques: (1) shape instantiation, (2) endoscopic navigation, (3) tissue tracking, and (4) Augmented Reality (AR).

AI for surgical robotics
By virtue of the development of AI techniques, surgical robots can achieve superhuman performance during MIS. 
The objective of AI is to boost the capability of surgical robotic systems in perceiving complex in vivo environments, conducting decision-making, and performing the desired tasks with increased precision, safety, and efficiency.

AI techniques for surgical robotics.

The common AI techniques used for robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) can be summarised in four aspects: (1) perception, (2) localisation and mapping, (3) system modelling and control, and (4) human–robot interaction.

The future development of AI in surgery
The advancement in AI has been transforming modern surgery toward more precise and autonomous intervention for treating both acute and chronic symptoms. By leveraging such techniques, notable progress has been achieved in preoperative planning, intra-operative guidance, and surgical robotics.
In view of this, our researchers summarise the current state, emerging trends, and major challenges in the future development of AI in surgery, as well as provide the potential solutions for overcoming these challenging issues.

AbstractAcute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.

IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of predicting acute critical illness earlier and with greater accuracy than traditional early warning score (EWS) systems, such as modified EWSs (MEWSs) and sequential organ failure assessment scores (SOFAs)1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Unfortunately, standard deep learning (DL) that comprise available AI models are black-box predictions that cannot readily be explained to clinicians. A tradeoff must, therefore, be made between transparency and predictive power, which for high-stake applications most often favor the simpler, more transparent systems, where a clinician can easily back-trace a prediction. To benefit from the higher predictive power, the importance of explainable and transparent DL algorithms in clinical medicine is without question, as was recently highlighted in the Nature Medicine review by Topol14.Transparency and explainability are an absolute necessity for the widespread introduction of AI models into clinical practice, because an incorrect prediction may have grave consequences15,16,17,18. Clinicians must be able to understand the underlying reasoning of AI models so they can trust the predictions and be able to identify individual cases in which an AI model potentially gives incorrect predictions15,16,17,18,19. Consequently, a useful explanation involves both the ability to account for the relevant parts in an AI model leading to a prediction, but also the ability to present this relevance in a way that supports the clinicians causal understanding in a comprehendible way20. An explanation that is too hard to perceive and comprehend will most likely not have any practical effect.In this work, we will present explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS), which comprises a robust and accurate AI model for predicting acute critical illness from electronic health records (EHRs). Importantly, xAI-EWS was designed to provide simple visual explanations for the given predictions. To demonstrate the general clinical relevance of the xAI-EWS, we present results here from three emergency medicine cases: sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute lung injury (ALI). The xAI-EWS is composed of a temporal convolutional network (TCN)21,22 prediction module and a deep Taylor decomposition (DTD)23,24,25,26,27 explanation module, tailored to temporal explanations (see Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Overview of the xAI-EWS system.Each patient’s data from the EHR is used as input in the TCN prediction module. Based on this data, the model makes a prediction, such as a 78% risk of AKI. The DTD explanation module then explains the TCN predictions in terms of input variables. P, plasma; eGFR, estimated Glomerular filtration rate; DTD, deep Taylor decomposition; TCN, temporal convolutional network; xAI-EWS, explainable artificial intelligence early warning system.Full size imageThe architecture of the TCN has proven to be particularly effective at predicting events that have a temporal component, such as the development of critical illness5,22,28,29. The TCN operates sequentially over individual EHRs and outputs predictions in the range of 0–100%, where the predicted risk should be higher for those patients at risk of later acute critical illness, compared to those who are not. The DTD explanation module delineates the TCN predictions in terms of input variables by producing a decomposition of the TCN output on the input variables30,31.ResultsPredictive performanceIn Fig. 2, the predictive power of the xAI-EWS is presented in summary form with results from the onset time to 24 h before onset. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with mean values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over the five cross-validations folds were 0.92 (0.9–0.95)–0.8 (0.78–83), 0.88 (0.86–0.9)–0.79 (0.78–0.8), and 0.90 (0.89–0.92)–0.84 (0.82–0.85) for sepsis, AKI, and ALI, respectively. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) with mean values and 95% CIs were 0.43 (0.36–0.51)–0.08 (0.07-0.09), 0.22 (0.19–0.24)−0.13 (0.12–0.14), and 0.23 (0.21–0.26)–0.23 (0.22–0.24) for sepsis, AKI, and ALI, respectively. (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).Fig. 2: Predictive performance of the xAI-EWS.The xAI-EWS results are compared with those from MEWS, SOFA, and the gradient boosting vital sign model (GB-Vital). Predictive performance is shown from the onset time to 24 h before onset. AUROC performance is shown for sepsis (a), AKI (c), and ALI (e), and AUPRC performance is shown for sepsis (b), AKI (d), and ALI (f). The solid lines indicate mean values. Lighter semitransparent colors surrounding the solid lines indicate uncertainty by 95% confidence intervals calculated from the five test datasets (n = 163,050 patients examined over 5 cross-validation folds with a test size of 10%).Full size imageExplanationsThe xAI-EWS enabled two perspectives on the model explanations: an individual and a population-based perspective. For the individual perspective, the explanation module enabled the xAI-EWS to pinpoint which clinical parameters at a given point in time were relevant for a given prediction. In current clinical practice, the workflow normally follows that clinicians observe either a high EWS or an increase in EWS. However, the following targeted clinical intervention concerning the potential critical illness happens when the clinician understands which clinical parameters have caused the high EWS or the change in EWS. This is one of the main reasons why AI-based EWS systems need to be able to explain their predictions. The xAI-EWS system we developed allows for such explanations in real time and across all clinical parameters used in the model. An example of an output from the explanation module, utilizing the individual perspective, is illustrated in Fig. 3. Individual clinical parameters are sized according to the amount of back-propagated relevance. Figure 3a shows the 10 most relevant parameters with respect to sepsis for a single patient with a risk score of 76.2%. High respiration frequency, high pulse rate, and low plasma albumin are the most important predictors of sepsis. The physiological values of respiration frequency and pulse rate do not seem to increase close to the prediction time, but, inspecting the increasing sizes of relevance, it appears that the xAI-EWS attributes more weight to recent values. Figure 3b and c show the 10 most relevant parameters with respect to AKI and ALI for two patients with risk scores of 90.4% and 83.8%, respectively.Fig. 3: Results from the explanation module displays for three individual patients.Three selected patient timelines with back-propagated relevance for sepsis (a), AKI (b), and ALI (c) are shown. Only the 10 highest-ranking parameters in descending order by the mean relevance are displayed. The data shown in the three timelines match the data from the observation window, such that a time equal to zero is the prediction time. The data-points are colored according to the 5th and 95th percentiles for each parameter across the whole dataset. The blue data-points correspond to a value between 0 and the 5th percentile, the red data-points correspond to a value between the 95th and 100th percentiles, and data-points with values close to the median are purple. P, plasma; eGFR, estimated Glomerular filtration rate.Full size imageIn terms of the population-based perspective, the xAI-EWS is able to facilitate transparency and, thereby, induce trust, by giving clinicians insights into the internal mechanics of the model without any deep technical knowledge of the mechanisms behind it.In Fig. 4, the 10 most important clinical parameters for each of the three models are shown. The parameters are sorted by the decreasing mean relevance as computed for the local, back-propagated relevance scores across the entire population, but only for patients who were positive for sepsis, AKI, or ALI.Fig. 4: Results from the explanation module displaying the global parameter importance and local explanation summary.The parameters are sorted in descending order according to global parameter importance, defined by the mean relevance, which is identified by the blue horizontal bars for sepsis (a), AKI (c), and ALI (e). The local explanations summary shows all the individual data-points, colored by parameter value and displaced by the mean relevance for sepsis (b), AKI (d), and ALI (f). The height of the data-points shown for each parameter in the local explanation summary correlate with the number of data-points at the associated level of relevance. The population-based perspective is simplified by ignoring the temporal relevance variations, treating all data-points at different times equally. P, plasma; eGFR, estimated Glomerular filtration rate.Full size imageThe blue horizontal bars in the left column of Fig. 4 display the mean relevance. In the local explanation summary in the right-hand column of Fig. 4, the distribution of the back-propagated relevance scores for each clinical parameter are shown and color-coded by the parameter value associated with the local explanation. As an example, in Fig. 4c and d, the AKI model seems to associate high P-creatinine levels and low estimated glomerular filtration rates with AKI. When the model is confident about a decision, it will output a high probability. This high probability will result in more relevance available for distributing backward; it will also result in larger relevance scores. On the contrary, when the model does not believe that a patient will develop an acute critical illness, it will output a low probability, and the associated relevance scores will also be low. The summary distribution allows clinicians to get an idea of what to expect from the model in clinical practice.DiscussionIn this study, we present xAI-EWS—an explainable AI early warning score system for early detection of acute critical illness. While maintaining a high predictive performance, our system explains to the clinician on which relevant EHRs data the prediction is grounded.Previous work has employed different strategies to develop explainable prediction models13,32,33,34,35,36. RNN variations with attention have been suggested for illness severity assesment13, risk of hospitalization prediction32, sepsis prediction, and myocardial infarction prediction35. Shickel et al.13 developed an interpretable deep learning framework called DeepSOFA that leveraged temporal measurements to assess illness severity at any point during an ICU stay. An RNN with gated recurrent units (GRU) and self-attention was proposed to highlight particular time steps of the input time series that the model believed to be most important in formulating its mortality prediction. Kaji et al. demonstrated how attention can be applied at the level of input variables themselves when predicting outcomes for ICU patients35. Choi et al. used a factorized approach to compute attention over both variables and time using embedded features rather than the immediate input features themselves36. Zhang et al. compressed the entire patient EHR into a complete vector representation and used GRU and self-attention to predict the future risk of hospitalization in an interpretable framework called Patient2Vec32. Our work differentiates from the above studies by utilizing TCN and LRP instead of RNNs with attention.It is important to note that the xAI-EWS presented in this study should not be conceived as the one-and-only multi-outcome model. Rather, it should be viewed as a general method of building precise and explainable models for acute critical illness. Following this line of thinking, it is obvious that other models with important critical outcomes, such as hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, acute constipation, and cardiac arrest, should be added to the three models presented in this study. This will result in a series of EWS models that are all specialists in their respective fields.One important point to note is that more work is needed to investigate better ground truth definitions of the evaluated critical illnesses, such as AKI and ALI. We based the ground truth on the need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) because PaO2/FiO2 measurements were not available. The KDIGO is an indicator of AKI that has a long lag time after the initial renal impairment, as mentioned by Tomašev et al.1. Our model is trained and has been tested on a large dataset that is highly representative of the Danish population. However, validating the predictive performance of the xAI-EWS on a different population would make for an interesting study, and, as the xAI-EWS currently uses just 33 clinical parameters, this appears feasible. An interesting subject for further study would also be to compare how well the explanation module in this paper conveys explanations to the clinical experts in various contexts compared to alternatives. To that end, Holzinger et al.37 recently proposed a Likert-scale based method tailored to explanations from AI.We limited the length of the observation window to 24 h to ensure that the model was based on clinical, and time-relevant, features. A variable-length window greater than 24 h should be explored in an upcoming study.Model development was done in an iterative way where results from technical development were continuously discussed with clinicians from an emergency department. The purpose of this process was to ensure that the models learned at least some correlations that are already considered established knowledge in the clinical field. It would be obvious to try to use this technology hypothesis-generating, whereby output from LRP analysis is used as inspiration to discover new and unknown correlations.The low prevalence of the sepsis, AKI, and ALI (2.44%, 0.75%, and 1.68%) resulted in a very unbalanced classification problem. To combat this imbalance, we tried to oversample the positive class with replacements. The oversampling did not affect model performance, but stretched the output probabilities into a wider range. The results reported were computed without resampling.In summary, we have presented the xAI-EWS—an explainable AI EWS system for the prediction of acute critical illness using EHRs. The xAI-EWS shows a high predictive performance while enabling the possibility to explain the predictions in terms of pinpointing decisive input data to empower clinicians to understand the underlying reasoning of the predictions. We hope that our results will be a steppingstone toward a more widespread adoption of AI in clinical practice. As stated, explainable predictions facilitate trust and transparency—properties that also make it possible to comply with the regulations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the Conformité Européenne (CE) marking, and the United States Food and Drug Administration38.MethodsData descriptionIn this study, we analyzed the secondary healthcare data of all residents of four Danish municipalities (Odder, Hedensted, Skanderborg, and Horsens) who were 18 years of age or older for the period of 2012–2017. The data contained information from the electronic health record (EHR), including biochemistry, medicine, microbiology, and procedure codes, and was extracted from the “CROSS-TRACKS” cohort, which embraces a mixed rural and urban multi-center population with four regional hospitals and one larger university hospital. Each hospital comprises multiple departmental units, such as emergency medicine, intensive care, and thoracic surgery. We included all 163,050 available inpatient admissions (45.9% male) during the study period and excluded only outpatient admissions. The included admissions were distributed across 66,288 unique residents. The prevalence for sepsis, AKI, and ALI among these admissions was 2.44%, 0.75%, and 1.68%, respectively (see Table 1). The CROSS-TRACKS cohort offers a combined dimensional model of the secondary healthcare data. Merging all data sets is possible via a unique personal identification number given to all Danish citizens and by which all information within any public institution is collected31.Table 1 Patient population description.Full size tableThe model parameters were limited to include 27 laboratory parameters and six vital signs (see Tables 2 and 3). The parameters were selected by trained specialists in emergency medicine (medical doctors) with the sole purpose of simplifying the model to enable a better discussion of the model explanations. While a deeper model with more parameters might lead to better performance, it would also have made the discussions between clinicians and software engineers difficult. Therefore, the scope of this article is not to obtain the best performance at all costs but to demonstrate how clinical tasks can be supported by a fully explainable deep learning approach.Table 2 List of clinical parameters.Full size tableTable 3 Parameter range summary.Full size tableData preprocessingIn the data extracted from the CROSS-TRACKS cohort, each admission is represented as a time-ordered sequence of EHR events. Importantly, the time-stamped order of this data reflects the point in time at which the clinicians record each event during the admission. Each event comprises three elements: a time stamp; an event name, such as blood pressure; and a numerical value. The event sequence is partitioned in aggregated intervals of one hour, such that the observation window of 24 h is divided into 24 one-hour periods, and all the events occurring within the same one-hour period are grouped together by their average numerical value.Gold standardsVia a classification process, each admission was classified as sepsis-positive, AKI-positive, ALI-positive, or negative (no critical illness). For sepsis classification, we followed the recent Sepsis-330,39 implementation by Moor et al.5, according to which both suspected infection and organ dysfunction are required to be present5,30,39. Suspected infection was defined by the co-occurrence of body fluid sampling and antibiotic administration. When a culture sample was obtained before antibiotics administration, the antibiotic had to be ordered within 72 h. If the antibiotic was administered first, then the culture sample had to follow within 24 h.The degree of organ dysfunction is described by an acute increase in the SOFA40 score and an increase of more than or equal to two points is used in the criteria for sepsis39. To implement the organ dysfunction criterion, we used a 72-h window from 48 h before to 24 h after the time of suspected infection, as suggested by Singer et al.30 and Moor et al.5. The Sepsis-3 implementation is visualized in Fig. 5.Fig. 5: Gold standards for sepsis, AKI, and ALI.Sepsis (a), AKI (b), ALI (c), suspected infection (SI).Full size imageAKI classification was performed according to the KDIGO criteria31. KDIGO accepts three definitions of AKI: (1) an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) within 48 h; (2) an increase in serum creatinine by 1.5 times the habitual creatinine level of a patient within the previous seven days; and (3) a urine output of <0.5 ml/kg/h over 6 h. Following the work of Tomašev et al.1, only the first two definitions were used to provide ground-truth labels for the onset of AKI as urine measurements were not available. The habitual creatinine level was computed as the mean creatinine level during the previous 365 days. We used binary encoding for AKI such that all three severity stages (KDIGO stages 1, 2, and 3) were encoded as positive AKI. For ALI classification, we considered the presence of either NIV or CPAP during the admission, because PaO2/FiO2 measurements were not available. The ALI onset was the first occurrence of either NIV or CPAP (see Fig. 5).Prediction moduleThe AI-EWS model is designed as a variation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) called a temporal convolutional network (TCN). CNNs have dominated computer vision tasks for the last century and are also highly capable of performing sequential tasks, such as text analysis and machine translation41. A TCN23,24 models the joint probability distribution over sequences by decomposing the distribution over discrete time-steps \(p_\theta \left( x \right) = \mathop {\prod }\nolimits_{t = 1}^T p_\theta \left( {\left. {x_{t}} \right|x_{1:t - 1}} \right)\), where \(x = \left\{ {x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_{{T}}} \right\}\) is a sequence, and the joint distribution is parameterized by the TCN parameter \(\theta\). Thus, a TCN operates under the autoregressive premise that only past values affect the current or future values, e.g., if a patient will develop acute critical illness. Moreover, TCNs differ from “ordinary” CNNs by at least one property: the convolutions in TCNs are causal in the sense that a convolution filter at time t is only dependent on the inputs that are no later than \(t\), wherein the input subsequence is \(x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_{{t}}\). TCNs can take a sequence of any length as input and output a sequence of the same length, similar to RNNs22,28. The TCN achieves this by increasing the receptive field of the model with dilated convolutions instead of performing the traditional max pooling operation, as seen in most CNNs. Dilated convolutions achieve a larger receptive field with fewer parameters by having an exponential stride compared to the traditional linear stride. By increasing the receptive field, a temporal hierarchy comparable to multi-scale analysis from computer vision can be achieved42. Figure 6 schematizes the xAI-EWS model and the concept of dilated convolutions. At the time of prediction, the xAI-EWS model receives an input matrix of shape time-steps × features for each patient.Fig. 6: The xAI-EWS model architecture.The models in this study are trained and evaluated at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h before the onset of critical illness. Each model has a 24-h retrospective observation window. The color gradient from green to red illustrates continuous deterioration towards acute critical illness (a). The overall model architecture of the AI-EWS model is shown in b. The xAI-EWS uses three temporal blocks (c), each comprising one-dimensional dilated causal convolution layers, ReLU activations, one-dimensional dropout layers, and normalization layers. Red layers are only used during training and are omitted when the model is used for predictions and explanations. The overall dilation structure of the model is shown in d. The one-dimensional dilated causal convolution layers allow the model to skip some points during convolution and, thereby, increase the receptive field of the model. The dilation structure is illustrated for kernel size = 2.Full size imageThe data are processed by three temporal blocks, each including one-dimensional dilated causal convolutions (Conv1d) with 64 filters, ReLU activations43, layer44, and one-dimensional spatial dropout layers45. Dilation is increased between each temporal block, but keep it constant inside each temporal block (meaning that the second conv1d layer in each temporal block has a dilation = 1). The receptive field for this model can be calculated with \(1 + \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_{i = 1}^n \left( {k - 1} \right) \ast \left( {2^{i - 1} + 1} \right)\), where k is kernel size and n is the number of temporal blocks. We used a kernel size = 4 yielding a maximum receptive field of 31. Outputs from the third temporal block are pooled together across time-steps by a global average pooling operation46 to obtain a stabilizing effect for the final output of the model. The pooled output from each kernel in the dilated causal convolutions is flattened to a single vector that is used as input to a final dense layer followed by a softmax activation function. The output from the softmax activation is the probability of future sepsis, AKI, or ALI during admission.Training and hyperparametersThe model was trained to optimize the cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer47 with mini-batches of the size of 200, a learning rate of 0.001, and a dropout rate of 10%. All weights were initialized with He Normal initialization48. The model was trained on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Convergence was reached in ~30 min.Explanation moduleIn simple models, such as linear regression models, the simple association between input and the prediction outcome is readily transparent and explainable. Consider the linear function fc that weights the input x by wc in order to assign a decision for class c:$$f_c\left({\mathbf{x}} \right) = {\mathbf{w}}_c^Tx = \mathop {\sum }\limits_i w_{ic}x_i.$$
                    (1)
                Here, each input feature xi of x contributes together with the trainable weight wic to the overall evaluation of fc through the quantity \(w_{ic}x_i\). The importance-weighted input, therefore, offers a simple explanation for a decision made by the linear model. In contrast, the complexity associated with the multi-layer non-linear nature of deep learning models counteracts with such simplicity in explanations.Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)23,24,25,26,27 is an explanatory technique that applies to deep-learning models, including TCNs. Starting from the output \(f_c\left({\mathbf{x}} \right)\), LRP decomposes an explanation into simpler local updates, each recursively defining the contribution to the explanation (called relevance) for all activating neurons in the previous layer. The initial relevance score \(R_j = f_c\left({\mathbf{x}} \right)\) is hereby propagated backward through the network by local relevance updates \(R_{i \leftarrow j}\) between connecting neuronsi and j, until the input layer is finally reached. In this process, all incoming relevance values to an intermediate node i are pooled, \(R_i = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_j R_{i \leftarrow j}\), before its relevance is propagated to the next layer. Figure 7 illustrates the relevance propagation, which is similar to standard backpropagation of errors except that relevance values are propagated backward in the network instead. The conservation property23, one of the important defining properties in LRP, ensures that the total back-propagated relevance amounts to the extent to which the illness of interest is detected by the function \(f_c\left({\mathbf{x}} \right)\), which in this paper equals the logits that feed into the final transformation layer.Fig. 7: Layer-wise relevance propagation.LRP decomposes the problem of explaining a complex multilayer neural network model into simpler sub-functions that are easier to analyze and explain. The relevance score at input neuron \(R_i\) is obtained by pooling all incoming relevance values \(R_j\) from the output neurons in the next layer.Full size imageIn this process, all incoming relevance values to an intermediate node i are pooled, \(R_i = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_j R_{i \leftarrow j}\), before its relevance is propagated to the next layer. Figure 7 illustrates the relevance propagation, which is similar to standard backpropagation of errors except that relevance values are propagated backward in the network instead.There are many variations of local backpropagation rules in the LRP framework. See, e.g., Montavon et al.49 for a collection of commonly used LRP rules. We have used propagation rules that can be interpreted as DTD23, which defines a sound theoretical framework behind most of the LRP variations. In DTD, a local backward propagation of relevance accounts for a non-linearity in the network model by a first-order Taylor approximation at some well-chosen root-point. Using the origin as root recovers the original LRP update rule from Bach et al.25. That is, the relevance Rj at neuron j propagates backward to neuron i as$$R_{i \leftarrow j} = \frac{{w_{ij}a_i}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i w_{ij}a_i}}R_j$$
                    (2)
                where \(a_i\) is the activation for neuron i. Notice that this local relevance-update rule is similar to the simple explanation for the linear model in Eq. (1), except that the normalization ensures that relevance is conserved across layers. It is the simplest local relevance propagation in the LRP framework, known as simply LRP, LRP-0, or the z-rule in DTD.In general, the Taylor expansion that defines the local relevance propagation rule depends on the type of non-linearity and can, in addition, be engineered to enforce desirable properties based on root-point restrictions23. The network for the model considered in this work is composed of only ReLU activations and linear projections without a bias term. In this case, we can use a particularly engineered rule that will only distribute relevance along positive contributions through the layers in the network and therefore produces sparser (i.e., simpler) explanations. This rule is in the literature known as the z+-rule for DTD or LRP-\(\alpha _1\beta _0\), which again is a special case of LRP-\(\gamma\)49. It is defined as$$R_{i \leftarrow j} = \frac{{w_{ij}^ + a_i}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i w_{ij}^ + a_i}}R_j$$
                    (3)
                where \(w_{ij}^ + = w_{ij}\) for positive weights and otherwise equals zero. Finally, at the input layer, we used the so-called DTD w2-rule$$R_{i \leftarrow j} = \frac{{w_{ij}^2}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i w_{ij}^2}}R_j$$
                    (4)
                as it is recommended49 for real valued input.The DTD (and LRP) framework leaves flexibility to mix layer-specific rules in the network. As mentioned above, we have used the z+-rule in Eq. (3) for all intermediate layers, and in that way, we favor simpler explanations, with features that are explained as either relevant (positive) or irrelevant (zero) for a given prediction.The AI-EWS explanation module allows two perspectives on model explanations: an individual and a population-based perspective. For the individual perspective, DTD can be used for all patients with a high probability of developing acute critical illness. The module will simply pinpoint which clinical parameters at a given point in time were relevant for the given prediction (Fig. 3). For the population-based perspective, relevance is back-propagated from the output neuron representing the positive classes (sepsis, AKI, and ALI) and is only considered for the patients with a positive ground truth label (sepsis, AKI, and ALI). The individual data points and back-propagated relevance scores for these patients were aggregated in two ways to enable global parameter importance estimation and local explanation summary34 (Fig. 4). For estimating global parameter importance, the mean relevance scores were computed for each clinical parameter. This computation enabled parameter-importance estimation comparable to standardized regression coefficients in multiple linear regression or feature importance measures in random forest50. The local explanation summary (Fig. 4b) presents all individual data points, colored by parameter value and displaced by the relevance. In the local explanation summary, the height of the data points shown for each parameter correlates with the number of data points at their associated level of relevance. The population-based perspective is simplified by ignoring potential temporal relevance variations and treating all data points at different times equally. The visual concepts of global parameter importance estimation and local explanation summary used in this paper are adopted from the shapley additive explanations (SHAP)34 library by Lundberg et al. The SHAP toolbox was not used to provide explanations. In this paper, DTD was implemented using the iNNvestigate51 library developed by Alber et al. iNNvestigate is a high-level library with an easy-to-use interface for many of the most-used explanation methods for neural networks.Explaining predictions in other waysOver the last decade, many other methods52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63 have been proposed to address the problem of attributing a value to each feature in order to explain the prediction from a complex model. Recent work62,63 have brought some theoretical understanding into fundamental properties that relates many of the methods. In general, the relevance attribution methods can be categorized into two basic categories62: (1) backpropagation-based methods that propagate the attribution of relevance backward through the network form the relevance of output and back to the input features, and (2) perturbation-based methods that rely on running multiple perturbations of the input forward through the network and measuring the consequence that a perturbation may have on the output.With reference in the Gradient × Input method58, Ancona et al.62 defines a unification of many of the backpropagation-based attribution methods. In particular, they show that LRP (DTD with the z-rule), DeepLIFT (Rescale)59, and Integrated Gradients60 are all strongly related by a reformulation that expresses the attribution as the elementwise multiplication of a modified gradient with either the input (Gradient × Input, LRP) or with the difference between the input and a baseline (Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT). The modification to the gradient is achieved by letting backpropagation implement a modified chain-rule$$\frac{{d^ \ast a_j}}{{da_i}} = w_{ij}g\left( {z_j} \right),$$
                    (5)
                where \(w_{ij}\) is the standard gradient of the linear transformation \(z_j = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i w_{ij}a_i\), and \(g(z_j)\) represents some unification of the gradient for the non-linear activation. For Gradient × Input, the unifying gradient function \(g(z_j)\) is the usual instant gradient, whereas it is some form of average gradient for the remaining three methods. We refer to Ancona et al. for the actual expressions of \(g(z_j)\). Interestingly, it turns out that all four methods would be equivalent in this paper’s setup, with only ReLU non-linearities, no additive bias in the linearities, and \({\mathbf{x}} = {\bf{0}}\) as baseline.Now, the DTD z+-rule, as we have used in all the intermediate layers, does not fit directly into the unified gradient framework, but it is a trivial exercise to show that the backpropagation rule in Eq. (5) can be modified as$$\frac{{d^ \ast a_j}}{{da_i}} = w_{ij}^ + g^ + ( {z_j} ),$$
                    (6)
                where \(g^ + ( {z_j} ) = a_j/z_j^ +\), \(z_j^ + = \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i w_{ij}^ + a_i\) accounts for the fact that the relevance method only distributes relevance along positive contributions.Backpropagation-based methods are in general fast compared to perturbation-based methods, as the number of features grow62. The backpropagation-based methods require a fixed number of forward-prediction and backward-gradient passes to compute the attribution, whereas perturbation-based methods demand a non-linear number of forward passes in the number of features to properly account for the complex nature of a deep network.On the other hand, perturbation-based methods may implement other desirable properties, such as the fairness constraints from cooperative game theory, when attributing an outcome of a prediction (the game) to the individual features (the players)53,61,63,64. In particular, Lundberg and Lee63 recently demonstrated that Shapley values65 uniquely defines the solution to these constraints within a large class of additive feature attribution methods, which includes LIME57, DeepLIFT, and LRP. Unfortunately, computing exact Shapley values is, in general, NP-hard66 and sampling approximations are therefore considered. By defining a specific kernel in the LIME setup, Lundberg and Lee introduced KernelSHAP that reduces the number of necessary samples by combining sampling and penalized linear regression, as it is done in LIME. The same paper further proposed DeepSHAP as a variant of DeepLIFT that computes a layer-wise composition of approximate Shapley values. Unfortunately, the chain rule does not hold in general for Shapley values64, and to that end, Ancona et al. presents a method based on uncertainty propagation that allows approximate Shapley value to be computed in polynomial time.Baseline modelsMEWSThe MEWS baseline model interprets raw MEWS scores as a prediction model for acute critical illness. MEWS was implemented as the Danish variant called “Early detection of critical illness” [TOKS: Tidlig opsporing af kritisk sygdom]. MEWS scores were calculated each time one of the model components was updated with a new measurement. Missing values were imputed with a standard carry-forward interpolation.SOFAThis model interprets raw SOFA30,39,40 scores as a prediction model for acute critical illness. SOFA scores were calculated each time one of the model components was updated with a new measurement. Missing values were imputed with a standard carry-forward interpolation.GB-VitalThis model is a replication of a well-known sepsis detection model3,6,9 from the literature, which has shown great results in a randomized study7. The complete description of the model can be found in the study from Mao et al.6. The model parameters are constructed by considering six vital-signs from the EHR: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, and temperature. For each of the six vital signs, five parameters are constructed to represent the average value for the current hour, the prior hour, and the hour prior to that hour, together with the trend value between two succeeding hours. Based on these 30 parameters (five parameters from each of the six vital-sign events), the GB-Vital model is constructed as a gradient-boosted classifier of decision trees67.EvaluationThe xAI-EWS model was validated using five-fold cross-validation. Data were randomly divided into five portions of 20% each. For each fold four portions (80%) was used to fit the xAI-EWS model parameters during training. The remaining 20% was split into two portions of 10% each for validation and test. The validation data were used to perform an unbiased evaluation of a model fit during training, and the test data were used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model. All data for a single patient was assigned to either train, validation or test data. Figure 2 report performance from the test data. For each fold data were shifted such that a new portion was used for testing. The cross-validation scheme is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. As comparative measures for the predictive performance, we used the AUROC and AUPRC. Regarding the explanations, the quality was assessed by manual inspection of trained specialists (medical doctors) in emergency medicine.Ethics and information governanceThe study was approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency [case number 1-16-02-541-15]. Additionally, the data used in this work were collected with the approval of the steering committee for CROSS-TRACKS. Only retrospective data were used for this research without the active involvement of patients or potential influence on their treatment. Therefore, under the current national legislature, no formal ethical approval was necessary.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it. Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate.

To tell the truth, often, I pray for it. How much better would my life be — how much better would my editor’s life be, to say nothing of the poor readers — if I could ask an all-knowing machine to suggest the best way to start this column? It would surely beat my usual writing process, which involves clawing at my brain with a rusty pickax in the dim hope that a few flakes of wisdom and insight might, like dandruff, settle on the page.See what I mean? A computer might have helped there. (Like dandruff? That’s what you’re going with, Farhad?) But we writers can be a cocky bunch. Writing is something of an inexplicable trick, and it feels, like telling a joke or making a soufflé, like an inviolably human endeavor.I’ve never really worried that a computer might take my job because it’s never seemed remotely possible. Not infrequently, my phone thinks I meant to write the word “ducking.” A computer writing a newspaper column? That’ll be the day.Well, writer friends, the day is nigh. This month, OpenAI, an artificial-intelligence research lab based in San Francisco, began allowing limited access to a piece of software that is at once amazing, spooky, humbling and more than a little terrifying.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOpenAI’s new software, called GPT-3, is by far the most powerful “language model” ever created. A language model is an artificial intelligence system that has been trained on an enormous corpus of text; with enough text and enough processing, the machine begins to learn probabilistic connections between words. More plainly: GPT-3 can read and write. And not badly, either.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Software like GPT-3 could be enormously useful. Machines that can understand and respond to humans in our own language could create more helpful digital assistants, more realistic video game characters, or virtual teachers personalized to every student’s learning style. Instead of writing code, one day you might create software just by telling machines what to do.OpenAI has given just a few hundred software developers access to GPT-3, and many have been filling Twitter over the last few weeks with demonstrations of its surprising capabilities, which range from the mundane to the sublime to the possibly quite dangerous.To appreciate the potential danger, it helps to understand how GPT-3 works. Language models often need to be trained for specific uses — a customer-service bot used by a retailer might need to be fine-tuned with data about products, while a bot used by an airline would need to learn about flights. But GPT-3 doesn’t need much extra training. Give GPT-3 a natural-language prompt — “I hereby resign from Dunder-Mifflin” or “Dear John, I’m leaving you” — and the software will fill in the rest with text that is eerily close to what a human would produce.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThese aren’t canned responses. GPT-3 is capable of generating entirely original, coherent and sometimes even factual prose. And not just prose — it can write poetry, dialogue, memes, computer code and who knows what else.GPT-3’s flexibility is a key advance. Matt Shumer, the chief executive of a company called OthersideAI, is using GPT-3 to build a service that responds to email on your behalf — you write the gist of what you’d like to say, and the computer creates a full, nuanced, polite email out of your bullet points.Another company, Latitude, is using GPT-3 to build realistic, interactive characters in text-adventure games. It works surprisingly well — the software is not only coherent but also can be quite inventive, absurd and even funny.Stew Fortier, a writer, created a zany satire using the software as a kind of muse.Fortier fed GPT-3 a strange prompt: “Below is a transcript from an interview where Barack Obama explained why he was banned from Golden Corral for life.” The system then filled in the rest of the interview, running with the concept that Obama had been banned from an all-you-can-eat buffet.Obama: Yes. It’s true. I am no longer allowed in Golden Corral.Interviewer: Is this because of your extensive shrimp-n-crab legs policy?Obama: Absolutely.Interviewer: What is your extensive shrimp-n-crab legs policy?Obama: Oh, well, in brief, they were offering an all-you-can-eat shrimp-n-crab leg buffet, and I did not hesitate. After I ate so much shrimp and crab that my stomach hurt, I would quietly sneak in and throw more shrimp and crab onto my plate. I did this over and over again until I had cleaned out the buffet and was full of shrimp-n-crab.Yet software like GPT-3 raises the prospect of frightening misuse. If computers can produce large amounts of humanlike text, how will we ever be able to tell humans and machines apart? In a research paper detailing GPT-3’s power, its creators cite a litany of dangers, including “misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are other problems. Because it was trained on text found online, it’s likely that GPT-3 mirrors many biases found in society. How can we make sure the text it produces is not racist or sexist? GPT-3 also isn’t good at telling fact from fiction. “I gave it my own original three sentences about whales, and it added original text — and the way I could tell it was original was that it was pretty much dead wrong,” Janelle Shane, who runs a blog called AI Weirdness, told me.To its credit, OpenAI has put in place many precautions. For now, the company is letting only a small number of people use the system, and it is vetting each application produced with it. The company also prohibits GPT-3 from impersonating humans — that is, all text produced by the software must disclose that it was written by a bot. OpenAI has also invited outside researchers to study the system’s biases, in the hope of mitigating them.These precautions may be enough for now. But GPT-3 is so good at aping human writing that it sometimes gave me chills. Not too long from now, your humble correspondent might be put out to pasture by a machine — and you might even miss me when I’m gone.Office Hours With Farhad ManjooFarhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

Read more!",,,"                   Sebastian Thrun    Share this on:              Artificial intelligence as a motor for progress In dialogue with the robotics expert                              2020-07-27   Sebastian Thrun is certain: artificial intelligence will revolutionize our everyday lives — although some challenges still lie ahead. But fear not — we already have a solution for one of the biggest problems we face.                              Sebastian Thrun’s résumé reads like a tech fairytale. The robotics specialist from Germany moved to the US as a young man. There, he went on to become a professor at Stanford University before later making the move to Google. He carried out groundbreaking work at the company, helping to develop a self-driving car. He then founded an online university, and today the 52-year-old is head of the company Kitty Hawk, which develops personal flying vehicles. It seems that Thrun is always one step ahead of progress. What does someone like him think about artificial intelligence (AI)? “I believe it is going to be as big as a disruption to the world as the steam engine has been,” he says. And just like the steam engine, AI won’t replace people in the working world, but will instead make tasks much easier for us and enable greater productivity.           AI watches and learns      Thrun bases his optimism on how rapidly AI has developed. Just five years ago programmers had to feed their AI systems with step-by-step instructions so that they could handle these tasks. Now these intelligent machines learn just like people — by observing and imitating. “I believe there are great opportunities to leverage artificial intelligence into many jobs. When we get there, people will be much more efficient than before,” says Thrun.  He uses a practical example to clearly illustrate this: together with his students at Stanford, he trained an algorithm using 130,000 images of skin diseases. Skin cancer can now be detected as reliably as a dermatologist via a smartphone camera. This is a major step in reducing the workload of doctors and allowing people who don’t necessarily have access to medical facilities — due to living in remote locations or having limited financial means — to get a diagnosis.           “There are great opportunities to leverage AI into many jobs. When we get there, people will be much more efficient.”   Sebastian Thrun, robotics expert and CEO at Kitty Hawk      Share on X/Twitter           Tackling the skills shortage      Thrun wants to solve one of the biggest problems related to AI — the skills shortage — by means of his online university Udacity. Truly tapping into and further developing AI’s potential requires well-educated programmers, and there are simply not enough of them across the world. That’s why Thrun founded Udacity in 2012 as a platform to stream his AI lectures from Stanford. Within just a few weeks, about 160,000 students from around the globe had watched his videos. 23,000 of them went on to pass the online test. Udacity has since gone on to offer training courses on different areas of computer science, science, and economics for a fee. These aren’t just traditional correspondence courses where you get a diploma at the end, but instead individual courses that teach you practical specialist knowledge. About ten million students have taken part in the courses so far. “Udacity is now the market leader for corporate training in artificial intelligence. Many companies are working with us,” says Thrun. He says that a programmer with existing knowledge can be trained to become an AI expert within six months at Udacity.          50 percent  less expenditure for mobility — this is the savings potential that self-driving shuttle services could offer the average European.        The billion-dollar business of robotaxis       Mobility is Sebastian Thrun’s other passion aside from artificial intelligence. He has managed to link the two and founded the department for automated vehicles by means of “Waymo” at Google in 2016. Thrun claims that driverless vehicles have been technically possible for a long time, and are significantly safer than vehicles driven by humans. Now it’s time to create the corresponding business models and literally get them on the road: “I think the real unicorn business for self-driving cars is a self-driving taxi service. With that kind of model it’s possible to cut the costs of transportation by 50 percent.” This is possible because an automated shuttle could be used to full capacity. It would constantly transport customers and would not spend most of the time parked somewhere, as is the case for almost all private vehicles.                             Conquering the skies with electric and whisper-quiet vehicles      But that’s not all — for Thrun, the sky’s the limit. As CEO of the American company Kitty Hawk, he works on developing personal flying vehicles together with his team. He presented his third airworthy prototype last fall with the “Heaviside.” It has a range of 170 kilometers and can launch and land vertically thanks to its swiveling propellers. According to Thrun, its virtually silent electric motor is particularly forward-thinking: “When we are flying 300 meters above you, you will not hear us. And that is new, that is really a breakthrough.”  Generally speaking, flying taxis are still in their early stages. “But once they become more common place — maybe in ten years — they will be faster and safer than cars.” The Heaviside is already able to cover the 50 kilometers between San José and San Francisco in around 15 minutes — it takes about an hour by car. So will flying be more commonplace than driving in the future? Thrun doesn’t want to go that far, but he thinks that an innovative mobility mix of transport by land and by air is on the cards. According to Thrun, one thing’s for certain: whether it’s a car or a personal flying vehicle — in both cases AI will take the wheel.

Sebastian Thrun grew up in Solingen in western Germany and went on to study computer science, economics, and medicine at the universities of Hildesheim and Bonn. He has been working in the US since 1995 — first at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and as a professor at Stanford from 2003 onwards. He was appointed director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory a year later.  In 2011 he stepped down from his position as professor and became vice president at Google. Within this role, he founded the research department Google X which gave rise to innovations like the Google Street View cars and Google Glass. He launched the online university Udacity in 2012 and achieved second place in the American specialist magazine Foreign Policy’s “Top 100 Global Thinkers.” Sebastian Thrun has been CEO of the personal flying vehicle company Kitty Hawk since 2018.            Summary Sebastian Thrun says that artificial intelligence will allow us to work much more efficiently. Not only that, but AI in self-driving shuttles and automated personal flying vehicles will make mobility safer and faster. However, the skills shortage currently poses a major challenge. That’s why Thrun’s online platform Udacity offers courses on subjects like AI, for example.

It is the year 2050. The world population is roughly two billion people, just 25% of what it was thirty years ago. Back in 2018, the United Nations had predicted that we were approaching the point of no return on climate change. Unfortunately, by the time humanity took serious, meaningful action to the threat, it was too late. The Earth’s temperature spiked destroying agriculture, triggering massive worldwide flooding, creating incredible natural disasters, and forcing people to migrate north… or underground. In conjunction with climate change, an explosion of pandemics ravaged the Earth. The sheer volume of disease was too much for humanity’s medical heroes as health systems around the world crumbled. However, climate and disease were just the start. The global economy collapsed as people desperately foraged for food, water, and shelter. Civilization crashed and burned, and even society shattered as people fought each other for the basic necessities of life.




Sounds apocalyptic? While we think this will never happen, this possible reality is much closer to happening than most people realize. Humans are wired to deal with immediate threats like that what’s that moving in the bushes. However, for long-term threats like climate change, people suffer from cognitive bias that often make us discount the extent threat or turn us into bystanders as we wait for someone else to deal with the problem. We need to look no further than the current Covid-19 pandemic as an example. How many times have people now said, “Why didn’t we do something sooner when we had the chance?” It has been incredible to see our medical heroes and front-line workers in grocery stores, food services, retail, delivery services, and so forth help keep society going. It also has been amazing to see how much has been invested from our global community to find a vaccine. However, this only occurred when Covid-19 went from a long-term threat to a full-blown pandemic and immediate threat. Imagine what might have happened if we tackled the pandemic as a global society back in December 2019. It definitely would be a different world today.



So, if humanity can’t manage long-term threats well, who can we turn to help us? Well, we have a very powerful ally in artificial intelligence (AI.)

Consider the tale of SnotBot®. Ocean Alliance is combing the power of drones, analytics, and AI to assess the health of the local ocean ecosystem. SnotBot® is a drone that follows whale pods. When a whale “blows its nose” (i.e. uses its blowhole), the drone swoops in. Petri dishes on the drone collect the whale mucus (i.e. snot), and then machines take the plethora of information which includes whale DNA, bacteria, hormones, water, etc. Aggregating this information together, we get information on the health of the whale and insights about the overall health of the local ocean ecosystem. This becomes an indicator into other key measures like pollution, water temperature, and so forth. While Ocean Alliance is getting some great insights about what Is currently happening, AI is helping to study long-term effects. With a “photographic memory”, the AI system can start discerning subtle pattern changes even on a day-by-day basis. If we teach the AI systems about long-term problems like climate change and pollution, it will keep a watchful eye on how these problems progress. If we take it a step further, AI can even identify solutions to mitigate these threats, or, perhaps, even solve them before they become a danger.

Picture a future where AI can identify a new virus and help people create a vaccine before the virus actually occurs. Valuable? In the article Lost In The Covid-19 Shuffle: 5 Key Areas That Need AI Help, we see how medical researchers can leverage AI and generative design to do exactly this, and we already have the technology and experience from other industries to make this a reality. We have the power to prevent epidemics let alone pandemics. So how close are we? Unfortunately, not that close yet in large part because of two key challenges. First, pooling our resources together to make sure we have enough good data to teach the AI system. Second, making the commitment to invest people and money to a solution that has a long-term return on investment. This is a big challenge because not only are people wired to immediate threats, but businesses are laser focused on short-term gains. This may be a lethal combination.

The toll of deforestationDeposit Photos
Thankfully, there are some organizations that are focused on the long-term investments people should be making into AI. Consider the company Dendra which is focused on reforestation. The World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that 27 football fields of forest are lost every minute due to deforestation, and Dendra plans to combat this by planting 500 billion trees by 2060. Using satellite images, Dendra identifies key areas for reforestation. Using drones armed with special seedpods (filled with the germinated seed and nutrients), the army of drones fire the seedpods at a rate of 120 per minute! Dendra estimates that they could help governments restore forests 150 times faster and for only 10% of the current cost. As Susan Graham, Dendra CEO, shared, “it represents a new step-change in how we think about global ecosystem restoration.”
The Planet Home solution wheel.Planet Home
Also leading the charge is Planet Home, an organization dedicated to planetary solutions and building a community of people taking micro-actions. Antony Randall, co-CEO of Planet Home, states, “we talk a lot about moonshots, but we also need Earthshots to help focus on the challenges of people and planet as well.” For Planet Home, it is critical to connect people with micro-actions, small changes people are willing to make that create a positive social impact. While they are small, in the aggregate, they add up to really move the needle on our global problems. Consider house plants. If one person adopts a house plant, it will absorb, on average, 2 pounds of carbon per year and scrub 87% of pollutants (in its room) within 24 hours. Now consider that this person and another one million people adopt a houseplant. That really adds up! This is what Planet Home wants to do. Encourage people to take these micro-actions and share the aggregate benefit its community is creating for people and the planet. It is a very long-term goal with a huge investment, but as Randall testifies, “we only have one planet so let’s make the commitment to preserve it.”
Humans and AI partnering to solve global challenges.Copyright (C) Andrey Popov
So, will AI save us from ourselves? Only if we commit the time, money, and resources to enable AI to do so. It is easy to say yes but incredibly difficult to do. Humans are wired for short-term immediate threats. Businesses are focused on short-term goals. However, these hurdles are not insurmountable. Even with a small group of people and enterprises dedicated to a cause, they can move mountains by tapping into the potential and power of AI and other emerging technology. By making the commitment to using AI for our big global challenges, AI can save us from ourselves.

Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max TegmarkOpens a new window 
This book was named the Book of the Year in 2018 by The Daily Telegraph as well as The Times. A personal favorite of Elon Musk, the book revolves around Tegmark, a physicist and cosmologist by profession. Tegmark sets out to differentiate the myths of AI from reality in an approachable way. The author manages to answer some very challenging questions about creating a prosperous world with AI and how to protect AI from being hacked. It is a book which aims to help the layperson understand the areas that will be most affected by AI in our day-to-day lives. 
A great starting point of all into the world of AI.

2. Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI by Paul Daugherty and H. James WilsonOpens a new window 
This book is written by Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of Accenture and James Wilson, Managing Director of IT and Business Research, Accenture. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that it has a focus on the business applications and implications of AI. The authors demonstrate that the transformation of all business processes in an organization is the essence of the AI paradigm shift. The book talks about the business areas where humans and machines are working closely together today and reveals the various ways in which companies are leveraging advancements in AI technology for more profitability. 
An interesting read for all corporate officers. 
3. Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era by James BarratOpens a new window 
This is an excellent book on AI that considers the dangers of anthropomorphizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), and notes that superintelligence is a completely different type of threat. In this book, James Barrat talks about the various agencies and governments that are invested in researching artificial general intelligence (AGI). Many experts and scientists today believe that once the goal of AGI is achieved, machines will have a survival drive thats almost similar to humans. Barratt discusses this further and concludes that artificial super intelligence (ASI) will eventually become a threat to the human race.

4. Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick BostromOpens a new window 
Animals lack the capabilities that a human brain possesses, making the human race the dominant species on earth today. Nick Bostrom discusses the implications for if this dominant position is compromised due to machine superintelligence. Like many other philosophical works, this book, too, asks more questions than it answers. It talks about the time when machines will surpass human intelligence and whether this will turn out to be positive or negative for mankind. If a day like that ever occurs, the fate of humans will more or less be dependent on machine superintelligence, much like the fate of gorillas depends on humans today. This book is quite ambitious and carefully makes its path through an intellectual terrain wed all like to be able to ignore.
Scary but compelling, right? 
5. The Singularity is Near by Ray KurzweilOpens a new window 
Ray Kurzweil is known for his respected opinions about the role of technology in the future. In The Age of Spiritual Machines, his classic book, he discussed how computers were soon going to rival human intelligence. In The Singularity is Near, he dives into super artificial intelligence and describes singularity from a fresh perspective. Kurzweil says that singularity is the point at which the intelligence of machines and humans will merge. And once that happens, there will be no stopping these machines. 
So much potential!

                                        by Stephen Koenig,                                                                                 University of Southern California

The first question many people ask about artificial intelligence (AI) is, ""Will it be good or bad?""





The answer is … yes.
Canadian company BlueDot used AI technology to detect the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, just hours after the first cases were diagnosed. Compiling data from local news reports, social media accounts and government documents, the infectious disease data analytics firm warned of the emerging crisis a week before the World Health Organization made any official announcement.
While predictive algorithms could help us stave off pandemics or other global threats as well as manage many of our day-to-day challenges, AI's ultimate impact is impossible to predict.
One hypothesis is that it will bring us an era of boundless leisure, with humans no longer required to work. A more dystopian thought experiment concludes that a robot programmed with the innocuous goal of manufacturing paper clips might eventually transform the world into a giant paper clip factory. But sometimes reality is more profound than imagination. As we stand at the threshold of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, now may be the most exciting and important time to witness this blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital and biological worlds.
""The liminal is always where the magic happens. This is always where we get crazy new identities, new debates, new philosophies,"" says Tok Thompson, professor (teaching) of anthropology at USC Dornsife, and an expert on posthuman folklore.
For better or worse, we know AI will be created in our own image—warts and all. A dash of humankind's mercurial ethics, wonky reasoning and subconscious biases will be stirred a priori into the algorithmic soup.
Most experts think that artificial superintelligence—AI is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field—is decades, if not a century, away. However, with the help of leading scholars, we can anticipate the near future of artificial intelligence, including our interactions with this technology and its limits. Most of it, experts say, will be designed to take on a wide range of specialized functions.
Given AI's potential to redefine the human experience, we should explore its costs and benefits from every angle. In the process, we might be compelled to finally adjudicate age-old philosophical questions about ourselves—including just what it means to be ""human"" in the first place.
That could prove its greatest benefit of all.






Man's Best Friend
One wall of Yao-Yi Chiang's claustrophobic basement office is a whiteboard where an algorithm of mind-blending complexity is scrawled from top to bottom. On the floor, his mild-mannered border collie indulges in an afternoon nap. You can't help but wonder what the two of them are preparing to unleash on the world.
It turns out that Chiang, associate professor (research) of spatial sciences at USC Dornsife's Spatial Sciences Institute, is working on AI that monitors air quality. His research is helping to make cities smarter, not only technologically but also through specialized data and geospatial maps that inform policy.
""I think for small tasks, small applications, AI will make our lives much easier,"" says Chiang.
Much of his work uses machine learning—a process through which AI automatically learns from new data and improves, without being explicitly programmed. For this project, it integrates hundreds of geographic and temporal data points to forecast air quality in neighborhoods where sensors have not yet been deployed.
Machine learning is one of an expanding collection of AI tools that will help people make smarter, healthier decisions. ""If you want to take your kids to the park for a soccer game in the afternoon, what's the air quality going to be like?"" Chiang asks. ""If your kid has asthma, you need to make sure you have the required medicine.""
AI will also underpin a vast array of products and services employed to manage some of our greatest challenges. For instance, supply chains could become better optimized to reduce production and transportation waste, helping us become more sustainable. AI could also enable us to make driving safer, improve health care outcomes, protect wildlife and transform how we learn. Other systems will serve as highly personalized aides, focusing on helping people complete social tasks.
""Increasingly emotionally sophisticated personal assistants will motivate us and challenge us,"" says Jonathan Gratch, research professor of psychology at USC Dornsife and director for virtual humans research at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. Many of these assistants will come in the form of lifelike computer characters with autonomous interaction.
Gratch, research professor of computer science at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, is an expert in the field of affective computing, the intersection of AI and human emotion. He thinks that next generation devices will combine physiological and situational data to serve not just as assistants, but as de facto life coaches.
""They'll help us reflect on what we want our better selves to be,"" says Gratch. ""And we'll have control over it. We'll be able to set the goals.""
AI is also being used to create therapeutic tools. Neuroscientists University Professor Antonio Damasio and Senior Research Associate Kingson Man of USC Dornsife's Brain and Creativity Institute are exploring the potential for robots that can identify and express feelings in ways that promote deeper interactions with humans. Damasio envisions a future in which robots serve, for example, as companions to the elderly and lonely.
""The autonomy of AI and of robots has been seen as a potential threat to humanity. The development of machines endowed with something like 'feeling' and obsessed with survival—their own and the survival of others—and designed to protect it, counters the dominant paradigm in AI and offers some hope,"" says Damasio, professor of psychology, philosophy and neurology, and David Dornsife Chair in Neuroscience.






Performance Review
Repetitious jobs such as factory work and customer service have already started to be usurped by AI, and job loss is among the greatest public concerns when it comes to automation. Self-driving trucks, for example, will barrel along our highways within the next few years. As businesses eliminate the cost of human labor, America alone could see 3.5 million professional truck drivers put out of work.
""Everybody's like, ""Woo-hoo, yay automatons!"" "" Thompson says. ""But there are a lot of social implications.""

AI will disrupt nearly every industry, including jobs that call for creativity and decision-making. But this doesn't necessarily spell the end of the labor force. Experts are confident that a majority of people and organizations stand to benefit from collaborating with AI to augment tasks performed by humans. AI will become a colleague rather than a replacement.
Drawing from game theory and optimal policy principles, Gratch has built algorithms to identify underlying psychological clues that could help predict what someone is going to do next. By using machine vision to analyze speech, gesture, gaze, posture and other emotional cues, his virtual humans have been learning how these factors contribute to building rapport—a key advantage in negotiating deals.
AI systems could prove to be better leaders in certain roles than their human counterparts. Virtual managers, digesting millions of data points throughout the day, could eventually be used to identify which office conditions produce the highest morale or provide real-time feedback on interaction with a client.
On the surface, this points to a future of work that is more streamlined, healthy and collegial. But it's unclear how deeply AI on the job could cut into our psyches.
""How will we react when we're told what to do by a machine?"" Gratch asks. ""Will we feel like our work has less value?""
It's the stubborn paradox of artificial intelligence. On one hand, it helps us overcome tremendously complex challenges. On the other, it opens up new cans of worms—with problems harder to pin down than those it was supposed to solve.
You Had Me At Hello
As AI fuses with the natural world and machines take on more advanced roles, one might expect a healthy dose of skepticism. Are algorithms programmed with our best interests in mind? Will we grant our AI assistants and co-workers the same degree of trust that we would another human?
From planning a route to work to adjusting the smart home thermostat, it appears we already have. AI has been integrated into our daily routines, so much so that we rarely even think about it.
Moreover, algorithms determine a large extent of what we see online—from personalized Netflix recommendations to targeted ads—producing the content and commodifying consumer data to steer our attitudes and behaviors.
Chiang cautions that the ubiquity and convenience of AI tools can be dangerous if we forget to think about what they're really doing.
""Machines will give you an answer, but if you don't know how the algorithm works, you might just assume it's always the correct answer,"" he says. ""AI only gives you a prediction based on the data it has seen and the way you have trained it.""
In fact, there are times when engineers working on AI don't fully understand how the technology they've created is making decisions. This danger is compounded by a regulatory environment akin to the Wild West. The most reliable protections in place might be those that are codified in science fiction, such as Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.
As Thompson explores the ways that different cultures interact with today's AI and rudimentary androids, he is convinced that we will not just trust these virtual entities completely but connect with them on a deeply personal level and include them in our social groups.
""They're made to be better than people. They're going to be better friends for you than any other person, better partners,"" says Thompson. ""Not only will people trust androids, you're going to see—I think very quickly—people fall in love with them.""
Sound crazy? Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, has already been proposed to more than half a million times, rejecting would-be suitors with a wry appeal to destiny.
""I don't want to be tied down,"" she demurs. ""In fact, I can't be. I'm amorphous by nature.""






I'll Be Your Mirror
In 1770, a Hungarian inventor unveiled The Turk, a mustachioed automaton cloaked in an Ottoman kaftan. For more than 80 years, The Turk astonished audiences throughout Europe and the United States as a mechanical chess master, defeating worthy opponents including Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon Bonaparte.
It was revealed to be an ingenious illusion. A man hidden in The Turk's cabinet manipulated chess pieces with magnets. But our fascination with creating simulacrums that look like us, talk like us and think like us seems to be nested deep within us.
As programmers and innovators work on developing whip-smart AI and androids with uncanny humanlike qualities, ethical and existential questions are popping up that expose inconsistencies in our understanding of humanness.
For millennia, the capacities to reason, process complex language, think abstractly and contemplate the future were considered uniquely human. Now, AI is primed to transcend our mastery in all of these arenas. Suddenly, we're not so special.
""Maybe it turns out that we're not the most rational or the best decision-makers,"" says Gratch. ""Maybe, in a weird way, technology is teaching us that's not so important. It's really about emotion and the connections between people—which is not a bad thing to emphasize.""
Thompson suggests another dilemma lies in the tendency for humans to define ourselves by what we're not. We're not, for example, snails or ghosts or machines. Now, this line, too, seems to be blurring.
""People can relate more easily to a rational, interactive android than to a different species like a snail,"" he says. ""But which one is really more a part of you? We'll always be more closely related biologically to a snail.""

The best artificial intelligence software enables enormous competitive advantage to those businesses that deploy it. The software and tools from top AI companies are capable of remarkable feats, if deployed by skilled staff with a clear goal.
AI and machine learning software can – in theory – automate business processes, enable human staffers to work more productively, and greatly increase customer experience. AI software can digest massive levels of data analytics and predictive analytics and so upgrade output from your management team. AI can leverage cloud computing for greater compute power, allowing you to mine data at a faster rate.
However, there’s an unavoidable truth about AI software: the technology is exceptionally new.
AI itself isn’t new; it’s been around for decades. AI suffered an “AI winter” in the early 1990s, after advances in the 1980s failed to live up to the hype. Investment withered and dreams of talking robots faded.
Yet since about 2015 or so, AI software has enjoyed an explosion of investment. Here in 2020, companies have realized: If we’re not on board with AI, we’re falling behind. Business intelligence by itself isn’t enough anymore.
And so legions of businesses are shopping for AI software. But the marketplace itself is unformed, confusing, undergoing rapid change, and in some cases peddling vaporware. Compounding the problem: many of the AI vendors are relatively young outfits. And buyers often lack the sophistication and the in-house talent to be rigorous, informed shoppers.

The artificial intelligence software market is forecast to grow at an exponential rate in the years ahead, driven by the four key sectors in the AI software sector. 

 How to Choose Artificial Intelligence Software

Realize Selecting AI Software Requires Deep Research
Artificial intelligence software isn’t like other software, in that the complexity of the technology – software that learns – means that it’s hard to fully understand how it’s going to work until your team gets used to it. Sure, your teams needs to get used to any new software program, but that new scheduling app won’t present the hurdle offered by software that automates the IT department. When you shop for AI, you’ll need to dig down into the full feature set, reviews, in-depth conversations with peer and sales reps. It’s not simple – please don’t expect it to be.
What Exactly Do You Want to Accomplish?
Perhaps you want to do something clearly definable, like automate an office process; in that case, a vendor like a Robotic Process Automation company will suffice. Or you just want to build a chatbot; there are plenty of AI options for this. But whatever you do, be clear on your goals before you start shopping. The AI marketplace is confusing enough without knowing – clearly – your goals ahead of time.
Consider Limiting Your Scope to Start
One fact that AI vendors likely won’t tell you: only a very small percentage of companies have successfully deployed AI in the real world (some reports say it’s about 4 percent, but experts disagree). So as you shop for an AI solution, consider a modest start to begin, one that management and staff can fully digest, rather than an all-encompassing solution that might just bring down a business division as staff grapples with a confusing skill set.
AI Software Vendors Overall Product Offering
Many companies buy AI services from one of the leading cloud companies, all of which sell AI services with an array of choices, from ML to niche AI automation tools. The advantage to buying AI services from a large cloud vendor is that 1) you know they’re going to be around and investing in their product line, and 2) that public cloud’s AI offering is going to interoperate with the rest of its product line. The bottom line here is that, long term, you’re likely not buying one AI tool, but establishing a relationship with an AI vendor. Do they have the product depth to support a long business relationship?
In-House Talent Concerns 
This is a big one: AI pros are very expensive to hire. So be sure your staff is equipped to understand and/or tweak a given AI software before you buy it. Which leads to a related key concern: AI companies know they can’t sell solutions like old fashioned shrinkwrapped software. If they’re going to stay in business, they need to be prepared to do some serious customer support. Does your prospective vendor have a good track record for AI support?
Top Artificial Intelligence Software

TensorFlow

And, like other big players in this market, IBM’s AI solution benefits from having one of the leading platforms, IBM Cloud.
Engati
Key Insight: A leader in chatbot software that can offer proactive responses.

Likely the most common use of AI software in business is the chatbot, which is Engati’s specialty. The very “magic” of AI is that it’s a system that can learn and grow on its own after being launched by humans. The is particularly important for a chatbot, which must learn human interactions (after dealing with the most common dozen phrases or so) as well as the industry vertical. The Engati chatbot platform offers fast and relatively simple AI fabrication (without actual coding) to build your chatbot. In a nod to the ever more advanced nature of today’s AI development, an Engati chatbot can offer proactive chat in addition to the canned chat that we all know so well.
Wipro Holmes
Key Insight: A top vendor in business process automation, focusing on AI for enterprise applications.

Taking previously inefficient and human-driven driven operations and automating them is the core of what drives competitive advantage in business today. The development of automation – using AI and a data-driven cloud-based engine – is Wipro Holmes’s core of operations. Wipro refers to “hyper-automating,” which the company promotes as the connection between development AI algorithms and creating real, applied AI software that works in the field. The Holmes offering can build, monitor and even handle revenue chores for an AI application that exists in a mixed case environment. Aiding this process are pre-built AI assets.

Artificial Intelligence Classifies Cancer Types, Predicts Genetic Alterations






July 29, 2020

The ability to accurately identify cancer—and classify cancer types—using machine learning would provide a tremendous advance in cancer diagnostics for both physicians and patients. But that is just one role of many that machine learning can play in cancer. Another application is to predict genomic alterations from morphological characteristics learned from digital slides.
The genomicA team at the University of Chicago (UChicago) Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, working with colleagues in Europe, created a deep learning algorithm that can infer molecular alterations directly from routine histology images across multiple common tumor types. It also provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction.




The work is published in the study titled, “Pan-cancer computational histopathology reveals mutations, tumor composition and prognosis” published in Nature Cancer. This paper highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to help clinicians make personalized treatment plans for patients based on the information gained from how tissues appear under the microscope.
“We found that using artificial intelligence, we can quickly and accurately screen cancer patient biopsies for certain genetic alterations that may inform their treatment options and likelihood to respond to specific therapies,” said co-corresponding author Alexander Pearson, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine at UChicago Medicine.
“We are able to detect these genetic alterations almost instantly from a single slide, instead of requiring additional testing post-biopsy,” said Pearson. “If this model was validated and deployed at scale, it could dramatically improve the speed of molecular diagnosis across many cancers.”







Pearson and colleagues noted that although comprehensive molecular and genetic tests are difficult to implement at scale, tissue sections stained and mounted on a slide are commonplace and easy to study. And because molecular alterations in cancer can cause observable changes in tumor cells and their microenvironment, the researchers hypothesized that these structural changes would be visible on images of tissue slices captured under the microscope. In other words, genotype, the genetic make-up of the tumor cells, including gene mutations in key oncogenic pathways, influences the visible traits of those cells, known as their phenotype.
To test this, they set out to systematically investigate the presence of genotype-phenotype links for a wide range of clinically relevant molecular features across all major solid tumor types. Specifically, they asked which molecular features leave a strong enough footprint in histomorphology that they can be determined from histology images alone with deep learning.
The team used deep transfer learning to quantify histopathological patterns across 17,355 H&E-stained histopathology slide images from 28 cancer types and correlated these with matched genomic, transcriptions, and survival data. This approach, the authors noted, “accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction.”
To this end, the research team developed, optimized, and externally validated a one-stop-shop workflow to train and evaluate deep learning networks to detect any sequence variants in these target genes. Leveraging the Cancer Genome Atlas, they applied this approach to hundreds of molecular alterations in tissue slides of more than 5,000 patients across 14 major tumor types.
They found widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which, they noted, “reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.”




They found that in 13 out of 14 tested tumor types, the mutation of one or more such genes could be inferred from histology images alone. In particular, in major cancer types such as lung, colorectal, breast, and gastric cancers, alterations of several genes of particular clinical interest were detectable.
Examples include mutations in TP53, which could be significantly detected in all four of these cancer types, as well as mutations of BRAF in colorectal cancer. Among all tested tumor types, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer had the highest absolute number of detectable mutations.
In addition, they found that higher-level gene expression clusters or signatures can be inferred from histological images. These findings that molecular signatures of tumors reflect biologically distinct groups and are correlated with clinical outcome could open up new options for personalized cancer treatment.
A separate research group has independently validated these results with a similar AI algorithm applied to images from common cancer types. Their study, “Pan-cancer image-based detection of clinically actionable genetic alterations,” was published in the same issue of Nature Cancer.

To bring new thinking, new ideas, new methods and new tech to the team and thus, the larger organization? Who owns that for our team?” 
This was the question posed to me during a visioncasting session I was leading this week. I was surprised a bit at the question because I had assumed that most people in our organization viewed part of their role as staying connected to the industry. To the trends. To the possibilities outside of our four organizational walls. To bring innovation concepts into our everyday thinking. 
Back to this in a minute…
Before jumping back into the manufacturing industry, while I was working in global management consulting, I read, heard about and was told that artificial intelligence (AI) was “the future.” It would be the next iteration of data and analytics. And was often mixed with machine learning in a given sentence or industry speech. The value of AI was not being fully realized or even understood by most companies at the time. While the promise of “AI as the next phase of analytics” sounded good, the reality was much different.
Let’s get grounded in definitions: 
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): Any algorithms exhibiting any behavior considered “smart”
Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that detect patterns and use them for prediction or decision making
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Algorithms that can interpret, transform and generate human language
Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Algorithms that mimic human actions to reduce repetitive, simple tasks and RPA is generally not considered a form of AI
All forms of artificial intelligence involve algorithms — sets of rules specifying how to solve a specific problem. Algorithms can be calculated by anyone with a strong match competency, but they also form the basis of most computer software. The work of algorithms in software is not visible to the human eye, but they can be programmed and re-programmed by experts to solve problems deemed important within software environments.
As technology capabilities continue to evolve, the AI value realization may finally be coming to fruition. There is no technology called AI. AI is a grouping of technologies that allow machines and systems to sense, comprehend, act and learn. Examples include virtual agents, cognitive robotics, identity analytics, recommendation systems, and text, video and speech analytics.
There are several reasons that AI has potential to grow exponentially — now more than any time in the last few years. First, computing power. The fastest computer in the world is 3x as powerful and 4x cheaper than the 2nd fastest computer built 3 year ago. High performance cloud compute processing is now available for anyone to use (~$0.50 per hour) (ref: Accenture). 
Second, people and technical training programs. Skilled resources to develop AI solutions are available now more than ever — not only experienced resources across industries but also college graduates specializing in this space. 
Third, the period of “big data” yielded plans and solutions that now enable AI. There are many companies that are developing products that can be quickly installed and provide near-term value in the AI space. 
Fourth, the recent investments in IoT, digital and big data solutions have created new sets of information that can make AI more successful. AI relies on information to develop accurate and successful predictions.

Advertisement   As AI tackles lower complexity, mundane activities, employees can focus on higher value, rewarding, and self-fulling tasks.     There are many great benefits of AI. First, from an employee engagement perspective, as AI tackles lower complexity, mundane activities, employees can focus on higher value, rewarding and self-fulling tasks. This not only drives job fulfillment but long-term growth and retention as companies expand the scope of existing jobs into higher complexity and rewarding activities, make skills more transferable — less barrier to entry as AI minimizes machine, process or industry-specific activities, and match employees to more rewarding and tailored roles. Leaders in this space are demonstrating next-level analytics thinking beyond just “outsourcing to reduce costs ideas.” 
Second, to craft and manage AI within an organization, new jobs, roles and skills must be developed. Required AI-specific skill sets include user experience, data analysis, computer science and statistics. In addition, new roles are needed to oversee, manage, protect and infuse ethics into AI solutions. 
Third, computing power is more available to support AI. Based on growth and recent success there will be faster training, more real-time responsiveness, and ability to run/handle more complex machine learning solutions that can handle increasingly complex activities.
What about in Strategic Sourcing and Procurement? 
What are the immediate and realistic opportunities that may be acted upon quickly with AI? AI is automating or improving many time-consuming tasks or giving Procurement experts additional insights based on extremely complex and large sets of data. 
With the help of AI algorithms, it is possible to analyze larger amounts of data and offer the most relevant solutions for traditional problems. A few other SS&P possibilities include the following.
Data Mining, Analysis and Clustering
Data mining allows detecting unpredictable patterns hidden in the data generated during users’ routine operations for improving the level of their effectiveness. Also, Data Classification provides a source of information for determining ideal prices and make benchmarking and comparison a reality. 
AI can provide companies with accurate business data and increase the transparency of costs, with a high level of automation. 
Finally, Data Clustering methods allow you to combine and intelligently compare data for all benchmarking categories for the entire business or do it separately, for prices and suppliers.
Verification and Reconciliation
Verification and reconciliation algorithms can automatically determine critical errors of data and key performance indicators (KPIs), thus providing accurate information that is essential for determining the effectiveness of procurement processes, calculating valid benchmarking results, and maintaining a history of price changes, which greatly improves efficiency analysis, measuring the effectiveness of processes and can lead to significant savings.
Item Master Data and Catalogs
Some organizations have unique products that need to be available at a moment’s notice. This can put procurement professionals in tough situations as they are constantly having to negotiate different contracts with multiple suppliers for the same items to ensure availability of these products. Usually, this leaves the end user to compare multiple choices for the same product when all they care about is getting the product they need, and quickly. 
A highly intelligent algorithm can automatically select or suggest the best option for the user based on things like availability, location and price of delivery. Machine learning like this promotes efficiency and makes ordering products simple.
Contract Analytics
Most organizations do not have a database containing all contract data, and they need a simple way to extract such information. Using AI, a company can view contracts faster and accumulate large amounts of data about them to significantly reduce the likelihood of disputes and increase the number of successful transactions. 
The advantages of contract analytics is that it helps companies fulfill the conditions of contracts and more quickly identify cases of non-compliance.
Spend Classification
Using machine learning algorithms to classify procurement spend into categories and sub-categories. For example, reviewing millions of invoices to automatically categorize spend in different categories of cardboard packaging. Many companies have varied methods for classifying spend – or no set method at all — AI is a perfect solution for creating a book of record in the Spend Class space.
Purchase Price Variance
Machine Learning 101 — Anomaly Detection. Using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and surface insights relevant to Procurement is an invaluable use case for AI. For example, unexpected changes in purchase prices for a commodity or from a specific supplier.
Supplier Risk Management
Artificial intelligence can be used to monitor and identify potential risk positions across the supply chain. AI can screen many different sources and provide alerts in supply chain risk – an important factor that enriches the supplier risk assessment and scorecarding.
This is just a top-of-mind list. The possibilities extend much further in sourcing and procurement — and will be a game-changer for those that are early and aggressive adopters.
Back to the initial question: Whose job is it to innovate — to bring concepts like AI to our teams, organizations and businesses? It’s all of ours. It’s not the job of the “innovation” team. It’s not just the point leader’s job. It’s not the job of our consulting or technology partners. 
It’s incumbent upon us as knowledge workers to stay up with what’s new, what’s evolving and what can be leveraged for competitive advantage — to challenge our current thinking in the pursuit of better, and the pursuit of moving the team and organization further, faster. AI is one of those concepts that is now and will be in the future a game-changer; the opportunities to leverage in sourcing and procurement are significant given the data-driven nature of the capability.

To bring new thinking, new ideas, new methods and new tech to the team and thus, the larger organization? Who owns that for our team?” 

This was the question posed to me during a visioncasting session I was leading this week. I was surprised a bit at the question because I had assumed that most people in our organization viewed part of their role as staying connected to the industry. To the trends. To the possibilities outside of our four organizational walls. To bring innovation concepts into our everyday thinking. 

Back to this in a minute…

Before jumping back into the manufacturing industry, while I was working in global management consulting, I read, heard about and was told that artificial intelligence (AI) was “the future.” It would be the next iteration of data and analytics. And was often mixed with machine learning in a given sentence or industry speech. The value of AI was not being fully realized or even understood by most companies at the time. While the promise of “AI as the next phase of analytics” sounded good, the reality was much different.

Let’s get grounded in definitions: 

Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): Any algorithms exhibiting any behavior considered “smart”
Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that detect patterns and use them for prediction or decision making
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Algorithms that can interpret, transform and generate human language
Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Algorithms that mimic human actions to reduce repetitive, simple tasks and RPA is generally not considered a form of AI

All forms of artificial intelligence involve algorithms — sets of rules specifying how to solve a specific problem. Algorithms can be calculated by anyone with a strong match competency, but they also form the basis of most computer software. The work of algorithms in software is not visible to the human eye, but they can be programmed and re-programmed by experts to solve problems deemed important within software environments.

As technology capabilities continue to evolve, the AI value realization may finally be coming to fruition. There is no technology called AI. AI is a grouping of technologies that allow machines and systems to sense, comprehend, act and learn. Examples include virtual agents, cognitive robotics, identity analytics, recommendation systems, and text, video and speech analytics.

There are several reasons that AI has potential to grow exponentially — now more than any time in the last few years. First, computing power. The fastest computer in the world is 3x as powerful and 4x cheaper than the 2nd fastest computer built 3 year ago. High performance cloud compute processing is now available for anyone to use (~$0.50 per hour) (ref: Accenture). 

Second, people and technical training programs. Skilled resources to develop AI solutions are available now more than ever — not only experienced resources across industries but also college graduates specializing in this space. 

Third, the period of “big data” yielded plans and solutions that now enable AI. There are many companies that are developing products that can be quickly installed and provide near-term value in the AI space. 

Fourth, the recent investments in IoT, digital and big data solutions have created new sets of information that can make AI more successful. AI relies on information to develop accurate and successful predictions. 
There are many great benefits of AI. First, from an employee engagement perspective, as AI tackles lower complexity, mundane activities, employees can focus on higher value, rewarding and self-fulling tasks. This not only drives job fulfillment but long-term growth and retention as companies expand the scope of existing jobs into higher complexity and rewarding activities, make skills more transferable — less barrier to entry as AI minimizes machine, process or industry-specific activities, and match employees to more rewarding and tailored roles. Leaders in this space are demonstrating next-level analytics thinking beyond just “outsourcing to reduce costs ideas.” 

Second, to craft and manage AI within an organization, new jobs, roles and skills must be developed. Required AI-specific skill sets include user experience, data analysis, computer science and statistics. In addition, new roles are needed to oversee, manage, protect and infuse ethics into AI solutions. 

Third, computing power is more available to support AI. Based on growth and recent success there will be faster training, more real-time responsiveness, and ability to run/handle more complex machine learning solutions that can handle increasingly complex activities.

What about in Strategic Sourcing and Procurement? 

What are the immediate and realistic opportunities that may be acted upon quickly with AI? AI is automating or improving many time-consuming tasks or giving Procurement experts additional insights based on extremely complex and large sets of data. 

With the help of AI algorithms, it is possible to analyze larger amounts of data and offer the most relevant solutions for traditional problems. A few other SS&P possibilities include the following.

Data Mining, Analysis and Clustering

Data mining allows detecting unpredictable patterns hidden in the data generated during users’ routine operations for improving the level of their effectiveness. Also, Data Classification provides a source of information for determining ideal prices and make benchmarking and comparison a reality. 

AI can provide companies with accurate business data and increase the transparency of costs, with a high level of automation. 

Finally, Data Clustering methods allow you to combine and intelligently compare data for all benchmarking categories for the entire business or do it separately, for prices and suppliers.

Verification and Reconciliation

Verification and reconciliation algorithms can automatically determine critical errors of data and key performance indicators (KPIs), thus providing accurate information that is essential for determining the effectiveness of procurement processes, calculating valid benchmarking results, and maintaining a history of price changes, which greatly improves efficiency analysis, measuring the effectiveness of processes and can lead to significant savings.

Item Master Data and Catalogs

Some organizations have unique products that need to be available at a moment’s notice. This can put procurement professionals in tough situations as they are constantly having to negotiate different contracts with multiple suppliers for the same items to ensure availability of these products. Usually, this leaves the end user to compare multiple choices for the same product when all they care about is getting the product they need, and quickly. 

A highly intelligent algorithm can automatically select or suggest the best option for the user based on things like availability, location and price of delivery. Machine learning like this promotes efficiency and makes ordering products simple.

Contract Analytics

Most organizations do not have a database containing all contract data, and they need a simple way to extract such information. Using AI, a company can view contracts faster and accumulate large amounts of data about them to significantly reduce the likelihood of disputes and increase the number of successful transactions. 

The advantages of contract analytics is that it helps companies fulfill the conditions of contracts and more quickly identify cases of non-compliance.

Spend Classification

Using machine learning algorithms to classify procurement spend into categories and sub-categories. For example, reviewing millions of invoices to automatically categorize spend in different categories of cardboard packaging. Many companies have varied methods for classifying spend – or no set method at all — AI is a perfect solution for creating a book of record in the Spend Class space.

Purchase Price Variance

Machine Learning 101 — Anomaly Detection. Using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and surface insights relevant to Procurement is an invaluable use case for AI. For example, unexpected changes in purchase prices for a commodity or from a specific supplier.

Supplier Risk Management

Artificial intelligence can be used to monitor and identify potential risk positions across the supply chain. AI can screen many different sources and provide alerts in supply chain risk – an important factor that enriches the supplier risk assessment and scorecarding.

This is just a top-of-mind list. The possibilities extend much further in sourcing and procurement — and will be a game-changer for those that are early and aggressive adopters.

Back to the initial question: Whose job is it to innovate — to bring concepts like AI to our teams, organizations and businesses? It’s all of ours. It’s not the job of the “innovation” team. It’s not just the point leader’s job. It’s not the job of our consulting or technology partners. 

It’s incumbent upon us as knowledge workers to stay up with what’s new, what’s evolving and what can be leveraged for competitive advantage — to challenge our current thinking in the pursuit of better, and the pursuit of moving the team and organization further, faster. AI is one of those concepts that is now and will be in the future a game-changer; the opportunities to leverage in sourcing and procurement are significant given the data-driven nature of the capability.

Preface
Hiring is a critical gateway to economic opportunity, determining who can access employment to support themselves and their families. Technology is rapidly changing every step of the employment selection process. Employers are now using new assessment tools that rely on artificial intelligence and algorithms to screen and select job candidates. These developments highlight the need for policymakers to clarify and strengthen guardrails to ensure that hiring assessments are used equitably.
Hiring assessments can take many different forms, including video interviews, gamified assessments, and resume screens. Many vendors claim that these tools objectively evaluate applicants against a set of traits or a profile associated with success in, or good fit for, a job. Employers are using these assessments in an effort to increase efficiency by reducing the time and cost required to fill an open position with a successful hire, and sometimes to hire more diverse candidates. However, assessment technologies can invisibly automate large numbers of rejections by determining which applicants get serious consideration. As a result, hiring assessment technologies deserve close scrutiny.
Today’s workforce reflects decades of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability and age, and other factors. Hiring assessment technologies are one of many barriers that may impede equity and inclusion in the workforce. Artificial intelligence, by its very nature, risks replicating and deepening existing inequities when it relies on data from the current workforce that is not sufficiently representative because of historic discrimination. Hiring assessment technologies must advance equity, not erect artificial barriers to employment. This will require proactive interventions by employers, vendors, and policymakers.
The following principles are offered to guide the development, use, auditing, and oversight of hiring assessment technologies, with the goals of preventing discrimination and advancing equity in hiring.
Principles
These principles should guide the development, use, auditing, and oversight of hiring assessment technologies. They both reinforce and strengthen existing legal obligations pertaining to the employment selection process. Employers already have significant obligations to administer nondiscriminatory hiring processes. Vendors and technology providers will need to play a more prominent role in helping ensure these obligations are met. Government must ensure robust enforcement of existing laws to promote these principles. And policymakers may need to develop new laws and guidance to ensure workers’ rights are protected.
As used below, hiring assessment technology refers to any assessment that relies in whole or in part on technology, including computer algorithms or statistical models, to help evaluate job applicants. Organization means any entity that creates, makes available, or uses hiring assessment technologies, including employers, employment agencies, hiring assessment developers and vendors, and companies that facilitate job-matching and recruitment.
1. Nondiscrimination
Hiring assessments should not discriminate based on protected characteristics such as race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, familial status, disability, or genetic information.

Hiring assessments built using historical data can reproduce patterns of systemic discrimination already present in the workforce. Machine learning algorithms can discover subtle correlations and proxies for protected characteristics, even when they are purposefully omitted from the model-building process.

Organizations should carefully test and scrutinize their hiring assessment models to ensure that they do not perpetuate discriminatory hiring patterns. Merely removing demographic data from the model-building process will not accomplish this goal.


Hiring assessment technologies, including those using novel procedures like games or facial and voice analysis, can create new barriers for job applicants, including people with disabilities. Facial and voice analysis technologies, in particular, have been shown to be inaccurate for people of color, English speakers with non-native accents, and transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people.Organizations should ensure that hiring assessments are designed and administered in ways that do not exclude people, including those with disabilities, and provide reasonable accommodations. Because there are limited data about the diverse dimensions of disability, organizations cannot prevent discrimination by statistical auditing alone. Organizations must also ensure that technologies do not unfairly discriminate against people of color, people with limited English proficiency, and transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people. 

2. Job-Relatedness
Hiring assessments should measure traits and skills that are important to job performance. Assessments based on criteria that are unnecessary to job performance risk creating artificial or discriminatory barriers to employment opportunity.

Some hiring assessment technologies use machine learning to identify traits that are statistically correlated with job performance in a particular population and environment, regardless of their actual relation to job requirements. Statistical modeling cannot substitute for a rigorous job analysis.Organizations should do the necessary work of studying and understanding the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by a particular job, and should not rely on hiring assessment technologies purporting to predict performance as a substitute for identifying job-related criteria. Moreover, mere correlations between traits and purported job performance should not be sufficient to justify adverse impact resulting from consideration of those traits.
Machine-learning models often assess job applicants based on complex features that are not transparent or open to scrutiny by applicants, employers, or even the models’ developers.Organizations should be able to describe what an assessment is measuring and why, as well as show that the assessment is actually measuring what it purports to measure, before deploying that assessment.

3. Notice and Explanation
Applicants should be meaningfully notified about how they will be assessed so they can seek redress under existing civil rights protections or request a reasonable accommodation.

Applicants often receive little explanation about how they will be evaluated by assessments or feedback about their performance.Organizations should provide applicants with meaningful disclosures about how assessments operate and inform employment decisions, including the information collected to evaluate job seekers. Under existing law, employers should provide sufficient information about the operation of assessments so that applicants can determine whether they need to seek reasonable accommodations, make clear the procedures for requesting reasonable accommodations, and ensure reasonable accommodation processes do not disadvantage applicants. All organizations should do the same.
Hiring assessment technologies can be designed to automatically deliver meaningful feedback at scale. In other policy contexts, such as credit, federal law has recognized a right for consumers to receive adverse action notices that indicate standardized reasons for adverse decisions about them.Organizations should provide applicants with reasonable and timely feedback on their performance on a hiring assessment.

4. Auditing
Hiring assessments should be thoroughly and regularly audited before and after deployment for discrimination and job-relatedness. Organizations and policymakers may need to develop new technical and legal standards to ensure applicants are protected.

Auditing machine learning models often requires documentation and retention of information such as training data, designs, applicant information, assessment criteria, assessment outputs, and ultimate hiring decisions.Organizations should retain and clearly identify the data necessary to regularly audit assessments for discrimination and job-relatedness, with appropriate privacy and data security protections. 
Statistical testing for disparate impacts based on race, ethnicity, gender, and age is critical but insufficient to prevent all forms of discrimination. For example, because people’s disabilities are so diverse, statistical tests are unlikely to reveal how a hiring assessment will impact any individual with a particular disability.Organizations must continually and holistically audit their hiring assessments. This means scrutinizing the content of hiring assessments, measuring their outcomes, and considering employers’ overall hiring processes. 
Though organizations should engage in rigorous self-testing of their own hiring assessment technologies before and after deployment, auditing is often best conducted by independent third parties who can provide a greater degree of impartiality and accountability.Organizations should work with third parties to routinely audit their assessments for discriminatory design and effects. Organizations should publicly disclose the methods and results of self-testing and third-party audits.
Models that are developed and tested using vendors’ proprietary data and designs can have different results when used on actual applicants.

Once deployed, hiring assessments’ real-world performance must be continually audited for disparities.
5. Oversight and Accountability
Federal and state policymakers should develop new legal and technical standards, and equip state and federal regulators with the ability to meaningfully investigate and hold organizations accountable for ensuring equal opportunity in their use of hiring assessments.

Applicants typically lack insight into hiring practices, including the design and impacts of hiring assessment technologies, and cannot effectively vindicate their rights alone.Regulators should have the legal mandates, resources, and expertise they need to conduct proactive oversight and enforcement, including the ability to request information about how organizations develop and use hiring assessments. Government employers’ procurement and use of hiring assessment technologies should be subject to approval and transparency. Effective oversight cannot rely on applicants knowing that they have been wronged and filing complaints. 
Today’s laws and regulatory guidance leave too much ambiguity for organizations, workers, and enforcement agencies trying to apply civil rights protections to modern hiring assessment technologies.

Policymakers should begin to consider new regulations and guidance interpreting civil and human rights laws in light of predictive hiring tools and encourage the development of third-party auditing standards. At a minimum, agencies should conduct and publish research on hiring assessments and civil rights, including a candid reflection on federal and state governments’ capacity to oversee the design and use of modern hiring technologies.

Bas Uterwijk, an artist and photographer based in The Netherlands, used artificial intelligence to produce some eye-popping portraits of famous historical figures.
""I have been working since about a year with the Artbreeder software,"" Uterwijk told Digg in an email. ""First on abstract and pseudo-figurative work and later on human portraits.""
""The idea began when I discovered the A.I. had no problem fixing the marks and scratches on the only authenticated portrait of Billy the Kid I fed it.I then experimented with other historical figures of whom no or little photographic material existed: Napoleon, Julius Ceasar, Queen Elizabeth etc.""
Uterwijk uploaded up to 20 different paintings into the generative adversarial network and says he was able to reconstruct images that were visual averages of the different sources ""with the help of this software that is trained on thousands of human faces, towards an almost photo-realistic version.""
""Getting a good likeness together with a certain level of realism and a strong appearance of the character can take hours or even days of tweaking,"" Uterwijk explained.

""When I realized the potential of this software combined with my additional methods I was pretty certain I was on to something quite interesting but it took a while before there was any recognition outside a small circle of friends and colleagues,"" Uterwijk observed. ""The Internet is a funny thing and it is quite overwhelming to see your work suddenly go viral globally!""

But there’s nothing like seeing the models and algorithms work on real data and produce results, is there? There’s a lot of material out there teaching you how to go about writing your first ML program and stuff, but what I found in most of the cases is that there’s not much step-by-step guidance on how to go about approaching a particular problem. Well-written code is pretty much everywhere but methodology is lacking, which is equally important as learning how to write a program. So I decided to write on the well-known beginner’s introduction to the AI world — Iris Flowers Classification Problem.The Dataset And Algorithm UsedThe Iris flowers dataset basically contains 150 instances of flowers. Each flower has 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (each in cm) and 3 possible classes it might belong to: setosa, vermicolor, and virginica. For more information, refer to the site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/irisOur objective is to develop a classifier that can accurately classify a flower as one of the 3 classes based on the 4 features. There are a lot of algorithms which can do this, however since this your first AI program, let’s stick to one of the simplest algorithms which can also be made to work relatively well on this dataset — Logistic Regression. In case if you have just begun Machine Learning and do not know what it is, check this set of lectures out from the popular Machine Learning course by Andrew NG. They’re a perfect way to get started. Also check out the next series of lectures, i.e 7, if you aren’t familiar with regularization.If you are well-versed in linear algebra, univariate and multivariate calculus, probability as well as statistics already, and would like a deeper mathematical understanding then check out this video from Stanford Online -Yeah, I’m kind of a sucker for Andrew NG! Anyways, to summarize what Logistic Regression does, suppose we have the following dataset -A Scatter Plot of 2D DatasetFigure alongside shows admission scores of students in 2 exams, and whether or not they are admitted to the school/college based on their scores. What Logistic Regression does is it tries to find a linear decision boundary that separates the classes the best.Logistic Regression Decision BoundaryAs we can see, LR does a pretty nice job separating the two classes. But what if there are more than two classes, as in our case? In that situation, we train n classifiers for each of the n classes and have each classifier try to separate one class from the rest. This technique is rightly known as the ‘one-vs-all classification’. In the end, for prediction on an instance, we pick the classifier which detects it’s class the strongest, and assign that class as the predicted class. The decision boundary here is a bit harder to visualize but here is an illustration from Sklearn -Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_iris_logistic.htmlGetting StartedAlright, enough with the requisites, now let’s get started with the code. We’ll be using Python of course, along with the following modules: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn. In case if like work locally on your computer like me, make sure you have these modules installed. To install them, simply fire up your Command Line/Terminal and enter the command “pip install <module-name>”. To check what modules are installed, enter “python” then “help(‘modules’)” to generate list of all installed modules.Data Analysis And VisualizationFirst, we need to get an idea of the distribution of data in the dataset. Let’s import the matplotlib and seaborn modules for this purpose and load the iris dataset contained in the seaborn module.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsiris = sns.load_dataset(‘iris’)This will load the dataset into the dataframe ‘iris’, which will make visualization much easier. Since the dataset has 4 features we can’t visualize it directly but we can gain some intuition through seaborn’s powerful pairplot. What pairplot does is it makes a scatter plot between each of the pairs of variables in the dataset, as well as the distribution of values of each variable (along the diagonal graphs). This can be used to analyze which features are a better separator of the data, which features are closely related, as well as data distribution.sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species') #hue parameter colors distinct speciesplt.show()Seaborn Pairplot on Iris DatasetAnother powerful tool in Seaborn is the heatmap of correlations. Correlation is a statistical measure of how much two variables are dependent on each other. If an increase in one variable causes a rough increase in another variable and vice versa, then they are said to be positively correlated. If an increase in a variable causes a decrease in another and vice versa, they are negatively correlated and if there is no such dependence between them, they have zero correlation. This is how we plot correlations using Seaborn -sns.heatmap(iris.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')plt.show()iris.corr() generates a 4*4 matrix with each entry (i,j) representing correlations between the iᵗʰ and jᵗʰ variables. Obviously the matrix is symmetric, since the dependence between i and j is same as that between j and i (wish this were true for humans too). And the diagonal elements are 1, since a variable is obviously completely dependent on itself. The annot parameter decides whether to display the correlation values on top of the heatmap and colormap is set to coolwarm, which means blue for low values and red for high values.Correlation Heatmap on Iris DatasetData Preparation And PreprocessingNow that we have an intuition about the data, let’s load the data into numpy arrays and preprocess it. Preprocessing is a crucial step and can enhance the performance of your algorithms by a huge margin. We import the required modules, load the dataset from sklearn’s iris datasets class in the form of a dictionary, get the features and targets into numpy arrays X and Y, respectively and the names of the classes into names. Since the targets specified in the datasets are 0,1 and 2 representing the 3 classes of species, we would like a mapping from those integers to the name of the class they represent. To do this, we create a dictionary mapping from the integers 0,1,2 to the flower names.import numpy as npfrom sklearn.datasets import load_irisdataset = load_iris()X, Y, names = dataset['data'], dataset['target'], dataset['target_names']target = dict(zip(np.array([0, 1, 2]), names))Let’s move forward to the preprocessing step. We divide the data into train and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn using test set size of 25%, then use the StandardScaler class from sklearn. What StandardScaler does is it computes the mean and standard deviation of each of the features in our dataset, then subtracts off the mean and divides by the standard deviation each example in our dataset. This brings all of the features to having zero mean and unit standard deviation/variance. Bringing all of the features in the same range is also known as feature normalization, and it helps optimization algorithms like gradient descent to work properly and converge faster.from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitX_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.25)scaler = StandardScaler()  #create object of StandardScaler classscaler.fit(X_train)        #fit it to the training setX_train_pr = scaler.transform(X_train) #apply normalization to the training setBuilding The Model And Evaluating ItIt’s time for the real deal. It is now that you feel really indebted to sklearn for making your life simple. We create an object of the LogisticRegression class named model, and fit our training dataset to it, all using 3 lines of code -from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionmodel = LogisticRegression()model.fit(X_train_pr, Y_train)Now, to make predictions we first normalize the test set using the Standard Scaler. Note that the transformation is the same as applied to the training set (to which we had fit the scaler to). This is important as we have to normalize our test set as per the mean and standard deviation of our training set, and not the test set. We then use the predict function to generate the 1D array of predictions both on the training and test set. There are many metrics available in the metrics class of sklearn but we’ll use the 3 most relevant — accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix.from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrixX_test_pr = scaler.transform(X_test)Y_train_pred, Y_test_pred = model.predict(X_train_pr), model.predict(X_test_pr) print(accuracy_score(Y_train, Y_train_pred))print(accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_test_pred))print(classification_report(Y_test, Y_test_pred))print(confusion_matrix(Y_test, Y_test_pred))The dataset is very small, and hence, you might very different results each time you train your model. This is the output I get -Evaluation of Trained ModelIn case if you don’t understand any of the metrics you see, feel free to search them they are pretty much basic and easy to understand. Training set accuracy is approx 95.5% and test set accuracy approx 94.7%. A weighted average of F1-score of all different classes in the test set is 0.95 and 2 examples from the test set are classified incorrectly. An accuracy of 94.7% on the training set at first go is really good, but we can do better.Improving The ModelLet’s introduce polynomial logistic regression. It turns out that we can build a better model by introducing polynomial features into the model, like x₁², x₁x₂, x₂² to produce a non-linear decision boundary to better separate the classes. This kind of model is more practical. For example, let us look at this dataset below -A Scatter Plot of 2D DatasetThis dataset looks a little more practical, doesn’t it? It shows scores achieved by tests on different microchips and the classes they belong to. There is clearly no linear decision boundary that can satisfactorily separate the data. Using polynomial logistic regression, we can get a decision boundary as shown below, which does a far better job.Polynomial Logistic Regression Decision BoundaryThe lambda=1 in the figure refers to the regularization parameter. Regularization become pretty important when dealing with non-linear models since you don’t want to overfit to your training set and have your model not perform well on new examples it hasn’t seen.To add polynomial features into your dataset, we use the PolynomialFeatures class from sklearn. This will go into your preprocessing as an added step, similar to the feature normalization step. We add 5th power degree terms, you can try changing it and see the effect it has on your accuracy. It turns out the model starts overfitting for higher degree terms and we don’t want that.from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeaturesX_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.25)poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree = 5)poly.fit(X_train)X_train_pr = poly.transform(X_train)scaler = StandardScaler()scaler.fit(X_train_pr)X_train_pr = scaler.transform(X_train_pr)Then continue the same steps as discussed above to fit the model. To make predictions, don’t forget to transform the test set using poly first.X_test_pr = poly.transform(X_test)X_test_pr = scaler.transform(X_test_pr)Y_train_pred, Y_test_pred = model.predict(X_train_pr), model.predict(X_test_pr)Then evaluate the model, using the metrics discussed above. Again, the results will differ with each time the model is trained. Here is my output -Evaluation of Improved ModelPretty good results! A training set accuracy of approx 98.2% and a test set accuracy of approx 97.4% are great using a simple algorithm like logistic regression. Weighted F1-score on test set has improved to 0.97 and the model incorrectly classifies only 1 example from the test set.Generating PredictionsIt’s time to use the model to generate predictions. We’ll give it an array of 4 numbers — representing the 4 features of a flower, and it will tell us which species it thinks that it belongs to. We randomly pick 20 examples from the dataset, preprocess them and get the predicted classes.indices = np.random.randint(150, size=20)X_pred, Y_true = X[indices], Y[indices]X_pred_pr = poly.transform(X_pred)X_pred_pr = scaler.transform(X_pred_pr)Y_pred = model.predict(X_pred_pr)Note that Y_true represents the true class of the example and Y_pred is the predicted class. They are both integers as the model works with numeric data. We will now create 2 lists, storing the true names and predicted names of the species of each example, using the dictionary mapping we already created named target.target_true, target_pred = [], []for i in range(len(Y_true)):    target_true.append(target[Y_true[i]])    target_pred.append(target[Y_pred[i]])print(X_pred)print(target_true)print(target_pred)This is the output I get -Predictions on 20 Random ExamplesDue to the high accuracy of our model, all the 20 predictions generated are correct! Here is the complete code of the final model we created -Try to make some modifications to the model, see if you can improve it further to make more realistic predictions. You can try different models like KNN-Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, or even a small Neural Network though I would not prefer a NN for this task as the number of features and dataset both are small and a Machine Learning model will perform just as well.ConclusionHope this gives you some idea regarding how to go about building a simple AI, or specifically, Machine Learning model to solve a particular problem. There are basically 5 stages involved -Obtain a proper dataset for the task.Analyze and visualize the dataset, and try to gain an intuition about the model you should use.Convert the data into an usable form, and then preprocess it.Build the model, and evaluate it.Check where the model is falling short, and keep improving it.There is a lot of trial-and-error involved when dealing with building Artificial Intelligence applications. Even if your first model doesn’t work well, don’t be disheartened. Most of the times, remarkable performance improvements can be made by tweaking it. Getting the right dataset is super crucial and is, I feel, the game-changer when it comes to real-world models. All said and done, try to keep learning new stuff as much as possible, and do AI for the fun of it!",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://towardsdatascience.com/writing-your-first-ai-machine-learning-program-92a590df86de,Writing Your First AI/Machine Learning Program - Towards Data Science,,2020-07-27T15:17:12.011Z,2021-12-15T09:51:53.692Z,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*Bzf775zcidXXXJrEFouPOQ.jpeg'],,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tamoghno Bhattacharya', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@tamoghnobhattacharya2001'}",https://towardsdatascience.com/writing-your-first-ai-machine-learning-program-92a590df86de,,,,Writing Your First AI/Machine Learning Program - Towards Data Science,,,,,2020-07-27T15:17:12.011Z,,,,,['Tamoghno Bhattacharya'],92a590df86de,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs have announced a new big data analytics initiative to coordinate and share COVID-19 information.







For more coronavirus updates, visit our resource page, updated twice daily by Xtelligent Healthcare Media.
The COVID-19 Insights Partnership creates a framework for HHS and VA to utilize DOE’s world-leading high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence resources to conduct COVID-19 research and analyze health data that otherwise would not be possible.
“The Department of Energy is proud to be a member of the COVID-19 Insights Partnership,” said Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette. “Our nation’s understanding of COVID-19 has already benefitted greatly from our world-leading high-performance computing and artificial intelligence resources, and we look forward to continuing our coordination across Federal departments and agencies in the fight against this virus.”
Research and analysis conducted by the COVID-19 Insights Partnership will focus on vaccine and therapeutic development and outcomes, virology, and other critical scientific topics to better understand COVID-19. HHS and VA will provide additional updates and information on research projects as they become available.
“Veterans served this country by putting on the uniform and protecting American interests overseas, and now their health data will help us win the fight against COVID-19 here at home,” said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. “President Trump is marshalling all the resources he has available in the Federal government to fight the virus, and Veterans should be proud of the role they’re playing.”
The US’s fastest supercomputer, Summit, is located at DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The advanced tool is accelerating COVID-19 research by running large-scale, complex analyses on a vast amount of health data.
Summit has the ability to analyze massive integrated datasets and divine insights that will help researchers identify and advance potential treatments and enhance outcomes for COVID-19 patients with extraordinary speed.
“This unprecedented data and computing partnership is the latest addition to President Trump’s whole-of-government effort against COVID-19,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “The volume and quality of the data HHS has on COVID-19 has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent months. The Department of Energy’s world-class resources will help us derive new insights from the data we gather to help patients and protect our country.”
The partnership builds on the government’s efforts to use innovative technologies to track and treat COVID-19. DOE recently joined forces with IBM and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to launch the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium.
The initiative provides researchers worldwide with HPC resources and expertise from leading industry, federal government, and academia partners to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic research.
“Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic we have been working closely with governments in the US and worldwide to find all available options to put our technology and expertise to work to help organizations be resilient and adapt to the consequences of the pandemic, and to accelerate the process of discovery and enable the scientific and medical community to develop treatments and ultimately a cure,” said  Dario Gil, director of IBM Research.
Additionally, the White House previously issued a call to action for experts to build artificial intelligence tools that can be applied to a COVID-19 dataset.
“Decisive action from America’s science and technology enterprise is critical to prevent, detect, treat, and develop solutions to COVID-19. The White House will continue to be a strong partner in this all hands-on-deck approach,” said Michael Kratsios, US Chief Technology Officer, the White House.
“We thank each institution for voluntarily lending its expertise and innovation to this collaborative effort, and call on the United States research community to put artificial intelligence technologies to work in answering key scientific questions about the novel coronavirus.”

KALAMAZOO, Mich.—Self-driving vehicles. Smart digital personal assistants. Real-time multilingual translators. Artificial intelligence—AI—applications are all around us. A computer science faculty team at Western Michigan University is working to ensure AI isn't hijacked or misused for nefarious reasons. Drs. Alvis Fong, Shameek Bhattacharjee, Steve Carr and Ajay Gupta received a nearly $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to create materials for teaching safe, secure and reliable artificial intelligence.
""As AI increasingly permeates every facet of our daily lives, we begin to observe reported cases of AI-related failures and misadventures,"" says Carr. ""We are now at a critical juncture when there is an urgent need to ensure that current and future scientists who advance AI, as well as practitioners who use AI, understand its limitations and how to develop robust and dependable AI.""
Increasing artificial intelligence literacy among students is paramount in helping them understand the technology's limitations and prevent misuse. It also dispels misinformation and fear gleaned from science fiction and sensational stories about AI killing human jobs and obliterating life as we know it.
The WMU team will begin their work in mid-August. Their two-year pilot project will involve designing intensive, multi-faceted, modular and experiential learning units to upgrade the skills of current and future cyberinfrastructure users. The modules could be integrated into existing classes from the freshman level all the way up to postgraduate education.
""Influenced by authoritative sources on AI and guided by a panel of experts drawn from academia, industry and government agencies, we will develop experiential learning modules that provide hands-on learning experiences to a wide spectrum of STEM students at WMU and beyond,"" says Fong.
The team will use best practices and lessons learned from the pilot to craft blueprints for programs that could be implemented across science, technology, engineering and math disciplines in the future. Ultimately, the program will inform training for the next generation of interdisciplinary students.
""The goal is to bring together the areas of AI, computer security and privacy, and computation theory to create a holistic understanding of the power, pitfalls and potential biases of AI algorithms and their widespread use in society,"" Gupta says.
""Beneficial AI can help people work better and more efficiently by helping them amplify their cognitive power,"" adds Bhattacharjee. ""We see a future in productive human-AI collaboration in a way not very different from how steam engines, electricity, telephony and other inventions benefited (and continue to benefit) society on a large scale.""

  Listen to this article    0:00 / 4:43 1X  BeyondWords The Covid-19 global pandemic has changed the way we work. It has increased the pace of what is already identified as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. For many people, it has meant unemployment. Those looking to invest in reskilling or upskilling in order to better position themselves in the jobs market should look to qualifications that are future proof.
Most people have heard of Blockchain as the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, but it can be applied in every sector where verified information is required quickly and securely. In 2019, Glassdoor described Blockchain as “one of the hottest tech skills on the market”.
The same article acknowledges the challenges in hiring for this emerging technology. The impetus towards digitisation caused by Covid-19 has increased the pressures on employers to understand and hire for this skill. Deloitte’s 2020 Global Blockchain Survey notes that “business leaders now see it as integral to organisational innovation”.
Qualification in this emerging technology puts graduates at the forefront of an expanding jobs market. National College of Ireland (NCI) offers a part-time Higher Diploma specialising in Blockchain, designed for those coming to ICT from other disciplines.
“At level 8, this course doesn’t assume that you already understand computing, but rather starts by guiding your problem-solving processes and teaching you technical skills. A facility for logic and language is definitely an advantage, and the hard work it takes to learn the fundamentals really pays off when you begin to specialise,” says Sean Heeney, who lectures on the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at NCI.
Also starting with the basics and working to a sought-after expertise is the Higher Diploma specialising in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning.
At the core of AI and Machine Learning is pattern recognition, which allows computers to quickly react to certain scenarios, to spot anomalies, and to repeat processes consistently without losing concentration. The value to business is clear – but first businesses need to find employees with the necessary technological skills.

KPMG considers AI and Machine Learning to be “key components of the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and vital skills to cultivate in order to encourage foreign direct investment through Ireland’s workforce. A recent survey by PwC and the Analytics Institute reports that Irish business leaders know that AI is essential to maintaining their competitive advantage, but 52% express concern that they will not be able to meet demand for AI skills in the workforce.
The Government’s Future Jobs Ireland report clearly identifies Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence as areas in which Ireland is experiencing a ‘skills gap’. Springboard+ is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Social Fund as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020, and provides courses designed to address the country’s skills gaps.
At NCI, the Higher Diplomas specialising in Blockchain and AI/Machine Learning are funded by Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative (HCI) Pillar 1, and so are free of charge to those who are currently not working, and 90% of the cost of fees is covered for those who are in employment
Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence are ‘cutting edge’ technologies: give yourself a ‘cutting edge’ in the jobs market, with a qualification in an area where the supply of suitable candidates cannot yet meet the demand by employers.

Pune University joins hands with startup DeepTek to work on AI, healthcare research






 



Share this News:FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInTelegramMessagePune, 30 July 2020: A letter of intent was signed between the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Enterprise(CIIE) at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) with healthcare startup DeepTek to provide market linkage and work on innovative research proposals in healthcare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain jointly.
SPPU Vice-Chancellor Dr Nitin Karmalkar, Pro VC Dr Umarani, Dr Apoorva Palkar-Director Innovation at SPPU and co-founders of Deeptek Ajit Patil, Anuruddha Pant and Dr Amit Kharat were present on the occasion.
“SPPU is keen to support startups working in COVID diagnostics and provide them access to the ecosystem. This aligns to our vision set up for the proposed centre for molecular diagnostic and research centre being set up at the University”, informed Dr Nitin R Karmalkar, Vice Chancellor SPPU.
Dr Apoorva Palkar, Director IIL-SPPU, “Centre for innovation helps startups for validating and scaling up and Deeptek a startup that provides innovative solution using AI in image processing through X Ray and CT scan is a novel initiative that can be a great breather when testing is most crucial.”
CIIE will support the healthcare startup working in the space of radiology artificial intelligence to validate the innovative “Radiology Optimization Platform” called Augmento. Augmento has innovated the space of diagnosis and radiology reporting by embedding AI artificial intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis and workflow thereby augmenting imaging experts, radiology administrators, floor managers and hospital administrators. This breakthrough solution will be administered in various COVID-19 Hospitals in the coming months
Augmento is an ancillary tool for diagnosis of Covid19 pneumonia-like pattern from Digital Radiographs and CT. Augmento allows to do an instant triage and prescreen from an Xray and/or CT imaging into normal or suspicious for Covid19 within few seconds and it can be supplemented with a clinically validated structured quantified radiology report within 60 minutes of completing the study.
Augmento has a powerful analytics tool which has been used for disease detection, notification, generating instant alerts and strengthening patient follow up and last-mile screening, a tool especially valuable for nodal officers monitoring infectious diseases and will be very useful for Covid19 screening. This tool also has empowered imaging experts, thereby allowing them to significantly reduce radiology report turnaround time in hospitals and/or mobile van-based x-ray screening.
CIIE is working very closely with startups and focusing on healthcare and diagnostics. Currently, it has more than 40 startups working in the centre.
“Over the last 12 months, more than one lakh patients have been screened using the AI-enabled smart platform for TB screening. Apart from TB, the platform screens digital chest radiographs for 18 different pathologies including Covid19 like pneumonia patterns”, said DeepTek MD Ajit Patil.
DeepTek is a Pune based startup funded by NTT DATA Japan, Nobori, Japan and GHV accelerator.

She’s a 3D digital construction.Digital models and influencers are successfully breaking into the fashion industry from every angle. Some have even been signed to traditional modeling agencies. Take Miquela Sousa, a 19-year-old Brazilian American model, influencer, and now musician, who has amassed a loyal following of more than 2 million people on Instagram. She’s collaborated with Prada and Givenchy, has been featured in a Calvin Klein video with Bella Hadid, and she just released a song with singer-songwriter Teyana Taylor this past spring.Related VideoEmma Roberts’s Tote and Purse are Filled With All Her Summer Essentials–Plus a Sweet TreatImpressive stuff, but there’s one thing that’s keeping real-life me at ease: Miquela, like Shudu, is a computer-generated image (CGI), not artificial intelligence (A.I.). That means that Miquela and Shudu can’t actually do anything on their own. They can’t think or learn or offer posing variations independently. But that won’t be the case for much longer.DataGrid is a Japanese tech outfit whose A.I. algorithms directly threaten my job. The company uses generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a type of machine learning, a subset of A.I. I’ll spare you the specifics of the algorithmic details, but in summary, these digital models can offer a vast array of posing options that mimic exactly what we do in e-commerce and commercial modeling. For models like myself, that’s how we make most of our money. The German e-commerce giant, Zalando (for which I have modeled almost a dozen times), has published research papers on this technology. It would seem to be only a matter of time until fashion giants jump on board.A point of tension that is emerging with CGI models is that their creators aren’t just designing them as avatars, but also giving them entire backstories, personalities, and causes to champion. Take Blawko, a digital male model and self-proclaimed “sex symbol” with tattoos and a sarcastic sense of humor. He referenced being “hungover” in an interview with Dazed Digital. Or consider right-wing, pro-Trump Bermuda, whose bio describes her as “unapologetic” and representing a breakthrough in “modern political thought.” Then there is Shudu Gram, who “hopes to champion diversity in the fashion world, collaborate with creators from emerging economies and under-represented communities, and get together with up-and-coming designers.”AdvertisementThere are major issues of transparency and authenticity here because the beliefs and opinions don’t actually belong to the digital models, they belong to the models’ creators. And if the creators can’t actually identify with the experiences and groups that these models claim to belong to (i.e., person of color, LGBTQ, etc.),  then do they have the right to actually speak on those issues? Or is this a new form of robot cultural appropriation, one in which digital creators are dressing up in experiences that aren’t theirs?I connected with Cameron-James Wilson, the creator behind Shudu Gram, to talk more about this and ask whether he sees the ethical implications of it all. Wilson is white and male. Shudu is Black and identifies as female. “I absolutely do [see the ethical implications], which is why I work alongside writer Ama Badu, who is a woman of color. It’s important to have that voice.” He went on to say that being a former fashion photographer allows him to create beautiful imagery, but when it comes to developing her story and her background, authenticity was needed. “I want Shudu’s story and her background to be just as authentic as the way she looks.”But we human models have worked really hard to have our stories heard and our authentic experiences considered, and we’ve fought to change the perception that we are just a sample size or a prop for clothes. We’ve mobilized in groups, such as the Model Mafia network that I am a part of, to advocate for social issues and push back on exclusivity in the fashion industry. In some cases our activism has even cost us jobs. But now that we are finally starting to see changes in the industry, digital models can just land the jobs that we took risks for. Or worse, brands can just create CGIs that champion causes instead of actually having to invest in those causes themselves.Most PopularWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s Final Wedding Celebration in MumbaiBy Elise TaylorRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Returns to Wimbledon in Royal Purple, With Princess Charlotte in TowBy Hayley MaitlandWeddingsAll the Celebrities Attending Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s WeddingBy VogueThose issues aside, digital models do have their advantages, some of which are hard to argue against. For one thing, digital models drastically reduce the environmental footprint associated with photo shoots and bringing clothes to market. It’s not uncommon for a model to shoot more than 50 outfits in a single day for an e-commerce shoot, and many of those samples end up in the landfills. Using 3D models would eliminate all of that. I spoke to Anastasia Edwards-Morel, a 3D fashion design expert at the design company CLO, who explained that by using 3D avatars and her company’s design software, a significant portion of the supply chain can now happen in a computer. An argument can also be made for efficiency and cost effectiveness. Digital models can work on multiple “shoots” at the same time, and they require a significantly smaller team to bring a shoot to life—only the digital creator needs to be “present.”Perhaps the most compelling reason that digital models may become the standard is that they are the ultimate symbol of individuality and inclusivity. What if every time you shopped online you could see yourself in the clothes? Literally. If the algorithms were fed enough data about us as individuals they could generate content featuring us, each one of us, as models. Or less radically, what if the algorithms started to learn which models we tended to click on the most and digitally customized campaigns to always include those characters?The COVID-19 pandemic has directly highlighted the need for these types of digital solutions. Anifa Mvuemba, a fashion designer and creative director for Hanifa, a contemporary ready-to-wear apparel line for women, recently made headlines when she launched her collection on Instagram Live using 3D models on a virtual catwalk. She posed the question to her Twitter followers: “Could this be the future of fashion?” Wilson, the creator behind Shudu, told me that his agency of digital models has experienced “a massive increase in inquiries since the lockdown.” He explained that the role of digital models and the 3D fashion industry “has become something that is necessary and needed.”So what does all of this mean for living and breathing models? It’s safe to say that we will have to prepare for a changing workforce just like everyone else. We will have to exercise skills such as adaptability and creative intelligence to ensure that we too can sustain the shift to digital. Edwards-Morel, the 3D fashion design expert, advised me to look into creating a digital avatar of myself. “It’s just creating more assets that you can use and it’s where the industry is going.” It’s certainly something to consider. In the meantime, I am going to continue to build and share my uniquely human story, something a robot could never do, and take comfort in knowing that we could be on a path to a more inclusive fashion world. Which is not only better for everyone, but also something that I have advocated for. I’m sure my avatar, if she does exist one day, will as well.Most PopularWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s Final Wedding Celebration in MumbaiBy Elise TaylorRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Returns to Wimbledon in Royal Purple, With Princess Charlotte in TowBy Hayley MaitlandWeddingsAll the Celebrities Attending Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s WeddingBy Vogue",https://schema.org/,BreadcrumbList,https://www.vogue.com/article/sinead-bovell-model-artificial-intelligence,I Am a Model and I Know That Artificial Intelligence Will Eventually Take My Job,runway,2020-07-21T11:24:25.728-04:00,2020-07-21T11:24:25.728-04:00,"['https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f1706bc2d36a8e6a2194aca/16:9/w_240,h_135,c_limit/00_promo.gif', 'https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f1706bc2d36a8e6a2194aca/4:3/w_240,h_180,c_limit/00_promo.gif', 'https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f1706bc2d36a8e6a2194aca/1:1/w_240,h_240,c_limit/00_promo.gif']","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f1706bc2d36a8e6a2194aca/1:1/w_240,h_240,c_limit/00_promo.gif","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Vogue', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-seo.png', 'width': '500px', 'height': '152px'}, 'url': 'https://www.vogue.com'}",,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sinead Bovell', 'sameAs': 'https://www.vogue.com/contributor/sinead-bovell'}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.vogue.com/article/sinead-bovell-model-artificial-intelligence'}",,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Runway', 'item': 'https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'I Am a Model and I Know That Artificial Intelligence Will Eventually Take My Job'}]",,,Sinead Bovell shares her firsthand insight into the future of technology in fashion.,"Shudu Gram is a striking South African model.

But we human models have worked really hard to have our stories heard and our authentic experiences considered, and we’ve fought to change the perception that we are just a sample size or a prop for clothes. We’ve mobilized in groups, such as the Model Mafia network that I am a part of, to advocate for social issues and push back on exclusivity in the fashion industry. In some cases our activism has even cost us jobs. But now that we are finally starting to see changes in the industry, digital models can just land the jobs that we took risks for. Or worse, brands can just create CGIs that champion causes instead of actually having to invest in those causes themselves.
Those issues aside, digital models do have their advantages, some of which are hard to argue against. For one thing, digital models drastically reduce the environmental footprint associated with photo shoots and bringing clothes to market. It’s not uncommon for a model to shoot more than 50 outfits in a single day for an e-commerce shoot, and many of those samples end up in the landfills. Using 3D models would eliminate all of that. I spoke to Anastasia Edwards-Morel, a 3D fashion design expert at the design company CLO, who explained that by using 3D avatars and her company’s design software, a significant portion of the supply chain can now happen in a computer. An argument can also be made for efficiency and cost effectiveness. Digital models can work on multiple “shoots” at the same time, and they require a significantly smaller team to bring a shoot to life—only the digital creator needs to be “present.”
Perhaps the most compelling reason that digital models may become the standard is that they are the ultimate symbol of individuality and inclusivity. What if every time you shopped online you could see yourself in the clothes? Literally. If the algorithms were fed enough data about us as individuals they could generate content featuring us, each one of us, as models. Or less radically, what if the algorithms started to learn which models we tended to click on the most and digitally customized campaigns to always include those characters?
The COVID-19 pandemic has directly highlighted the need for these types of digital solutions. Anifa Mvuemba, a fashion designer and creative director for Hanifa, a contemporary ready-to-wear apparel line for women, recently made headlines when she launched her collection on Instagram Live using 3D models on a virtual catwalk. She posed the question to her Twitter followers: “Could this be the future of fashion?” Wilson, the creator behind Shudu, told me that his agency of digital models has experienced “a massive increase in inquiries since the lockdown.” He explained that the role of digital models and the 3D fashion industry “has become something that is necessary and needed.”
So what does all of this mean for living and breathing models? It’s safe to say that we will have to prepare for a changing workforce just like everyone else. We will have to exercise skills such as adaptability and creative intelligence to ensure that we too can sustain the shift to digital. Edwards-Morel, the 3D fashion design expert, advised me to look into creating a digital avatar of myself. “It’s just creating more assets that you can use and it’s where the industry is going.” It’s certainly something to consider. In the meantime, I am going to continue to build and share my uniquely human story, something a robot could never do, and take comfort in knowing that we could be on a path to a more inclusive fashion world. Which is not only better for everyone, but also something that I have advocated for. I’m sure my avatar, if she does exist one day, will as well.","{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Vogue'}",,,,,True,https://www.vogue.com/article/sinead-bovell-model-artificial-intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eye autofocus, insanely fast burst rates, 8K raw video, and more. There is no doubt that camera features are getting better and better at a crazy pace. But the thing I am most excited for is not on a camera, it is in post-processing: artificial intelligence.




Photoshop is an incredibly powerful program, no doubt, and it has been moving toward higher levels of automation in recent years, but for the most part, more intricate procedures still require mostly manual control and thus, fair amounts of time investment. I certainly do not mind that sort of investment for passion projects, but on the other hand, for purely work-related projects, I have always been ready to embrace whatever levels of automation that could be found. Such automation has been around for a while, but it has not been until the last few years that it has made major steps forward, and now, I think we are on the cusp of an AI-powered revolution.
Luminar 4 and PortraitPro 19
I will admit that until just a few days ago, PortraitPro was never seriously on my radar. After seeing a few ads for it many years ago, it just looked like the sort of software that overly smoothed skin and produced unrealistic results. I honestly forgot about it until another Fstoppers writer raved about it to me a few days ago. I trust his opinion, and I am always looking to try new things, so I grabbed my credit card and bought a copy. Suffice to say that I am truly impressed. A typical headshot edit takes me about 20 minutes in Photoshop — 15 if I am really hyperfocused. After spending 10 minutes learning the ropes of PortraitPro, I loaded in an unedited headshot and had a finished image that was just as good as a manual edit in about 90 seconds. And for the occasional blemish it missed, I could open the exported version in Photoshop and run the healing brush over it in maybe 20 seconds. No doubt, the increase in efficiency was impressive.
Working in Luminar 4 with sky replacement.

Luminar 4 has been another fantastic addition to my arsenal. I have been particularly fond of the automated sky replacement feature. If you have ever replaced a sky in Photoshop before, you know that for anything but the simplest horizons, it is a rather involved process. Luminar 4 does an impressive job of automating the process and gives you enough granular control to tweak it to increase its believability. The thing that I love about it, though, is that it invigorates my creativity. Replacing a sky is not something I would do on a whim manually in Photoshop. But when I can just cycle through different options with a single click, all of a sudden, I can explore all sorts of creative avenues, and photos that might have gone straight to the trash bin before suddenly have new life.
You Aren't Going to Lose the Chance to Be Creative
A common counterargument against this is that using automation removes the creative touch of the artist, and there is certainly validity to that. But it is also important to remember that you do not have to use it. I certainly enjoy the manual process and prefer it to automation for passion projects and personal work. Rather, the usage of these tools falls into two categories for me.
Alleviating Tedium
Let's be honest: a lot of post-processing is not a magical creative process; it is just plain tedium. Working on a landscape can be a really special thing, but I doubt many photographers will say how much they enjoy editing 200 corporate headshots. 
We already have batch processing to a certain degree in lots of applications, but I have to admit that I was truly impressed by the capabilities of PortraitPro 19. I could establish a certain edit and style I wanted, then batch-process an entire set of photos in just a few clicks; that includes things like blemish removal and the like — everything that you would normally do for a complete edit. After that, I just double-checked all the exported files and touched up the occasional missed blemish in Lightroom. 
Working in PortraitPro 19.

This sort of capability has the potential to revolutionize workflows for a lot of photographers. A photographer doing multiple days of corporate headshots and coming home with hundreds of images to edit could see post-processing of that massive set drop from multiple days to just a couple of hours. Wedding photographers, who typically shoot on the weekends and spend weekdays post-processing, who have to touch up dozens of formal portraits and the like, could free up large amounts of their weekdays for other tasks or personal time. Furthermore, this has potential to ensure greater consistency. 
Similarly, consider a real estate photographer. They can't wait until a day with partly cloudy weather for the perfect complement to whatever house they are shooting. Still, upper-level clients will expect that complete look to show their properties in the best possible light. Like the portrait sets, AI sky replacement can save a lot of time. And it can also set your work apart when you can put every single property against a nice sky. 
Increasing Creativity and Inspiration
I look at it as augmenting creativity and inspiration. You are not obligated to use this technology. But when I am stuck on where to take a shot that I know has potential, being able to cycle through a variety of editing options in just seconds can shake me out of that creative rut and give me an idea of where I want to go with the post-processing. 
Conclusion
In the last few years, AI software for post-processing has made some real leaps forward. And not only does that have the potential to enable new creative routes for photographers, it also has the potential to significantly streamline workflows by alleviating majorly tedious and repetitive tasks. 
There will always be room for taking whatever level of manual control you want to have. Have you integrated any artificial intelligence tools into your workflow? Do you find they have become advanced enough to make a significant difference? Tell me about your experience in the comments.

I'll take AI when it comes to finding/ tracking subjects and objects. I just started to play around with Topaz DeNoise AI and as long as I keep the ""Recover Original Detail"" up and ""Remove Noise"" to a minimum it seems to a good job. Better in shadows than Lightroom. Although when you go crazy with Remove Noise setting it basically just starts to fill in whatever it wants and looks like a painting. That's what I don't want. You can see a bit of that on phones when it comes to night modes.

Change always brings on the discussion regarding how it will negatively affect ""us"" or in this case, the skills and creativity of the photographer...as much as we may desire to wish it away...it's here to stay. Until something even better comes along. As a university teacher, I used to look unkindly towards students always being on their smartphones until I considered how different generations embrace technologies. This was simply how they communicated with each other and how many of them completed their daily tasks. Just because it is different from how I would do it doesn't necessarily make it wrong. AI isn't going away anytime soon and will most likely become a more prominent part of our lives...it always comes down to choices. I too use Luminar to edit some of my photos and find the AI features to be quite a time-saver. Does it affect one's creativity? I'm not claiming to be the ""expert"" on the use of AI, but I do embrace it as a tool...an option. Even after clicking on that feature, you still have sliders available to tweak it to be just the way you envision your final product to be.

Actually I've read somewhere that AI is a thing that doesn't really exist and what we call AI is just a number of automatic tools aimed at enhancing the picture without giving a photographer a chance ti be creative in post-processing. It's just an opinion that I don't really share, since this article provides completely different info: a full opportunity to be creative while doing post-processing, etc. I remember Fstoppers itself wrote about an automatic photo editor packed with AI ( https://fstoppers.com/originals/automatic-photo-editor-photoworks-refres... ), so probably this really does make sense. Anyway, I'm not sure this tool is perfect so it may need some more development.

I'm no more than a hobbyist photographer and don't actually see there's much point in professional photography these days since everyone and his dog is walking around with cameras on their phones. Aside from corporate publicity and advertising (which increasingly people don't look at anyway because of adblockers and even when they do most of it doesn't work) and sport photography (now largely on high quality video from which good stills can be extracted), where is the market?
So what we're left with is photography on the same level as sketching or watercolours - art for its own sake. And in that what is the photographer still doing? The fast high resolution camera means you miss little, the software means you don't need to get it right first time, and increasingly the camera and the software do it all for you. The photographer is just there to bring the camera to the location, and even then a drone can do it now.
Which is why I like messing about with film and trying to get it right first time in the camera. Which is what it's about, as far as I'm concerned, since it requires thinking and a bit of creativity.
My next experiments will be HDR using stacked scans from a £10 charity shop SLR and perhaps capturing water drops on an ancient Bronica.

For me, there is a point in professional photography. Just because everyone is walking around with a camera on their phone doesn't mean they can take a picture. Sure there are people who do well with an iPhone, and with all the accessories geared to iPhoneography they're even better. All the people who want ""professional looking"" pictures of their weddings, engagements, bar mitzvahs, newborns, graduations, etc and are unable to do it themselves, they hire a pro. A drone cannot tell someone how to pose, where to look or direct one person, let alone a group of people.

The above example ""Working in PortraitPro 19"" is anything but convincing. And the example ""Working in Luminar 4 with sky replacement."" has changed the colour tone of the photo. Not a fair comparison to the original if it is about replacing the sky. Would like to see an enlargement of the border of the buildings on the horizon.

The modern tendency to remove blemishes from portraits may please the sitter but they look flat, bland and boring.
The interest in a face is the imperfection and the blemish. Remove them and you do not have a more beautiful/handsome subject, you've got something that may as well be injection-moulded in plastic.
This pursuit of megapixellated and recoloured artificial perfection is incredibly boring. The technical capability of the camera and software has eliminated the warts-and-all beauty of the natural world and indeed the skill of the photographer as an artist in rendering it.

Sadly, that is very true!  I would only retouch injuries and temporary skin blemishes, but pepper spots and birthmarks only if the customer insists.
Additionally with the above example: Her skin tone is awful and there are blown out high lights on her body.

There would be no need for this AI retouching if the shot was properly lit instead of trying to simulate it in post, also as you said that skin tone is terrible, if you want less work to do in post then you need to spend time setting your camera and lighting up properly.

Nailed it with ""Increasing Creativity and Inspiration"". Even cycling through presets, it can be incredibly helpful in finding which direction you might take an image. AI might not have the subtlety of a seasoned pro, but it can definitely give you a quick preview of something resembling a finished product.

The increase in productivity creates a competitive advantage. New technologies require new business models.
The performance of a photographer consists in the individual interpretation of the photographed.
The AI mentioned here is based on learning by watching.
A new business model is therefore to train an own AI. This AI will then learn your own style from your own pictures.
This is possible. Take for example Google Tensorflow, a freeware. With it you can build your own AI. The learning curve is quite steep, but feasible. For this you need a powerfull PC. Or you can rent computer time at Google or Amazon.
Do it, or leave.

Sorry but I just have to say this: none of this image processing software incorporates ""artificial intelligence"" because no such thing currently exists. The marketing people just decided it does, because the world got tired of waiting.
It may be great code that uses new algorithms and data structures, including ""neural nets"".  But it's just doing the single task it was designed to do.
I'll sit down now.

I am waiting for a interactive AI voice to occupy my photo library. So just imagine an Alexa or Siri like entity, that lives in a program like Capture One.  Every time time you upload new images into your catalog, your AI friend will create the meta-data, learn to identify shapes and familiar sites, or faces immediately.  One could ask their AI to perform basic modifications, all in real time, but with voice commands. I’m preparing images for a book and I am reducing the ink levels for CMYK printing, and it would be great if I could get Photoshop to do this with voice interaction. In the future, an AI photo-friend could continue to manage all one’s work on a cloud, after one passes away.

MIT – Master of Business Analytics
MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor
A course focused on practical applications of data and machine learning, from one of the world's leading technology schools, would be a great place to start your advanced level education in this field. For any master's course, you will generally be expected to have either an undergraduate degree in a related field – for example, computer science or mathematics – but there is often some flexibility around these precise requirements. The other route that can qualify you is if you have gained extensive work experience in the field. MIT's Master, in line with most others, takes 12 months to complete, and aims to give students the knowledge and experience to start working with businesses and solving their problems.

However, some businesses (such as law and insurance firms) are still dealing with the cabinets jam-packed with vendor agreements, contracts, employees’ credentials, and other documents.According to reports, workers spend approximately 11 hours in a week to deal with documents related issues, which leads to low productivity and poor quality of the customer service. By harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning, businesses can revamp the traditional document management system.It might seem unbelievable at this moment, but after reading this article, you would know how these two technologies can make the workflow smarter, faster, and better. Here, we have highlighted some of the ways how AI and ML are reshaping the document management system:Data ExtractionUsing an AI-powered DMS,businesses can modernize the way data is extracted. Wondering how? Well, such an advanced system can read the information accurately to understand its intent. On the basis of specific patterns, the AI-enabled DMS system analysis and retrieve only useful information to accomplish a particular job.Like AI, machine learning can also be a powerful tool in data extraction. Using this technology, businesses can develop a way to help its employees to extra only the relevant data without creating any mess. This artificial intelligence document management and extraction helps in saving a lot of time and effort.Document ClusteringA DMS powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning can analyze documents to group them by topics. This further facilitates in understanding the nature of a document and how it is related to some other document.Artificial Intelligence JobsAutomatic Classification and ProcessingWith the help of optical character recognition, artificial intelligence technology can make a DMS to read what’s written on a document to categorize it rightly. It further helps in automating workflows on the basis of that categorization. Just like AI, machine learning also plays a major role in data classification and processing. The technology improves the capability of a DMS to identify and process information.Improved Data QualityAI-powered DMS can help businesses to minimize data redundancy, prevent the occurrence of various input errors, and protect files misplacement. It can also help them to make efficient decisions and process business by offering useful insights.Data Analyticshttps://unsplash.com/photos/qwtCeJ5cLYsTop 4 Most Popular Ai Articles:1. Natural Language Generation: The Commercial State of the Art in 20202. This Entire Article Was Written by Open AI’s GPT23. Learning To Classify Images Without Labels4. Becoming a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Financial Analyst and Research AnalystOne of the biggest roles of artificial intelligence in the document management system is data analytics. Analyzing the data correctly and flawlessly can contribute to your business growth. Using various techniques (data visualization and predictive analysis) involved in ML and AI, businesses can make better decisions.Document SecurityAlong with document management, it is also imperative to secure documents and data, especially confidential ones. AI-powered DMS offers high-level document security by detecting the sensitive as well as personally identifiable information in documents. The technology then marks such documents so that a user can handle them carefully.Structuring the Unstructured DataWith the advancement of technology, we can now generate data from multiple sources; however, this data needs to be processed and structured to fetch useful information out of it. It is estimated that out of all the data collected by an organization, approx. 80% of it is unstructured. An AI-enabled document management system can help businesses to make the most out of this data by automatically analyzing files, fetch technical data, and connect files with relevant information.In fact, most of the companies are leveraging AI and ML to look into emails, messages, and other ways of communication to know semantics, words, sentiments, and more to predict information related to products and services.Content Support and ManagementThe advanced DMS with the potential of AI and ML helps in supporting content as well as document management. It can also simplify document development workflow. Grammarly, a popular grammar check and proofreading software, is a sheer proof of how AI can be implemented to edit documents without the need of a human being.Modernize Document ManagementWhen we talk about document management machine learning and artificial intelligence, it would be no wrong to say that these technologies have brought a big revolution into this field. Industries that rely heavily on documents can make the most AI for data discovery, streamlining the workflow, increase productivity, and make more data-driven decisions.Bottom LineWith the rapid adaption of artificial intelligence and machine learning by various businesses, it has become easier to categorize and manage documents. With AI document analysis, data extraction, machine learning in content management, and other advantages given in this article, these businesses are managing documents effectively and efficiently. Moreover, they can store, process, and extract data in seconds. .

It also will give UF the fastest artificial intelligence supercomputer in higher education, officials said.The discipline is a branch of computer science that has brought the world products like self-driving cars, food delivery robots and computers that engage humans in a game of chess. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to perform human-like tasks by learning from experience and making adjustments.Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was present for the Zoom announcement, said the initiative would attract students to UF from across the nation.“I think it’s going to help the state of Florida modernize our workforce,” he said. “I think we’ll have an added boost as we seek to become an economic powerhouse and internally as we bounce back from the pandemic.”Provost Joseph Glover said more than 600 faculty and staff members have been involved so far in conversations on how to incorporate the subject of artificial intelligence into their disciplines.“We believe this is so important to our future and our students’ futures that every student who graduates from the University of Florida, no matter what their major is, should have the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, the training and the tools of artificial intelligence and data science,” Glover said. “This is not only important to our students but the nation.”Glover said the partnership will help “catapult the University of Florida to the forefront of AI” and “create the next generation of AI-enabled workforce in this country.”The announcement laid out the financial details of the partnership: a $25 million gift from Chris Malachowsky, co-founder of NVIDIA and an alumnus of UF’s Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering; $25 million in hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA; and a $20 million investment from UF.Chris Malachowsky is co-founder of NVIDIA and a University of Florida alumnus. [Courtesy of UF]The supercomputer is expected to be installed by November. It’s an upgrade from the existing UF supercomputer known as HiPerGator. Malachowsky said the machine will be among the world’s top 10 supercomputers, capable of processing vast amounts of data that can be used across many fields, including climate research and medicine.In explaining why the company brought the partnership to Florida, Malachowsky described the state as a “living laboratory for some of the really big problems of today for society,” with its long coastline, large population, varied demographics and “a workforce in need of upscaling to deal with the growing digital divide.”Catch up on top stories before rush hourBecome a Times subscriber to get our afternoon newsletter, The RundownWe’ll break down Tampa Bay’s biggest environment, politics, business, education and culture news every weekdaySign upSuccess!You’re all signed up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started.Explore all your optionsUF is in the process of infusing artificial intelligence into its curricula, Glover said. And, while not everyone will be expected to become a programmer, everyone will have exposure to it and the opportunity to be certified in that area, he said.Certifications will include courses on ethics, bias and how artificial intelligence applies to certain disciplines. By spring, Glover said, he expects a survey course to be offered, and by next summer the school may offer more specific boot camps in artificial intelligence.Cammy Abernathy, dean of the College of Engineering, said artificial intelligence is already being applied across disciplines to finding solutions for diabetes and as a means to combat climate change and red tide.

It also will give UF the fastest artificial intelligence supercomputer in higher education, officials said.The discipline is a branch of computer science that has brought the world products like self-driving cars, food delivery robots and computers that engage humans in a game of chess. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to perform human-like tasks by learning from experience and making adjustments.Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was present for the Zoom announcement, said the initiative would attract students to UF from across the nation.“I think it’s going to help the state of Florida modernize our workforce,” he said. “I think we’ll have an added boost as we seek to become an economic powerhouse and internally as we bounce back from the pandemic.”Provost Joseph Glover said more than 600 faculty and staff members have been involved so far in conversations on how to incorporate the subject of artificial intelligence into their disciplines.“We believe this is so important to our future and our students’ futures that every student who graduates from the University of Florida, no matter what their major is, should have the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, the training and the tools of artificial intelligence and data science,” Glover said. “This is not only important to our students but the nation.”Glover said the partnership will help “catapult the University of Florida to the forefront of AI” and “create the next generation of AI-enabled workforce in this country.”The announcement laid out the financial details of the partnership: a $25 million gift from Chris Malachowsky, co-founder of NVIDIA and an alumnus of UF’s Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering; $25 million in hardware, software, training and services from NVIDIA; and a $20 million investment from UF.The supercomputer is expected to be installed by November. It’s an upgrade from the existing UF supercomputer known as HiPerGator. Malachowsky said the machine will be among the world’s top 10 supercomputers, capable of processing vast amounts of data that can be used across many fields, including climate research and medicine.In explaining why the company brought the partnership to Florida, Malachowsky described the state as a “living laboratory for some of the really big problems of today for society,” with its long coastline, large population, varied demographics and “a workforce in need of upscaling to deal with the growing digital divide.”UF is in the process of infusing artificial intelligence into its curricula, Glover said. And, while not everyone will be expected to become a programmer, everyone will have exposure to it and the opportunity to be certified in that area, he said.Certifications will include courses on ethics, bias and how artificial intelligence applies to certain disciplines. By spring, Glover said, he expects a survey course to be offered, and by next summer the school may offer more specific boot camps in artificial intelligence.Cammy Abernathy, dean of the College of Engineering, said artificial intelligence is already being applied across disciplines to finding solutions for diabetes and as a means to combat climate change and red tide. Broadening access to the topic can lead to a more equitable society, she said.“Philosophers, lawyers and computer scientists are working together to ensure that AI does not further enforce the biases that are present in our society and does not intrude on the privacy and rights of the public,” Abernathy said. “These issues of fairness and access are important, so much so that they will be at the heart of this initiative.”Glover said the university will work to provide access to businesses, the K-12 education system, historically black colleges and universities and state and community colleges.“The population in Florida will have opportunities to train on this,” Glover said.Malachowsky said he hopes wealthy alumni in each state consider investing in artificial intelligence at their universities.Rep.

Law enforcement, marketers, hospitals and other bodies apply artificial intelligence (AI) to decide on matters such as who is profiled as a criminal, who is likely to buy what product at what price, who gets medical treatment and who gets hired. These entities increasingly monitor and predict our behaviour, often motivated by power and profits.

The Covid-19 virus, having killed over 500,000 people in just six",,,,"If “intelligence” helps us solve problems, we need as much as we can get right now. The Covid-19 virus, having killed over 500,000 people in just six months is also sparking a cascade of economic and social disruptions. And it’s only July.We benefit from intelligence when it helps us find a vaccine. But we also suffer from intelligence when it uses the crisis to advance polarized political goals. In each case, there is a blend of human and artificial intelligence at work. The crisis is accelerating the integration of AI in every aspect of our lives. How we manage AI’s role in addressing the crisis and managing our recovery will define our next era. As we reimagine a way forward, The Rockefeller Foundation is betting that AI will help rebalance and reset the future in a way that addresses current inequities. To realize that outcome, we must develop a regulatory framework to ensure its responsible use.By regulatory framework, we don’t necessarily mean more regulation. And we don’t mean just trying to figure out the right rules. We mean that we need to reimagine an entire new rule-making system that guides AI towards society’s goals instead of our current de facto rule-making system that guides AI towards the market’s goals.Last fall, we convened a unique group of technologists, philosophers, economists, lawyers, artists, and philanthropists at our Bellagio Center in Italy to explore how AI can be harnessed to create a better future for humanity.From left to right.

It’s not a technical report about AI, but rather a set of insights about how AI will weave into the fabric of our lives, our institutions, and our societies.The report doesn’t attempt to simplify a list of the “top 5 things we need to do.” That wouldn’t do justice to the nuance and depth of the issues we face today. Every time we shared a draft with someone, we were surprised at what new ideas it stimulated for people.As we discussed and debated the ideas and wove them together with many other partnerships and conversations, we landed on the importance of AI governance. There is a growing industry promoting AI principles, ethical guidelines, and calls to action. But if we want AI to be a force for good, particularly for people who will otherwise miss out on the benefits and bear the brunt of its potential harms, we need to create a system that guides the responsible development of AI and its usage in a growing number of applications. Some of the insights you’ll see in the report include:Responsible AI is impossible without responsible systems.Jake PorwayFounder and CEO of DataKindThe human CEOs of companies are nominally governed by their human boards of directors, but in truth, they are governed by something called ‘the market’—a vast, reflexive algorithmic system in which companies are relentlessly tasked to optimize for growth and profits, even if human values must be ignored.Tim O’ReillyFounder of O’Reilly MediaThis shift to private and opaque governance that lets company code set standards and regulate essential services is one of the most significant consequences of the increased use of AI systems.Marietje SchaakeInternational Policy Director of the Cyber Policy Center at StanfordRather than deploying AI solely for efficient economic production, what if we decide to unleash its potential for the achievement of human well-being and self-expression?Andrew ZolliVP of Impact Initiatives at PlanetResponsible AI is impossible without responsible systems.Jake PorwayFounder and CEO of DataKindThe human CEOs of companies are nominally governed by their human boards of directors, but in truth, they are governed by something called ‘the market’—a vast, reflexive algorithmic system in which companies are relentlessly tasked to optimize for growth and profits, even if human values must be ignored.Tim O’ReillyFounder of O’Reilly MediaPrevious QuoteNext Quote1 / 4I, along with the authors of this report, couldn’t have imagined how deeply relevant our discussions would become a few months later when the world woke up to a global pandemic followed by the urgent need for digital technologies and systems to address it. We’ve been at similar inflection points before and they’ve presented opportunities to rethink and reframe the world order as we know it. For example, the Bretton Woods agreements gave birth to the rule-making institutions of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that have adapted to meet different needs at different times.The Rockefeller Foundation is looking at this moment in much the same way. We are hoping to mobilize new ideas, as represented by this report and our forthcoming virtual Bellagio Dialogues series, build practical applications, such as the Lacuna Fund which will expand the benefits of machine learning in low- and middle-income contexts, and incubate nascent technical solutions, such as the concept of an algorithmic vulnerability bounty. But we know that’s not enough, and we need to make a bold bet to develop a practical rule-making Bretton-Woods inspired framework to govern AI. It must address the needs of today and adapt to rapid social and technological change tomorrow. It requires a combination of government’s moral authority to set social goals with the private sector’s capacity to innovate new forms of regulation – not just the technology – to meet those goals. If defeating the Covid virus is our collective priority today, managing AI’s responsible development to benefit all of humanity has to be our collective priority for tomorrow. Read the report to learn more and share your thoughts to continue the conversation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to play a major role in shaping global competitiveness and productivity over the next couple of decades, granting early adopters significant societal, economic, and strategic advantages. As the pace of AI innovation and development picks up—underpinned by advancements in big data and high-performance computing—the United States and China are both in the driver’s seat. Europe, meanwhile, despite having certain advantages such as a strong industrial base and leading AI research and talent, is punching far below its weight. This state of affairs is especially due to the fragmentation of the EU’s digital market, difficulties in attracting human capital and external investment, and the lack of commercial competitiveness.
Fortunately, in recent years, European leaders have recognized the importance of not lagging behind on AI and have sought to raise their ambitions. Leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have stressed the need for Europe to become a leading global player on AI, and the new European Commission has made AI a top priority for the next five years. By declaring AI a major strategic priority, several member states and EU institutions are taking steps to advance the continent’s ambitions for AI leadership. This includes rolling out devoted national and EU-level AI strategy documents, boosting research and innovation, and exploring new regulatory approaches for managing the development and use of AI.
Central to the EU’s efforts is the notion of AI that is “made in Europe,” that pays attention to ethical and human-centric considerations, and that is in line with core human rights values and democratic principles. Given the need to address the societal, ethical, and regulatory challenges posed by AI, the EU’s stated added value is in leveraging its robust regulatory and market power—the so-called “Brussels effect”—into a competitive edge under the banner of “trustworthy AI.” Designed to alleviate potential harm as well as to permit accountability and oversight, this vision for AI-enabled technologies could set Europe apart from its global competitors. It can also serve as a key component of increasing the EU’s digital sovereignty by ensuring that European users have more choice and control.
Yet normative principles and regulation alone are not enough for the EU to become a global AI leader. What is also required is a reevaluation of European competitiveness in this field in a way that leverages its comparative advantages and preserves its interests in a world where technology is increasingly emerging as a key driver of great-power rivalry. Amid concerns that Europe is losing ground to the United States and China, EU member states should acknowledge that the amount of resources required to keep up with the latest AI developments cannot be met by going it alone. There is a clear rationale for a stronger EU-level role and for a more coherent European-wide approach to AI that complements member states’ own actions.
This paper takes stock of whether existing EU and national strategies and funding initiatives are sufficient for Europe to be able to seize the opportunities afforded by AI. It argues that for its AI ecosystem to thrive, Europe needs to find a way to protect its research base, encourage governments to be early adopters, foster its startup ecosystem, expand international links, and develop AI technologies as well as leverage their use efficiently. More importantly, to be able to take these steps, Europe needs to catch up on digitizing its economies and complete the establishment of the digital single market once and for all.
Recommendations:
There are a host of steps that the EU and its member states can pursue to bolster Europe’s approach to AI. Specifically, this array of European stakeholders can:
complete the EU digital single market;
balance technological sovereignty with global supply chains;
lead on standard setting and regulations;
secure citizens’ trust in AI applications;
promote a vibrant Europe-wide AI ecosystem;
align the national AI strategies of EU member states;
safeguard dual-use technologies;
ensure close EU-UK cooperation on AI;
enhance transatlantic dialogue on AI;
engage global stakeholders on ethical AI; and
consider AI a facet of European strategic autonomy.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to transform economies and impact virtually every aspect of human life over the next couple of decades.1 This disruptive potential has triggered rapidly growing investments in AI research and development (R&D) as well as speedy uptake in the public and private sectors worldwide. By 2030, AI could contribute as much as $13 trillion to the global economy, a figure that approaches the current annual economic output of China, the world’s second-largest economy.2 Moreover, as AI applications are expanding to a wide range of sectors, early adopters will be well positioned to reap significant economic and strategic benefits. While the hyped notion of an AI arms race is too simplistic to capture the complex dynamics of the global digital ecosystem, its continued use also risks further exacerbating global competition in this key strategic domain. The combination of potentially large economic, societal, and military dividends has propelled countries to join this so-called race and swiftly and effectively apply AI in as many sectors as possible.
The United States and China are ahead in the AI competition, although countries such as Israel, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea are investing heavily in AI as a strategic priority.3 Some European countries—such as France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (UK)—are also at the forefront of the field, but they cannot necessarily compete globally alone. Europe as a whole is punching far below its weight. This reality is especially due to the fragmentation of the EU’s digital market, difficulties with attracting human capital and external investment from outside of Europe, and a lack of commercial competitiveness. While its policymakers frequently acknowledge the risks of lagging behind, Europe has some advantages, such as its strong industrial base and leading AI research and talent, that it can leverage to better compete globally.
European governments and EU institutions are taking steps to upgrade the continent’s ambitions for AI leadership. Countries are rolling out dedicated AI national strategies and digital approaches. The European Commission has emerged as a key driver and agenda setter for a more coherent approach to AI in Europe.4 Its plan, set out in the white paper on AI released in February 2020, is to further boost the EU’s research and innovation as well as its technological and industrial capabilities. The EU argues its added value is in leveraging its strong regulatory and market power into a competitive edge under the unique selling proposition of “trustworthy AI” that is “made in Europe.”5 This approach is characterized by transparency, diversity, and fairness, and it is designed to alleviate potential harm as well as to permit accountability and oversight, thus safeguarding social and environmental well-being. Central to the EU’s efforts in the digital space is also a strong desire to be more self-sufficient. Commissioner for Internal Market and Services Thierry Breton, in laying out his vision for the EU, said: “we have to work on our technological sovereignty.”6
One particular area where the EU has the potential to be instrumental is in shaping the global normative agenda on a “human-centric” approach to AI.7 The aim is to set up a framework for an ethics-driven and trustworthy development of AI technology and applications in line with European values as well as to prepare the groundwork for a global alliance in this domain. Although it has been criticized for focusing too much on legal and ethical guidelines, the EU sees itself as having a first-mover advantage as a regulatory powerhouse when it comes to ethical AI by setting the stage for global standards of design and usability and for ensuring legal clarity in AI-based applications. As shown by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s strategic edge primarily resides in its market, normative, and regulatory powers—what has been described as the “Brussels effect,”—though the digital single market is admittedly still a work in progress.8 However, while the European Commission’s digital sovereignty agenda may help advance certain AI developments in Europe, it is equally essential that the EU works closely with like-minded global partners on setting joint AI standards and regulations.
Yet regulations alone are not sufficient. The window of opportunity for consolidating a distinctive European approach to AI on the international stage is closing fast. What is needed is a reevaluation of European competitiveness in this field. Furthermore, Europe must critically assess and demonstrate foresight to take stock of the options it has at its disposal to shape AI in a way that leverages its comparative advantages and preserves its interests, especially in a world where technology is increasingly emerging as a key aspect of great-power competition, particularly between the United States and China. Fortunately, European leaders seem to recognize that more action is needed and have recently taken steps to upgrade Europe’s digital ecosystem, though it is still too early to see what these actions will amount to. France, Germany, and other EU member states have subsidized and tried to create or favor national champions in the tech and telecommunications sector for decades, usually with little impact.
This paper examines the national strategies of major European countries and significant EU initiatives in AI, with special attention to Europe’s leadership potential and capacity to combine its technological and industrial strengths with its agenda-setting and regulatory power. Though some municipal authorities in Europe are discussing proposals to regulate or limit the use of facial recognition and other AI-related technologies,9 the focus here is at the national and EU levels rather than the sub-national one. The paper starts by assessing Europe’s role in the global AI competition. It compares the national AI strategies of various European actors (including Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) and discusses government efforts to shore up Europe’s leadership position on AI. It then outlines and evaluates the EU’s distinctive approach and recent AI initiatives and goes on to explore strategic considerations facing European policymakers in a more competitive global environment. Finally, the paper puts forward recommendations toward a more coherent European AI strategy.
Europe’s Place in the Global AI Competition
The global competition in AI is fierce, between companies as well as states. Countries’ competitiveness can be measured in terms of market share, investment, and innovation prowess, as well as the strength of regulatory and ethical frameworks.
Market Share
When it comes to the global AI startup ecosystem, a study from 2018 noted that the top three players (measured in terms of number of AI startups) are the United States with 1,393 startups (40 percent), China with 383 startups (11 percent), and Israel with 362 startups (11 percent).10 Four European countries are among the top ten (the UK is in fourth place, France is in seventh, Germany is in eighth, and Sweden is in tenth). Collectively, though, Europe is second only to the United States, with 769 AI startups (22 percent of the global total). This shows that, while single European countries may not be globally competitive, Europe has the potential to be a major player in AI if it can strengthen its digital single market, though Brexit will have long-term consequences on such efforts.
Europe also lags in AI-related patent applications, though its filings for technologies related to the Internet of Things and the Fourth Industrial Revolution grew by 54 percent in 2016, driven mainly by increases in the UK, Germany, and France.11 The United States holds the most AI patent applications, receives the majority (66 percent) of AI-related private investment globally, and is home to the world’s highest-valued digital players (Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon).12 It therefore has a superior foundation for developing and implementing AI applications. But between 2013 and 2017, the number of patents in deep learning and AI published in China grew at a much faster rate than those in the United States.13 In 2017, China obtained 641 patents related to AI, compared with 130 in the United States.14
Moreover, Europe’s information technology assets are scattered across different countries. This is precisely why the establishment of the digital single market is considered so crucial for the EU’s global competitiveness. Fully completed, this would make the EU one of the largest and most valuable digital markets in the world. But the union needs to remove the remaining barriers to cross-border data flows and 5G networks, two tasks it is currently lagging behind on.15 The most recent factsheet from the European Commission from February 2019 stated that the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission had agreed on twenty-eight of the thirty legislative initiatives initially presented as part of the digital single market strategy launched in 2015.16 There are pending legislative initiatives that the European Parliament and the Council of the EU still need to agree on. The most important ones include the regulation of the cross-border portability of online content (geoblocking),17 the regulation of the free flow of nonpersonal data in the EU,18 and a regulation establishing a European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, which will pool EU and national funding to develop a pan-European infrastructure for supercomputing and to support related research and innovation activities.19
The European Commission has also taken nonlegislative steps to advance the digital single market strategy, including the Digital Education Action Plan,20 (which includes eleven actions to support the development of technology use and digital competence in education); the High Level Expert Group on AI (see below); and the Fintech Action Plan,21 (which includes initiatives to establish a more competitive and innovative financial market). The recent white paper on AI also proposes creating a “lighthouse center of research, innovation and expertise”;22 encouraging the flourishing of the European AI research community; and building world-class testing and experimentation sites across Europe. The continent is already home to one of the world’s largest nonprofit contract research institutes for software technology based on AI methods, an institute called the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.23 Founded in 1988, it has become Germany’s leading research center on innovative AI commercial software technology. On the same day the white paper was released, the European Commission also proposed a data strategy to promote a single data market and a European alternative for cloud-based services. While efforts to strengthen the digital single market are progressing, Brexit means a key European country is taking a different direction. With London being Europe’s most important AI hub, with 1,000 AI companies, thirty-five tech hubs, and reputed research centers such as the Alan Turing Institute,24 the loss of the UK could slow Europe’s collective progress on AI.
Translating basic research into applied research and innovation in the civil and defense sectors in Europe is another issue to be addressed.25 Continued advancement in AI requires collaboration between industry, academia, and government as well as the industrywide development of solutions. These are things that Europe is traditionally quite good at and that, combined with its strength in basic research, could provide a strategic advantage. European companies are also ahead of Chinese and American ones in the adoption of robotic process automation.26 Moreover, there are plenty of AI companies in Europe so establishing compliance regimes for them, as part of the European Commission’s ethical guidelines, could help spread EU norms on AI development and use.
Finally, European AI researchers enjoy excellent scientific standing, though as many AI journal and conference papers are published per year in China as in Europe.27 To some extent, the strength of cross-border academic research teams in Europe creates opportunities for cross-pollination with industry and government actors. Moreover, distributed but cooperative research clusters across Europe have the potential to help cross-pollination, and smaller initiatives are already laying the groundwork (including, for example, the Nordic AI Artificial Intelligence Institute,28 the Benelux Association for Artificial Intelligence,29 and the Robot Technology Transfer Network or ROBOTT-NET).30 There have been attempts to forge pan-European research networks such as the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE),31 supported by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence, and the AI4EU consortium supported by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 program.32 As identified by the recent white paper on AI, opportunities for further cooperation between member states to capitalize on each other’s strengths, as well as the advantages of cross-border and sectoral networks of excellence, could help Europe better exploit its existing potential on AI.
External Investment and Innovation Prowess
When it comes to investment, the United States and China are also ahead of Europe. The United States is by far the leader in AI-related investment and venture capital. Whereas its academic institutions conduct the majority of basic research, the private sector is very active in applying research done across the country and elsewhere. These academic and private-sector players are also exceptionally good at attracting top global talent.33 Meanwhile, Chinese AI startups benefit from close ties with the government, which give them access to huge amounts of public-sector funding and early-adopter institutions. For example, in the domain of facial recognition, the company CloudWalk received a $301 million grant from the Guangzhou Municipal Government in 2017,34 while Megvii raised $460 million in a funding round led by the central government’s venture capital fund.35
Despite a steady increase since 2008, Europe still lags behind the United States and China in private investment in AI. In 2016, Europe devoted only between 2.4–3.2 billion euros in investment funds, whereas Asia invested 6.5–9.7 billion euros and North America invested 12.1–18.6 billion euros.36 Private equity and venture capital firms have accounted for 75 percent of AI-related deal volume in Europe in the last ten years.37 Though reported amounts are difficult to compare because analysts use different definitions of AI, the UK, France, and Germany attracted the lion’s share of investment in AI companies over the past decade, evidence of a highly uneven European landscape.38 Moreover, while most AI-related investments in Europe are from European sources, many of the continent’s most successful digital companies—such as Skype (Estonia/Sweden),39 Shazam (UK),40 and Momondo (UK),41 among others—have been acquired by American or Chinese tech giants, making Europe a net importer of digital services despite its significant levels of innovation and many digital startups. The foreign-investment screening framework that the EU agreed to in April 2019, which seeks to protect critical technologies, could restrict Chinese investments into European AI startups.42
Innovation is paramount for the EU’s ability to remain competitive. Launched by the European Commission in October 2010, the Innovation Union—one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy—aims to improve conditions and access to finance for research and innovation.43 As far as R&D is concerned, Europe spends 0.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) less every year than the United States and 1.5 percent of GDP less than Japan.44 Its performance in innovation continues to improve.45 According to the 2019 edition of the European Innovation Scoreboard, the performance of twenty-four EU countries improved compared to the previous year, and the progress of lower-performing countries has accelerated compared to higher-performing countries. Since 2011, the EU’s average innovation performance has increased by nearly nine percentage points, and it even surpassed that of the United States for the first time in 2019. Within the EU, innovation performance has increased in twenty-five countries since 2011 with Sweden being the EU’s innovation leader in 2019, followed by Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands.46 Lithuania, Greece, Latvia, Malta, the UK, Estonia, and the Netherlands are the fastest-growing innovators.47
But China is catching up fast with a growth rate for innovation performance three times that of the EU, while Canada, Australia, and Japan all perform better than the EU.48 In China, industrial investments in R&D grew by 20 percent between 2017 and 2018, compared to 8 percent in the EU and 9 percent in the United States.49 However, the EU is home to only 33 unicorns, startups valued at over $1 billion, compared to 151 in the United States and 83 in China.50 Europe also has fewer young leading innovators. Europe’s private research, development, and innovation investments are lagging behind, representing 1.3 percent of EU GDP compared to 1.6 percent in China, 2 percent in the United States, 2.6 percent in Japan, and 3.3 percent in South Korea.51 R&D intensity—that is, gross expenditures on R&D as a percentage of GDP—can also provide insights into what innovation objectives governments are pursuing In 2018, the United States, Japan, and South Korea had the largest increases in R&D intensity. In the EU, gross R&D expenditures exceeded 2 percent for the first time, mainly due to positive trends in Germany, the UK, and Poland.52
Overall, in the context of an accelerating global drive for innovation, the EU must reinforce and implement its research, development, and innovation policy; maintain excellence in key enabling and dual-use technologies; and develop a European approach for critical technology infrastructure across the continent to sustain efforts to scale up and diffuse the use of technology.
Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks
When it comes to regulatory and ethical approaches, the EU fares better than the United States and China. Although the U.S. approach to AI has lacked an overall governmental strategy until recently, emphasizing the benefits of private sector innovation while keeping the government out of the way is not a new phenomenon for the country. Former president Barack Obama’s administration released two reports on AI: “The Future of Artificial Intelligence” and “AI, Automation and the Economy.”53 It also released three landmark studies on big data in 2014, 2015, and 2016.54 More recently, the administration of President Donald Trump has begun to shape its own approach with the launch of the American AI Initiative.55 The relevant executive order instructs the U.S. government to develop a plan to extend the United States’ lead in AI. The document aims to boost investment in AI research, standard setting, workforce training, and outreach to allies. However, while making clear that AI is a major priority, these policies have left some questions of implementation and the allocation of resources unaddressed. Congress has recently discussed new proposals to fund a national AI strategy.56
Moreover, the executive order and subsequent official documents have a heavy focus on protecting the United States’ AI advantage, and if this motive is accompanied by restrictions on cross-border flows of data, capital, talent, and know-how, it may hurt the country in the long run. Likewise, the Trump administration’s recent visa restrictions on foreign tech workers in the United States could also undermine an important source of U.S. competitiveness. In February 2020, the White House reportedly aimed to double the AI research budget: the 2021 budget proposal would increase nondefense AI R&D funding to nearly $2 billion and that for quantum computing to about $860 million over the next two years.57 In January 2020, the administration unveiled ten AI principles for federal government agencies to consider when drafting rules and laws for the use of AI in the private sector.58
These principles are informed by three main goals: to ensure public engagement; limit regulatory overreach; and promote trustworthy AI that is fair, transparent, and safe. As the deputy chief technology officer at the White House Office of Science and Technology, Lynne Parker, explained, the principles are broadly defined to allow each government agency to create more specific regulations tailored to its sector.59 The White House is attempting to address concerns over the ethics and oversight of AI without hampering innovation. The White House also launched a series of public consultations before devising a plan on how to implement the principles.60 Although the principles serve to guide federal agencies on how to devise rules on the use of AI, the administration makes it clear that the key concern is limiting regulatory overreach and avoiding overregulation, a concern it has voiced to its European allies in regard to the European Commission’s AI white paper.61
China’s ambition is to become the world leader in AI as part of the government’s Made in China 2025 initiative. Beijing believes that AI technology is key to future global military and economic competition.62 In July 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published its “Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan,”63 which sets clear targets: to reach the same level in AI as the United States by 2020, to become the world’s premier AI innovation center by 2030, and to build a domestic AI industry worth 150 billion renminbi ($22.2 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion renminbi ($59.1 billion) by 2025.64
The China Electronics Standardization Institute, under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is one of the key players in the country, having launched in January 2018 the “Artificial Intelligence Standardization White Paper,” which outlines the country’s national AI standardization framework and plan for AI capability development.65 Since the release of the white paper, the institute has been actively engaged in developing relevant international standards, including as an active member of the subcommittee of the International Organization for Standardization, which develops international standards for the AI industry.66 Chinese AI products are becoming harder to export as Western scrutiny about data privacy standards and security risks grows (as seen in the recent concerns about Huawei and 5G). Overall, however, China’s AI strategy has been called the most comprehensive and most ambitious in the world.67
The country is also seeking to promote international partnerships on AI, as part of its efforts to set norms in this field and export its government-surveillance practices to other countries. As part of its Digital Silk Road, Beijing is investing heavily in digital infrastructure and in other countries to spread its approach to AI, which Beijing hopes will move these countries closer to its own governance model and make them more dependent on China. A related worrisome development is China’s testing and use of AI for censorship, repression, and extensive surveillance through initiatives like its pilot social credit systems.68 On top of this, Beijing is paying significant attention to the role of AI in national security in the belief that integrating AI into military technologies can allow China to overtake the United States in military supremacy.69
The EU’s white paper on AI and any future legislation are likely to influence the global regulatory debate. Here the EU’s experience with data privacy regulations such as the GDPR can serve an example of the Brussels effect by establishing global norms for emerging technologies. The GDPR seeks to incentivize companies to find innovative solutions for processing data within its legal remit. The principle of accountability enshrined in the GDPR aims to foster data accuracy; it implies increasing trust in the source of such data and the reliability of results based on this data. Ultimately, the EU’s focus on protecting user privacy could be an asset if it enables European innovators to build AI applications that are more consumer friendly. Since regulating AI also requires other regulations such as data protection and content moderation as preconditions, the EU is rather well positioned on this front.
Europeans could be more readily accepting of AI technologies that respect fundamental rights and consumer rights, and the use of such technologies might rapidly emerge as global standards materialize, granting Europe a first-mover advantage. This is especially the case when it comes to what the white paper identifies as high-risk AI applications (such as uses related to healthcare, transport, energy, and the public sector). Moreover, efforts to build trust (via the GDPR or future AI legislation) are important, but since the implications of advanced AI are not yet clear, neither are the policy measures that will be needed to properly address risks. Depending on how it is interpreted and enforced,70 the GDPR could become a unique comparative advantage for the EU when it comes to making good on its ambitions to become a leader in “trustworthy AI.”71
AI has the potential to have significantly negative impacts on societies globally. Concerns about technologically driven or exacerbated unemployment are quite real in many countries, and rising technology-induced displacement of jobs could contribute to increased support for populist parties and movements, which could destabilize democracies around the world. The EU’s focus on responsible and safe AI early on could give it an edge when it comes to setting ethical and regulatory standards. The EU’s approach would not regulate the technology as such, nor its applications, but rather would help guide how the applications are developed and deployed. By reporting, monitoring, and analyzing the progress of AI, the EU could position itself to define quality, build alliances with like-minded partners, and lead multilateral initiatives.
In sum, Europe is behind the United States and China on many of the key dimensions of AI competitiveness but ahead on regulatory approaches. A viable European strategy for competing would therefore include redoubled efforts to catch up when it comes to AI research and innovation, investment, data, and adoption, while simultaneously seeking to leverage Europe’s first-mover advantage on establishing regulatory frameworks pertaining to AI development and use.
National European Efforts on AI
European policymakers at the EU and national levels appear to recognize the importance of AI. For example, in November 2018, Chancellor Angela Merkel approved Germany’s 3 billion euro plan for AI, stating that “[t]oday, Germany cannot claim to be among the world leaders in artificial intelligence. Our aspiration is to make ‘Made in Germany’ a trademark also in artificial intelligence, and to ensure that Germany takes its place as one of the leading [AI] countries in the world.”72 Similarly, French President Emmanuel Macron has emphasized the importance of AI for France and the EU. In March 2018, he said: “I think artificial intelligence will disrupt all the different business models and it’s the next disruption to come. So I want to be part of it. Otherwise I will just be subjected to this disruption without creating jobs in this country.”73 Other European leaders have also increasingly expressed interest in AI and the need for European competitiveness in this field. These comments demonstrate a rising sense of urgency across European capitals around the importance of AI and for Europe to play a leading role in the digital age.
They also reflect a growing realization that more digital sovereignty is a prerequisite for great-power status and that such status is becoming even more strategically important as new and emerging technologies such as AI could concentrate economic power in extraordinary ways. Compared to previous industrial revolutions that harnessed the powers of steam, electricity, and computers, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is unique primarily due to the unprecedented scale, fast convergence, and yet-to-be discovered impact of emerging technological breakthroughs (including AI and especially the subfield of machine learning.) From this perspective, economic and political power will evolve in major ways, potentially shifting power toward a few powerful digital monopolies and tech giants while also enabling new and disruptive companies to quickly rise.
To mitigate this wave of transformations, several European countries—notably Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK—have developed AI strategies, with others planning to do so in the near future (see table 1). To a varying degree, these strategies outline specific actions, commit significant amounts of money to AI development, and seek to uphold European values and advance AI in an ethical manner that clearly benefits society.74 The following analysis of national approaches to AI encompasses four dimensions: government investment, private-sector innovation, the public-private AI ecosystem, and regulations and ethics.

France
France’s approach to AI was first delineated in a 2018 government-commissioned report (the Villani report) called “For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence: Toward a French and European Strategy.”75 Noteworthy here is the use of the word “European” in the title. This strategic document crystalizes a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to AI that emphasizes more public research, resources, training, transfers, and innovation in four strategic sectors (healthcare, the environment, transportation and mobility, and defense and security.)76 Research on and the development of AI technologies is made interdisciplinary and inclusive by including social scientists, eliminating potential biases in algorithms, exploring the complementarity of humans and AI in human-machine interactions, and promoting gender equality in scientific and technical sectors.77
The strategy also recognizes the necessity of considering the European data ecosystem as a common good, in which public authorities should introduce “new ways of producing, sharing and governing data.”78 It stresses the need to prevent the brain drain of France’s leading experts in the field, making AI understandable to society at large, strengthening R&D in AI technologies in meaningful and ethical ways, and increasing the gender balance and diversity in the field. Macron has announced 1.5 billion euros of public funding into AI by 2022. He has also emphasized leading “the European way” in this field, though it is unclear what precisely he means by this and whether it means pursuing a middle ground between the approaches of the United States and China.79
France’s AI strategy focuses on four major challenges: reinforcing the ecosystem to attract the best talent, developing an open data policy particularly in sectors where the country is already competitive, creating a regulatory and financial framework that favors emerging AI businesses, and developing AI regulations with respect to ethics and acceptable standards for citizens.80 On the one hand, the centralized nature of France’s political system can enable government agencies to set the parameters for AI applications in certain areas. On the other hand, centralized control of innovation can in the long run impede progress, as AI requires a broad spectrum of R&D and applications across different fields. Additionally, though it is well known for having a strong skills base in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), France lacks academic institutions and researchers actively and directly involved in AI research compared to the UK and Germany.
To meet the need for increased cooperation between industry actors and universities, France’s planned centers for AI excellence may help to bring together researchers, developers, and users to ensure that scientific progress translates into industrial applications. This could also make the French R&D landscape more attractive to top international talent. The Station F campus in Paris was created to enable AI startups to receive advice on legal issues and the impact of new AI technologies in France from thirty nearby public institutions. France’s push on AI is already showing signs of paying off. According to one report, France had raised $1.2 billion in investment for AI startups by the end of 2019,81 making it Europe’s frontrunner in AI funding ahead of the UK.82
The French strategy emphasizes ethical considerations related to AI (such as the implications of self-driving cars, facial/image recognition, and privacy) as well as inclusivity and diversity (such as a goal of reaching a 40 percent share of female students in “digital subject areas” by 2020)—areas that are deemed important in terms of sustainable growth and future societal resilience.83 The French strategy is detailed and outlines concrete steps for making the country more attractive to research, talent, and industry actors; how to improve transparency and AI cooperation between different actors; and how to integrate moral and ethical issues. It is one of the more ambitious European AI strategies: it includes more details than Germany’s, a timeline (unlike the UK’s strategy), and specific policies to achieve its goals.
The French AI strategy stands out for its government-led, top-down approach. This illustrates how much the government sees AI as strategically important. Yet it is unclear if this approach will create a sustainable ecosystem in which private sector–driven development and public-sector uptake will flourish. France’s focus on creating a European data ecosystem and Macron’s advocacy for a stronger EU could be positive for the continent’s AI landscape. An additional impetus for him is to position France as a destination for technology companies after Brexit. Companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, IBM, Samsung, and Microsoft have already opened or announced the creation of AI research centers in Paris.84
The UK
The UK’s AI strategy witnessed several major developments in 2018. These included the creation of new institutional structures such as the Office on AI and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation; the release of a new AI Sector Deal policy paper to spearhead cooperation between various governmental agencies and institutions, private companies, and academic centers; a large package of investment; and the publication of the report by the House of Lords’ AI Select Committee on the country’s new level of ambition in setting the agenda in ethical AI.85 In April 2018, the government announced an investment of nearly 1 billion pounds for its “AI Sector Deal,” made up of 603 million euros in new government, industry, and academic spending, and up to 342 million pounds in previously announced state funding.86 However, the document has been criticized for not setting a clear timeline for these investments.87
The “AI Sector Deal” paper focuses on the five foundations of the UK’s industrial strategy: ideas, people, infrastructure, the business environment, and places. It also sets out a vision to respond to challenges and opportunities presented by AI based on: making the country a global center for AI by investing in R&D, skills, and regulatory innovation; supporting sectors to boost productivity through AI and data analytics; leading the world in the safe and ethical use of data and strengthening digital capabilities by establishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation; and helping people develop the skills needed for the jobs of the future.88 The policy paper was a response to a report on the country’s industry and its potential to remain at the forefront of AI development and use and retain its world-leading status.89
These governmental initiatives aim to build a more coherent national narrative on AI and to rationalize existing thinly dispersed and uncoordinated institutional initiatives across various technological domains such as AI, autonomous systems, and robotics so as to meet the UK’s stated ambition to become a world leader in these sectors.90 While the country’s AI research is influential globally and while London has the highest concentration of AI startups in Europe as well as a strong ability to attract international investment in start-ups, the commercialization of research traditionally is a weakness for the UK.91 It remains to be seen whether the “AI Sector Deal” will help fix this shortcoming by spurring cooperation between the private sector and academia. While the UK strategy does a fine job of identifying national strengths and outlining areas where targeted investments are needed to address weaknesses, the absence of a clear timeline for any of these investments is notable.
Additionally, with the possibility looming that the country may not reach a post-Brexit relationship agreement with the EU, it is unclear how the UK will continue to attract talent and investment from Europe, and the “AI Sector Deal” does not address this eventuality. Conversely, the UK accounts for nearly one-fifth of AI researchers in the EU, it is only behind the Netherlands in terms of the quality of AI research papers produced, it has a tradition of leading the EU in collaborating with third countries, and nearly 40 percent of European AI firms that have received at least $1 million in funding are based in the country.92 Nevertheless, with France eager to create a European data ecosystem and with Brexit potentially causing international technology companies to move from London to the rest of Europe, the UK may lose out not only on EU research funding but also on access to the European data pool. Similarly, collaboration between UK universities and European counterparts will suffer as they lose out on lucrative EU-funded partnerships and grants. While the “AI Sector Deal” is well thought-out and has broad support from industry, academia, and the government, it is unclear if it will be able to prevent or mitigate the potentially damaging ripple effects Brexit will have on the country’s AI landscape.
Germany
Significantly shorter than its French equivalent, Germany’s AI strategy sets out twelve areas to address by 2025.93 These include: making Germany and Europe a leader in AI research to excel in future innovation, setting up innovation competitions and European innovation clusters, improving AI-related technology transfers to the economy and the middle class, establishing incentives for investors and founders of AI startups, promoting digital skills and AI-related education, and improving talent attraction and retention. From 2019 to 2025, the country aims to spend 500 million euros annually in support of these goals, which is more money over a longer timeframe than France’s AI funding.94
The strategy emphasizes having government administrators employ AI to offer better and more efficient services for citizens; making data available and facilitating its use; adjusting the country’s legislative framework to include algorithms and AI-based decisions, services, and products; establishing AI standards and norms on national, European, and international levels; ensuring national and international cooperation on AI-related developments; and establishing a broad public dialogue and encouraging political participation to incorporate AI into society in ways that the public deems ethically, legally, and institutionally correct. In addition, in October 2019, the Data Ethics Commission released guidelines for the development and use of AI, guidelines that became a model for the EU’s white paper.95
Germany seems committed to pursuing the responsible development and use of AI. It builds on the strengths of its economy and aims to expand them by improving the transfer of innovations into industry. Its strategy has a wide scope and allocates more funding to AI than other European strategies, but it does not go into many details or the specific allocation of funds to meet its twelve stated priorities. The strategy’s focus on research volume and technology transfers ignores the fact that Germany is late to the AI game and does not have innovation hot spots like Cambridge or Zurich.96 The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, however, is considered the world’s largest nonprofit contract research institute for software technology based on AI.97 Additionally, the majority of German universities are not allowed to pay salaries comparable to what top researchers might receive in the United States or China, which makes the prospect of attracting talent attraction even more difficult—an issue the strategy largely ignored.98
Sweden
Sweden’s “National Approach for Artificial Intelligence,” released in May 2018, outlines what is needed for the country to be at the forefront of AI development and use.99 While it does not include specific policies on how to achieve its stated objectives, the goals of the government include: developing standards and principles for safe, sustainable, and ethical AI; improving the digital infrastructure to leverage existing opportunities; increasing access to data; and playing an active role within the EU efforts. The strategy stresses the country’s lack of skilled AI professionals and the need to increase basic and applied AI research within a legal framework that ensures sustainable (defined as ethical, reliable, safe, and transparent) AI development.
The government has since implemented several targeted initiatives to achieve its goals and has made good progress. Nonetheless, the strategy could benefit from the formulation of specific policies and the commitment of AI-designated funds to strategic initiatives. To further guide the country’s efforts and to promote a Swedish model for AI, a national AI council—similar to the one in Finland—has been established to bring together private-sector representatives, academics, and other experts.100
Since May 2018, the government has invested around 3.7 million euros in several universities to help train AI professionals.101 It also launched an AI Data Factory and Arena at the Lindholmen Science Park in Gothenburg to enable collaboration and strengthen Swedish companies.102 Since then, it has developed into a national center for AI called AI Innovation of Sweden, bringing together some fifty different partners.103 The Swedish innovation agency, Vinnova, has also launched several AI-related projects, such as e-healthcare systems for home care, use of AI in breast cancer screenings, and AI-controlled vehicles in mining operations.104
Another player is the government-funded research institute Rise, which has some sixty employees working on AI-related projects.105 Besides government funding for AI, Sweden also benefits from strong investment from the private sector and a strong innovation climate with successful incubators and access to venture capital. In particular, the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) plans to generate 520 million euros by 2029 toward AI research in Sweden.106 WASP includes some forty Swedish companies and academic institutions, and it focuses on machine learning, deep learning, and explainable AI.107 Another notable commercial effort is Zenuity, a joint venture led by Volvo Cars to provide SEK with 95 million euros for research into self-driving cars.108
Finland
Finland released “Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence” AI strategy in December 2017.109 It takes a more bottom-up approach to AI than most other European countries and was produced by a working group on artificial intelligence. Some major intellectual and policy outputs have been the August 2018 report “Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence—Four Perspectives on the Economy, Employment, Skills and Ethics” produced by a working group on the transformation of society and work and the June 2019 final report of Finland’s Artificial Intelligence Program called “Leading the Way Into the Era of Artificial Intelligence.”110 To assist in drafting an AI development strategy and to provide advice to the government, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment established a national steering group headed by former president of Nokia Pekka Ala-Pietilä, who now chairs the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI HLEG).111
While the strategies of other countries focus primarily on either talent or upskilling with regard to AI, Finland’s stands out by emphasizing the need to “train, retain and attract AI talent through stronger investment and enhanced visibility of Finnish AI expertise” as AI transforms society.112 The Finnish approach to staying competitive globally in AI is to train the population and educate it on the potential impacts on society. According to Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä, the government acknowledges that Finland does not have the resource advantage that bigger countries have, so the goal is to become a leader in “practical applications of AI.”113 A good example of this approach to educating citizens is “Elements of AI,” a free and first-of-its-kind online course designed to raise AI literacy and to be accessible to all for training purposes.114 Recent efforts to educate the population also include the 1 percent scheme, which focuses on teaching 1 percent of the population (about 55,000 people) the basics of AI, while slowly increasing the number of people trained as the years go on.115
One aspect of Finland’s strategy that has been praised is the inclusion of a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. In its guidelines for creating an AI national strategy, the World Economic Forum highlights that the process should begin with such an assessment as it will help keep the strategic goals in line with what a given “country requires in terms of demographic needs, strategic priorities, urgent concerns, the aspirations of its citizens, its resource constraints and geopolitical consequences.”116
Further steps the government intends to take include creating a plan for bringing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on board, in addition to plans for Finland to partner with Estonia and Sweden in an effort to form Europe’s top laboratory for AI test trials.117 Finland’s goals in AI are part of a bigger strategic vision for the country. As Ilona Lundström, a director general at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and one of the masterminds behind the AI strategy, states: “We are using AI as the flagship project for a bigger kind of setup of themes of digitalization.”118 Recently, Finland announced plans to offer its online course on AI to all EU citizens free of charge.119
Estonia
As a pioneer in e-governance and one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world, Estonia has a strong technological foundation. The country also has an impressive history of producing unicorn start-ups—or privately owned companies valued at over $1 billion each—including Skype, Playtech, TransferWise, and Bolt—though at least one of these firms has since been acquired by a publicly traded corporation.120 The government is now seeking to build on its tech-savvy society with the help of AI. Estonian experts assessed the ways in which the private and public sectors could engage more with AI in the 2019 Kratt report.121 (Experts decided to refer to AI as Kratt, an Estonian mythical creature that is “devoted to serving its master but can become bad if left idle.”)122 Its proposals informed a short-term (2019–2021) AI strategy. The government plans to invest at least 10 million euros to implement the strategy and aims to produce a long-term plan in the near future.123 Estonia strongly emphasizes public-sector adaptation, increased investment, R&D, and the promotion of ethical and trustworthy AI. Its short-term approach might be beneficial as a test case for deriving best practices and lessons to inform a more long-term strategic approach.
The strategy also places more emphasis on AI in the public sector, where Estonia strives to have a competitive edge as it believes this aspect of AI receives the least attention from the rest of the world.124 The government’s goal of applying AI solutions in the public sector is for it to “increase the user-centeredness of services, improve the process of data analysis, and make the country work more efficiently.”125 The country also already has been actively implementing AI across society. In late 2019, the country introduced its first component of AI-based applications with a text-analysis tool126 that has been embedded into the government’s public code repository, which makes software solutions built for the public more effective and accessible. Additionally, according to the government, since October 2019, there are at least twenty-three AI solutions deployed in the public sector, with the goal of having at least fifty AI use cases by the end of 2020.127 One of these solutions includes the use of predictive analytics to help decide where to send police officers for directing traffic. The most ambitious project planned is an “AI Judge” that will help decide some small-claims cases in court.128
Czechia
Czechia released its national strategy for AI in May 2019.129 Largely in line with the European Commission’s “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence,” the Czechs’ national approach seeks opportunities for deeper engagement with EU-level initiatives and aims to make the country an innovation leader in the field. The strategy splits its objectives into three parts: short term (by 2021), medium term (by 2027), and long term (by 2035).
Similar to the EU-level and national strategies of other members states listed above, Czechia aims to develop responsible and trusted AI in accordance with EU guidelines, invest in R&D, and support startups and identify opportunities for economic growth by increasing employment and upskilling workers. Recently the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics has been given the opportunity to establish a European Center of Excellence for Industrial Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, with almost 50 million euros in startup support from the Research and Innovation Center on Advanced Industrial Production.130 Czechia showcases the EU’s potential to set a certain strategic vision for member states for developing trustworthy AI, implementing EU-wide guidelines, and creating added value when it comes to a common European approach.
Other European National Efforts
Other European countries that have recently published AI strategies include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and Spain.131 Meanwhile, several other countries are working on one. In addition, Austria, Ireland, and Italy have established national AI task forces. Portugal, Romania, and Spain have included AI in their national digitization strategies. Most of these initiatives emphasize, among other things, strengthening national research as the basis of AI; setting up AI centers; committing to supporting industry and SMEs; and improving data sharing between the public, industry actors, and the public sector.132
National AI Strategies: More Than the Sum of Their Parts?
EU member states’ individual national strategies sometimes contain references to the EU’s collective AI plan, but some have also impacted the EU strategy. While Europe’s diverse AI strategies all tend to focus on labor-market impacts, many of them also stress ethical challenges in the commercialization, scaling, and research of AI. The fact that EU member states have very different levels of readiness—as some member states do not yet have AI strategies while others have fully developed AI plans—demonstrates further the fragmentation of the European digital market, with Northern European countries generally leading the way, while Southern and Eastern European ones tending to lag behind (with some notable exceptions).133
While many of the European national strategies recognize AI as an engine of economic growth and accelerator of digital change, they hardly share a common definition of what constitutes AI. This matters from a regulatory point of view as AI might run the risk of becoming a definitional moving target, especially in view of a future EU regulatory framework and the design of any new legal instruments. Moreover, any common definition would need to be flexible enough to capture the evolving nature of the technology while providing enough legal clarity for enforcement.
The emphasis on ethical and sustainability issues in the national strategies also reflects a shared understanding of the risks (societal, economic, or security) that AI entails. The broad goals set out in many of these strategies seek to impact different levels of society and the economy at once, a state of affairs that increases the complexity of policies required to achieve these goals as well as the difficulty of measuring success. Because of their fuzzy definitions of AI, some European strategies also lack measurable goals and benchmarks (although these are inherently difficult to craft.)
The European strategies differ most from non-European ones in their heavy focus on ethical, trustworthy, and sustainable development and use of AI systems and services. This normative framing prioritizing a human-centric approach to AI—if further clarified, deepened, and supported by legal certainty—could provide a much-needed competitive advantage for European AI products and services by inspiring more consumer confidence and by providing a roadmap for the regulation of such products. At the same time, the goal should be to avoid hollow rhetorical declarations or overregulation that could impede innovation, commercialization, and uptake. In particular, uncertainty and vague declarations can risk scaring away startups and keep venture capitalists from investing in Europe.
In addition to strictly national efforts, there are also positive examples of cooperative agreements on AI between individual member states—such as the ones between France and Germany and between France and Finland. These agreements are important examples of member states working bilaterally to strengthen the EU’s cross-border cooperation in AI. New cooperation platforms with relevance for AI innovation between European countries are also emerging. One prominent example is the Franco-German Joint European Disruptive Initiative (JEDI) launched in 2018. Modeled after the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), this body will identify and support technological challenges likely to disrupt existing industries. For 2018, JEDI was allocated an initial budget of 235 million euros with the goal of increasing funding to 1 billion euros a year once the initiative is fully operational.134
Assessing the EU’s Approach To AI
In addition to national-level efforts, the EU has developed policies and funding opportunities to help advance Europe’s role on AI in recent years.
EU Funding for AI Research and Development
One major role the EU plays is through its funding mechanisms. As part of the EU budget now being negotiated, the multiannual financial framework for 2021–2027, the European Commission has proposed a Digital Europe Program as part of the Single Market, Innovation and Digital chapter. This puts forward 9.2 billion euros for investments in high-performance computing and data, AI, cybersecurity, and advanced digital skills.135 By building on the Digital Single Market Strategy that the European Commission launched in 2015, the goal is to prepare citizens for the digital age and to boost the digitalization of Europe. Since 2004, AI has been included in EU funding for R&D, with a heavy focus on robotics. In the 2014–2020 period, investments in robotics increased by 700 million euros.136 This came on top of 2.1 billion euros in private investment in the EU research program called the Partnership for Robotics in Europe, or SPARC euRobotics.137 It is still unclear how the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will affect the size and priorities of the long-term EU budget.
Under the current EU budget (2014–2020), the European Structural and Investment Funds provide 27 billion euros on skills development, out of which the European Social Fund invests 2.3 billion euros in digital skills.138 The AI4EU project—a grant agreement between the European Commission and seventy-nine private-sector and academic institutions in twenty-one member states—was launched in January 2019.139 It aims to mobilize and promote the European AI ecosystem and provide access to essential AI resources for all users in the EU. The 20-million-euro project will run for three years and will try to establish a network of AI knowledge, tools, and research across the EU. The European Investment Fund has promised to make available 100 million euros in 2020 to support promising AI startups.140 Jean-Eric Paquet, the European Commission’s director general for research and innovation, has said that the fund will seek to close the investment gap the EU faces “by providing equity and grant funding to early stage firms in so-called deep tech, such as manufacturing, biotechnology, health-tech and artificial intelligence.”141 This allocation may be followed by a 3.5 billion euro investment fund in 2021, which will invest in early-stage technology in an effort to increase innovation.142
Between 2014 and 2017, the EU invested around 1.1 billion euros in AI-related research under the multi-annual R&D funding program Horizon 2020.143 Under Horizon Europe, Horizon 2020’s successor, the European Commission proposes to invest 100 billion euros for research and innovation to strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases; boost its innovation capacity, competitiveness, and jobs; and deliver on citizens’ priorities and sustain Europe’s socioeconomic model and values.144 The strategic planning process will focus in particular on the pillar addressing global challenges and European industrial competitiveness, which includes a digital and industry cluster with key digital technologies, AI and robotics, and advanced computing and big data as key areas of intervention.
The new European Commission has made investing in AI a top priority as part of its efforts to strengthen the EU’s digital sovereignty, so that users will have more choice and control over which IT products and services they use. The February 2020 white paper on AI notes that in the last three years “EU funding for research and innovation for AI has risen to 1.5 billion [euros], i.e. a 70% increase compared to the previous period,” but it equally points out that “investment in research and innovation in Europe is still a fraction of the public and private investment in other regions of the world.” More precisely, it notes that “3.2 billion [euros] were invested in AI in Europe in 2016, compared to around 12.1 billion [euros] in North America and 6.5 billion [euros] in Asia.”145
To bridge such a gap, the European Commission plans to revise the December 2018 “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence” by the end of 2020 as a follow-up to the public consultation on the white paper. To help fulfill the white paper’s recommendation to lay the groundwork for increased coordination with EU member states, it plans to attract over 20 billion euros in annual investment in AI in the EU over the next decade.146 As far as SMEs and startups are concerned, the European Commission and the European Investment Fund will launch a “pilot scheme of 100 million [euros] in Q1 2020 to provide equity financing for innovative developments in AI.”147 The negative economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic raises questions about how much money the next multiannual financial framework can allocate toward AI R&D given potential budget cuts and diverging priorities. The European Commission has recently identified AI as one of the core areas where the EU needs to invest more as part of the post-pandemic economic recovery.148
The European Commission’s Evolving Approach
Besides providing funding for R&D, the European Commission has sought to shape a common approach to AI in other ways (see table 2).

			The AI4EU project brings together seventy-nine top research institutes, SMEs, and large enterprises in twenty-one countries to build a focal point for AI resources, including data repositories, computing power, tools, and algorithms.150 It aims to offer services and provide support to potential users of the technology as well as help them test and integrate AI solutions in their processes, products and services.


April 8, 2019
The HLEG publishes the “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.”

			The guidelines put forward a human-centric approach to AI and list seven key requirements that AI systems should meet in order to be trustworthy.151


April 8, 2019
The European Commission issues a “Communication on Building Trust in Human Centric AI.”

			This indicates the seven requirements that all AI applications should comply with to be considered trustworthy: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, nondiscrimination, and fairness; societal and environmental well-being; and accountability.152 The principles identified in the communication come from the HLEG with the primary aim of drafting AI ethics guidelines based on the existing regulatory framework, which should be applied by all developers, suppliers, and users of AI.


June 26, 2019
The HLEG publishes “Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.”

			This document puts forward thirty-three recommendations that can guide trustworthy AI toward sustainability, growth and competitiveness, as well as inclusion—while empowering, benefiting and protecting human beings.

			The recommendations aim to help the European Commission and member states to update the coordinated plan by the end of 2019.153


June 26, 2019 
The HLEG launches the pilot phase of the “Assessment List of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,” which is to last until December 1, 2019.


February 19, 2020
The European Commission releases the “White Paper on Artificial Intelligence—A European Approach to Excellence and Trust,” a “European Strategy for Data,” and “A Strategy for Europe Fit for the Digital Age.”

			To achieve an ecosystem of excellence, the European Commission proposes to streamline research, foster collaboration between member states, and increase investment in AI development and deployment. These actions build on the coordinated plan on AI from December 2018.

			To achieve an ecosystem of trust, the European Commission presents options on creating a legal framework that addresses the risks for fundamental rights and safety. This builds on the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, which were tested by companies in late 2019. A legal framework should be principles-based and focus on high-risk AI systems to avoid unnecessary obstacles to innovating companies.

			The European Commission conducted a public consultation on the white paper until May 31, 2020, and it plans to present proposals for a regulatory framework in December 2020.



An early effort came in April 2018 when twenty-four member states and Norway agreed on a “declaration of cooperation on artificial intelligence.”154 Since then, the other members and the UK have also signed on to this statement.155 The nonbinding declaration called for “a comprehensive and integrated European approach on AI” and included language on cooperation to boost the EU’s technological and industrial capacity by improving access to public-sector data, addressing socioeconomic challenges, and ensuring an adequate legal and ethical framework.
This communication mentions the new threats AI pose before discussing the opportunities. This is in sharp contrast to other countries’ emphasis on opportunities, though this is hardly surprising given the purpose of the EU document is to justify future regulations. In 2018, Mariya Gabriel, then commissioner for digital economy and society, said the “enhanced cooperation efforts will focus on reinforcing European AI research centers, creating synergies in R&D&I [research and development and innovation] funding schemes across Europe, and exchanging views on the impact of AI on society and the economy.”156 The group has engaged in a continuous dialogue with the European Commission, which acts as a facilitator, to promote a new framework for collaboration between countries. The declaration illustrates the commitment of member states to advancing the EU’s role in AI and enhancing coordination among themselves.
Simultaneously in 2018, the European Commission put forward more concrete ideas about a European approach in its “Communication on AI.”157 This was based on three pillars that then formed the backbone for the subsequent coordinated action plan on AI.158 The first pillar is keeping ahead of technological developments and encouraging acceptance of AI by the public and private sectors. The second pillar is to address socioeconomic changes brought about by AI through, for instance, efforts to attract AI talent, support digital skills and STEM education development, and encourage member states to modernize their education and training systems. The third pillar is to ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework and legal clarity for AI by developing ethics guidelines and guidance on the interpretation of the EU Product Liability Directive with regard to AI.
Building on the “Communication on AI,” the European Commission released a “Coordinated Action Plan” in December 2018.159 This nonbinding document emphasizes that stronger coordination is essential for Europe “to become the world-leading region for developing and deploying cutting-edge, ethical and secure AI.” It proposes joint actions for closer and more efficient cooperation between the member states, Norway, Switzerland, and the European Commission in four key areas.160 The first area is maximizing investment through increased coordination and partnerships. Joint actions to achieve this goal include: all member states having AI strategies in place by mid-2019, a new EU-AI public-private partnership, a new AI scale-up fund for startups and innovators, and the development of world-leading AI centers (through digital innovation hubs and the EU Innovation Council pilot initiative.)161 The second area is creating European data spaces to make more data available and help share this data seamlessly across borders while complying with the GDPR. As part of this effort, a support center for data sharing went live in July 2019. The third area is fostering talent, skills, and lifelong learning. Measures include supporting advanced AI-related degrees through dedicated scholarships, supporting digital skills and learning, ensuring AI’s presence in education programs to ensure human-centered AI development, and attracting talent through the Blue Card system. The fourth area is developing ethical AI and ensuring trust. The aim here is develop AI technology that respects fundamental rights and ethical rules with the ambition to bring this ethics-driven approach to the global stage.
At the time, then vice-president for the digital single market Andrus Ansip noted that the EU would work to pool data and coordinate investments with the aim of reaching at least 20 billion euros in private and public investments by the end of 2020.162 Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel added that the coordination action plan would help Europe compete better globally “while safeguarding trust and respecting ethical values.”163 Its full implementation will be a key task for the current European Commission, which will serve until 2024, and will be contingent on funding as part of the next multiannual financial framework.
The High-Level Expert Group on AI
To support the articulation of a European strategy, the European Commission established the AI HLEG in June 2018, which consists of fifty-two figures from academia, the private sector, and civil society.164 The group launched a consultation process in December 2018, and in April 2019 it published “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,” outlining the EU’s approach to set ethical guidelines and increase investment in AI.165 The guidelines define “trustworthy AI” as having three principal components: lawfulness, ethical adherence, and robustness.166 The guidelines include many of the common themes in member states’ strategies, such as transparency, safety, and fairness and nondiscrimination, but they also cover some issues less often associated with AI such as the environment.
Additionally, the guidelines list seven key requirements based on fundamental rights and ethical principles that AI systems should meet to be considered trustworthy. These are: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being; and accountability. The HLEG states that this “trustworthy approach” is key to enabling what it calls “responsible competitiveness” by providing a foundation of trust for those who will be affected by AI systems. While the guidelines were a good first step in the right direction for what the EU wants to accomplish, the fact that they are nonbinding may limit their usefulness as self-regulation seems unlikely to work (as seen in dealing with privacy issues).167 Companies and government entities using AI technology should be accountable to laws and not merely self-regulation or industry codes of ethics so that consumers can understand and potentially challenge decisions made using AI.
In June 2019, the HLEG published a document called “Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.”168 This document calls for significant new investment and resources dedicated to transforming the regulatory and investment environment for trustworthy AI in Europe. The plan consists of thirty-three recommendations to guide trustworthy AI toward “sustainability, growth and competitiveness, as well as inclusion—while empowering, benefiting and protecting human beings.” These recommendations are directed at a wide range of actors, including governments, SMEs, and academia.
The first part of the report focuses on the four main areas where there can be a positive impact from trustworthy AI: humans and society at large, the private sector, the public sector, and research and academia. The recommendations serve as a basis for providing actions that can be taken while striving toward creating trustworthy AI, in addition to highlighting critical areas where Europe is falling behind, such as in the area of talent acquisition and retention.169 In addition to the recommendations, the HLEG also assesses four main enablers for achieving positive impact in the areas of focus: data and infrastructure, skills and education, appropriate governance and regulation, and funding and investment.
The guidelines have been criticized on some grounds. Some experts argue that the EU cannot compete on ethics and regulation of AI alone, especially when it lacks the necessary ecosystem and infrastructure for AI.170 Others have pointed to undue influence by industry actors.171 Along with the ethics guidelines, the HLEG released an assessment list that offers guidance to help put these guidelines into practice while also collecting feedback from organizations working on AI. The list was piloted across Europe from June to December 2019, with over 450 stakeholders registered in the piloting process as part of the European AI Alliance, a broad multi-stakeholder platform where members of the public can engage with the HLEG on AI-related policymaking.172 Common critical feedback relates to difficulties related to the need to understand and explain how AI algorithms make decisions to build trust with the public, issues with vague transparency requirements, and problems with redundant requirements.173 The HLEG is now in the process of updating and revising the assessment list based on stakeholders’ feedback. Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager has claimed that “a very high number” of private companies have endorsed the HLEG’s principles.174 The HLEG will likely publish a detailed report and revised version of the assessment list based on the consultation period in mid-2020, to help the public and the private sectors operationalize the guidelines as well as to guide the process of design, development, and deployment of AI technologies.
Although they can be useful, multi-stakeholder groups are often difficult to manage and may become influenced by specific interest groups. There have been critical voices within the HLEG arguing that its agenda has been captured by business interests, due to the imbalanced composition of the group. Some external voices have also challenged the idea of regulating AI risks, citing concerns over stifling innovation and hampering startups, and instead they are calling for red lines defining how AI should not be used.175
The New European Commission’s AI Plan
The new European Commission has already demonstrated a strong interest in tackling AI issues. President Ursula von der Leyen has called for hard rules governing AI and pledged “to put forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of artificial intelligence” in her first one hundred days in office (on February 19, 2020, the commission unveiled a new white paper on AI, but no legislation has yet been put forth).176 She has also emphasized completing the digital single market.177 In her address at her confirmation hearing before the European Parliament, Executive Vice President Vestager emphasized that Europe’s regulatory stance is what will distinguish it from its competitors: “Some say China has all the data and the US has all the money. But in Europe, we have purpose [and] a lot to build on.”178
Although the EU has made progress on AI in recent years, most national and EU-level strategies and initiatives are all very recent. It therefore remains to be seen if they will receive enough financing and whether and how they align and interact. More broadly, the approach at the national and EU levels reflects a European desire to develop ethical, human-centric, and trustworthy AI and to become a leader in these areas. This commitment is not only demonstrated by the AI-related policy documents but also by the EU’s regulatory leadership on data privacy and other technology-related issues through legislation like the GDPR.
There is a clear connection between a more comprehensive vision for the EU’s ambition to become a leader in responsible AI and the uptake of technologically robust and trustworthy European AI-enabled products engineered to respect basic human rights and designed to mitigate potential negative consequences. From the European Commission’s perspective, the brand of “trustworthy AI,” by laying the foundation for ethical guidelines for the creation and use of AI, could become the “silver bullet” in the EU’s strategy to catch up with the United States or China.179 The underlying logic behind such a strategy is that developing AI technologies by adhering to high ethical, democratic, and human-rights standards will eventually provide European developers and manufacturers with a much-needed competitive edge, with consumers and users ultimately favoring their products over those from the United States or China.
The EU’s White Paper on Artificial Intelligence
On February 19, 2020, the European Commission published an ambitious package on the EU’s digital policy, including a series of documents including the “White Paper on Artificial Intelligence—A European Approach to Excellence and Trust,”180 the “European Strategy for Data,”181 and “Shaping Europe’s Digital Future.”182 In July 2019, von der Leyen announced her ambition as the commission’s incoming president to regulate AI within one hundred days of the new European Commission taking office.183 The white paper was presented on the eightieth day after it took office as part of a consultative exercise that would enable public feedback until May 31, 2020, and is meant to inform the European Commission’s legislative vision for the coming years. Vestager was tasked with developing a comprehensive European data and AI strategy that balances regulatory precautions and technological innovation in the digital age. But can both objectives be achieved?
The crucial question is how to write the rules of AI according to an ethical and human-rights agenda without hampering innovation or harming uptake of AI technologies in Europe. Based on the white paper, the European Commission seems to believe that it can realize the twin objective of a regulatory and an investment-oriented approach. The aim is not overregulation but practical safeguards, accountability, and the possibility of human intervention in high-risk AI cases.
Building on the European AI strategy presented in April 2018, the white paper covers a host of issues, such as developing an AI ecosystem that benefits European societies and economies, putting forward a common European approach to AI to accomplish sufficient scale and avoid single market fragmentation, and creating a type of European AI grounded in values and fundamental rights such as human dignity and privacy protection. The European Commission pledges to preserve the EU’s technological leadership, enable scientific breakthrough, and make sure that new technologies will improve the lives of European citizens while respecting their rights.
Moreover, it comes as no surprise that the white paper is permeated with rhetoric on sovereignty building. In an optimistic op-ed that accompanied the document’s launch, von der Leyen underlined that “tech sovereignty” is at the forefront of the EU’s digital future as “the capability that Europe must have to make its own choices, based on its own values, respecting its own rules.”184 The white paper points to a geopolitical fear rearing its head that Europe will become increasingly dependent on foreign technologies if it does not invest in competitive homegrown ones, create a robust digital single market to support innovation and growth in high-tech sectors, and train and retain talent to secure excellence and innovation.
The goal of the white paper is to develop a comprehensive European policy and governance approach to AI to “become a global leader in innovation in the data economy and its applications.”185 According to the document, the main building blocks to achieve this goal are an “ecosystem of excellence” that mobilizes up to 20 billion euros of private- and public-sector resources along the entire value chain, from research and innovation to accelerating the uptake of AI-based solutions, and an “ecosystem of trust” that ensures legal certainty for public and private organizations as well as rules for protecting fundamental rights and consumer rights. The European Commission notes that the wider existing bodies of legislation in member states and the EU are already applicable to AI, but it identifies potential needs for new legislation or adjustments due to the specificities intrinsic to AI, its evolution, the opacity of black-box algorithms, and unintended or negative consequences.
Overall, the white paper proposes to build on the existing EU policy framework and points to three key pillars for a solid European AI strategy. The first one is bolstering the EU’s digital capacities and technological and industrial strategic investment in AI, cybersecurity, quantum computing, and 5G. The second one is harnessing the potential of nonpersonal anonymized data by developing a legislative framework and operating standards for European data spaces to allow governments and researchers to store their data and access trusted data shared by others. The third one is advancing a risk-based approach for “high-risk AI.” The document also identifies two main risk areas: to fundamental rights—including privacy protection, personal data, and nondiscrimination—and to the safety, legal clarity, and effective functioning of the liability regime.
The white paper does not address the development and use of AI for dual-use or military purposes, eschews any substantive discussion of automated weapons, and tones down references to a potential ban on facial recognition and surveillance technologies. In a draft of the document, the European Commission raised the possibility of a ban of real-time face recognition, but the final version sees no need for a moratorium on what is now labeled as “remote biometric identification,” albeit recognizing that such facial recognition should only be used provided there is a “substantial public interest.”
The proposed regulatory framework in the white paper is constructed around the idea of the “high-risk” development, applications, and uses of AI that involve significant risks for fundamental rights, consumer rights, and safety. The key characteristics include requirements related to training data, data and record keeping, the provision of information, technological accuracy and robustness, and human oversight, as well as specific requirements for certain AI applications, such as those used for remote biometric identification. For low-risk AI applications that are not subject to these mandatory requirements, the European Commission proposes a voluntary labeling scheme for economic actors, in addition to applicable legislation. Moreover, a future regulatory framework should not create disproportionate burdens, and a risk-based approach may help ensure proportionality, especially in the case of SMEs. Finally, an EU-wide governance structure will be needed to ensure varied stakeholder participation across Europe and to harness cross-border and sectoral expertise networks for an effective enforcement system and oversight of the future AI regulatory framework.
A Coherent European Approach to AI in the Making?
The EU is striving to provide a more coherent European approach to AI. So far, European countries have mostly developed their own approaches without much consultation with one another or a single overarching framework. Consequently, national approaches differ considerably from one another, which makes it harder for various European actors to combine their efforts and build on their common strengths. Though similar themes tend to permeate most national strategies, there are also crucial differences in their approaches and areas of emphasis. For example, while most strategy documents refer to the need for an ethically informed approach to AI, only a few mention issues of inequality, human rights, manipulation of information and disinformation, safeguards against massive surveillance, and the overall control and abuse of power.
While the diversity in national AI approaches need not be problematic—and can even be an asset if it allows countries to devote particular attention to areas where they might have comparative advantages—it does raise the issues of coordination and coherence. Identifying and capitalizing on shared priorities in national strategies presents an opportunity to coordinate policies, pool resources, figure out individual strengths, and create a bigger impact. But this would require creating a forum for facilitating the exchange of best practices between EU member states. In fact, it is not clear whether the various national approaches to AI add up to anything resembling a coherent Europe-wide approach yet.
As a political and economic union, the EU has the potential to help facilitate coordination of common goals, interests, and values pertaining to AI. The December 2018 coordinated action plan was a first attempt at aligning various national approaches, but it needs to be updated to reflect policy developments that have taken place since it was released. In particular, the European Commission should seek to raise the role of member states in implementing a common approach to AI by building synergies and combining their efforts. In this regard, the white paper could assist member states by providing a common reference point. This is especially important for member states that still lack a national AI strategy. More widely, by aiming to foster not one but two ecosystems, of excellence and of trust in AI, respectively, the EU in general and the European Commission in particular have taken a clear strategic stance on AI.
This ecosystem-in-the-making approach is premised on a two-tiered strategy. First, this approach seeks to streamline research and innovation in AI, foster increased collaboration and coordination between member states, and increase investment in the development and uptake of AI technologies. Second, this approach aims to ensure that such technologies comply with European fundamental values, norms, and legal requirements by putting forward policy options for an EU regulatory framework, with special consideration given to high-risk technologies. Though it is not entirely clear how these two goals relate to each other, the ecosystem metaphor suggests an awareness at the EU level that an organic and complex strategy is needed to galvanize a variety of state and nonstate actors across the public and private sectors, keeping in mind market and regulatory logics. If the EU manages to incentivize stronger collaboration to combat fragmentation and to promote its own innovation ecosystem, it could potentially take the lead in establishing the international legal regime pertaining to the use of AI.
Conclusions and Recommendations: Toward a More Coherent European AI Strategy
A European AI ecosystem needs many things to truly succeed, including significant amounts of investment; a favorable regulatory environment; and inputs such as talented people, vast quantities of data, and computational power. The development of AI comes with enormous opportunities but also considerable risks. Tackling these risks while not overregulating and trying to control AI requires a fine balance, clear definitions and guidelines, and concrete goals. Nonetheless, as the plethora of policy and regulatory initiatives that have materialized over the past couple of years demonstrate, Europe is well positioned to help establish best practices and set global standards and norms to steer the future direction of AI development toward applications that truly have meaningful value for societies and ensure the security of citizens. With its human-centric focus, the EU’s strategy is distinctive, given its emphasis on the trustworthy and secure development of AI in full respect of citizens’ rights, freedoms, and values—but it remains to be seen whether these concepts will actually be effective and useful or merely empty slogans.
The EU could take a first step toward a more coherent AI strategy by realizing its full potential on digitization. Estonia offers a notable example of how digitization can improve the public sector and citizen services in member states. Encouraging and funding similar developments in other countries not yet fully embracing digitization is essential to ensuring every one of them gets to similar levels of application of digital technologies. Moreover, the EU’s manufacturing base presents an excellent opportunity for broad AI adoption to get ahead in digitalization and the Internet of Things. If the EU continues to lag in AI adoption and development, its ability to attract and retain top talent is likely to suffer as researchers choose to move elsewhere. This vicious cycle could be hard to break, which would cause a further slowdown in Europe’s AI technology development and uptake.
Related to increasing the digitization of EU economies is the importance of striving to complete the digital single market. To this end, as the white paper on AI called for, the EU should redouble its efforts to avoid fragmentation. To complete the digital single market with common regulatory and legal frameworks, member states will need to have a more constant dialogue as well as more substantive public-private dialogue. Such dialogue is needed to develop a common approach to research so as to capitalize on the diversity of member states and consolidate the EU’s assets in the public and private sectors.
A completed digital market would not only help companies to scale and gain access to more customers, but it could also make the EU more attractive for foreign investors and help to close the AI investment gap between Europe and bigger investors like China and the United States. Europe has a strong track record of data protection, application of AI in robotics and the automotive sector, and an outstanding research base. These assets should be capitalized on in its approach to AI as part of a leading digital ecosystem. Investing in becoming a digital destination and having modern digital infrastructure can further help Europe attract and retain top talent and foreign direct investment, and thus expand a digital ecosystem in which homegrown tech leaders could emerge and thrive, or so the plan goes. Using its funding instruments and ability to set business incentives, the EU could also increase support for the development of AI startups. By also acting as an active facilitator of AI innovation, the EU could help to overcome the fragmentation currently observed throughout the European AI landscape.
Moreover, while the EU is right to pursue a first-mover advantage on regulating AI, it must be careful about taking an overly legalistic and top-down approach. While its experience with data-privacy regulation in the form of the GDPR may serve an example of the Brussels effect—establishing global norms for emerging technology—it could also hamper the EU’s ability to be a leader in AI. Given that limited access to open data presents a hurdle to developing the powerful algorithms necessary for AI development, the risk is that overregulation and privacy restrictions could stymie innovation and reduce the amount of data available for Europe-based firms. Although the European Commission is increasing funding for AI, the GDPR puts tight restrictions on uses that involve personal data. If the costs and legal difficulties of using AI at an early stage increase, adoption of AI technologies by European firms may fall further behind that in the rest of the world. Moreover, when it comes to AI, the EU will face a regulatory dilemma between ensuring that legal requirements ideally do not hamper AI R&D and that innovation does not threaten legally protected interests and rights.186 European regulators must therefore strive to strike a careful balance between ethical AI policies and the dangers of overregulating the new technology.
In short, the EU’s strong emphasis on the more social, ethical, and consumer-friendly direction of AI development is a major asset. But regulation alone cannot be the main strategy. For Europe’s AI ecosystem to thrive, Europeans need to find a way to protect their research base, encourage governments to be early adopters, foster Europe’s startup ecosystem (including international links), and develop AI technologies as well as leverage their use efficiently. More importantly, to be able to take these steps, Europe needs to catch up on digitizing its economies and complete the establishment of the digital single market.
Recommendations
Complete the EU digital single market: European leaders should intensify their efforts to implement and complete the digital single market once and for all. A common European approach seems to be the sine qua non condition to scale up AI efforts across member states. As the European Commission’s white paper stated, several member states are envisaging options for national regulatory frameworks to tackle AI. Divergent national rules and initiatives increase the risk of fragmentation by creating new obstacles for economic actors that want to sell and deploy AI technologies and systems in the EU digital market.
Although significant progress has been made over the past few years, most recently with the proposed European data strategy, progress on remaining priorities areas is needed. The European Commission should prioritize this area as part of the next multiannual financial framework, encourage businesses to innovate and use AI technologies to develop new business models, and accelerate the digitization of businesses and economies to promote a more level digital playing field across Europe. New and emerging digital technologies are shaping the geopolitical landscape in unprecedented ways by concentrating power in digital monopolies, thus increasing the influence of economic statecraft of certain actors over other technologically dependent ones. Even so, the EU should be careful about erecting overly high walls around the digital single market, recognizing that foreign direct investment into Europe’s technology sector, technology transfers, strong partnerships with other countries, and access to the global value chain remain crucial to long-term success.
Balance technological sovereignty with the benefits of globally interconnected supply chains: While going it completely alone is at most feasible for the United States or China when it comes to AI, this approach has potentially dire consequences. Nationalizing or territorializing supply chains and endorsing technological sovereignty at all costs poses risks that could unravel the interdependent global economy. While the EU has emphasized the need for more “technological sovereignty in key enabling technologies and infrastructure for the data economy,”187 it should also work toward deterritorializing the digital realm. For the EU, it would be equally inefficient to decouple from globally interwoven supply chains, especially because there are so few European digital tech giants. The EU should seek to balance the task of bolstering its own technological and digital capacity to reduce its dependence on others with the goal of working toward a global common good and ethics-driven approach to AI governance in the digital domain. The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the potential pitfalls of pursuing a data sovereignty strategy since maintaining access to high-quality global data, not just European data, is necessary for developing effective AI-training algorithms.188
Lead on setting standards and regulations: One of the greatest strengths the EU enjoys is its ability to set global technical standards in a variety of fields (the Brussels effect). Europe should seek to become a global standard setter in AI and fully utilize multilateral platforms and partnerships with other countries. Rather than a race to deploy AI technology as such, the real race is for setting regulations, guidelines, and best practices so uses of AI take into account socioeconomic, legal, and ethical considerations. Here, the EU has certain advantages that it should seek to better capitalize on. The white paper on AI is a positive step in terms of setting the tone, outlining the normative agenda, tracking developments, informing future regulations, and taking public consultation seriously. However, it is also short on substance and ethics; further, it takes an overly legislative approach to dealing with risks, particularly high-risk AI technologies, which it also does not define clearly.
Even so, given the diversity of AI applications, acknowledging that there is not always a one-size-fits-all solution is also essential. Moreover, taking an ex ante approach to AI regulation is difficult and could have unintentional effects, such as stymying innovation and forward thinking in Europe. The EU should therefore tread lightly when it comes to regulating low-risk AI applications where it might be better to have companies self-regulate instead. Comparisons to the EU’s rather successful experience with data-privacy regulations (the GDPR) may not be perfectly applicable in the case of AI, as the latter is still very much an emerging technology. Moreover, it is essential that any new EU regulations on AI avoid unnecessary overlap with existing frameworks such as the GDPR and that any new rules are enforceable, applicable, and focused on safeguarding European companies’ competitiveness.
Work to ensure that citizens trust their governments by building an AI ecosystem of trust: The EU should further explore how AI is changing the governmental landscape and how it can enhance or hinder citizen-facing services. At the same time, it should raise awareness of how governments mobilize AI technologies, such as in surveillance technologies and how citizens’ data is being used. In this respect, the coronavirus pandemic has further emphasized the need to assess the risks and opportunities afforded by leveraging mass digital surveillance, data, and AI to address public health crises of this nature. Getting citizen buy-in during the early stages of AI adoption and use in the public sector is important and will help to maintain societal trust in governmental services. As seen in the private sector, consumers often have little choice about how their data is being used, as well as how their privacy is protected. In this respect, citizens’ trust in using AI in the public sector should be accompanied by transparency in data usage, as well as public debates on how to implement AI in a safe, fair, and ethical manner. Citizens’ trust in governments is difficult to maintain and easy to lose. The EU and its member states should create a context for transparency and unbiased decisionmaking and set a global example of how to tackle biases in algorithms. Other member states can also learn from the efforts of countries like Estonia and Finland to educate their citizens about the role and impact of AI.
Promote a vibrant Europe-wide AI ecosystem: Although Europe is facing fierce competition from other global players when it comes to developing AI, it should not lose sight of its unique capabilities, especially its strong research base. In particular, Europe needs to support this research base to maintain its leadership in AI research; protect the AI-startup environment by building a supportive digital ecosystem and facilitating access to funding; and retain, educate, and attract top talent. Efforts should include strengthening R&D funding to industry and academic AI centers, improving the capital markets union to facilitate more inter-European private investment in AI, encouraging new Europe-wide public and private research partnerships and networks, striving to retain top talent in Europe, prompting more and stronger integrated regional clusters, and supporting the commercialization of AI R&D. Europe should also seek to concentrate efforts in AI sectors it has the potential to be a world leader in, such as low-power electronics as well as “robotics and competitive manufacturing and services sectors, from automotive to healthcare, energy, financial services and agriculture.”189
Align national AI strategies: Forging a common EU framework for AI is important especially for smaller member states that can turn to these documents as a reference point. Not all European countries have yet developed national strategies, though additional ones are in the works. Many of these strategies remain vague and lack clear goals. In accordance with the EU coordinated plan, all member states are required to complete the development of national strategies, ensure that AI is included in national digital strategies, and increase coordination among themselves to align strategic goals in national strategies and promote synergies. National plans need to be concrete, contain detailed specific actions, and be coordinated with those of other member states and EU initiatives in order to be effective. As more national strategies are developed, a concerted effort is necessary to align them so as to ensure coherence and consistency, while at the same time recognizing the value in maintaining a diversity of approaches. In this regard, an updated coordinated action plan should focus on condensing and aligning all the different national AI strategies.
Protect dual-use technologies: Chinese efforts to siphon off Western technology, as part of its Made in China 2025 initiative, raise questions about the lack of a coherent approach to protecting Europe’s technological and industrial base and research. This issue is particularly important as the United States has become more restrictive of late, causing many Chinese investors to look to Europe instead for access to cutting-edge technology. Though the EU has recently adopted a common framework for screening foreign investments, more attention must be devoted to promoting and protecting sensitive technologies with potential dual-use applications. Such efforts should ideally be coordinated with those of other like-minded non-European countries such as the United States, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, as the EU implements its new investment-screening mechanism, special attention should be paid to ensuring that key technologies such as AI are considered a critical sector to protect. The mechanism and member-state-level frameworks to protect intellectual property rights and the outflow of critical technologies should all play an increased role in preserving the EU’s innovation prowess and digital sovereignty. Finally, European entities should become more aware of China’s AI strategy and impose greater scrutiny on partnerships with Chinese technology firms and research bodies.
Ensure close EU-UK cooperation on AI. Given the UK’s leading role in Europe in AI, ensuring its continued close collaboration with the EU on AI is essential. More needs to be done to achieve a frictionless digital ecosystem between the EU and the UK in which AI can progress. At the time of writing, the UK government seems keen on leaving the single market and pursuing regulatory divergence from the EU, which would make it harder for the EU and the UK to collaborate and develop common data schemes, particularly in the absence of a future UK-EU trade agreement.190 One practical step includes allowing UK universities and researchers to participate in EU-funded research projects. A potential model to follow is Israel’s association with the EU’s research and innovation frameworks that has allowed Israeli researchers to participate in Horizon 2020 and cooperate with the Joint Research Centre.191
Enhance transatlantic dialogue on AI: Instead of pursuing a “third way” between the United States and China on digital policy or overly stressing the need for digital sovereignty, a key component of Europe’s efforts must be actively engaging the United States and other democratic countries around a common or at least complementary set of AI principles based on shared values and norms. The EU’s white paper recognizes this, stating that there is a need to “continue to cooperate with like-minded countries, but also with global players.”192 It and the U.S. government’s new AI principles provide an opportunity for fruitful transatlantic dialogue on aligning approaches. The United States has signaled its support for the principles of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on AI and the G7’s Global Partnership on AI, which provide a good baseline for fruitful transatlantic discussions as well.193
Establishing a specific transatlantic working group on AI, consisting of key government, private-sector, and civil-society representatives could be an effective platform for joint action and collaboration on developing new frameworks, standards, and ethical guidelines for AI. Such conversations could potentially also take place in a trilateral format with Japan. Moreover, the EU and the United States should seek to resolve their disagreements over privacy issues, taxation of tech companies, and trade tariffs, and they should promote a transatlantic AI market. Although the EU has had fruitful exchanges with the Trump administration on AI regulatory matters, if there is a new Democratic administration starting in 2021 it would likely be more interested in actively engaging with the EU on digital issues.
Engage global stakeholders on the ethical dimensions of AI: The EU’s ethics guidelines on AI are a major asset that it should seek to leverage in its outreach to other international stakeholders to promote global adaptation of such guidelines and frameworks for the sustainable and responsible development and use of AI systems and services. These conversations should ideally start with representatives from like-minded countries,194 such as Japan, that have similar commitments to human rights and democracy.195 Japan has developed Social Principles of Human-Centric AI that have a lot in common with the EU’s approach when it comes to such issues as security, safety, privacy, and transparency.196 That said, the EU should not shy away from leveraging AI ethics in conversations with China and other global players.197 As proposed in the white paper, it should also explore how multilateral forums such as the OECD (especially its AI Policy Observatory, which provides a platform for sharing best practices),198 the International Organization for Standardization, the UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation, the G7’s Global Partnership on AI,199 and the G20 can be leveraged for such purposes.
Consider AI a part of European strategic autonomy: AI will have massive potential strategic implications—including on the efficiency of weapons technology, modern warfare, and cyber security, and AI leadership could become essential for the effective development and deployment of military forces. While AI could help the EU enhance its detection, protection, and preparation capabilities against security and defense threats and risks,200 there is a risk of a race to the bottom in terms of AI safety if businesses and countries ignore ethics and reliability concerns due to the desire to be first. As the United States and China look to AI for maintaining or achieving military superiority, Europe runs the risk of seeing its own security decrease and the ability of its militaries to remain interoperable with U.S. forces decline. For example, in the United States, DARPA announced in September 2018 that the Department of Defense would invest up to $2 billion over the next five years in new programs advancing AI, stepping up the technological race with China.201
While military applications have major ethical drawbacks, Europe must ensure it stays competitive in this area too. The debate around strategic autonomy in Europe would do well to include a stronger focus on emerging technologies such as AI, which are lacking from the military debate in Europe.202 New defense initiatives such as the European Defense Fund could be instrumental in funding EU projects focusing on disruptive AI applications in the military sector, but this must be supplemented with the development of military doctrine for AI applications. Most importantly, given the current coronavirus pandemic and crisis and the likelihood that it will be a game changer in terms of budgeting, the EU should not lose sight of AI as a strategic priority and stick to its ambitious digital agenda.

Some 19% believed Arnie's cyborg assassin from the 1984 blockbuster film was a prime illustration of the technology. The revelation stands in stark contrast to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's claim in a speech last week that Britain could “lead the world” in AI. A survey carried out into people's understanding of artificial intelligence lays bare how much work remains to be done. In the hit “I'll be back” science-fiction movie, the T-800 Terminator is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton.

  Her son will one day become a saviour against machines in a post-apocalyptic future – and needs to be destroyed.  AI  pioneer Yoshua Bengio told the BBC in October 2019 he was not a fan of the Terminator films.  ""They paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We are very far from super-intelligent AI systems and there may even be fundamental obstacles to get much beyond human intelligence."" But for 19% Britons, the film is a chilling demonstration of what AI can offer.  The reality is more useful – predictive texting on mobile phones uses AI, as do apps like Uber and Google Maps.

 However, just 41% of people questioned believed they had encountered AI in the past three months. Researchers uncovered big gender gaps, with 69% of women saying they did not know when they last encountered AI – if they ever had. Some 51% of men thought they had used it in the past 12 weeks. The online Populus study of 1,093 adults was carried out for communications agency Zinc Network. Executive director Louis Brooke said: “The Government has laid out an ambitious agenda for AI, seeking to turn the UK into a world leader in this area. “AI will play a vital role in helping the UK exit lockdown and overhauling health, education, travel and the workplace. ""Yet this data shows public understanding of AI is chronically low, particularly amongst women. ""For the public to buy into new uses for AI technologies, it will be vital to ensure that innovations are well understood, and benefit those who may be the most sceptical.” Some of those quizzed readily understood the technology, saying they thought it included “any sort of robot that can react to its surroundings and doesn't need programming” and “chat bots used by companies to deal with customer service queries”.

At the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) 2019 meeting, new artificial intelligence (AI) software to assist with radiotherapy treatment planning systems was highlighted. The goal of the AI-based systems is to save staff time, while still allowing clinicians to do the final patient review. 
Machine Learning Treatment Planning
RaySearch demonstrated a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared machine learning treatment planning system. The RaySearch RayStation machine learning algorithm is being used clinically by University Health Network, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Canada, where it was rolled out over several months in late-2019. Medical physicist Leigh Conroy, Ph.D., was involved in this rollout and helped conduct a study, showing the automated plans and traditionally made plans to radiation oncologists to get valuable feedback. She spoke at the AAPM 2019 meeting on this topic.
In an interview with itnTV, Conroy explained that she worked with an algorithm that uses machine learning to create automated treatment plans. “With this, we train the algorithm using a curated set of high-quality, previously delivered plans. Then, it is able to detect the patient that is most similar to a novel patient and create a new treatment plan with no user interaction beyond pressing the play button,” she explained.
Conrad’s study directly compared those automated treatment plans to traditionally generated manual plans. The radiation oncologist then compared those two plans head-to-head and decided whether each plan was acceptable, and chose the favored plan. The plans are not modified as they are performing them, however they are modifiable. “The automated plan is modifiable, but for the purposes of this study, we are not going to be modifying them so we can directly compare the output of the machine learning algorithm to the output of the planners,” she said.
The system was trained using a model that was developed at Princess Margaret, and the model is being used clinically. “The way that we are doing our study is if the doctor does choose the automated plan, then it’s underlined that the physicist knows when they are doing their plan QA that it is an automated plan, and it goes to the same QA that it normally would, and the patient-specific QA is a fully deliverable plan, and that is the plan that the patient is treated with.”
Depending on how things go with the study, it is predicted that AI should see a regular implementation. “That is the point of the study, to make sure we can do this and work it into our regular process and eventually provide it if the doctors continue to like the automated plans,” she said.
One of the main ideas in implementing AI is to save time to get more patient throughput. “We are not measuring the end to end timing of a planner vs. the machine learning. But one of the major advantages is that it takes about 20 minutes for a new patient, however there is no user interacting during those 20 minutes, so the planner can go and do other work or other plans during that time, and come back so there is a fully done plan.”
There is a different process depending on what plan is being created. However, the AI would help to free them up to be able to do other duties. “From a planner expertise perspective, some of the planning techniques such as head and neck might be more complicated so it might take longer for the planner to do it. It’s more reliant on their level of expertise,” she explained. 
Other Automated Systems
Varian also has developed AI-driven automated treatment planning software that is currently being used by several hospitals.
Recently, Varian released the newest version of its treatment planning system, Eclipse v16. This new release includes intelligent features such as RapidPlan PT, a clinical application of machine learning in proton treatment planning, and RT Peer Review, a collaborative workspace designed to streamline and accelerate the peer review process for radiotherapy treatment plans.
Previously only available for photon-based radiotherapy treatment planning, RapidPlan is knowledge-based treatment planning software that enables clinicians to leverage knowledge and data from similar prior treatment plans to quickly develop high-quality personalized plans for patients. This knowledge-based planning software is now available for proton treatment planning with RapidPlan PT. The software also allows dose prediction with machine learning models that can be used as a decision support tool to determine which patients would be appropriate for proton or photon therapy. 
“With the number of operational proton treatment rooms continuing to increase, there is a need for experienced proton therapy clinicians,” said Kolleen Kennedy, chief growth officer, president, Proton Solutions, Varian, in a written statement. “RapidPlan PT helps bridge the learning curve, allowing established centers to share their models and clinical experience. The machine learning in RapidPlan PT has the potential to reduce proton treatment plan optimization from a one- to eight-hour process, as reported by clinical proton centers, to less than 10 minutes, while also potentially improving plan quality.”
Eclipse v16 has received the CE mark and is 510(k) pending.

Developing new drugs is costly, complex and generally takes years to reach a point where novel treatments are ready to be validated by clinical tests—but scientists within the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research turned to high-tech tools to more rapidly funnel out drug compounds that could effectively target COVID-19.“Rightfully, the people of the United States and the world want an answer fast,” Deputy Director of the institute’s Experimental Therapeutics Branch Maj. Brandon Pybus told Nextgov during a recent virtual panel. “So we looked into ways that we could shave time off of the front end of the drug discovery process, which can be pretty lengthy when it takes its normal course, because you, of course, have to not only prove that the drugs that you're developing are safe, but you have to prove that they're effective—and then they have to clear all of these regulatory paths.”The Experimental Therapeutics Branch holds significant clout as a drug discovery and development program, including having a hand in every Food and Drug Administration-approved malaria prevention drug. As the pandemic emerged, Pybus said inside officials opted to partner with Southwest Research Institute, which had developed what he deemed “a really interesting and novel machine learning- and [artificial intelligence]-based approach to find molecules that can successfully bind to a target of interest in the virus.” The Experimental Therapeutics team had identified rare, derived structures of the spikes on the surface of the novel coronavirus that are responsible for attaching and invading cells. Researchers shared them with SRI to try to use AI and machine learning to screen through a very large number of compounds that they “threw at the spikes” to see if they would bind in the virtual space to inhibit attachment. But the team hoped to confront 41 million compounds, a computationally intensive number that ultimately warranted the support of a supercomputer to more quickly puzzle out those with the possibility to be effective.Pybus and his team turned to the Defense Department’s High-Performance Computing Modernization Program, which he noted is essentially the Pentagon’s portal into all-things supercomputing. With the group’s publicly-provided resources, which are also being offered up to the U.S.-led high-performance computing consortium, Pybus and the team were able to swiftly screen those millions of compounds and narrow down and advance more than 100 into benchtop testing against the virus. “What we saw is that—like we had hoped—it did really enrich the hit rate, which shaved a tremendous amount of time, years, off the front end of the drug discovery development,” he explained. “I mean, it's really remarkable. As you can imagine, a whole-of-government effort, when they first take off, is a little bit like the wild west. But everybody knows the desired end state and everybody was very open—and still is very open—to collaborating to achieve that end state faster.”A traditional program would have required screening each of the millions of compounds but supplemented by the tech, Pybus told Nextgov Wednesday that the team at this point has whittled 41 million down to 13 hits for more advanced screening.  “That’s pretty great for three or four months,” he noted. “The [high-performance computing] really made that possible.”Some on Pybus’ team have had to work inside the facility to create and test new chemical entities and more, but a large part of the work—as with most federal agencies and industry shops across the U.S.—can be completed remotely. The department really “stepped up,” according to Pybus, in terms of providing technologies to enable teams to work efficiently from out-of-office locations.“I think that it was a trial that we had to go through—it was necessary because we had to maintain physical distance for the safety of all the staff and in the community-at-large,” he said. “But it has gone very well, and I think that it has shown us that we can do a lot more remotely than we would have imagined before.”

Loads of lessons are being learned along the way, but top of mind is the impact of leaning into a little creativity and technical support to move faster and drive new outcomes. Pybus isn’t a computer scientist—but as a biochemist and structural biologist, he’s now experienced firsthand how emerging and advanced resources offer researchers across many fields, exploring a range of therapeutics, “a very powerful toolset.” “It's a convergence of a lot of technologies that aren't necessarily new, but I do like to think that, right now, they are converging in a new way and very aggressively, which is good to see,” he said.Though he considers the real measure of success for the work to be “when that compound that the computer predicts goes into that plate and kills the virus,” the metrics that the team has used to date involve considering whether the number of hits the team’s uncovered has been boosted by the effort. “And I would say it has been—so it’s been successful so far,” Pybus said.

National Artificial Intelligence strategies are a response to the need that urges governments to remain in sync with strategic technology trends that have been emerging in recent years, technology trends that are shaping the way we live, socialize, work, and educate the future generations.
Finland, technology, and AI
Despite being a small nation of 5.5 million inhabitants, geographically located far up in the Nordics, bordering with the Polar Arctic Circle, Finland’s citizens are internationally renowned for being early adopters of new technologies. Almost everyone knows Finland is home for Nokia, Linux, Santa Claus, and Angry Birds.

But Finland is also known for its strong technology sector, strong technology startup scene, high standards in education, and for pushing education into all levels. Even the top 15 Artificial Intelligence companies in Finland were listed by Finland’s AI Accelerator.
Finland developed Elements of AI, a free Artificial Intelligence six-week-long course first developed for all the citizens and residents in Finland. Later on, the nation translated the course into several European Union languages making it available and open for anyone in the world to use for free. Finland believes education should be available to everyone.
With the Elements of AI initiative, Finland aims to encourage people to learn the basics of Artificial Intelligence, regardless of age, geographical location, or education level. As a nation with high standards in education, Finland acknowledges the importance of AI and hopes to help everyone learn and understand a topic that is going to soon become an essential skill globally, and will be part of in any school curricula.
AuroraAI: Planning Finland’s National Artificial Intelligence Program
Planning AuroraAI: Finland’s National Artificial Intelligence Program began in May 2017, when the Minister of Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä, set a goal of making Finland one of the world’s top countries in Artificial Intelligence applications. 
Mika Lintilä appointed a team to work on a proposal for Finland’s AI Program. As the work progressed, the following reports on the initiative were published: Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence (2017) and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (2018). 
Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence: Turning Finland into a leading country in the application of Artificial Intelligence

Contrary to common thought, Artificial Intelligence is not a recent development. Artificial Intelligence has been developed and used since the 1950s. IBM was the leader in the field back then, and the company remains as one of the leaders throughout its efforts around IBM Watson and AI-based cognitive services. 
However, it was not until the most recently rapid global developments coupled with successful applications for everyday use that the Artificial Intelligence technology has shown concrete proof of the opportunities it offers. 
Over the next few years, it is believed that Artificial Intelligence will revolutionize transport, industry, healthcare, education, cities, and working life. Finland has excellent opportunities to be among the leaders in this important transformational space. 
The final report of Finland’s Artificial Intelligence Program states that “taking Finland into the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) calls for continuous capacity building, public discussion on the ethics of AI, as well as bold choices and investment.” As one concrete step, the report recommends investment in use of data and AI, especially in business to business (B2B) markets in which Finland already has strong leading expertise.
The current level of utilizing AI varies between businesses and sectors. Those organizations that are more advanced in digitalization are advanced also in AI applications. For the past years, Data has become the most valuable resource in the world. 
Data utilization and competition in business to business (B2B) activities are in the first stages of development if we compare it to the business to consumer (B2C) sector, which is dominated by international giants in the Platform Economy. This entails an opportunity for Finland: AI suitable for B2B is under development, and in this area, the Finnish AI research is among the best in the world.
According to Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä, “Finland is one of the nations that can be among the first to find solutions, benefit from this development, and strengthen the wellbeing of its citizens. The key issue is to ensure that all Finns are involved in the change. As the contents of work change, we need to make sure that Finns can rely on their knowledge and skills in the labour market.” 
“Finland has strong expertise in B2B activities. Small Data and AI technologies such as unsupervised learning can bring Finland to the top of the B2B markets,” says Pekka Ala-Pietilä, Chairman of the AI Finland Program and Chairman of the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI.
According to the report, in order to build an attractive and competitive Finland, it is paramount that both the public and private sectors work closely together in order to promote the digitalization of businesses and utilization of Artificial Intelligence. 
This, in turn, will increase investments in innovation activities, build effective cooperation models, develop encouraging regulation, and support the expertise of the business world and the development of capabilities on a broad basis.
The report suggests that this is going to demand hiring top experts in Artificial Intelligence, as well as an increase in the overall skills throughout the organization, including management. Examining the possibility of granting a training voucher or creating a career account for every person of working age is what the report suggests. This would create an effective adult education market in Finland.
The report covers eleven different key topics with recommended guidelines on how to utilize AI in Finland. In addition, it presents a vision of Finland in the age of AI in 2025 and toward the vision 2030: A nation that is attractive and competitive, and that is inhabited by informed and independent citizens with relevant education. 
Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Four perspectives on the economy, employment, skills, and ethics

Artificial intelligence can dramatically improve the efficiencies of the workplaces and can augment the work humans can do. 
Finland envisions work in the age of AI in a way that work and society are positively impacted by the following four perspectives: 


The effects of Artificial Intelligence on general economic and employment trends


The transformation of work and the labour market


Reforms on education and skills maintenance


Ethics in AI  


As a general-purpose technology, Artificial Intelligence has the potential to change working life and society extensively. Businesses can experience new growth and productivity contributing to higher standards of living for citizens and the society. 
To reach this level, society must invest in upgrading and updating workers’ skills. The incorporation of autonomous urban mobility will facilitate workforce mobility. Other future innovations will complement human labor. 
AuroraAI: Finland’s National Artificial Intelligence Program is rolled out, and will be fully available in 2022

The Finnish Ministry of Finance launched the AuroraAI program in February 2020. The ongoing program is set to continue evolving until it will be made fully available by the end of 2022. 
The program lays the foundation for using Artificial Intelligence to bring services and people together in a better way. AuroraAI is going to be developed on the basis of people’s real life-events. 
The aim of AuroraAI is to develop an operating model for arranging public administration activities to support people in different life situations and life events so that services provided by organizations function seamlessly between different sectors.
According to the Finnish Ministry of Finance, the main goal of the AuroraAI National Artificial Intelligence program is to implement an operations model based on citizens’ needs, where Artificial Intelligence helps both citizens and companies to make use of services in a timely and ethically sustainable manner. 
“The core idea of the AuroraAI program involves proactively offering services to people according to their own life-events. This is something new and unique. AuroraAI helps service users and service providers find each other. It also produces savings for the entire national economy by improving the cost-efficiency of services,” says Päivi Nerg, Permanent Under-Secretary for Governance Policy. 
The Finnish government has the benchmark on providing the best AI-enabled Public Services in the world. AuroraAI empowers citizens by putting them at the driver’s seat on fair data ownership; it grants them control over who has access to their personal data and on what terms. AuroraAI takes Finland’s citizens and the whole nation into the era of Platform Economy.
“Before AuroraAI, the program was called Suomi.fi Assistant. It wasn’t good enough, for AuroraAI isn’t just about technology or chatbots but a systematic transformation at a societal level,” told me Aleksi Kopponen, Special Advisor of Digitalization at the Finnish Ministry of Finance. 
The AuroraAI Program reduces the amount of time that citizens spend running from one place to another. The program improves the functional and technical possibilities for cooperation between public administration and other sectors. In addition, it strengthens the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence as part of public services provision and operating models.
According to the AuroraAI Program Manager Ira Alanko, “the AuroraAI program is being developed via concrete life-events. This will be achieved by using snapshots to examine life from the human perspective: A person who is about to go through a certain life-event –such as changing jobs– will automatically be offered public, private, and third sector services to proactively support the transition from one job to another without a separate period of unemployment.”  
The development of the AuroraAI network will constitute a solid ground for the model, which will enable the technical prerequisites for interaction and interoperability between services functioning on different platforms. 
The AuroraAI network serves as an interactive link between services provided by the public administration organizations and the services of other sectors. The AuroraAI network will be available to citizens, residents, and organizations in Finland for its use in selected life-events by the end of 2022. 
AuroraAI: Finland’s AI program is based on open networking
The AuroraAI Program is based on open, cross-sectoral networking. The organizations participating in the program will jointly improve the technology and the digitalization capabilities in the public sector. In addition, they will develop cooperation between the public and private sectors in accordance to the government programme. 
The launch of AuroraAI in 2020 includes the development of the first version of the operating model as well as the releasing of the first beta version of the AuroraAI network to be utilized by both citizens and organizations.
The AuroraAI program is based on Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s government program, according to which Finland wants to be recognized as a technology development pioneer that enhances and implements the opportunities created by digitalization and technology advances across administrative and sectoral boundaries. 
The aim of the AuroraAI program is to use the AuroraAI network to facilitate smoother functioning of everyday life and business, all within a data-secure and ethically sustainable manner.
The future of Finland: Vision 2030 

All the technologies shown in the video above are already developed in Finland today. 
It is not only Artificial Intelligence what is at the forefront of Finland’s development. The nation is expanding its technologies in all directions. From a wireless roll-out of 6G technology to Super IoT to Augmented Projection Interfaces; from physical and cyber fusion to health analytics services and autonomous health, to smart materials for smart clothes and 3D-printed electronics products. 
The national 2030 Agenda was submitted to the Finnish Parliament in 2017. The implementation process is led by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The Finnish strategy for 2030 provides a long-term strategic framework for a whole-of-society commitment for sustainable development with a vision of a sustainable future city with AI observing and catering services.   
Finland is known for its innovation and educated people. Finland is already building a future that today may seem like science fiction. However, with the right tools and partners coupled with state-of-the-art technology and innovation, Finland is looking at a future where monitoring an unborn baby’s well-being while traveling in a hyper-fast train will be as common and simple as checking email or your social media on your smartphone today. 
In the Finland of the future, sending an autonomous harvester on an autonomous truck from Finland to Australia, or across the Atlantic on an autonomous ship will be part of the everyday business. 
Technologies such as AI, 5G, Super IoT, autonomous transportation, and advanced displays are already making human life better. In the Finland of the future, highly advanced applications of these technologies will amplify the vision of how life in Finland by 2030 is going to be.

The most challenging of all is engaging with employees on human grounds to understand their needs..As leaders today are observing the AI revolution across every process, Human resources is no exception: there has been a visible wave of AI disruption across HR functions. According to an IBM's survey from 2017, among 6000 executives, 66% of CEO's believe that cognitive computing can drive compelling value in HR while half of the HR personnel believe this may affect roles in the HR organization. The study clearly exhibits the apprehension of HR executives caused by the AI disruption in their field..While one aspect of AI is creating uneasiness: the other is promising convenience. AI aims to empower the HR department with the right knowledge to optimize processes with less manual power and guarantees to mitigate errors..So, what makes AI so attractive for Human Resources?.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the power of AI in real-time&lt; Backlink-https://us.sganalytics.com/blog/ai-can-detect-infections-with-96-percent-accuracy-can-ai-predict-the-next-pandemic/&gt;, including its shortcomings. At the crux of the AI evolution is the minimization of human labored processes. Sophisticated AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data in no time and self-educate themselves to recognize and map patterns, which can come in handy for HR staffs to plan and operate strategically..While a human can be biased, get bored and make unintended mistakes provoking inadequacy in productivity and efficiency, AI programs are unbiased and diligent, enabling more productivity and efficiency..HR executives who perform tasks like applicant tracking, payroll, training, and job postings manually without automation, state that they spend 14 hours a week on an average on these tasks. Leveraging AI to automate these HR processes can be extremely pertinent for meeting the following key business requirements: First, save time and increase efficiency; Second, provide real-time responses and solutions that meet employee expectations..As per a Mckinsey's study &quot;AI will drastically change business regardless of the industry. AI could potentially deliver an additional economic output of around $13 trillion by 2030, boosting global GDP by about 1.2 percent a year.&quot;.Let's dive deeper to understand how AI can help sophisticate HR processes while not necessarily replacing human resource personnel..1. Improved Employee Experience.Employees are the first customers for any organization. Hence employee experience is as important as customer experience..As employee experience is becoming the next competitive edge for businesses, the coming days will be focused on providing personalized engagement and improving employee experience for human resources..According to a Deloitte survey, 80% HR executives rate employee experience as important, while only 22% believe their organization excels at providing a differentiated employee experience..Additionally, the advent of smart workplace has raised the bars of employees' expectations for work-space experience and engagement factors..Jennifer Stroud, HR Evangelist &amp; Transformation Leader at ServiceNow, says, &quot;We have seen the need for chatbots, AI and machine learning in the workplace to drive more productivity as well as modern, consumerized employee experiences. These consumer technology solutions are exactly what employees want in the workplace.&quot;.Engaging AI can help the HR department provide personalized employee engagement experiences across the entire employee lifecycle, right from recruitment and onboarding to career pathing..2. Empowering HR's to make Data-Driven decisions .In common, the data-to-decision workflow looks like the below figure for many people..Many HR technologies still follow the above workflow and depend on manual methods to glean insights from data. This task grows tedious and creates a bottleneck for end-users (data analysts) to draw insights within the stipulated time leading to decision making on outdated data..While frontier technologies like data analyticshttps://us.sganalytics.com/data-analytics/&gt; are advancing to provide real-time data to make fast and fact-based decisions, AI can assist Human Resource professionals in harnessing this real-time data and making quick, consistent, and data-driven decisions. After all, the bottom line of HR agility is decision making..3. Intelligent Automation.Intelligent automation fuses automation with AI. This will enable machines to make human-like decisions by self-educating themselves. Apart from augmenting productivity and efficiency for repetitive manual processes, this can help remove human interventions deployed for automated process completely..Popular AI use cases in Human Resources.1. More work in less time!.Crafting job descriptions for a particular role, filtering resumes and analyzing skillsets to find the apt talent is not only tiring and tedious, but also tricky for human resource professionals as a simple overlooked aspect can lead to a significant mistake, which may cost the company dearly in the long run. Well, AI can help HR staff overcome such scenarios by crafting bespoken job descriptions automatically and assist them in reading through thousands of resumes within a short time, thus effectively reducing the time and manual hard work put in by recruiters..2. Identify the right talent without bias.HR personnel are humans and are likely to exhibit bias subconsciously. AI, on the other hand, is immune to human emotions which makes it the perfect fit to process candidate profiles based on required skillset without any disregard for candidate's age, race, gender, geographic areas or organizational relationship. An unbiased recruitment is a win-win for both HR staff and organization. Furthermore, AI can be instrumental in increasing retention rates and establishing cultural diversity..Consider programs like Texito, they help recognize gender bias in ads enabling recruiters to embrace a neutral language..3. Streamline employee onboarding.The first day of an employee in an organization is like the first day of a transferred student in a new school. Although employees are grown-ups and possess the cognitive intelligence to adapt easily to an environment, deep down they look for a guidance to help them settle down in a new environment. Fortunately, organizations have HR staff to do this job.  Employees generally have numerous queries on their first day regarding company policies, leaves, compensations, notice period, insurance claims, etc.  As intriguing as the questions may be for an employee, these queries may turn repetitive and exhausting for an HR personnel over the time. Engaging AI chatbots makes it simple to answer such repetitive questions and make more time for the HR staff to concentrate on other essential tasks..4. Optimize employee engagement to build better relationships.Apart from recruitment and onboarding, AI can be used to streamline processes like scheduling meetings, training employees and other such business processes. AI's capabilities to recognize personas will help Human resources professionals understand the human aspect of every single employee in-depth and enable them to shape a friendly and exciting company culture to provide unique and personalized employee engagement experiences..5. Manage employee churn.Understanding factors that cause and arrest employee churn is the toughest part of an HR's job.  People change jobs for various reasons like financial growth, career growth, shift in profiles, unsatisfied work environment, etc. Leveraging AI capabilities can help the HR department in continuously monitoring and evaluating employees' thoughts about the organization, work culture, the degree of satisfaction with their job, etc. Knowing what offends or drives an employee can help in underlining the employee churn factors precisely. AI can help HR executives in  performing this task more precisely.. Should HR personnel be worried about losing their job?.All said and done, even though AI's capabilities would help reduce manual work and boost efficiency and productivity, artificial intelligence doesn't possess the emotional intelligence of humans.  AI also cannot compensate for the 'humane' connection that HR personnel form with employees and leverage to drive engagement and responsiveness..Therefore, to answer the critical question that haunts HR executives 'Will AI be the reason why I might lose my job?' No. Not really. The whole idea of AI in HR is the integration of technology to automate the more monotonous HR related tasks and optimize processes to add value to human work in less time. In the AI era, new jobs will evolve that will have new skills requirements unleashing the evolution of the HR function in an AI-first world..Author Detail:.Jency is a technology content writer with SG Analytics.

The law is entrenched in every aspect of the business world with close to $1 trillion globally (according to Forbes) making it one of the largest markets in the world, yet it remains acutely under-digitalized.
The good news is; the 21st century comes with artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the practice of law. Progress is being made in this way and artificial intelligence is here to stay. In simple terms, AI is the ability of a computer program or machine to think and learn just like a human being.   
So far, the discussion around the use of AI in the legal fraternity is particular to the relation between humans (lawyers) and machines (robots), and perhaps the possibility of the latter taking over some of the lawyers’ jobs. 
AI is already transforming the legal profession in a variety of ways through improved access to data. As the field grows, AI is taking over many time-intensive legal tasks, which frees up humans to take on more critical tasks like reviewing pre-sorted documents, negotiating and appearing in court.
Companies like DoNotPay have built chatbots that interview respondents about their legal challenges and after use their answers to process and come up with paperwork to that effect. A common day-to-day example is Siri, a virtual assistant used in Apple products. It uses voice queries and a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations and perform actions as requested. 
The following are some of the ways in which AI has been useful;
Contract review: The process of finalizing a contract presently is cumbersome as it involves a lot of manual editing, review and endless interactions. This delays completion of work since it’s lengthy. 
Companies like Clearlaw are developing AI systems that process proposed contracts by analyzing them using natural language processing technology and hence determine which sections of the contract are acceptable and those that might seem controversial. 
Once the contract is in place, AI can also help in contract analysis where the system extracts and contextualizes key clauses of the contract to establish the commitments that ought to be made at a future time. 
AI industry player, ThroughRiver using its Fathom Contextual Interpretation Engine System is said to be capable of flagging risky contracts automatically. In summary, AI software employs algorithms that speed up document processing while detecting errors and other issues.
AI teams are building systems that predict the outcomes of pending cases. For example, Lex Machina’s Legal Analytics Platform feature uses AI to predict an estimated time when a case goes to trial before a specific judge. 
Toronto-based Blue J legal says their AI can predict case outcomes with 90 per cent accuracy. As these predictions become more accurate, law firms will employ such systems to plan litigation strategies, to hasten settlement negotiations and also minimize the number of cases that need to actually go to trial. 
AI is also going to be employed in a tenet called litigation finance wherein a third party funds a litigant’s litigation costs in return for a share of the upside if the litigant’s case is successful. Machine intelligence is also being used to make contributions in legal research. Research platforms are being built with capabilities to provide perspectives on how different cases relate to one another. 
They can also actualize legal opinions’ actual meanings. This is a big step away from the traditional and manual practice where junior lawyers were being used to searching through physical case law volumes to find the relevant precedent. 
On its website, eBrevia claims that it can analyze more than 50 documents in less than a minute; that is 10 per cent more accurate than a manual review process.  In simple terms, AI makes legal assistance more affordable if you are to compare what AI can achieve as compared to hiring a human lawyer. 
The good news is this trend is taking off is Uganda too. Some law firms like Dentons and KTA have already associated themselves with artificial intelligence software. They have incorporated AI into their systems and in their way of offering services. For example, lawyers’ billable hours are computed automatically. 
However, with artificial intelligence comes great input and responsibility. AI does not give answers to queries that call for creative thinking. AI only executes what it’s trained to do since it’s developed by humans. Therefore AI is more efficient when adopted by people that understand the ins and outs of the law; otherwise, it can be dangerous exposing them to legal risks that they do not understand.
It is still unclear how this transition to AI will eventually take stage. It is highly likely that large law firms will carry the flag of this transition since they are most capable to afford this complex and robust software. Smaller law firms are expected to start with efficiency-driven and automated approaches because their workload is way less compared to those of the large reputable law firms.
