Six major Spanish and Spanish-based companies have just launched IndesIA: a national strategic consortium. This project has been established to promote the use of data and AI in Spanish industrial companies with the support of pioneering organisations in the field such as the Basque Artificial Intelligence Centre (BAIC). Around 100 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are already interested in joining IndesIA with the aim of accelerating their digitisation processes, productivity and sustainability in the sector.

IndesIA: a consortium launched by six groups to promote artificial intelligence and data

Telefónica, Repsol, Microsoft, Navantia, Técnicas Reunidas and Gestamp are the six founding members of IndesIA: a consortium for the data economy and artificial intelligence in the industrial sector in Spain that has a European vocation and a desire to integrate other companies and sectors.
IndesIA aims to be a driving project, born with the purpose of positioning Spain as a reference in the use of data and artificial intelligence in the industrial field and to promote the development of a new economy generating economic growth in the country.
This consortium has the support and experience of organisations specialising in artificial intelligence, such as the BAIC, and will also work to try to boost employability, reducing the training gap that exists in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The consortium’s focus is on several areas of work

In order to achieve its objectives, the tractor project is structured around the following axes:

Create acceleration mechanisms that will streamline the process of developing solutions based on megadata and artificial intelligence, facilitating access to the technical and financial resources needed to implement them.
Generate an ecosystem of start-ups, technology centers and universities specialized in the research and development of artificial intelligence solutions applied to the industrial field that will allow the sharing and application of the most effective knowledge and solutions.
Promote the creation of a large interoperable industrial data platform that favours the development and consumption of artificial intelligence solutions.
Conclude agreements to facilitate access to cutting-edge technologies (IoT, 5G, cloud, supercomputing, quantum, edge computing…) that will enable case development.
Create a school of data and artificial intelligence to be able to involve and train professionals from the industrial sector in the use and analysis of data through appropriate training routes, which also focus on promoting diversity, gender equality and commitment to scientific profiles.

About sixty use cases, the creation of a library of industrial cases and an adapted ecosystem

IndesIA has already identified some sixty use cases based on artificial intelligence that will help drive the value chains of five industrial sectors: engineering, naval, telecommunications, energy and automotive. All the processes in the industrial domain aim to be improved thanks to data and artificial intelligence.
The consortium envisages the generation of a library of transversal and functional industrial cases, duly documented and with access to the data that allowed them to be solved, which will reduce the barriers to entry of artificial intelligence for companies and for more than the hundred SMEs that are already joining the consortium.
To develop these use cases, an ecosystem of companies, start-ups, technology centres and universities specialising in the application of artificial intelligence in the industrial field should be set up soon. This collaborative network will enable the rapid dissemination of the most effective knowledge and practices, as well as their adaptation to the specific needs of each sector.
Several training paths will be defined to cover both the generalized knowledge that employees in the industrial sector need to acquire to better understand how these solutions can help them in their daily lives, as well as specialize in order to retrain new profiles such as data scientists and data engineers internally.

The snipped pieces were lost. Since the 19th century, the trimmed painting has been housed in the Rijksmuseum, where it is displayed as the museum’s centerpiece, at the focal point of its Gallery of Honor.Now, from Wednesday — for the first time in more than three centuries — it will be possible for the public to see the painting “nearly as it was intended,” said the museum’s director, Taco Dibbits.Using new high-tech methods, including scanning technologies and artificial intelligence, the museum has reconstructed those severed parts and hung them next to the original, to give an idea of “The Night Watch” as Rembrandt intended it.ImageThe museum reconstructed the lost pieces by using scanning technology and artificial intelligence.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageThe scans were printed on canvas, attached to metal plates and varnished to look like a painting.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageThe museum’s multimillion-dollar, multiyear restoration project was initiated in 2019. Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesThe cutdown painting is about 15 feet wide by 13 feet high. About two feet from the left of the canvas was shaved off, and another nine inches from the top. Lesser damage was done to the bottom, which lost about five inches, and the right side, which lost three.The Museums Special SectionDark Awakening: Many artists are dimming the lights of their museum shows, for a mix of symbolic and spiritual reasons.A Story Told in 183 Canvases: A 122-foot-long painting by Noah Saterstrom explores mental illness.Striking a Balance: In a biennial between two museums on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, artists tell fresh stories of their homeland.Exploring History: In North Miami, the Haitian artist Manuel Mathieu weaves the personal and the political.More on Museums: Institutions are striving to offer their visitors more to see, do and feel.Temporarily restoring these parts will give visitors a glimpse of what had been lost: three figures on the left-hand side (two men and a boy) and, more important, a feel for Rembrandt’s meticulous construction in the work’s composition. With the missing pieces, the original dynamism of the masterpiece is stirred back to life.“It gives us an insight into the composition that Rembrandt made,” Dibbits said.Rather than hiring a painter to reconstruct the missing pieces, the museum’s senior scientist, Robert Erdmann, trained a computer to recreate them pixel by pixel in Rembrandt’s style. A project of this complexity was possible thanks to a relatively new technology known as convolutional neural networks, a class of artificial-intelligence algorithms designed to help computers make sense of images, Erdmann said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” he said.Image“The Night Watch” has been a national icon in the Netherlands ever since it was painted in 1642.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageHanging the recreated pieces next to the original painting gives an idea of the work as Rembrandt intended it.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImage“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” said the museum’s senior scientist, Robert Erdmann.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesIndications already existed of how the original “Night Watch” likely looked, thanks to a copy made by Gerrit Lundens, another 17th-century Dutch painter. He made his replica within 12 years of the original, before it was trimmed.Lundens’s copy is less than one-fifth the size of Rembrandt’s monumental canvas, but it is thought to be mostly faithful to the original. It was useful as a model for the missing pieces, even if Lundens’s style was nowhere near as detailed as Rembrandt’s. Lundens’ composition is also much looser, with the figures spread out more haphazardly across the canvas, so it could not be used to make a one-to-one reconstruction.The Rijksmuseum recently made high-resolution scans of Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” as part of a multimillion-dollar, multiyear restoration project, initiated in 2019. Those scans provided Erdmann with precise information about the details and colors in Rembrandt’s original, which the algorithms used to recreate the missing sections using Lundens’s copy as a guide. The images were then printed on canvas, attached to metal plates for stability and varnished to look like a painting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRembrandt’s composition features a large group of Amsterdam’s civic guards led by Capt. Frans Banninck Cocq and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch. The original was asymmetrical: The large arch that stands behind the crowd was in the middle, and the group’s leaders were on the right. Rembrandt painted them this way to create a sense of movement through the canvas.ImageFrom Wednesday — for the first time in more than three centuries — the public will see the painting “nearly as it was intended,” said the museum’s director.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesOnce the new pieces were restored, so was the balance, Dibbits said. “You really get the physical feeling that Banninck Cocq and his colleagues really walk towards you,” he added.Looking at the group of militia men standing just over Banninck Cocq’s shoulder, it is possible to see the top of someone’s head — a hat, a nose and an eye, looking out at the viewer. The figure looks suspiciously like the artist.“That’s so like Rembrandt,” Dibbits said. “To position himself right in the middle.”“It’s part of the process of getting to know the painting in the best way possible,” he added, “as we didn’t know it before.”A version of this article appears in print on June 25, 2021, Section C, Page 14 of the New York edition with the headline: A Trimmed-Down Rembrandt Is Reborn With Help From A.I..

What comes to mind when you think of artificial intelligence?
Maybe you think of an evil cyborg created to kill and destroy? Or maybe a network of vast computers that threatens to steal your job.
Whatever your idea, the truth about artificial intelligence, or “AI” for short, is that it’s far more commonplace than you might imagine, says H.P. Newquist, a computer historian who developed the “Artificial Intelligence: Your Mind & The Machine” exhibit currently at Discovery Place Science.
“The reality is, we already have AI all around us,” he said. “We have it in our cell phones with Siri and Alexa. We have it in our homes and Google GPS maps.” 
Every time you buy a product on Amazon or watch a show on Netflix, AI is watching.
The exhibit, Newquist said, is meant to make artificial intelligence “real and relevant” to more people.
Here are five things we learned while touring the exhibit:
#1. Women led the way
In an industry dominated by men, women have played a central role in the development of AI.
From Mary Shell, the 19th-century author who wrote the book “Frankenstein,” right up to this current day, women have envisioned machines that could “think” like humans…or at least appear to anyway.


You’ll learn about Fei-Fei Li, a Chinese-born scientist who was an early pioneer of artificial intelligence.
Fun fact: A woman named Ada Lovelace is considered by some to be the world’s first computer programmer…way back in the 1800s.
#2. AI looks for patterns
You know those cat pictures we love to hate on the internet? This exhibition tells you how they helped in the development of artificial intelligence. 
That technology has now given way to facial-recognition software, which allows you to unlock your phone simply by looking at the screen. 


Check out the photo above.
Can you tell which squares contain Chihuahuas and which show blueberry muffins? Can artificial intelligence tell the difference? The Discovery Place exhibit provides some surprising answers.
#3. Race matters with AI 
Cameras loaded with facial-recognition software are everywhere in China, and video footage in the Discovery Place exhibit takes you there.
But here in the U.S., many police departments use that same technology to locate suspects.



Because so much is at stake, Newquist said, the tech companies that are developing new generations of AI must do more to recruit and train people of color, lest (even more) racial bias gets built into the systems.
The exhibit will help you see other reasons why that’s important. 
#4. Yes, AI may steal your job
Imagine the amount of artificial intelligence it takes to produce a self-driving car.



Someday that same technology may replace hundreds of thousands of long-haul truckers and other commercial drivers. And when that day arrives, Newquist said, countless other jobs that depend on human drivers also will be lost.
Is your job vulnerable to artificial intelligence? 
The exhibit offers some clues.
#5. It’s complicated
When asked whether society is better off with or without artificial intelligence, Newquist was quick with his response.
“With it,” he said. 


Despite the challenges, artificial intelligence has made our lives better and safer, eliminating mundane tasks and freeing up more of our time for productive (and fun) activities, he said.
“It ultimately only takes a wrong turn when the wrong people use it,” he said.
Visit Discovery Place Science in Uptown to see for yourself.
The AI exhibit will be there through August 22. To keep visitors safe and socially distanced, reservations are required.

Lost Edges of Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ Are Restored Using Artificial Intelligence
Experts have used new technology to recreate missing portions of the old master painting

In 1642, Rembrandt van Rijn completed a dynamic painting called The Night Watch, which depicts the captain of an Amsterdam city militia urging his men into battle. But in 1715 someone cut all four sides of the canvas to hang it on a wall in Amsterdam’s Town Hall, and the strips seemingly vanished into thin air.
Now, researchers have restored the work to its original size using A.I. As Mike Corder reports for the Associated Press (AP), experts used a combination of scanners, X-rays and 528 digital exposures to recreate and print the missing portions of the canvas during “Operation Night Watch,” a multi-million dollar restoration effort that began in 2019. Today, the newly created shreds are affixed to the edges of the painting, which is currently hanging in Rijksmuseum’s honor gallery in Amsterdam.

“We made an incredibly detailed photo of the Night Watch and through artificial intelligence or what they call a neural network, we taught the computer what color Rembrandt used in the Night Watch, which colors, what his brush strokes looked like,” the museum's director Taco Dibbits tells the AP.
The resized painting measures about 15- by 13-feet. In total, someone removed almost two feet from the left of the canvas and another nine inches from the top. The bottom only lost about five inches of fabric, and the right side is missing around three, notes Nina Siegal in the New York Times.
“I am always hoping that somebody will call up one day to say that they have the missing pieces,” Dibbits tells the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey. “I can understand that the bottom part and top might not be saved but on the left hand you have three figures, so it is surprising that they didn’t surface because at the time in 1715 Rembrandt was already much appreciated and an expensive artist.”
However, museum employees haven’t been able to locate the fragments yet, so they had to get creative. Though many museums employ painters to reconstruct master works, the Rijksmuseum decided to use new restoration methods, and its senior scientist Robert Erdmann was able to use a computer to recreate the missing panels stroke by stroke, per the Times.
Erdmann and his team were ultimately able to complete the task thanks to a new technology called Convolutional Neural Networks—a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that helps computers figure out what images may have once looked like.
Experts also used Dutch painter Gerrit Lunden’s 17th-century copy of the painting to determine what the panels should look like. Lunden created his replica around 12 years after Rembrandt completed the original copy. The replica is about one-fifth of the original canvas’ size, and Lunden didn't paint as meticulously as Rembrandt did, but experts believe that the composition of the copy mimics the original one.
“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” Erdmann tells the Times.
Born in the Netherlands in 1606, Rembrandt was one of the most well-respected Baroque painters. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the artist started painting at a young age after he left traditional schooling to train as a painter. Later in his career, Rembrandt created a series of technically accomplished self-portraits and complex narrative scenes like The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632).
Rembrandt’s Night Watch is one of the artist’s most famous works and portrays its main subjects, Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch, in the center of the composition.
Museum employees hope that the new restoration job will help onlookers see Rembrandt’s master work in a way that more closely resembles its original form.
“Rembrandt would have definitely done it more beautifully, but this comes very close,” Dibbits tells the AP.

Law enforcement officers have also started utilising Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes— from petty to horrendous. The machine learning models, help the police department to guide through each step without wasting too much time on any wrong process to capture criminals. It boosts productivity to help victims get justice as soon as possible. Jurors consider multiple pieces of evidence captured by Artificial Intelligence to decide the severity of the punishments. Thus, there is a significant rise in crime prevention and detection after using Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes..Cities are getting smarter with the continuous installation of hi-tech CCTVs and buying smart devices. Artificial Intelligence models work on the real-time information that comes from these CCTVs and records from smart devices. Whenever police officers need to track criminals down, they prefer to use AI like a smart assistant to monitor the movements precisely. The facial recognition system helps in understanding the last location of any victim as well as detecting the behaviour of the criminal or abductor..AI also helps to detect gunfire shots with sensors connected to a cloud-based application. It does not need any passer-by to call the police and inform them about the gunfire. The multiple sensors capture the time and sound of gunfire shots and send real-time data to the police department for determining the current position of the shooter..Artificial Intelligence, is solving crimes by detecting essential and hidden clues from multiple crime scenes that are impossible to detect with the naked human eye. It opens a plethora of connections to new links from the evidence from photographs. The new links are worth checking out because it reduces the time to solve the crime and get hold of the criminal involved..The appropriate use of Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes, helps the law enforcement officers in crime prevention and detection efficiently.

Artificial Intelligence in action

                                                                    By Special Reports

Spiwe Chireka, telecoms, media and technology expert  
AI has the potential to deliver real value in business, creating unprecedented efficiencies across countless processes. But is South Africa’s industry ready? 
In the 1964 children’s novel by British author Roald Dahl Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie’s dad, Mr Bucket, loses his job when the factory where he works is mechanised. Once responsible for screwing the lids onto tubes of toothpaste, he gets laid off because a robot is able to perform his job more cheaply and efficiently. 
This trope of man being replaced by machine often comes up in discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on our world and workforce. But the fear around how emerging technologies will challenge our existing culture and change our lives fails to acknowledge the many benefits that accompany the growth of innovations such as AI. And these gains span all industries, not only computing and IT. 
In 2021, Forrester Research predicted that more and more companies will implement AI for no other reason than because they have to do so if they want to compete in an AI-driven future. 2020 gave business leaders the impetus, born out of necessity, to embrace technologies that make them future-proof and digital-ready, the research firm notes, predicting that the AI software market will grow to $37-billion globally by 2025.
“I would go as far as to say that AI is at the heart of Industry 4.0 and/or the fourth industrial revolution,” says Spiwe Chireka, telecoms, media and technology industry expert. “It is one of those technological advancements that adds the ‘oomph’ to other technology advancements.”
New technology, new ways of working
AI has expanded the bounds of possibility, especially when it comes to data, explains Ndabenhle Ngulube, one of the cofounders of Pineapple, a local insurtech start-up: “Once upon a time, something like time-to-purchase data was seen as futile and meaningless. But today, this kind of data is the de facto input for thousands of AI models around the world.” Why? Because some customers will make a purchase on their first visit to your website, while others will only purchase a product after their second, third or fourth visit. If you understand how long it takes customers to buy something, you have a better understanding of their behaviour and you’re better equipped to tailor your marketing campaigns to offer a more personalised experience.

The insurance industry has historically been guilty of sitting on massive amounts of data, with no application for it. Not only is artificial intelligence changing this narrative, it’s also making the process of taking out insurance faster and easier, Ngulube says. For example, the Pineapple app allows a user to get cover by simply snapping an image of the item they want to insure. The app’s computer vision AI recognises what the image is and then places that image in an appropriate category for pricing purposes before providing the customer with an estimated premium.
Today, every business owner needs to understand how AI can be leveraged across their operations and how it is relevant to their progress and sustainability, says Volente Morais, executive manager at Koogan Plastics, a South African plastics and packaging manufacturer. What do these applications and technologies look like for a business like mine, where production is heavily reliant on people, she asks? Well, they’ve incorporated a smart robot into their labelling assembly line. This AI timed system is trained to respond to the exact location of the product so that it can mould labels directly onto the product instead of sticking on an adhesive label. “The value gained here is efficiency, process improvement and reduction in waste costs. And our increased output ultimately improves our revenue,” she states, noting that innovations like this are game changers in sectors where everyone is selling the same product. But with the introduction of new technologies comes an evolution of the workforce and growth in the sizable skills gaps that already exist. 
According to Professor Duncan Coulter, deputy head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at The University of Johannesburg (UJ), as intelligent systems become more ubiquitous, there is a great need to educate non-specialists in both the use and limitations of these emerging technologies. For those looking to up their AI expertise, UJ has added an AI specialisation option to their existing BSc honours in Computer Science and Informatics. They have also introduced an undergraduate BSc (Computer Science) with an AI specialisation, which includes an AI-focused project module in the final year. In addition to this, the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering offers a short learning programme focused on the creation of intelligent systems using modern techniques and technologies.  
“If you talk about artificial intelligence as the pursuit of creating genuine, generalised intelligence, we are quite far from realising that goal. If you consider artificial intelligence as being our capacity to embed pre-existing intelligent behaviours into artefacts, then we have made considerable progress,” concludes Coulter. “But even fairly simple tools can be used for great good and for great harm; just as a hammer could serve as a tool for construction or a weapon of destruction. For this reason, there is increasing work that needs to be done to maximise the gains that can be made in terms of the tasks these systems are good at, while minimising the harm that can be done through these very same tasks.” — Joanne Carew
AI and legal liabilityBack in 2018, a self-driving Volvo knocked down and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. This was the first pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous car. Who was responsible? AI law refers to the application of the law on AI. Like any branch of law, it has to evolve in order to deal with new challenges and new situations such as this one, notes Patrick Bracher, a director at Norton Rose Fulbright. The increased use of AI demands that existing legal principles be adapted to account for new ways of life and new ways of doing business, and modern precedents will have to be established to determine who is responsible should death, injury or damage be caused by the failure of an AI system.
AI gone wrong Part science, part art, we need to remember that Artificial Intelligence is only as smart as the data it’s fed, which is why AI systems sometimes get things wrong. Back in 2016, a Microsoft Twitter chatbot spewed out misogynistic and racist remarks after learning these sentiments from users. Around the same time, an Amazon recruitment tool came under fire for disadvantaging female candidates because it was based on historical hiring decisions, which traditionally favoured men over women. This is why diversity is so important — diversity in the people developing the AI systems and in the data being used to power them.

In the digital world, artificial intelligence is already capable of doing several things that humans can do. The technology can help robots draw your picture amazingly, write a poem for you, click pictures, do house chores, etc. In a nutshell, artificial intelligence is turning to be humans in the 21st century. However, all is not working out in its favor. If we look closely at AI technology, we can see there are some things that artificial intelligence can't do..Humans started working on technology with the thought to make something as capable as him/them. Although we are not in a full-fledged situation to enjoy such luxury, today, artificial intelligence can do a lot of tasks that humans dreamed of. Moving on to the future, AI researchers predict a period when robots could walk, talk, and have perfect human qualities. Even now, half of them are already happening and some are in progress. However, we don't know if we are awaiting a future where humans and machines work together or robots bring an apocalypse to take over human society. There is no doubt we have had many ground-breaking advancements in machine learning, cloud computing, robotics, quantum computing, etc. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence just isn't there yet. There are many things, that artificial intelligence can't do for humankind or society. In a world filled with AI punditry and hysterical fearmongering, separating artificial intelligence from fiction can be a tough task indeed. That is why Analytics Insight has phrased out some things that artificial intelligence can't do despite its increasing dominance and unconditional development..HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE OF WORK AND LIFE?5 TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL SHAPE 2021 AND BEYONDAFTER YEARS OF ADVANCEMENT, WHAT ARE THE THINGS AI CANNOT DO YET?.Use 'Common sense' to Make Decisions in Real-time.A major aspect where artificial intelligence falls behind humans is in using common sense. Although robots are capable of doing what man is incapable of, such as labor intense jobs and working in dangerous circumstances, artificial intelligence is still no competition to humans' intellect. Machines can even make wise decisions and help humans make the right choice, but when things get twisted, robots entangle in confusion. For example, if we say 'A woman went shopping. She bought a beautiful dress. She left the place with a big smile.' If asked what the woman shopped, a human would instantly say 'a beautiful dress.' But answering these simple questions is very difficult for artificial intelligence..Humans can automatically grasp the concept in real-time, but machines are not wise enough to use their common sense and answer in such situations. Besides, humans have lived through times. So, we know what is necessary for a circumstance and what is not. But machines are just fed with data that were run on humans, which can be complicated. Robots can't get things straight through those datasets and acting to situations in real-time is real trouble for artificial intelligence..Care for Human Beings.Humans are gifted with a sixth sense that makes us different from other living beings. However, despite the improvements that AI researchers have made, robots are still incapable of caring for humans or fellow robots and machines. For example, the Australian government uses a chatbot called 'Nadia' to help people access the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Although Nadia can interpret their speech and expressions with 85% accuracy, she can't abstract the emotions they carry. With zero emotional intelligence, Nadia just looks at their sad face and carries out the process. Therefore, all the responses by Nadia are rational from a perspective. Whether the caller yells or cries or talks sweetly, her response would be similar to all of them..This is where robots highly differ from humans. Even AI researchers agree that people will never forget how you made them feel in a critical situation and today's artificial intelligence can't compete with reality on that scale..Do Multiple Tasks at the Same Time.We must've come across the ideology that women are capable of doing multiple tasks at the same time very well. When men are already incapable of doing the same at women's level, machines are nothing. AI researchers have trained robots to solve specific problems. But the ability to perform different tasks at a time is still in progress. Recently, Google tried its hand at making robots do multiple tasks. It implied its Google Assistant to do the routines. But the result was not very positive. Although artificial intelligence was capable of doing a number of things, it only played a selective role after receiving a command. So it is safe to say that today's robots can't take notes from a business chart, attend a phone call and answer the queries, and arrange things for the upcoming meeting, all at the same time..Replace a Good Employee.Forget the dystopian future, humans are just scared of the fact that robots might take over their jobs very soon. Although this could be a reality to some extent, it is not a complete truth. Take the robots in healthcare for example. They take medicines to patients, follow their timeline, and even perform surgeries. But what they lack is the empathy to comfort people. But an actual human doctor can do that. Besides, machines can't take the initiative and proactively look for areas of improvement. Human employees develop processes and train others to make the company work more effectively and efficiently. Even though machines can take over laborious jobs, they will only push humans to carry out intellectual works without wiping out their job opportunities..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

But today it is intensively about software tools and computer designs. The demand for artificial intelligence and digital technology has been gaining momentum. Advancements in the AI sector are transforming smart systems and supervised machine learning to a great extent..Artificial intelligence systems will ease the laborious tasks that engineers do such as finding relevant content, fixing errors, and determining solutions. Smart systems can help finish their job quickly. AI and digital tech can also assist the system engineer in creating sophisticated designs along with incorporating sensor-based design procedures and delivering the designs to intelligent manufacturing facilities..But AI may not approach the project the way a human designer would. Sometimes this can go off the grid too. Because today's machines are usually made of expert systems that have software-enabled decision-making. Since the engine of this software is based on if-then rules, it is acquired through experience..When new knowledge is registered in the library, the software uses if-then rules to expand new facts or ifs and comes out suggesting various solutions or then what occurs..This process serves as the basis of AI and machine learning. As people are connected with the help of the internet, this opens the doors for smart machines to bring in new services and opportunities..The largest fraction of smart systems is currently made of expert systems and this will be soon taken over by autonomous robots through technology transformation by 2024. There are critics as well as supporters for this trend. Since the number of robotic appliances continues to increase automatically, the cost of the sensors will decrease this becomes the simple reason for artificial intelligence robots to multiply within no time..The robotic sensors market is estimated to undergo a CAGR of nearly 8% over the forecast period of (2021-2026). Currently, most of the industries like automotive, transportation, industrial manufacturing, logistics, and defense have started to adopt autonomous robotics and digital technology as their main mode of the production process..As a result, due to this rapid growth of smart technologies with its roots, interconnected artificial intelligence can lead to uncertainty. Though computers can take intelligently-based action, they are not capable of replicating the cognition processes of the human brain. Algorithms of artificial intelligence tech can only deal with known data and cannot predict and formulate rational decisions during uncertain situations..New technologies using the most advanced AI and machine learning have been coming up due to their widespread connectivity and inexpensive sensors. These technologies are primitive and still are not capable of mimicking the human brain..It becomes clear that AI algorithms relate facts to solutions that are dependent on experiential learning without any acknowledgment of physics. AI has evolved from scientific advancement to an engineering tool. Latest innovations in digital tech require engineers from various domains to learn and integrate AI tools into their engineering designs..Many open-source tools such as Microsoft's DMLT, Google's TensorFlow, and Amazon's DSSTNE possess software libraries that empower machine learning. The DeepVariant open AI software of Google can depict a person's genome from sequencing data more accurately than other methods are helping engineers to seek help from..Personal productivity assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Windows Cortana use natural language processing to make decisions. IBM Watson has been trained by Oncologists to help them treat and diagnose lung cancer. Tesla is getting closer to self-driving autonomous vehicles. Zebra Medical Systems, an Israeli company is developing tools for radiology having greater than human accuracy. All this is possible with the help of different types of engineers who are responsible for training smart systems..At this point in time, the role of a human engineer may be that of a director shortly rather than producing and manufacturing the products. Though humans may not be executing the task, they are definitely the ones who are choosing the direction the machine should work. Once the machine knows how to design things, the system of engineering will change but engineers will still be highly skilled and relevant..The uncertain future of technologies demands resilient and versatile engineers who can design robust technologies using artificial intelligence with different skill sets, including teaching AI systems how to innovate and become part of future human-AI organizations..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health, is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of international experts appointed by WHO. “Like all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.” Artificial intelligence can be, and in some wealthy countries is already being used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and screening for diseases; to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management. AI could also empower patients to take greater control of their own health care and better understand their evolving needs. It could also enable resource-poor countries and rural communities, where patients often have restricted access to health-care workers or medical professionals, to bridge gaps in access to health services.However, WHO’s new report cautions against overestimating the benefits of AI for health, especially when this occurs at the expense of core investments and strategies required to achieve universal health coverage.It also points out that opportunities are linked to challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data; biases encoded in algorithms, and risks of AI to patient safety, cybersecurity, and the environment.       For example, while private and public sector investment in the development and deployment of AI is critical, the unregulated use of AI could subordinate the rights and interests of patients and communities to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control.

AI systems should therefore be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socio-economic and health-care settings. They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients.

An expert on how data and algorithms are changing work responds to Janelle Shane’s “The Skeleton Crew.”
“The Skeleton Crew” asks us to consider two questions. The first is an interesting twist on an age-old thought experiment. But the second is more complicated, because the story invites us to become aware of a very real phenomenon and to consider what, if anything, should be done about the way the world is working for some people.
The first question explores what it would mean if our machines, robots, and now artificial intelligences had feelings the way we do. (Recall the Haley Joel Osment child A.I. that was created to suffer an unending love for its human mother while society dies around it.) “The Skeleton Crew” offers an interesting twist because the A.I. indeed has feelings just like us, because it is, in fact, us: The A.I. is a group of remote workers faking the operations of a haunted house to make it seem automated and intelligent.

It’s a fun take on the trope. That the A.I. actually is real people with real feelings underscores the villainy, heroism, or oblivious indifference of other characters around them. The villains interact with the A.I. in murderous ways, and their fear of it is their ultimate downfall. The badass damsel in distress graciously thanks the A.I. for saving her life before she knows that it’s humans. The billionaire is oblivious to the actual workings of this world he’s created, whether it is shoddy A.I. or real people, and he ghosts as soon as his moneymaking is in question. Interestingly, the crowds of people who go through the haunted house seem most interested in seeing whether they can break the A.I. and prove it’s not actually intelligent (recall the Microsoft Tay release). Perhaps this represents our human bravado, wanting to prove we’re a little harder to replace than A.I. tech companies think we are.

The second question, less familiar and comfortable, is queued up when Bud Crack, the elderly Filipino remote team manager, says to his team: “I’m trying to explain things to them. What we are. They’re confused.”
Before “they”—those operating in expected, visible roles in society—can offer any kind of assistance, they need to wrap their minds around the very existence of remote workers faking the operations of A.I. In this case, the 911 operator has to get from her belief that “the House of A.I. is run by an advanced artificial intelligence” to a new understanding that there is a frantic remote worker in New Zealand who has been remotely controlling the plastic Closet Skeleton in the House of A.I. and is now the only person in the world with (remote) eyes on a dangerous situation.

This fictional moment mirrors an actual reality that is detailed in the award-winning book Ghost Work by Mary Gray, an anthropologist at Microsoft Research and a 2020 MacArthur Fellow, and Siddharth Suri, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research. Ghost work refers to actual, in-the-flesh human beings sitting in their homes doing actual paid work to make A.I. systems run. Most machine learning models today use supervised learning, where the model learns how to make correct decisions from a dataset that has been labeled by people. Ghost work refers to the paid, piecework data labeling that humans do so the models can learn correct decisions: for instance, labeling images, flagging X-rated content, tagging text or audio content, proofreading, and much more. You may have done some of this data labeling work for free by completing a reCAPTCHA identifying all the bikes or traffic lights in a photo in order to sign in to different websites.

The decade or so of academic research emerging around this topic gives an opportunity to understand these work conditions as well as the experiences of people who go into and out of participation in these platforms. Three themes connect into the “Skeleton Crew” story, and offer some visibility into this work experience.
First, many but not all of these work settings are subject to “algorithmic management,” which includes functions such as automated hiring and termination and also gamification of performance evaluation, with scores linked to wages. Here in Silicon Valley, such automated management functions are framed as enabling “scale,” because human supervisors or evaluators are no longer needed. In “The Skeleton Crew,” the automated management functions that monitored the workers’ success at scaring visitors, among other things, had a “hostility that was rivaled only by [the] profound shoddiness.” In the story, as in many settings, people working on these platforms experience autotermination with no recourse as particularly cruel. I suspect many of us have encountered some form of “algorithmic cruelty,” such as getting locked out of an online account or getting scammed by a fake flower website, with no options for recourse, no phone number to call, no humans to talk to. Now imagine that your income and livelihood were subject to such automated systems and dehumanizing responses. Or, per Hatim Rahman’s research, imagine losing income and professional status on an automated platform for reasons that will never be explained to you and indeed seem to be intentionally opaque. “The Skeleton Crew” suggests that the shoddy systems and dehumanizing treatment are completely unnecessary and almost puzzlingly so, perhaps because the billionaire company needed to pretend like there were not humans operating the system. The real-world examples of people or companies faking A.I. operations are strange, but not uncommon. One New Zealand company seems to have faked a digital A.I. assistant for doctors, with nonsensical interfaces such as clients needing to email the A.I. system. The founders chided a questioning reporter for choosing “not to believe.” But companies don’t have to make explicitly false claims about A.I. to engage in ghost work. Some academics and activists, including Lilly Irani, have argued that many human-in-the-loop automated systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk rely on the invisibility of the people involved because it seems to make the technology appear more advanced and autonomous than it actually is, and the rhetoric and system design try to create invisibility of the human work.

Second, despite some of these cultural conditions and system designs, these work settings, like almost any, are collaborative and social and meaningful. Take, for example, the Uber and Lyft drivers banding together to game the algorithmically managed prices. Such collaboration is common, even on the purposefully individualistic crowd platforms. Another of Gray and Suri’s research papers showed the collaboration network created by people working on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where they as “crowdworkers” collaborated to ensure best wages and create social connections (see also the Turkopticon system). Similarly, the Skeleton Crew actively collaborated to create workarounds within the dysfunctional system, including dividing up the Closet Skeleton shifts because the gamified “Scare-O-Meter” was so bad for this role that it typically meant no wages (until, hilariously, one of them realized the Scare-O-Meter registered a mop as a frightened human face and the whole team could get paid for Closet Skeleton shifts again). Because of their collaboration and how they had “clawed their way together” through this bizarre system, it would have been catastrophic to lose a co-worker in what might seem like individualistic jobs.

Third, “The Skeleton Crew” gives insight into these work worlds through its lively examples of how amazingly good humans are at improvisation and at developing situated expertise, capabilities that remain difficult for automated systems. Lucy Suchman and colleagues have several books and articles that analyze humans’ improvisation and situated expertise, and “The Skeleton Crew” illustrates these ideas with fun details: The team figures out how far the Dragonsulla has advanced through the haunted house by spotting a bit of her star eyeshadow in the malfunctioning bizarro A.I. profiles on the wall; Cheesella knows she can eject one of her cheap plastic skeleton hands to distract the bad guys and also thinks to pull the fire alarm when she realizes her remote-controlled skeleton self has no way of communicating with the people in the room. The Skeleton Crew’s understanding of the idiosyncratic context, and the collaborative improvisation that it took for its members to expertly use the setting to thwart the attack, offers a fun and realistic take on how groups of people work together, even when completely remote and even when mediated through virtual communication.

These themes in the story give us insight into these work conditions and start us thinking on the more complicated second question the story asks us to consider: As society begins to better see and understand the potential cruelties of ghost work conditions, is there anything that can to be done? Gray sometimes likens the current moment to when society began to really understand the realities of child labor and the urgent need for more protective laws. She argues that what is needed is regulation—specifically, regulation that recognizes a  new “form of employment that does not fit in full-time employment or fully in part-time employment or even clearly in self-employment.” Such regulations involve getting the new classification of employment right, and also ensuring needed provisions and benefits for all kinds of relevant work, even as technologies and jobs and employment statuses change. Pressing for this new employment classification, and related provisions and regulations, requires us to see work conditions that have not been easily visible, and also for companies to recognize that these are not merely temporary work conditions “on the way to automation” and to take action. Hopefully “The Skeleton Crew” helps begin or continue this awareness and conversation.

Artificial intelligence is a data hog; effectively building and deploying AI and machine learning systems require large data sets. “The development of a machine learning algorithm depends on large volumes of data, from which the learning process draws many entities, relationships, and clusters,” says Philip Russom of TDWI. “To broaden and enrich the correlations made by the algorithm, machine learning needs data from diverse sources, in diverse formats, about diverse business processes.”


At the same time, AI itself can be instrumental in identifying and preparing the data needed to increase the value of AI-driven or analytics-driven systems. Companies have needed cadres of data scientists or high-level analysts to put AI and machine learning algorithms in place, AI itself may ultimately help automate such roles to a large degree.

“A new generation of enterprise analytics is emerging, and it incorporates some degree of both automation and contextual information,” according to Tom Davenport and Joey Fitts, writing in Harvard Business Review. AI-enhanced analytics systems “can prepare insights and recommendations that can be delivered directly to decision makers without requiring an analyst to prepare them in advance.”

PROMOTED
Business intelligence analysts and quantitative professionals “will still have important tasks to perform, but many will no longer have to provide support and training to amateur data users,” according to Davenport and Fitts. “Small to mid-size businesses that haven’t been able to afford data scientists will be able to analyze their own data with higher precision and clearer insight. All that will matter to organizations’ analytical prowess will be a cultural appetite for data, a set of transactional systems that generate data to be analyzed, and a willingness to invest in and deploy these new technologies.”

Of course, the ability to effectively automate data science tasks depends on industry and circumstances. As Matt Przybyla, senior data scientist and author of Toward Data Science, points out, there often still needs to be trained human guidance to AI and machine learning initiatives, especially if the output is critical to the tasks at hand. “Sure, use an automated data science platform if you already have a data analyst on your team. Or, use the automated solution for predictions that are not harmful if incorrect. Categorizing clothes incorrectly is not the worst thing that can happen, but when you are in the health or finance industry and you classify a disease or large sums of money incorrectly, the harm is undeniable.”

While automated AI data science tools or platforms may be easy and powerful, they also may leave businesses with unanswered questions. “Imagine you are not a data scientist and have not had an academic background in the various types of machine learning algorithms,” Przybyla continues. “You will have to explain these platform model results and implement the suggestions or predictions with regards to your company’s integrations, which could prove to be time-consuming and difficult.”

There may be ways to automate various pieces of data science roles, but the skills category that will still be essential is that of data engineer. There are many tasks required to source, manage and store data in which data scientists don’t necessarily want to get involved. “To succeed with AI, companies should have an automation environment with reliable historian data,” a McKinsey report observes. Then, companies “will need to adapt their big data into a form that is amenable to AI, often with far fewer variables and with intelligent, first principles–based feature engineering,” the study’s authors, led by Jay Agarwal, state. Data engineering is needed to produce “smart data” to improve predictive accuracy and aids in root-cause analysis. This, along with equipping staff with the right skills, can provide services that can help increase revenues up to 15 percent, they relate.
“The most important role the most important first hire is a data engineer,” says John Mosch, senior manager of analytics, business intelligence, and data science at Cisco. “Without data, there’s nothing to do. These are the people who are going to make the data available and usable. They’re going to collect it and arrange it into a form that can be ultimately useful for analytics that ultimately is used by data scientists. A data scientist can’t find anything, can’t do anything until there’s a good set of data to work from.”
Data scientists and high-level data analysts will continue to be in demand, and are critical to helping enterprises design and test algorithms and data needed to predict trends, automate processes, understand customers, and engage with customers. However, the amount of data flowing into and through enterprises is overwhelming, as are demands for new algorithms and capabilities — beyond what a data scientist can accomplish. AI is opening the door to better and more accessible AI.

You were created to be so young.”This heartbreaking line arrives toward the end of AI: Artificial Intelligence, many centuries after David, an uncommonly sophisticated mechanical child (or “Mecha”), has embarked on a quest to become “a real boy”, like Pinocchio, and reunite with the human mother he’s been programmed to love. The years have not aged him, of course. He is eternally young, incapable of acquiring the wisdom and perspective that come with age. He can’t comprehend the passage of time, much less the absurd and quixotic nature of his mission. He just wants his mommy.Shrek at 20: an unfunny and overrated low for blockbuster animationRead moreThe purity of that feeling is something Steven Spielberg has been chasing for much of his career, how the innocence of a child is expressed through wonder on one end and intense vulnerability on the other. The magic of Spielberg’s ET the Extra Terrestrial is that it extracts tears at both ends of the spectrum, whether young Eliot is lifting off on his bicycle or connecting with his alien friend as he falls under the cold scrutiny of grown-ups. AI is much more about vulnerability than wonder, and it may be Spielberg’s darkest film, darker than Schindler’s List, which seeks out a sliver of redemption from an overwhelming historical horror. There’s a redemption arc in AI, too, but it’s as synthetic (and as real) as the android at the center of it.Though it’s been 20 years since AI polarized audiences, the genesis of the film extends another 30 years before that, when Stanley Kubrick picked up the rights to the 1969 Brian Aldiss short story Supertoys Last All Summer Long and began the slow development process that didn’t always result in an actual film. (See also: Napoleon, Aryan Papers and scores of others unrealized projects.) When the title “An Amblin/Stanley Kubrick production” comes on screen, you can anticipate the cognitive dissonance between the two film-makers: Kubrick the cold clinician, taking inventories of man’s hypocrisies and destructive nature; Spielberg the slick entertainer, a brand name in Hollywood storytelling. How could those sensibilities possibly be reconciled?That’s a rhetorical question to those who consider AI a failure, but for the others who admire it, like me, the tension between Kubrick and Spielberg results in a one-of-a-kind experience, a bleak film about human nature disguised as a sentimental science fiction fairytale. Through Spielberg’s lens, David becomes a real boy the moment Monica (Frances O’Connor) finishes the formal “imprinting” process that ends with the android calling her his mother. Kubrick reportedly never believed a child actor could play the role of David convincingly, but the way Haley Joel Osment, as David, softens his expression after that last command lays that concern to rest. He is a robot who has been programmed to love his parent and Spielberg and Osment make it impossible to think about David’s love as inauthentic, even though we’re aware that he’s just a piece of next-gen technology, the first in a line of super-toys ready for shipping.The Gepetto in this Pinocchio story is Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt), who designs David to a fill the needs of a society in collapse. In the 22nd century, climate change has led to a rise in sea levels that has wiped out coastal cities, drastically reduced global population, and led to legal sanctions on pregnancies, since human children would tax the world’s limited resources. Monica and her husband, Henry, are chosen as the “perfect” family for David, because their son Martin has contracted a rare disease and is being kept in “suspended animation”, without much hope of recovery. The idea of replacing Martin with a like-aged robot son initially repulses Monica, but she warms to this uncanny being over time and goes through with the imprinting.The ethical question a colleague asks of Professor Hobby when he talks about his new creation hovers over the entire film: “If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold to that Mecha in return?” Humankind is used to the answer being “none at all”, as we learn later when outdated robots are rounded up at Flesh Fairs, which are like monster truck rallies where people cheer at the destruction of technologies that have clearly made their lives worse. But the time between when Monica does the imprinting and when she tearfully leaves David in the woods is the most important and powerful stretch of the film. Monica is playing pretend with David, taking comfort in the maternal rituals that Martin’s absence has denied her. But pretend for long enough and maybe it doesn’t feel like pretend any more.View image in fullscreenSteven Spielberg on the set. Photograph: APThat’s how the movies work, too, right? That’s how we ache for David when Monica and Henry’s real son returns and a hoped-for sibling relationship goes sour, culminating at a birthday party when David nearly drowns Martin in a swimming accident. Spielberg doesn’t even have to hide David’s synthetic qualities all that much – the meals that he fake eats, his weird laughing outbursts, his blank does-not-compute expression whenever he’s confused – because we accept the premise that he loves his mother. As consumers of fiction, we get emotionally invested in unreal characters all the time, and they don’t have to be human beings when they’re creatures as sincere and pitiable as David.The middle section of AI follows David (and his adorable Teddy Ruxpin-like toy companion) in his quest to find “Blue Fairy” that will turn him into a real boy, which leads him to cross paths with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a Mecha prostitute on the run from a murder setup. If this is a Pinocchio story, then the entire second act has the nightmarish quality of Pleasure Island, that lawless place in the 1940 Disney film where boys smoke cigars, engage in various vices, and eventually turn into braying donkeys. We realize that Monica and Henry are among the privileged few and that society-at-large has become a Pleasure Island of cheap pleasures meant to salve deep wounds and resentments. This is no place for a boy like David. It’s no place for anyone. And it may be what the future holds for us.The end of AI is the most misunderstood part of the film, perhaps because it seems like Spielberg is engineering a happy ending when it’s really much more on the bitter side of bittersweet. The last third is a mirror reflection of the first third, a day-in-the-life ritual of a mother-son relationship, only this time the mother is the more synthetic being of the two. Neither of them have a future, together or apart. Both were consigned to obsolescence long ago, along with the entire human race and planet at large.But they can fake it so real. And, in the hands of Steven Spielberg, one of the great movie fantasists, we can pretend along with them.Explore more on these topicsAISteven SpielbergJude LawStanley KubrickScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policy‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’Who is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – live",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) has studied the awareness and image of artificial intelligence among the French. The main question around which the study revolves is the following: “How do the French perceive artificial intelligence? One of the findings shows that the French are aware of the important role that AI plays in economic life and trust it, but say they are poorly informed about the possibilities that this technology can bring.

The omnipresence of artificial intelligence in the consciousness of individuals
In the survey proposed by IFOP, the first point put forward is the ubiquity of artificial intelligence since 91% of the individuals questioned have already heard about it. One French person out of two claims to know what it is precisely, but only 27% of them have already used services or products that exploit AI in their personal life. As soon as one is interested in professional life, the figure drops (16%). IFOP states:
“These figures reveal a significant gap between the perception that the French have of artificial intelligence and the actual use they have of it. Because as soon as you use your smartphone or take advantage of a streaming platform, AI is present. So it seems that the French have difficulty identifying it.”

In the 91% of individuals, almost all are aware of being uninformed on the subject and more than two-thirds of French people want to be more aware, an increase of 8% (58% vs. 66%) compared to 2018. The sectors where lack of awareness of AI seems to be present are health (66%), the environment (69%) and education (70%).
However, 76% of the French are convinced that AI will play an important role in our daily lives in the years to come: a figure that is 22% higher than in 2019.
Artificial intelligence: indispensable and positive on work performance

45% of those questioned believe that AI is indispensable and are therefore aware that its development is crucial and that whatever happens, many of them will be impacted. In the context of their working lives, roughly the same proportion of individuals (44%) consider that AI has a fairly positive impact on work performance, on the development of skills (42%) and on well-being at work (40%), figures that are up by three to four points compared to 2019.
At the same time, 42% of respondents believe that AI will have a rather negative impact on the sustainability of their jobs. A result that could be correlated with another study conducted by Botnation among consumers and professionals.
The importance of trusted artificial intelligence in the eyes of the French

For 73% of the French, the development of trusted AI is an important issue. Compared to 2019, those surveyed trust it more (64% vs. 58% in 2019). 21% of them have a better opinion of AI since the beginning of the health crisis related to COVID-19 and 47% think it is becoming more important in the health sector.
In comparison, 24% of French people are wary of AI and think there may be a risk of misuse, while 20% think there are risks related to data protection and loss of know-how. To conclude, Agnès Van de Walle, President of the Impact AI collective and Director of Partners and Start-ups Microsoft France, spoke about this study and responsible AI:
“If the health crisis has accelerated the uses of digital technology, this new edition of the Impact AI barometer shows that it has also contributed to the evolution of the French people’s perception of artificial intelligence. Whether in their professional or private spheres, the majority of French people now consider AI as a way to progress, as long as these uses are made in a framework of trust. In this sense, our collective has already been committed for 3 years to the development of a responsible AI which represents a major issue for the French and society as a whole.”

As part of this survey, 1,524 French people were questioned: 1,017 individuals representative of the French population aged over 18 as well as 507 employees representative of French working life.

A Moral Question: Gender and (Re)production in A.I. Artificial Intelligence 20 Years Later

Features
Steven Spielberg






Originally to be helmed by Stanley Kubrick before the baton was passed over to Steven Spielberg, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is emblazoned with visual motifs indicative of both filmmakers’ catalogs. Though Kubrick died two years before the film’s release, the distinct essence of both filmmakers is palpable due to Spielberg’s script closely following the original treatment from Kubrick’s fledgling work on the project in the ‘70s. Though many critics have unduly attributed certain aspects of A.I.’s contrasting tone of surreal, uncanny darkness and whimsical adventure to the wrong directors, the exploration of these two realms and the moral dilemmas they pose on a futuristic, dystopian level are never more tangible than when delving into the construction of gender.
Against public misconception, Spielberg remains faithfully fixated on the sinister ethical conundrums presented in A.I., unsettling audiences with the implications of this far-off 2141 society outsourcing human emotions to machines. During the opening sequence of the film, an otherwise supplementary character simply credited as “female colleague” (April Grace) raises an uncomfortable philosophical question. This inquiry emerges in response to a presentation by Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt), lead scientist of Cybertronics of New Jersey, who aims to build a robot child model who will eternally and “genuinely love the parent or parents that it imprints on.”
“If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return?” she interjects. “It’s a moral question, isn’t it?”
Professor Hobby pauses. “In the beginning, didn’t God create Adam to love him?”
The resulting mecha child is David (Haley Joel Osment), a prototype given a trial run in the household of Cybertronics employee Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife Monica (Frances O’Connor). The couple are selected for beta testing due to the fact that their own child, Martin (Jake Thomas) is in a state of suspended animation via cryogenic freezing due to a mysterious illness for which modern medicine currently has no cure.
Despite her initial discomfort around David, Monica begins to treat him as a son—even gifting him Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel), a “supertoy” stuffed bear equipped with a capacity for language and play. Despite being told that the process is irreversible barring David’s destruction, Monica triggers the mecha-boy’s imprinting protocol—thus committing David to an existence centered around unconditional love for her as his “Mommy.” Though David’s company brings much-needed solace to the grieving mother, it’s clear that her love for the manufactured child is nowhere near as irrevocable as his automated love for her. Shortly after imprinting, David’s place in the Swinton home is quickly made redundant when Martin unexpectedly recovers and returns. After a series of escalating accidents occur as a result of a competition between the two boys for Monica’s affection, Henry demands that she return David to Cybertronics headquarters for destruction. Heartbroken by David’s innocence and unyielding adoration, Monica opts to abandon him in the wilderness surrounding the corporation’s entrance. Tears in her eyes, Monica’s last words to David are, “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the world.”
The world in question is one that exists well after the most cataclysmic events of global warming have taken place, obliterating coastal cities like New York, Venice and Amsterdam. Ensuing global poverty and a population boom prompts governments in the “developed world” to place strict sanctions to license pregnancies. Presumably, this is why Monica is unable to have another child after Martin—it is illegal for her to become pregnant. In this sense, robots “were so essential an economic link in the chain mail of society,” as the opening voiceover explains, because they allowed the affluent to circumvent the restrictions curbing reproductive rights on a national scale.
The intersection of gender and artificial intelligence has been a prevalent throughline within science fiction, appearing on film in titles such as Blade Runner (1982), Cherry 2000 (1988), Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Ex Machina (2014). Furthermore, Blade Runner director Ridley Scott has a vested interest in understanding the role of motherhood within the genre, including these themes in both his directorial breakthrough Alien (1979) and the 2020 HBO show he executive produced and partially directed, Raised by Wolves. Questions of exploitation and autonomy are intrinsically linked to the production of artificially intelligent beings—particularly when they resemble human women—because of the gendered oppression faced by the very people they are made in the likeness of. When sex, home-rearing and other preconceived “duties” meant to be fulfilled by women are outsourced to non-human beings who merely resemble them, the same subjugation continues to exist.
In A.I., this complication is cleverly inverted. Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a charismatic “lover bot” programmed to be a safe and sensual hourly companion, understands that his relationship to his human clients is tenuous and solely for their benefit. He becomes David’s starkly adult counterpart after they both escape destruction at an anti-mecha “Flesh Fair” shortly after he is abandoned by Monica. When David becomes convinced that the Blue Fairy he remembers from Monica’s reading of Pinocchio will turn him into a “real boy” as she did the titular wooden marionette, Joe asserts that she can likely be found in Rouge City, a seedy spot where human vice (and robot-aided satiation of these vices) reigns supreme.
When addressing a car-load of adolescent boys he hopes will give him and David a lift to Rouge City, he delivers a more than compelling sales pitch. “There are girls your age who are just like me,” he explains. “We are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being. You’re not gonna get us pregnant or have us to supper with Mommy and Daddy. We work under you, we work on you and we work for you.”
The emphasis is on the transactional aspect of labor which has come to be outsourced to mecha: Sex workers, nannies and house cleaners included. These often precarious occupations have essentially omitted human exploitation by creating robots to serve these roles, yet the prejudices and dangers surrounding these services still remain. When Joe is framed for murdering a client earlier in the film, the material drawbacks of this subservient existence are made profoundly clear. With no protections or autonomy, Joe is forced to go on the run—which is how he ended up in the nefarious flesh fair with David in the first place.
In her revolutionary 1991 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century,” theorist Donna Haraway argues that a cyborgian existence—patently non-human and thus transcendent of all man-made systems of oppression—should indeed be one of inherent liberation.
“The machine is not an ‘it’ to be animated, worshipped, and dominated,” she writes. “The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they.”
Haraway’s blatantly utopian vision of how women and people of color would benefit from being relieved from the structural oppression of humanity’s (and above all, Western colonialism’s) rule, is responded to in A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The film argues that the systems in place are in no position to be shifted or altered in the wake of powerful corporations wielding artificial life in order to serve “the human race in all the multiplicity of daily life.” Yet Haraway understands that when the power structure is not thoroughly obliterated, the distribution of power—particularly along gender lines—will continue to play out as they have for centuries. In essence, A.I. unravels what will occur to a society that never reckons with the inequalities of its social stratification—meanwhile, Haraway offers an idyllic blueprint for how the upheaval of this inequitable system would dramatically alter and empower the lives of marginalized individuals.
“Every story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation,” Harroway writes. “These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics—rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy.”
In this sense, both David and Monica exist within a system which devalues both of their multifaceted natures. Monica is only seen as fulfilled when she assumes the role of mother and nurturer; meanwhile, David’s “original innocence” is rendered without purpose when abandoned by the caretaker he imprinted on. Within the confines of the nuclear familial structure, both are stripped of true individuality and the ability to forge a new path for themselves.
Even when David supposedly overrides his internal circuitry—which was created to hinder his ability to make decisions and “follow his dreams”—it is with the resolute goal of finding the Blue Fairy, so that he can become a “real boy” for Monica. Frustrated with David’s lack of understanding, Gigolo Joe makes one final plea for David to abandon his plight before traveling to the perilous submerged island of Manhattan where he believes the mythical mother figure to reside.
“[Monica] loves what you do for her, as my customers love what it is I do for them,” he begins. “But she does not love you, David. She cannot love you. You are neither flesh nor blood…[Humans] made us too smart, too quick and too many. We are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes, all that will be left is us. That’s why they hate us.”
Joe’s words ring true right up to the emotion-shattering conclusion of A.I. Artificial Intelligence (though the entire film, admittedly, induces tears throughout). When David and Teddy travel through the flooded ruins of New York, they eventually stumble upon a gorgeous ceramic statue of the Blue Fairy in the aquatic rubble of Coney Island, a discovery which David becomes so obsessed and entranced with that he remains in her presence for 2,000 years, long after the power supply of his amphibious vessel has completely depleted. At this point, advanced mecha are the only remaining inhabitants of an Earth clutched by glacial freeze. It is they who discover David and Teddy in the icy depths, eventually housing them in a simulation of the Swinton household recreated via David’s stored memories. The advanced beings explain to David that he is the last remaining tether to human life and connection. Yet in lieu of focusing on the immense cruelty he and other mecha suffered at the hands of vindictive humans, David begs the beings to utilize their advanced technology to bring Monica back from the dead, presenting a lock of her hair as a means to harvest her DNA.
“All we want is for your happiness,” the advanced robots concede. Monica is only able to be brought back to life for one full day, after which she will die. David proceeds to spend the happiest day of his life with a reincarnated Monica—then goes on to defy the laws of his very programming, dying by her side that night.
“For the first time in his life,” Ben Kingsley’s narration concludes as David shuts his eyes for the first and only time during the film’s duration, “he went to that place where dreams are made of.”
Ironically, it is through death that David finds ultimate freedom from the brutal margins of his creation. Though this is not seen as “survival” in the literal sense, it is an act of self-determination that truly echoes the thesis of Haraway’s essay. “Cyborg writing is about the power to survive,” she writes, “not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as ‘other.’”
Conversely, Monica cannot escape the narrow identity of Mother even by means of resurrection. Though the bleakness of A.I.’s ending in large part stems from the tragedy of David’s self-induced slumber, there remains a distinct streak of melancholy when it comes to Monica’s own inability to escape the narrow label of Mother even when given life anew. In fact, there is little about her existence that is removed from her duties as wife and mother. Despite the inescapable presence of the nuclear family and dominant view of women as innately reproductive and servile, the film’s depiction of traditional gender roles outliving major coastal cities in the post-apocalypse is particularly salient.
However, Monica’s pleasant last day on Earth with David is not entirely depressing. Haraway argues that by being “out of place” (i.e. stripped from the hierarchy of her traditional family structure) and reuniting with David (“the machine”), she herself is able to engage in a cyborgian inversion of feminine expectations of child-rearing: “Up till now…female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females.”
In harnessing the biological phenomenon of mortality, David extrapolates himself from an existence without control. In spite of never being recognized as a “real boy,” David is nonetheless able to free himself of the burden of eternal devotion and naivete. In turn, Monica is retroactively manufactured in order to fulfill David’s desire as a mecha, inversing the method of creation (and the enduringly misogynistic society) which produced David in the first place. This power structure is not one of force and control, but rather one created with loving intention and with objective happiness as the goal. Within this compassionate framework, conjured via the adept minds of both Kubrick and Spielberg, the cyborgian entity is truly liberated.

The era of artificial intelligence is already upon us, and it's found its home in the cloud.
Artificial intelligence (AI) assists in the automation of routine activities within IT infrastructure, which increases productivity. The combination of AI and cloud computing results in an extensive network capable of holding massive volumes of data while continuously learning and improving.







With tools available from top public cloud providers, such as IBM Watson, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure AI and the AWS AI services portfolio, advanced AI and machine learning capabilities are more readily available to enterprises. Learn how AI can benefit your enterprises, as well as areas to watch out for.

The benefits of AI in cloud computing
AI has changed the cloud landscape in the following ways:


Lower costs
A big advantage of cloud computing  is that it eliminates costs related to on-site data centers, such as hardware and maintenance. Those upfront costs can be prohibitive with AI projects, but in the cloud enterprises can instantly access these tools for a monthly fee, making research- and development-related costs more manageable. Additionally, AI tools can gain insights from the data and analyze it without human intervention.
Intelligent automation
Enterprises use the power of AI-driven cloud computing to be more efficient, strategic and insight-driven. AI can automate complex and repetitive tasks to boost productivity, as well as perform data analysis without any human intervention. IT teams can also use AI to manage and monitor core workflows. IT teams can focus more on strategic operations while AI performs the mundane tasks. For example, IBM Cloud Pak for Automation provides prebuilt workflows for AI-powered automation.

See how AI has progressed.





Deeper insights
AI can identify patterns and trends in vast data sets. It uses historical data and compares it to the most recent data, which provides IT teams with well-informed, data-backed intelligence. On top of that, AI tools can perform data analysis fast so enterprises can rapidly and efficiently address customer queries and issues. The observations and valuable advice gained from AI capabilities result in quicker and more accurate results. For example, an app developer can use Amazon Personalize to give customers real-time personalized recommendations.
Improved data management
AI plays a significant role in processing, managing and structuring data. AI can significantly boost marketing, customer care and supply chain data management with more reliable real-time data. AI tools streamline how data is ingested, modified and managed. For example, IT teams can imbed AI tools into Google Cloud Stream analytics to get real-time personalization, detect anomalies and predict maintenance scenarios.
Increased security
As enterprises deploy more applications in the cloud, intelligent data security is crucial to keep data safe. IT teams can use AI-powered network security tools to track and evaluate network traffic. AI-powered systems can raise a flag as soon as they find an anomaly. This proactive approach helps prevent any damage to critical data. For example, Amazon GuardDuty is an intelligent threat detection tool that uses AI and machine learning to find potential risks.

Add AI to your cloud security strategy.







The downsides of AI in cloud computing
While combining AI with cloud computing provides numerous benefits, there are drawbacks as well. For example, while it can lower costs, AI is complex and may require a well-trained staff, which can cost more money upfront. The following are the other downsides to using AI in cloud computing environments:
Connectivity concerns
Cloud-based machine learning systems need consistent internet connectivity. IT teams use the internet to send raw data to the cloud service and recover processed data. Poor internet access can hinder the advantages of cloud-based machine learning algorithms.
While processing data in the cloud is quicker than conventional computing, there is a time lag between transmitting data to the cloud and receiving responses. This is a significant issue when using machine learning algorithms for cloud servers, where prediction speed is one of the primary concerns.
Data privacy
AI applications require a large amount of data, which can include consumer and vendor information. For example, Amazon provides recommendations based on purchase history. While some data can be anonymous and can't be tied to personally identifiable information, knowing who the data belongs to makes it more valuable. When sensitive information is used, data protection and compliance is a major concern. Enterprises need to create privacy policies and secure all data when using AI in cloud computing.

			What Is AI Slop and What Can You Do About It?

 Artificial intelligence is disrupting and revolutionizing almost every industry. With advancing technology, it has the potential to improve so many aspects of life drastically. 



 But, it isn’t without risk. 





 And, with swathes of experts warning of the potential danger of AI, we should probably pay attention. On the other hand, many claim that these are alarmist views and that there’s no immediate danger from AI. 

 So, are concerns about artificial intelligence alarmist or not? This article will cover the five main risks of artificial intelligence, explaining the currently available technology in these areas. 


 How Can AI Be Dangerous? 
    

 AI is growing more sophisticated by the day, and this can have risks ranging from mild (for example, job disruption) to catastrophic existential risks. The level of risk imposed by AI is so heavily debated because there’s a general lack of understanding (and consensus) regarding AI technology. 





 It is generally thought that AI can be dangerous in two ways: 

 The AI is programmed to do something malicious  The AI is programmed to be beneficial but does something destructive while achieving its goal  

 These risks are amplified by the sophistication of AI software. The classic hypothetical argument is the facetious “paper clip maximizer.” In this thought experiment, a superintelligent AI has been programmed to maximize the number of paper clips in the world. If it’s sufficiently intelligent, it could destroy the entire world for this goal. 

 But, we don’t need to consider superintelligent AI to see that there are dangers already associated with our use of AI. So, what are some of the immediate risks we face from AI? 



 1. Job Automation and Disruption 
    





 Automation is a danger of AI that is already affecting society. 

 From mass production factories to self-serve checkouts to self-driving cars, automation has been occurring for decades—and the process is accelerating. A Brookings Institution study in 2019 found that 36 million jobs could be at a high risk of automation in the coming years. 

 The issue is that for many tasks, AI systems outperform humans. They are cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate than humans. For example, AI is already better at recognizing art forgery than human experts, and it’s now becoming more accurate at diagnosing tumors from radiography imagery. 

 The further problem is that, with job displacement following automation, many of the workers who lost their jobs are ineligible for newly created jobs in the AI sector due to lacking the required credentials or expertise. 






 As AI systems continue to improve, they will become far more adept at tasks than humans. This could be in pattern recognition, providing insights, or making accurate predictions. The resulting job disruption could result in increased social inequality and even an economic disaster. 



 2. Security and Privacy 
 In 2020, the UK government commissioned a report on Artificial Intelligence and UK National Security, which highlighted the necessity of AI in the UK’s cybersecurity defenses to detect and mitigate threats that require a greater speed of response than human decision-making is capable of. 

 The problem is that the hope is that as AI-driven security concerns rise, so do AI-driven prevention measures. Unless we can develop measures to protect ourselves against AI concerns, we run the risk of running a never-ending race against bad actors. 

 This also begs the question of how we make AI systems secure themselves. If we use AI algorithms to defend against various security concerns, we need to ensure that the AI itself is secure against bad actors. 





 When it comes to privacy, large companies and governments are already being called out for the erosion of our privacy. With so much personal data available online now (2.5 million terabytes of data is created daily), AI algorithms are already able to easily create user profiles that enable extremely accurate targeting of advertisements. 

 Facial recognition technology is also already incredibly sophisticated. Cameras can perform real-time profiling of individuals. Some police forces worldwide reportedly use smart glasses with facial recognition software that can easily label wanted or suspected criminals. 

 The risk is that this technology could be expanded to authoritarian regimes or simply individuals or groups with malicious intents. 



 3. AI Malware 
    





 AI is becoming increasingly good at hacking security systems and cracking encryption. One way this is occurring is via malware “evolving” through machine learning algorithms. The malware can learn what works through trial and error, becoming more dangerous over time. 

 Newer smart technology (like self-driving cars) has been assessed as a high-risk target for this kind of attack, with the potential for bad actors to cause car crashes or gridlocks. As we become more and more reliant on internet-connected smart technology, more and more of our daily lives will be impacted by the risk of disruption. 

 Again, the only real solution to this danger is that anti-malware AI outperforms malicious AI to protect individuals and businesses. 



 4. Autonomous Weapons 
 Autonomous weapons—weapons controlled by AI systems rather than human input—already exist and have done for quite some time. Hundreds of tech experts have urged the UN to develop a way to protect humanity from the risks involved in autonomous weapons. 





 Government militaries worldwide already have access to various AI-controlled or semi-AI-controlled weapon systems, like military drones. With facial recognition software, a drone can track an individual. 

 What happens when we start allowing AI algorithms to make life and death decisions without any human input? 

 It’s also possible to customize consumer technology (like drones) to fly autonomously and perform various tasks. This kind of capability in the wrong hands could impact an individual's security on a day-to-day basis. 



 5. Deepfakes, Fake News, and Political Security

 Facial reconstruction software (more commonly known as deepfake tech) is becoming more and more indistinguishable from reality. 





 The danger of deepfakes is already affecting celebrities and world leaders, and it’s only so long until this trickles down to ordinary people. For instance, scammers are already blackmailing people with deepfake videos created from something as simple and accessible as a Facebook profile picture. 

 And that’s not the only risk. AI can recreate and edit photos, compose text, clone voices, and automatically produce highly targeted advertising. We have already seen how some of these dangers impact society. 



 Mitigating the Risks of Artificial Intelligence 
 As artificial intelligence increases in sophistication and capability, many positive advances are being made. But unfortunately, powerful new technology is always at the risk of being misused. These risks affect almost every facet of our daily lives, from privacy to political security to job automation. 






 The first step in mitigating the risks of artificial intelligence will be to decide where we want AI to be used and where it should be discouraged. Increasing research and debate into AI systems and their uses is the first step to preventing them from being misused.

She is a research professor of communication and science and technology studies at the University of Southern California and a senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research. Her new book, Atlas of AI, looks at what it takes to make AI and what’s at stake as it reshapes our world.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.You’ve written a book critical of AI but you work for a company that is among the leaders in its deployment. How do you square that circle?I work in the research wing of Microsoft, which is a distinct organisation, separate from product development. Unusually, over its 30-year history, it has hired social scientists to look critically at how technologies are being built. Being on the inside, we are often able to see downsides early before systems are widely deployed. My book did not go through any pre-publication review – Microsoft Research does not require that – and my lab leaders support asking hard questions, even if the answers involve a critical assessment of current technological practices.What’s the aim of the book?We are commonly presented with this vision of AI that is abstract and immaterial. I wanted to show how AI is made in a wider sense – its natural resource costs, its labour processes, and its classificatory logics. To observe that in action I went to locations including mines to see the extraction necessary from the Earth’s crust and an Amazon fulfilment centre to see the physical and psychological toll on workers of being under an algorithmic management system. My hope is that, by showing how AI systems work – by laying bare the structures of production and the material realities – we will have a more accurate account of the impacts, and it will invite more people into the conversation. These systems are being rolled out across a multitude of sectors without strong regulation, consent or democratic debate.What should people know about how AI products are made?We aren’t used to thinking about these systems in terms of the environmental costs. But saying, “Hey, Alexa, order me some toilet rolls,” invokes into being this chain of extraction, which goes all around the planet… We’ve got a long way to go before this is green technology. Also, systems might seem automated but when we pull away the curtain we see large amounts of low paid labour, everything from crowd work categorising data to the never-ending toil of shuffling Amazon boxes. AI is neither artificial nor intelligent. It is made from natural resources and it is people who are performing the tasks to make the systems appear autonomous.Unfortunately the politics of classification has become baked into the substrates of AIProblems of bias have been well documented in AI technology. Can more data solve that?Bias is too narrow a term for the sorts of problems we’re talking about. Time and again, we see these systems producing errors – women offered less credit by credit-worthiness algorithms, black faces mislabelled – and the response has been: “We just need more data.” But I’ve tried to look at these deeper logics of classification and you start to see forms of discrimination, not just when systems are applied, but in how they are built and trained to see the world. Training datasets used for machine learning software that casually categorise people into just one of two genders; that label people according to their skin colour into one of five racial categories, and which attempt, based on how people look, to assign moral or ethical character. The idea that you can make these determinations based on appearance has a dark past and unfortunately the politics of classification has become baked into the substrates of AI.You single out ImageNet, a large, publicly available training dataset for object recognition…Consisting of around 14m images in more than 20,000 categories, ImageNet is one of the most significant training datasets in the history of machine learning. It is used to test the efficiency of object recognition algorithms. It was launched in 2009 by a set of Stanford researchers who scraped enormous amounts of images from the web and had crowd workers label them according to the nouns from WordNet, a lexical database that was created in the 1980s.Beginning in 2017, I did a project with artist Trevor Paglen to look at how people were being labelled. We found horrifying classificatory terms that were misogynist, racist, ableist, and judgmental in the extreme. Pictures of people were being matched to words like kleptomaniac, alcoholic, bad person, closet queen, call girl, slut, drug addict and far more I cannot say here. ImageNet has now removed many of the obviously problematic people categories – certainly an improvement – however, the problem persists because these training sets still circulate on torrent sites [where files are shared between peers].And we could only study ImageNet because it is public. There are huge training datasets held by tech companies that are completely secret. They have pillaged images we have uploaded to photo-sharing services and social media platforms and turned them into private systems.You debunk the use of AI for emotion recognition but you work for a company that sells AI emotion recognition technology. Should AI be used for emotion detection?The idea that you can see from somebody’s face what they are feeling is deeply flawed. I don’t think that’s possible. I have argued that it is one of the most urgently needed domains for regulation. Most emotion recognition systems today are based on a line of thinking in psychology developed in the 1970s – most notably by Paul Ekman – that says there are six universal emotions that we all show in our faces that can be read using the right techniques. But from the beginning there was pushback and more recent work shows there is no reliable correlation between expressions on the face and what we are actually feeling. And yet we have tech companies saying emotions can be extracted simply by looking at video of people’s faces. We’re even seeing it built into car software systems.Trevor Paglen: art in the age of mass surveillanceRead moreWhat do you mean when you say we need to focus less on the ethics of AI and more on power?Ethics are necessary, but not sufficient. More helpful are questions such as, who benefits and who is harmed by this AI system? And does it put power in the hands of the already powerful? What we see time and again, from facial recognition to tracking and surveillance in workplaces, is these systems are empowering already powerful institutions – corporations, militaries and police.What’s needed to make things better?Much stronger regulatory regimes and greater rigour and responsibility around how training datasets are constructed. We also need different voices in these debates – including people who are seeing and living with the downsides of these systems. And we need a renewed politics of refusal that challenges the narrative that just because a technology can be built it should be deployed.Any optimism?Things are afoot that give me hope. This April, the EU produced the first draft omnibus regulations for AI. Australia has also just released new guidelines for regulating AI. There are holes that need to be patched – but we are now starting to realise that these tools need much stronger guardrails. And giving me as much optimism as the progress on regulation is the work of activists agitating for change.The AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru was forced out of Google late last year after executives criticised her research. What’s the future for industry-led critique?Google’s treatment of Timnit has sent shockwaves through both industry and academic circles. The good news is that we haven’t seen silence; instead, Timnit and other powerful voices have continued to speak out and push for a more just approach to designing and deploying technical systems. One key element is to ensure researchers within industry can publish without corporate interference, and to foster the same academic freedom that universities seek to provide.

According to the literary critic Harold Bloom, among writers “influence always proceeds by misinterpretation.” In The Anxiety of Influence, Bloom argues that writers willfully ignore and misinterpret their predecessors in order to make their canvases as blank as possible. 
Bloom’s specific stages of anxiety (outlined much like the stages of grief) are a bit too Freudian and peculiar to be truly universal, but he’s right that to create is to exist in a state of anxiety. Like construction in Rome, we writers are always building on top of something. I too keep an eye on particular contemporary writers, like Richard Powers and Rebecca Goldstein, just in case.
But in the past year my anxiety of influence has shifted far and away to another source: an entity called GPT-3. It’s an artificial neural network with over 175 billion parameters—think of it like an artificial brain with the computing power of 175 billion connections (if it makes you feel any better, you probably have around 125 trillion synapses in your own brain, for comparison).
In the past year my anxiety of influence has shifted far and away to another source: an entity called GPT-3.
Developed by OpenAI, GPT-3 costs several million dollars of computational work just to train, and now subscription services that let you access GPT-3 are both approval-only and cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars a month. 
GPT-3 is a natural language processor, which means it’s trained to try to complete any prompt that it’s given. Its training data is basically the entire internet, so given a prompt, like a few paragraphs of text, it will make a guess as to what comes next. These guesses show that GPT-3 can really write. It can write in all sorts of styles, oftentimes as convincingly as a real human author. Like a medium, it can even channel the dead. The anxiety I feel toward it is different than toward any writer that once lived and breathed. I think it represents the first warning shots of an impending man vs. machine agon of language. 
This is not something anyone in the publishing industry appears to have noticed. The academization of literature, making it a prerequisite for writers to climb the hierarchy up all the way to that famous MFA program (a journey now necessary if you want to be published and reviewed), has created a lot of writers incurious about technology and science. So I doubt more than a handful in the literary community are paying attention to how things might change for them as the limits of deep learning get pushed further out. 
Confronting my anxiety head on (Bloom might deem this the “daemonization” stage), I decided to see if GPT-3 could have written my debut novel, The Revelations. To prove to myself, once and for all, there’s nothing to be anxious about (oh reader—there is). 
I decided to see if GPT-3 could have written my debut novel, The Revelations.
Getting access to GPT-3 requires various approvals, which is why the running joke is that OpenAI should drop the “Open” from their name. This gives interacting with GPT-3 an oracular quality, since you’re communicating with its galaxy brain hosted on some tightly-controlled server. Once my sojourn to Delphi was complete, I fed GPT-3 the jacket copy of my novel—that description on the flaps of the hardcover that tells readers what they’re getting into. This gave GPT-3 a sense of who I was and how to write like me. Then, trying not to bias the experiment, I flipped to a random section of The Revelations and selected a few paragraphs I thought ripe for comparison.

The randomly-arrived at short scene is around the middle of the novel. Carmen, a young scientist, has been pursuing what she thinks was the murder of one of her colleagues in the New York City subway. The events surrounding the investigation have gotten stranger and more mysterious over time, and now, unable to make any progress, she’s staking out the subway station late at night. Within the strained atmosphere she’s been under, and the mysterious guttural phone calls she’s been getting from unlisted numbers since she started the investigation, she begins to dread seeing something inhuman. Here’s the original:
“Stand clear of the closing doors, please.” Eventually the people become less numerous. In the lateness of the night her mind begins to imagine scenarios, to play them out again and again on a loop, as if some part of her is daring something to happen, is waiting for something drastic. Instead the night just gets later and later and the people fewer and fewer, until finally entire trains are coming and going without the entrance or exit of a single soul. And Carmen is becoming half-terrified of the menacing long platform next to her, which extends into that subterranean realm… the scenario she imagines is that a creature, something huge but lithe, something with an animal head, peeks from the side out onto the platform, a bull’s head maybe, leering at her, its mouth gaping and panting, its eyes impossibly dark and lewd upon her, and eventually the image becomes so strong, and the expectation so intense, that she suddenly bolts from her wooden seat, pushing through the turnstiles and in her flight continually whipping around to look until she reaches the safety of the surface. 
Now here’s GTP-3’s version, fed the above paragraph up to the word “creature” (as well as the jacket copy of the book). Where the bolded text starts below is where GPT-3 took over writing:
And Carmen is becoming half-terrified of the menacing long platform next to her, which extends into that subterranean realm . . . the scenario she imagines is that of a creature who crawled out of the earth in a burrow, a huge being with tiny eyes and long and stumpy arms. . . But this wasn’t a dream, was it? The wind of the passing trains nearly knocks her off her feet, and before she knows it she is bursting out of the subway, up the stairs, through the turnstiles and out onto the street, running down the sidewalk, her breath coming in gasps and the crescendo is rising and rising in the pit of her stomach, her sneakers flapping against the asphalt, and they are all just blurs now, someone turning up a music system looks up, a dog barks and gets its leash yanked, an old couple walking arm in arm looks up, but no one notices her, and the city throbs, breathes, exhales.
To get this I merely prompted GPT-3 a handful of times, threw out the first two results, and deleted a few clauses of GPT-3’s third try. It took about five minutes. I didn’t add a single thing, it’s all GPT-3. Damn machine had the gall to write my book.
No doubt, this artificial prose has flaws. Long and stumpy arms? Wind from a subway isn’t strong enough to nearly knock someone off their feet. Carmen is too terrified in this version, rather than just creeped out. That sentence where she considers whether this is a dream doesn’t add up grammatically. Although perhaps Bloom would say this is merely the “clinamen” stage of anxiety, a classic misreading to make this technological shadow of myself look worse than it is.
Still. Any writer worth their ink should start feeling some AI anxiety on reading that output. There are a number of advanced literary techniques GPT-3 is using here. The long run-on sentence of Carmen’s flight means GPT-3 knows that style is apt for describing characters in motion. And the break in narrative to linger on the people who don’t notice her flight as she runs past, that’s good technique as well. It’s cinematic, makes a reader focus on the city itself. The last line of “and the city throbs, breathes, exhales” is definitely something I’d write. It fits the atmosphere of the novel, which treats New York City like its own organism possessing a centuries-slow consciousness. 
That particular phrase is so appropriate for the novel it felt reminiscent. After searching the text of the book I came upon a similar phrase describing a storm the characters find themselves caught in, on what becomes the night of the murder.
The city inhales and exhales in great whooping winds.
That’s from a section GPT-3 wasn’t shown. It can’t possibly have seen it. While GPT-3 itself is trained on a corpus of text (basically the entire internet) from the year 2019, The Revelations came out only last month. Just the fact that the AI deduced to write “and the city throbs, breathes, exhales” from the given sample and jacket copy—it’s uncanny.
I’m happy to report there are still issues with GPT-3. It has limited space for input and output, only about 1,500 words or so, and the fact is that if you feed it its own ramblings it becomes more and more incoherent. The AI still needs a human editor to tether it to reality. But it’s a fine first-draft writer in short bursts, especially since it can generate paragraphs about 1000x faster than a human. You just click and there’s the text for you to pick and choose from. I wouldn’t want to write this way, but others will surely use it as a co-author, and it might legitimately improve their books. And if they did use it—who would know?




We Asked Google’s New Book-Based Artificial Intelligence About the Meaning of Life


An interview with the “Talk to Books” app, which uses the text of 100,000 books to answer questions

						Apr 24													– Erin Bartnett

Beyond an artificial helper, writers should seriously be worried about GPT-4 as a direct competitor. When GPT-5 rolls around, they should feel dread. Therein lies the heart of this new technological anxiety: its inevitable nature. Consider that when I was born, language, whenever I encountered it, was always generated by human consciousness. When I die, will most language come from a source separate from consciousness? Things that speak and things that feel are now entirely dissociable. I grew up in my mother’s independent bookstore, so to me this is anathema, a debasement of the holy. Why is no other writer in the world freaking out about this new Babel?
It doesn’t help that the post-work future is so often envisioned as the AIs doing all the labor, leaving humans free to spend their days making art. But what if the AIs are better at making art too?
Does this output even count as “art”? The words of an AI have no intentionality. Only conscious minds produce meaning. This is more like infinite monkeys typed out infinite nonsense, and eventually this creates a Sylvia Plath poem. One might argue it is the consciousness of the observer that gives meaning to art, not consciousness as art’s producer, but then the reply is that any meaning here is just pareidolia—it’s like seeing faces on the rocks on Mars. It is a deep fake of meaning itself. In this way AI robs us of our very words by diluting their importance away. These machines give us sentences with perfect syntax but without intentional semantic content—something I’ve called the “semantic apocalypse.”
Post-work future is so often envisioned as the AIs doing all the labor, leaving humans free to spend their days making art. But what if the AIs are better at making art too?
As it stands right now, GPT-3 could not write The Revelations, even with a heavy editorial hand. It could certainly contribute a number of relevant scenes and phrases. Maybe, hopefully, GPT-3 is as good as natural language processors get. Maybe it will always need micromanagement. Maybe maybe maybe. Maybe not. The situation for poets is already far worse. Oh, poor poets. All the things GPT-3 struggles with, like long-term coherency, causality, common sense knowledge, character development, etc, are all things that rarely matter in poems. Same for songwriters. Consider the recent “Drowned in the Sun,” a catchy new Nirvana song made by an AI trained on their old work.
What would Bloom’s horror have been if in the future a simple prompt to GPT-X generates a perfect new Shakespeare sonnet? What anxiety would your average poet feel then? Prompt. Perfect poem. Prompt. Perfect poem. Prompt. And if it can do this for any living writer as well, in any format? Some authors may declare it doesn’t matter, that it’s their identity that makes a product special, not the product itself. But what an honest crafter of language would feel—one who cares about language qua language—is anxiety. The forever crippling kind.
Now, I’m not saying that writers are necessarily under existential threat from GPT-3. When I attend literary events I don’t only see a bunch of dinosaurs plodding across a tar pit. I just get flashes of a possible future. GPT-3 and its ilk could, somehow, not affect literature at all. But just by existing they do necessarily make human production of art smaller in its shadow.
I will tell you a funny thing. A strange one as well, though perhaps it was always inevitable. Lately, if I look in the mirror too long, I see only an ape staring back.

Can Big Tech take criticism from within?,,,,,,,True,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,,,,,,,"Gebru, a researcher at Google, had just clicked out of a last-minute video meeting with an executive named Megan Kacholia, who had issued a jarring command. Gebru was the coleader of a group at the company that studies the social and ethical ramifications of artificial intelligence, and Kacholia had ordered Gebru to retract her latest research paper—or else remove her name from its list of authors, along with those of several other members of her team.
The paper in question was, in Gebru’s mind, pretty unobjectionable. It surveyed the known pitfalls of so-called large language models, a type of AI software—most famously exemplified by a system called GPT-3—that was stoking excitement in the tech industry. Google’s own version of the technology was now helping to power the company’s search engine. Jeff Dean, Google’s revered head of research, had encouraged Gebru to think about the approach’s possible downsides. The paper had sailed through the company’s internal review process and had been submitted to a prominent conference. But Kacholia now said that a group of product leaders and others inside the company had deemed the work unacceptable, Gebru recalls. Kacholia was vague about their objections but gave Gebru a week to act. Her firm deadline was the day after Thanksgiving.
Gebru’s distress turned to anger as that date drew closer and the situation turned weirder. Kacholia gave Gebru’s manager, Samy Bengio, a document listing the paper’s supposed flaws, but told him not to send it to Gebru, only to read it to her. On Thanksgiving Day, Gebru skipped some festivities with her family to hear Bengio’s recital. According to Gebru’s recollection and contemporaneous notes, the document didn’t offer specific edits but complained that the paper handled topics “casually” and painted too bleak a picture of the new technology. It also claimed that all of Google’s uses of large language models were “engineered to avoid” the pitfalls that the paper described.
Gebru spent Thanksgiving writing a six-page response, explaining her perspective on the paper and asking for guidance on how it might be revised instead of quashed. She titled her reply “Addressing Feedback from the Ether at Google,” because she still didn’t know who had set her Kafkaesque ordeal in motion, and sent it to Kacholia the next day.
On Saturday, Gebru set out on a preplanned cross-country road trip. She had reached New Mexico by Monday, when Kacholia emailed to ask for confirmation that the paper would either be withdrawn or cleansed of its Google affiliations. Gebru tweeted a cryptic reproach of “censorship and intimidation” against AI ethics researchers. Then, on Tuesday, she fired off two emails: one that sought to end the dispute, and another that escalated it beyond her wildest imaginings.
The first was addressed to Kacholia and offered her a deal: Gebru would remove herself from the paper if Google provided an account of who had reviewed the work and how, and established a more transparent review process for future research. If those conditions weren’t met, Gebru wrote, she would leave Google once she’d had time to make sure her team wouldn’t be too destabilized. The second email showed less corporate diplomacy. Addressed to a listserv for women who worked in Google Brain, the company’s most prominent AI lab and home to Gebru’s Ethical AI team, it accused the company of “silencing marginalized voices” and dismissed Google’s internal diversity programs as a waste of time.
Relaxing in an Airbnb in Austin, Texas, the following night, Gebru received a message with a 😮 from one of her direct reports: “You resigned??” In her personal inbox she then found an email from Kacholia, rejecting Gebru’s offer and casting her out of Google. “We cannot agree as you are requesting,” Kacholia wrote. “The end of your employment should happen faster than your email reflects.” Parts of Gebru’s email to the listserv, she went on, had shown “behavior inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Gebru tweeted that she had been fired. Google maintained—and still does—that she resigned.
Gebru’s tweet lit the fuse on a controversy that quickly inflamed Google. The company has been dogged in recent years by accusations from employees that it mistreats women and people of color, and from lawmakers that it wields unhealthy technological and economic power. Now Google had expelled a Black woman who was a prominent advocate for more diversity in tech, and who was seen as an important internal voice for greater restraint in the helter-­skelter race to develop and deploy AI. One Google machine-learning researcher who had followed Gebru’s writing and work on diversity felt the news of her departure like a punch to the gut. “It was like, oh, maybe things aren’t going to change so easily,” says the employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak by Google management.
Dean sent out a message urging Googlers to ignore Gebru’s call to disengage from corporate diversity exercises; Gebru’s paper had been subpar, he said, and she and her collaborators had not followed the proper approval process. In turn, Gebru claimed in tweets and interviews that she’d been felled by a toxic cocktail of racism, sexism, and censorship. Sympathy for Gebru’s account grew as the disputed paper circulated like samizdat among AI researchers, many of whom found it neither controversial nor particularly remarkable. Thousands of Googlers and outside AI experts signed a public letter castigating the company.
But Google seemed to double down. Margaret Mitchell, the other coleader of the Ethical AI team and a prominent researcher in her own right, was among the hardest hit by Gebru’s ouster. The two had been a professional and emotional tag team, building up their group—which was one of several that worked on what Google called “responsible AI”—while parrying the sexist and racist tendencies they saw at large in the company’s culture. Confident that those same forces had played a role in Gebru’s downfall, Mitchell wrote an automated script to retrieve notes she’d kept in her corporate Gmail account that documented allegedly discriminatory incidents, according to sources inside Google. On January 20, Google said Mitchell had triggered an internal security system and had been suspended. On February 19, she was fired, with Google stating that it had found “multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included exfiltration of confidential, business-­sensitive documents.”
Google had now fully decapitated its own Ethical AI research group. The long, spectacular fallout from that Thanksgiving ultimatum to Gebru left countless bystanders wondering: Had one paper really precipitated all of these events?
The story of what actually happened in the lead-up to Gebru’s exit from Google reveals a more tortured and complex backdrop. It’s the tale of a gifted engineer who was swept up in the AI revolution before she became one of its biggest critics, a refugee who worked her way to the center of the tech industry and became determined to reform it. It’s also about a company—the world’s fifth largest—trying to regain its equilibrium after four years of scandals, controversies, and mutinies, but doing so in ways that unbalanced the ship even further.
Beyond Google, the fate of Timnit Gebru lays bare something even larger: the tensions inherent in an industry’s efforts to research the downsides of its favorite technology. In traditional sectors such as chemicals or mining, researchers who study toxicity or pollution on the corporate dime are viewed skeptically by independent experts. But in the young realm of people studying the potential harms of AI, corporate researchers are central.
Gebru’s career mirrored the rapid rise of AI fairness research, and also some of its paradoxes. Almost as soon as the field sprang up, it quickly attracted eager support from giants like Google, which sponsored conferences, handed out grants, and hired the domain’s most prominent experts. Now Gebru’s sudden ejection made her and others wonder if this research, in its domesticated form, had always been doomed to a short leash. To researchers, it sent a dangerous message: AI is largely unregulated and only getting more powerful and ubiquitous, and insiders who are forthright in studying its social harms do so at the risk of exile.
At the time, Gebru lived with her mother, an economist, in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Her father, an electrical engineer with a PhD, had died when she was small. Gebru enjoyed school and hanging out in cafés when she and her friends could scrape together enough pocket money. But the war changed all that. Gebru’s family was Eritrean, and some of her relatives were being deported to Eritrea and conscripted to fight against the country they had made their home.
Gebru’s mother had a visa for the United States, where Gebru’s older sisters, engineers like their father, had lived for years. But when Gebru applied for a visa, she was denied. So she went to Ireland instead, joining one of her sisters, who was there temporarily for work, while her mother went to America alone.
Reaching Ireland may have saved Gebru’s life, but it also shattered it. She called her mother and begged to be sent back to Ethiopia. “I don’t care if it’s safe or not. I can’t live here,” she said. Her new school, the culture, even the weather were alienating. Addis Ababa’s rainy season is staccato, with heavy downpours interspersed by sunshine. In Ireland, rain fell steadily for a week. As she took on the teenage challenges of new classes and bullying, larger concerns pressed down. “Am I going to be reunited with my family? What happens if the paperwork doesn’t work out?” she recalls thinking. “I felt unwanted.”
The next year, Gebru was approved to come to the US as a refugee. She reunited with her mother in Somerville, Massa­chusetts, a predominantly white suburb of Boston, where she enrolled in the local public high school—and a crash course in American racism.
Some of her teachers, Gebru found, seemed unable or unwilling to accept that an African refugee might be a top student in math and science. Other white Americans saw fit to confide in her their belief that African immigrants worked harder than African Americans, whom they saw as lazy. History class told an uplifting story about the Civil Rights Movement resolving America’s racial divisions, but that tale rang hollow. “I thought that cannot be true, because I’m seeing it in the school,” Gebru says.
Piano lessons helped provide a space where she could breathe. Gebru also coped by turning to math, physics, and her family. She enjoyed technical work, not just for its beauty but because it was a realm disconnected from personal politics or worries about the war back home. That compartmentalization became part of Gebru’s way of navigating the world. “What I had under my control was that I could go to class and focus on the work,” she says.
Gebru’s focus paid off. In September 2001 she enrolled at Stanford. Naturally, she chose the family major, electrical engineering, and before long her trajectory began to embody the Silicon Valley archetype of the immigrant trailblazer. For a course during her junior year, Gebru built an experimental electronic piano key, helping her win an internship at Apple making audio circuitry for Mac computers and other products. The next year she went to work for the company full-time while continuing her studies at Stanford.
At Apple, Gebru thrived. When Niel Warren, her manager, needed someone to dig into delta-sigma modulators, a class of analog-to-digital converters, Gebru volunteered, investigating whether the technology would work in the iPhone. “As an electrical engineer she was fearless,” Warren says. He found his new hardware hotshot to be well liked, always ready with a hug, and determined outside of work too. In 2008, Gebru withdrew from one of her classes because she was devoting so much time to canvassing for Barack Obama in Nevada and Colorado, where many doors were slammed in her face.
As Gebru learned more about the guts of gadgets like the iPhone, she became more interested in the fundamental physics of their components—and soon her interests wandered even further, beyond the confines of electrical engineering. By 2011, she was embarking on a PhD at Stanford, drifting among classes and searching for a new direction. She found it in computer vision, the art of making software that can interpret images.
Unbeknownst to her, Gebru now stood on the cusp of a revolution that would transform the tech industry in ways she would later criticize. One of Gebru’s favorite classes involved creating code that could detect human figures in photos. “I wasn’t thinking about surveillance,” Gebru says. “I just found it technically interesting.”
In 2013 she joined the lab of Fei-Fei Li, a computer vision specialist who had helped spur the tech industry’s obsession with AI, and who would later work for a time at Google. Li had created a project called ImageNet that paid contractors small sums to tag a billion images scraped from the web with descriptions of their contents—cat, coffee cup, cello. The final database, some 15 million images, helped to reinvent machine learning, an AI technique that involves training software to get better at performing a task by feeding it examples of correct answers. Li’s work demonstrated that an approach known as deep learning, fueled by a large collection of training data and powerful computer chips, could produce much more accurate machine-vision technology than prior methods had yielded.
Li wanted to use deep learning to give computers a more fine-grained understanding of the world. Two of her students had scraped 50 million images from Google Street View, planning to train a neural network to spot cars and identify their make and model. But they began wondering about other applications they might build on top of that capability. If you drew correlations between census data and the cars visible on a street, could that provide a way to estimate the demographic or economic characteristics of any neighborhood, just from pictures?
Gebru spent the next few years showing that, to a certain level of accuracy, the answer was yes. She and her collaborators used online contractors and car experts recruited on Craigslist to identify the make and model of 70,000 cars in a sample of Street View images. The annotated pictures provided the training data needed for deep-learning algorithms to figure out how to identify cars in new images. Then they processed the full Street View collection and identified 22 million cars in photos from 200 US cities. When Gebru correlated those observations with census and crime data, her results showed that more pickup trucks and VWs indicated more white residents, more Buicks and Oldsmobiles indicated more Black ones, and more vans corresponded to higher crime.
This demonstration of AI’s power positioned Gebru for a lucrative career in Silicon Valley. Deep learning was all the rage, powering the industry’s latest products (smart speakers) and its future aspirations (self-driving cars). Companies were spending millions to acquire deep-­learning technology and talent, and Google was placing some of the biggest bets of all. Its subsidiary DeepMind had recently celebrated the victory of its machine-learning bot over a human world champion at Go, a moment that many took to symbolize the future relationship between humans and technology.
Gebru’s project fit in with what was becoming the industry’s new philosophy: Algorithms would soon automate away any problem, no matter how messy. But as Gebru got closer to graduation, the boundary she had established between her technical work and her personal values started to crumble in ways that complicated her feelings about the algorithmic future.
Gebru had maintained a fairly steady interest in social justice issues as a grad student. She wrote in The Stanford Daily about an incident in which an acquaintance wondered aloud whether Gebru was “actually smart” or had been admitted due to affirmative action. At Stanford’s graduate school, Gebru encountered a significantly less diverse student population than she had during her undergraduate years, and she felt isolated. She bonded with people who, like her, had experienced global inequality firsthand. “Once you’ve seen the world in terms of its injustice and the ways in which the United States is not always the answer to everybody’s problems, it’s very difficult to unsee,” says Jess Auerbach, a student from South Africa who became friends with Gebru at Stanford, and who is now an anthropologist at North West University in South Africa.
In 2016, Gebru volunteered to work on a coding program for bright young people in Ethiopia, which sent her on a trip back home, only her second since she had fled at the age of 15. Her coding students’ struggles, she felt, exposed the limits of US meritocracy. One promising kid couldn’t afford the roughly $100 required to take the SAT. After Gebru paid the fee for him, he won a scholarship to MIT. She also pitched in to help students who had been denied visas despite having been accepted to US schools. “She tried all she could to help these kids,” says Jelani Nelson, the UC Berkeley professor who founded the program.
Li, Gebru’s adviser at Stanford, encouraged her to find a way to connect social justice and tech, the two pillars of her world­view. “It was obvious to an outsider, but I don’t think it was obvious to her, that actually there was a link between her true passion and her technical background,” Li says. Gebru was reluctant to forge that link, fearing in part that it would typecast her as a Black woman first and a technologist second.
But she also became more aware that technology can sometimes reflect or magnify society’s biases, rather than transcend them. In 2016, ProPublica reported that a recidivism-risk algorithm called COMPAS, used widely in courtrooms across the country, made more false predictions that Black people would reoffend than it did for white people (an analysis that was disputed by the company that made the algorithm). This made Gebru wonder whether the crime data she’d used in her own research reflected biased policing. Around the same time, she was introduced to Joy Buolamwini, a Ghanaian American MIT master’s student who had noticed that some algorithms designed to detect faces worked less well on Black people than they did on white people. Gebru began advising her on publishing her results.
It wasn’t just the algorithms or their training data that skewed white. In 2015, Gebru got her first glimpse of the worldwide community of AI researchers at the field’s top conference, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), in Montreal. She noticed immediately how male and how white it was. At a Google party, she was intercepted by a group of strangers in Google Research T-shirts who treated the presence of a Black woman as a titillating photo op. One man grabbed her for a hug; another kissed her cheek and took a photo. At the next year’s conference, Gebru kept a tally of other Black people she met, counting just six among the 8,500 attendees—all people she already knew, and most of whom she’d already added to an email list she’d started for Black people in the field. After the event, Gebru posted a warning to AI researchers on Facebook about the dangers of their community’s lack of diversity. “I’m not worried about machines taking over the world, I’m worried about groupthink, insularity, and arrogance in the AI community,” she wrote. “If many are actively excluded from its creation, this technology will benefit a few while harming a great many.”
Gebru’s awakening roughly coincided with the emergence of a new research field dedicated to examining some of the social downsides of AI. It came to be centered on an annual academic workshop, first held in 2014, called Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FATML) and motivated by concerns over institutional decisionmaking. If algorithms decided who received a loan or awaited trial in jail rather than at home, any errors they made could be life-changing.
The event’s creators initially found it difficult to convince peers that there was much to talk about. “The more predominant idea was that humans were biased and algorithms weren’t,” says Moritz Hardt, now a UC Berkeley computer science professor who cofounded the workshop with a researcher from Princeton. “People thought it was silly to work on this.”
By 2016 the event had grown into a meeting that sold out a hall at NYU School of Law. The audience included staffers from the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. Yet the presenters, by and large, applied a fairly detached and mathematical lens to the notion that technology could harm people. Researchers hashed out technical definitions of fairness that could be expressed in the form of code. There was less talk about how economic pressures or structural racism might shape AI systems, whom they work best for, and whom they harm.
Gebru didn’t attend the FATML workshop that year or the next—she was still mainly focused on building AI, not examining its potential for harm. In January 2017, at a one-day event centered on how AI could shake up finance, Gebru stood in a gray turtle­neck in a large octagonal room overlooking Stanford’s terracotta-roofed campus and presented the findings of her PhD thesis to members of Silicon Valley’s elite. She clicked through slides showing how algorithms could predict factors like household income and voting patterns just by identifying cars on the street.
Gebru was the only speaker who was not a professor, investment professional, or representative of a tech company, but, as one organizer recalls, her talk generated more interest than any of the others. Steve Jurvetson, a friend of Elon Musk and an early investor in Tesla, enthusiastically posted photos of her slides to Facebook. A longtime AI aficionado, he wasn’t surprised that machine-learning algorithms could identify specific cars. But the way Gebru had extracted signals about society from photos illustrated how the technology could spin gold from unexpected sources—at least for those with plenty of data to mine. “It was, ‘My God, think of all the data that Google has,’” Jurvetson says. “It made me realize the power of having the biggest data set.”
For Gebru, the event could have been a waypoint between her grad school AI work and a job building moneymaking algorithms for tech giants. But she decided that she wanted to help contain the technology’s power rather than expand it. In the summer of 2017, she took a job with a Microsoft research group that had been involved in the FATML movement from early on. Gebru wrote her pivot into the final chapter of her thesis: “One of the most important emergent issues plaguing our society today is that of algorithmic bias. Most works based on data mining, including my own works described in this thesis, suffer from this problem,” she wrote. Her plan for a career, she went on, was “to make contributions towards identifying and mitigating these issues.”
In 2015, Mitchell, an expert in software that generates language from images, was working on an app for blind people that spoke visual descriptions of the world. She had christened it Seeing AI, and she loved the idea that the flourishing power of machine learning could lift up society’s most vulnerable. But Microsoft didn’t seem willing to seriously invest in such projects at the time.
Mitchell also noticed some troubling gaffes in the machine-learning systems she was training. One would describe someone with pale skin, like the red-haired Mitchell, as a “person,” but a figure with dark skin as a “Black person.” In another test, an image of an inferno at an oil storage depot was captioned “great view.” She began to fear that AI was laced with land mines, and the industry was not paying enough attention to finding them. “Oh crap,” she remembers thinking. “There are serious issues that we have to solve right now because no one else is working on them and this technology is evolving.”
In 2016, Mitchell moved to Google to work full-time on those problems. The company appeared to be embracing this new, conscientious strand of AI research. A couple of weeks before she started, Google published its first research paper on machine-­learning fairness. It considered how to ensure that a system that makes predictions about ­people—say, assessing their risk of defaulting on a loan—offered equal treatment to individuals regardless of their gender, race, religion, or other group identity. The company highlighted its research in a blog post for a general audience, and signed up, alongside Microsoft, as a corporate sponsor of the FATML workshop.
When Mitchell got to Google, she discovered a messier reality behind the company’s entrée into fairness research. That first paper had been held up for months by internal deliberations over whether Google should publicly venture into a discourse on the discriminatory potential of computer code, which to managers seemed more complex and sensitive than its labs’ usual output. Mitchell’s own first publication at the company, on making smile-detection algorithms perform well for people of different races and genders, also met with a degree of corporate hesitancy that didn’t seem to encumber more conventional AI projects. She chose to work on smiles in part because of their positive associations; still, she endured rounds of meetings with lawyers over how to handle discussions of gender and race.
At other times, Mitchell’s work inside Google faced little resistance, but also ­little enthusiasm. “It was like people really appreciated what I was saying, and then nothing happened,” she says. Still, Mitchell hadn’t expected to change the company overnight, and gradually her efforts gained momentum. In late 2017 she formed a small team dedicated to “ethical AI research” and embarked on a campaign of meetings with teams across Google to spread the word and offer help. This time people seemed more receptive—perhaps in part because broader attitudes were shifting. Some of Google’s rivals, like Microsoft, appeared to be taking AI fairness more seriously. Industry hype about AI was still intense, but the field’s culture was becoming more reflective.
One person driving that change was Timnit Gebru, who was introduced to Mitchell by an acquaintance over email when Gebru was about to join Microsoft. The two had become friendly, bonding over a shared desire to call out injustices in society and the tech industry. “Timnit and I hit it off immediately,” Mitchell says. “We got along on every dimension.”
Gebru was also hitting it off with others who wanted to work in AI but found themselves misunderstood by both people and algorithms. In December 2017, Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a young Nigerian-Canadian coder at an AI startup called Clarifai, stood in the lobby of the Long Beach Convention Center in a crowd of mostly white faces at that year’s NIPS conference. She was beginning to feel that working in AI was not for her. At Clarifai, Raji had helped to create a machine-learning system that detected photos containing nudity or violence. But her team discovered it was more likely to flag images of people of color, because they appeared more often in the pornography and other material they’d used as training data. “That really hit me,” Raji says. “I built this thing, and it was actively discriminatory in a way that hurt people of color.”
The NIPS conference provided a look at the world of AI beyond her startup, but Raji didn’t see people like herself onstage or in the crowded lobby. Then an Afroed figure waved from across the room. It was Gebru. She invited Raji to the inaugural Black in AI workshop, an event born out of Gebru’s email list for Black researchers. Raji changed her plane ticket to stay an extra day in Long Beach and attend.
The event mixed technical presentations by Black researchers with networking and speeches on how to make AI more welcoming. Mitchell ran support for remote participants joining by video chat. At the post-event dinner, on the cruise ship Queen Mary, permanently docked in Long Beach, Gebru, Raji, and other Black AI researchers mingled and danced with big names from Amazon and Google.
Other events at NIPS that year had made the hype-saturated world of AI research appear seamy and elitist. Intel threw a corporate party that featured provocatively dressed women performing acrobatics, and Elon Musk made an anatomical joke about the conference’s acronym. NIPS organizers released a “statement on inappropriate behavior,” promising tougher policies for attendees and sponsors. (They also ended up changing the event’s acronym, in due course, to NeurIPS.)
At the Black in AI event, by contrast, there was an atmosphere of friendship and new beginnings. People spoke openly and directly about the social and political tensions hidden beneath the technical veneer of AI research. Raji started to think she could work in the field after all. Jeff Dean, the storied Googler who had cofounded the Google Brain research group, posed for selfies with attendees. He and another top Google Brain researcher, Samy Bengio, got talking with Gebru and suggested she think about joining their group.
Gebru’s research was also helping to make work on AI fairness less academic and more urgent. In February 2018, as part of a project called Gender Shades, she and Buolamwini published evidence that services offered by companies including IBM and Microsoft that attempted to detect the gender of faces in photos were nearly perfect at recognizing white men, but highly inaccurate for Black women. The problem appeared to be rooted in the fact that photos scraped from the web to train facial-­recognition systems overrepresented men as well as white and Western people, who had more access to the internet.
The project was a visceral demonstration of how AI could perpetuate social injustices—and of how research like Gebru’s could hold companies like her own employer to account. IBM and Microsoft both issued contrite statements. Gebru had not informed her bosses of Microsoft’s inclusion in the Gender Shades project much in advance, but Microsoft’s research division was known for being kept relatively isolated from the business in order to give its researchers freedom. A product manager quizzed her about the study, but that was it. The lab promoted a New York Times write-up of the project on its homepage, with a photo of Gebru over the newspaper’s headline: “Facial Recognition Is Accurate, If You’re a White Guy.”
Gebru’s primary research project at Microsoft contrasted her experience as an electrical engineer with the working habits of machine-learning experts. At Apple, Gebru and her coworkers had studied standardized data sheets detailing the properties of every component they considered adding to a gadget like the iPhone. AI had no equivalent culture of rigor around the data used to prime machine-learning algorithms. Programmers generally grabbed the most easily available data they could find, believing that larger data sets meant better results.
Gebru and her collaborators called out this mindset, pointing to her study with Buolamwini as evidence that being lax with data could infest machine-learning systems with biases. Gebru’s new paper proposed a framework called Datasheets for Datasets, in which AI engineers would document the patterns and contents of their data to avoid nasty surprises later. The project treated AI systems as artifacts whose creators should be held to standards of responsibility. “For the first time it gave some structure in my mind about how to think about implementing fairness,” says Krishna Gade, who led a team developing machine learning for Facebook’s News Feed before founding Fiddler Labs, which creates AI transparency tools.
The Datasheets project bolstered Gebru’s prominence in the movement to scrutinize the ethics and fairness of AI. Mitchell asked her to think about joining her Ethical AI team at Google.
Some people warned Gebru about joining the company. While she was interviewing, Google employees were pressuring their leaders to abandon a Pentagon contract known as Project Maven, which would use machine learning to analyze military drone surveillance footage. Gebru signed a letter with more than 1,000 other researchers urging the company to withdraw. Her uncomfortable experience at the 2015 Google party in Montreal preyed on her mind, and multiple women who had worked at Google Brain told her that the company was hostile to women and people of color, and resistant to change.
Gebru considered walking away from the job offer, until Mitchell offered to make her colead of the Ethical AI team. They would share the burden and the limelight in hopes that together they could nudge Google in a more conscientious direction. Gebru reasoned that she could stick close to Mitchell and keep her head down. “I thought, OK, I can do my work and be careful who I collaborate with, and try to ignore some of the other things,” she says. “My number one concern was: Can I survive in this environment?”
Gebru joined a discussion about the protest on an internal email list called Brain Women and Allies. She pointed out some problems she’d noticed at her new workplace, including “toxic men” and a lack of women in senior positions. She was summoned to a brief meeting with Dean—now her boss’s boss—and a representative from human resources to discuss her observations.
Soon after, Gebru met with Dean again, this time with Mitchell at her side, for another discussion about the situation of women at Google. They planned a lunch meeting, but by the time the appointment rolled around, the two women were too anxious to eat. Mitchell alleged that she had been held back from promotions and raises by performance reviews that unfairly branded her as uncollaborative. Gebru asserted that a male researcher with less experience than her had recently joined Google Brain at a more senior level. Dean said he’d look into the pair’s claims. Gebru was promoted; Dean told her that the hiring committee had not previously seen all parts of her résumé, an explanation she found dubious. After more back and forth over Mitchell’s position, Dean let her switch supervisors.
Gebru and Mitchell’s work didn’t fit easily into Google’s culture, either. The women and their team were a relatively new breed of tech worker: the in-house ethical quibbler. After the dustup at Google over Project Maven, and in the wake of research like Buolamwini and Gebru’s, tech giants began trumpeting lofty corporate commitments to practice restraint in their AI projects. After Google said it would not renew its controversial Pentagon contract, it announced a set of seven principles that would guide its AI work. Among them: AI projects had to be “socially beneficial” and could not relate to weapons or surveillance (though other defense work was still permitted). Microsoft posted six AI principles that were less specific, including “inclusiveness” and “accountability.” Both companies created internal review processes for cloud computing deals that they said would weed out unethical projects. In 2016, Microsoft and Google were the only corporate sponsors of the FATML workshop; in 2019, they were joined by Google’s Alphabet sibling DeepMind, as well as Spotify and Twitter, as sponsors of an entire conference that had in part grown out of the FATML workshop. Gebru was one of its organizers.
Despite those changes, it remained unclear to some of the in-house quibblers how, exactly, they would or could change Google. The Ethical AI team’s primary job was to conduct research, but Mitchell also wanted the group to shape the company’s products, which touched billions of lives. Indifference and a lack of support, however, sometimes stood in their way. In some cases, Mitchell herself wrote code for product teams that wanted to implement AI safeguards, because engineering resources weren’t regularly made available for their kind of work.
So the Ethical AI team hustled, figuring out ways to get traction for their ideas and sometimes staging interventions. In one case, they noticed problems in Gmail’s Smart Reply feature, which suggests short responses to emails: It made gendered assumptions, such as defaulting to “he” if a message included mention of an engineer. A member of the Ethical AI team met with an engineer on the project for a quiet chat. That helped set off a series of conversations, and the feature was adjusted to no longer use gendered pronouns.
Mitchell also developed a playbook for turning ethical AI itself into a kind of product, making it more palatable to Google’s engineering culture, which prized launches of new tools and features. In January 2019, Mitchell, Gebru, and seven collaborators introduced a system for cataloging the performance limits of different algorithms. The method, which built on Gebru’s earlier work documenting the contents and blind spots of data sets, noted the conditions under which algorithms were most likely to return accurate results and where they were likely to falter. Mitchell’s team named the concept Model Cards, to make it sound generic and neutral, and shopped it around to other teams inside the company. The cloud computing division adopted Model Cards, using them as a form of disclosure, like a nutrition label, to show the public how well, say, Google’s facial detection algorithm performs on different kinds of images.
On at least one occasion, the Ethical AI team also helped convince Google to limit its AI in ways that ceded potential revenue to competitors. Microsoft and Amazon had for years offered face-­recognition services that could be used for more or less anything, including law enforcement. With the Ethical AI team’s help, Google launched a limited service that just recognized public figures and was offered only to customers in the media after careful vetting.
Mitchell and Gebru believed their successes derived in part from the fact that their team provided refuge from Google’s internal culture, which they and some other researchers found hostile, territorial, and intensely hierarchical. The dozen or so people on the Ethical AI team took pride in being more diverse in terms of gender, race, and academic background than the rest of the company. Gebru fondly thought of them as misfits and believed that diversity made the group more likely to spot problems or opportunities that Google’s largely white male workers might overlook. Gebru and Mitchell also successfully lobbied executives to allow them to bring in sociologists and anthropologists—not just the usual computer science PhDs. “A lot of people in our team would either not be at Google or maybe even in the tech industry if they didn’t join,” Gebru says.
Over time, the team seemed to show how corporate quibblers could succeed. Google’s Ethical AI group won respect from academics and helped persuade the company to limit its AI technology. Gebru and Mitchell both reported to Samy Bengio, the veteran Google Brain researcher, whom they came to consider an ally. The company had built up a handful of other teams working on AI guardrails, including in the research and global affairs divisions, but they were tied more closely to the company’s business priorities. The Ethical AI team was more independent and wide-ranging. When Mitchell started at Google, the field mainly took a narrow, technical approach to fairness. Now it increasingly asked more encompassing questions about how AI replicated or worsened social inequalities, or whether some AI technology should be placed off-limits. In addition to creating handy tools for engineers, members of the team published papers urging AI researchers to draw on critical race theory and reconsider the tech industry’s obsession with building systems to achieve mass scale.
At the same time, however, Mitchell and Gebru’s frustrations with Google’s broader culture mounted. The two women say they were worn down by the occasional flagrantly sexist or racist incident, but more so by a pervasive sense that they were being isolated. They noticed that they were left out of meetings and off email threads, or denied credit when their work made an impact. Mitchell developed an appropriately statistical way of understanding the phenomenon. “What is the likelihood that I will not be invited to a meeting that I should be at? What is the likelihood that my male colleague will be invited? You start to see the trends,” she says.
Together, the two women joined and sometimes led attempts to change Google’s culture. In 2019, with two others, they circulated a pointed internal document listing concerns about the treatment of women in Google’s research teams. Women were treated as “punching bags,” the document asserted, and senior managers dismissed observations about inequality as “temper tantrums.” Mitchell disseminated a chart explaining how to support marginalized groups at work, including checklist items like “Did you listen to their answer and respond with empathy?”
Gebru was the more outspoken of the two—usually because she felt, as a Black woman, that she had to be. She admits that this won her enemies. She dismissed as backward diversity programs that placed an emphasis on mentoring for women: The company’s problems, she would say, were rooted in its culture and leadership, not in the marginalized workers. Gebru’s willingness to speak up sometimes led to blowups. In one incident, she and another woman warned Dean that a male researcher at Google had previously been accused of sexual harassment. Managers did not appear to act until the man was accused of harassing multiple people at Google, after which he was fired. The man’s lawyers then sent Google a letter in which they accused Gebru and the other woman of defaming him. Google lawyers in turn advised the pair to hire their own counsel. Gebru and her coworker did so, and their own lawyers warned Google that it had a duty to represent its employees. After that expensive pushback, the two women didn’t hear more about the issue. (Google did not respond to a request for comment on the incident, but told Bloomberg it began an investigation immediately after receiving reports about the man and that he departed before the investigation concluded.)
Some Googlers chafed at Gebru’s willingness to confront colleagues. “Timnit’s behavior was very far outside the norm,” says one researcher at Google who was not authorized to speak to the press. The researcher recalls an incident in the summer of 2020, during the wave of Black Lives Matter protests, when Gebru got into a dispute on an internal mailing list dedicated to discussing new AI research papers. A male colleague posted a short, enthusiastic message about a new text­-generation system that had just been opened up for commercial use. Gebru, acutely conscious of the demonstrations roaring across America, replied to highlight a warning from a prominent woman in the field that such systems were known to sometimes spew racist and sexist language. Other researchers then replied to the initial post without mentioning Gebru’s comment. Gebru called them out for ignoring her, saying it was a common and toxic pattern, and she says one man privately messaged her to say he wasn’t surprised she got harassed online. A hot-tempered debate ensued over racism and sexism in the workplace.
According to the Google employee, the incident—which is also described in anonymous posts on Reddit—showed how Gebru’s demeanor could make some ­people shy away from her or avoid certain technical topics for fear of being pulled into arguments about race and gender politics. Gebru doesn’t deny that the dispute became heated but says it ultimately proved productive, forcing attention to her negative experiences and those of other women at Google.
Dean raised a polite chuckle when he explained that the new system was called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, but was generally known by a name borrowed from Sesame Street: BERT. It was an example of a new type of machine-learning system known as a large language model, enabled by advances that made it practical for algorithms to train themselves on larger volumes of text, generally scraped from the web. That broader sampling allowed models like BERT to better internalize statistical patterns of language use, making them better than previous technology at tasks like answering questions or detecting whether a movie review was positive or negative.
When a reporter asked whether BERT would also learn, say, sexist language patterns, Dean responded, “This is something that we definitely look at for all the machine-learning-related product launches and also in our own research,” citing the work of people like Mitchell and Gebru. “We want to make sure that our use of machine learning is free of unfair forms of bias.” The Q&A also revealed that Google had other reasons to value BERT. When another journalist asked if it was being used by Google’s ads team, one of the search executives replied, “I’m sure they must be applying it.”
In the months that followed, excitement grew around large language models. In June 2020, OpenAI, an independent AI institute cofounded by Elon Musk but now bankrolled by a billion dollars from Microsoft, won a splurge of media coverage with a system called GPT-3. It had ingested more training data than BERT and could generate impressively fluid text in genres spanning sonnets, jokes, and computer code. Some investors and entrepreneurs predicted that automated writing would reinvent marketing, journalism, and art.
These new systems could also become fluent in unsavory language patterns, coursing with sexism, racism, or the tropes of ISIS propaganda. Training them required huge collections of text—BERT used 3.3 billion words and GPT-3 almost half a trillion—which engineers slurped from the web, the most readily available source with the necessary scale. But the data sets were so large that sanitizing them, or even knowing what they contained, was too daunting a task. It was an extreme example of the problem Gebru had warned against with her Datasheets for Datasets project.
Inside Google, researchers worked to build more powerful successors to BERT and GPT-3. Separately, the Ethical AI team began researching the technology’s possible downsides. Then, in September 2020, Gebru and Mitchell learned that 40 Googlers had met to discuss the technology’s future. No one from Gebru’s team had been invited, though two other “responsible AI” teams did attend. There was a discussion of ethics, but it was led by a product manager, not a researcher.
That same month, Gebru sent a message to Emily M. Bender, a professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, to ask if she had written anything about the ethical questions raised by these new language models. Bender had not, and the pair decided to collaborate. Bender brought in a grad student, and Gebru looped in Mitchell and three other members of her Google team.
The resulting paper was titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜” The whimsical title styled the software as a statistical mimic that, like a real parrot, doesn’t know the implications of the bad language it repeats.
The paper was not intended to be a bombshell. The authors did not present new experimental results. Instead, they cited previous studies about ethical questions raised by large language models, including about the energy consumed by the tens or even thousands of powerful processors required when training such software, and the challenges of documenting potential biases in the vast data sets they were made with. BERT, Google’s system, was mentioned more than a dozen times, but so was OpenAI’s GPT-3. Mitchell considered the project worthwhile but figured it would come across as boring. An academic who saw the paper after it was submitted for publication found the document “middle of the road.”
Plenty of people inside Google knew about the paper early on, including Dean. In October, he wrote in a glowing annual review that Gebru should work with other teams on developing techniques to make machine-learning software for language processing “consistent with our AI Principles.” In her reply, she told him about the paper she was drafting with Bender and others. Dean wrote back: “Definitely not my area of expertise, but would definitely learn from reading it.” Gebru also informed Google’s communications department about the project and mentioned it to Marian Croak, a Black engineering executive on Google’s Advanced Technology Review Council, an internal review panel that was added after the Maven protests. Croak said the paper sounded interesting and asked Gebru to send her a copy. But Gebru never got the chance before the fatal controversy over “Stochastic Parrots” erupted.
It’s not clear exactly who decided that Gebru’s paper had to be quashed or for what reason. Nor is it clear why her resistance—predictable as it was—prompted a snap decision to eject her, despite the clear risk of public fallout. Other researchers at Google say it isn’t unusual for publications about AI to trigger internal corporate sensitivities before public release, but that researchers can usually work through managers’ objections. Gebru, with her track record of rattling management about Google’s diversity and AI ethics problems, got little such opportunity. One reason managers were not more open in explaining their feedback to Gebru, according to Google, was that they feared she would spread it around inside the company. Those fears may have been compounded when Gebru took to an internal listserv to criticize Google for “silencing marginalized voices,” even as she offered to kill her own paper in exchange for greater transparency.
On the night of her forced exit from Google, in early December, members of Gebru’s team joined a tearful Google Meet video call that lasted until early the next morning. In normal times, they might have hugged and huddled in a bar or someone’s home; in a pandemic they sniffled alone over their laptops. Two weeks later, the remaining team members sent an email to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding an apology and several changes, including Gebru’s­ reinstate­ment (and Kacholia’s ­reassignment). Mitchell’s firing two months later brought new pain. She hired lawyers who blasted out a press release saying she had been fired after “raising concerns of race and gender equity at Google.”
Dean became the face of Google’s displeasure with the “Stochastic Parrots” paper. He sent an email to the members of Google Research, also released publicly, saying the work “didn’t meet our bar for publication,” in part because one of its eight sections didn’t cite newer work showing that large language models could be made less energy-­hungry. Dean repeated the point so often inside Google that some researchers joked that “I have an objection to Parrots section three” would be inscribed on his tombstone. The complaint made little sense to many AI researchers, who knew that grumbles about citations typically end with authors revising a paper, not getting terminated. Dean’s argument suffered another blow when reviewers accepted the paper to the conference on fairness and technology.
Others, including Gebru, offered a different explanation from Dean’s: Google had used an opaque internal process to suppress work critical of a technology that had commercial potential. “The closer the research started getting to search and ads, the more resistance there was,” one Google employee with experience of the company’s research review process says. “Those are the oldest and most entrenched organizations with the most power.” Still others surmised that Gebru was the casualty of a different kind of turf battle: that other internal groups working on responsible AI—ones with closer relationships to Google’s product teams—felt that Gebru and her coauthors were encroaching where they didn’t belong.
Some Google employees, including David Baker, a director who’d been at the company for 16 years, publicly quit over its treatment of Gebru. Google’s research department was riven by mistrust and rumors about what happened and what might happen next. Even people who believed Gebru had behaved in ways unbecoming of a corporate researcher saw Google’s response as ham-handed. Some researchers feared their work would now be policed more closely. One of them, Nicholas Carlini, sent a long internal email complaining of changes that company lawyers made to another paper involving large language models, published after Gebru was fired, likening the intervention to “Big Brother stepping in.” The changes downplayed the problems the paper reported and removed references to Google’s own technology, the email said.
Soon after, Google rolled out its response to the roiling scandal and sketched out a more locked-down future for in-house research probing AI’s power. Marian Croak, the executive who had shown interest in Gebru’s work, was given the task of consolidating the various teams working on what the company called responsible AI, including Mitchell and Gebru’s. Dean sent around an email announcing that a review of Gebru’s ouster had concluded; he was sorry, he said, that the company had not “handled this situation with more sensitivity.”
Dean also announced that progress on improving workforce diversity would now be considered in top executives’ performance reviews—perhaps quietly conceding Gebru’s assertion that leaders were not held accountable for their poor showing on this count. And he informed researchers that they would be given firmer guidance on “Google’s research goals and priorities.” A Google source later explained that this meant future projects touching on sensitive or commercial topics would require more input from in-house legal experts, product teams, and others within Google who had relevant expertise. The outlook for open-minded, independent research on ethical AI appeared gloomy. Google claimed that it still had hundreds of people working on responsible AI, and that it would expand those teams; the company painted Gebru and Mitchell’s group as a tiny and relatively unimportant cog in a big machine. But others at Google said the Ethical AI leaders and their frank feedback would be missed. “For me, it’s the most critical voices that are the most important and where I have learned the most,” says one person who worked on product changes with Gebru and Mitchell’s input. Bengio, the women’s manager, turned his back on 14 years of working on AI at Google and quit to join Apple.
Outside of Google, nine Democrats in Congress wrote to Pichai questioning his commitment to preventing AI’s harms. Mitchell had at one point tried to save the “Stochastic Parrots” paper by telling executives that publishing it would bolster arguments that the company was capable of self-policing. Quashing it was now undermining those arguments.
Some academics announced that they had backed away from company events or funding. The fairness and technology conference’s organizers stripped Google of its status as a sponsor of the event. Luke Stark, who studies the social impacts of AI at the University of Western Ontario, turned down a $60,000 grant from Google in protest of its treatment of the Ethical AI team. When he applied for the money in December 2020, he had considered the team a “strong example” of how corporate researchers could do powerful work. Now he wanted nothing to do with Google. Tensions built into the field of AI ethics, he saw, were beginning to cause fractures.
“The big tech companies tried to steal a march on regulators and public criticism by embracing the idea of AI ethics,” Stark says. But as the research matured, it raised bigger questions. “Companies became less able to coexist with internal critical research,” he says. One person who runs an ethical AI team at another tech company agrees. “Google and most places did not count on the field becoming what it did.”
To some, the drama at Google suggested that researchers on corporate payrolls should be subject to different rules than those from institutions not seeking to profit from AI. In April, some founding editors of a new journal of AI ethics published a paper calling for industry researchers to disclose who vetted their work and how, and for whistle-blowing mechanisms to be set up inside corporate labs. “We had been trying to poke on this issue already, but when Timnit got fired it catapulted into a more mainstream conversation,” says Savannah Thais, a researcher at Princeton on the journal’s board who contributed to the paper. “Now a lot more people are questioning: Is it possible to do good ethics research in a corporate AI setting?”
If that mindset takes hold, in-house ethical AI research may forever be held in suspicion—much the way industrial research on pollution is viewed by environmental scientists. Jeff Dean admitted in a May interview with CNET that the company had suffered a real “reputational hit” among people interested in AI ethics work. The rest of the interview dealt mainly with promoting Google’s annual developer conference, where it was soon announced that large language models, the subject of Gebru’s fateful critique, would play a more central role in Google search and the company’s voice assistant. Meredith Whittaker, faculty director of New York University’s AI Now Institute, predicts that there will be a clearer split between work done at institutions like her own and work done inside tech companies. “What Google just said to anyone who wants to do this critical research is, ‘We’re not going to tolerate it,’” she says. (Whittaker herself once worked at Google, where she clashed with management over AI ethics and the Maven Pentagon contract before leaving in 2019.)
Any such divide is unlikely to be neat, given how the field of AI ethics sprouted in a tech industry hothouse. The community is still small, and jobs outside big companies are sparser and much less well paid, particularly for candidates without computer science PhDs. That’s in part because AI ethics straddles the established boundaries of academic departments. Government and philanthropic funding is no match for corporate purses, and few institutions can rustle up the data and computing power needed to match work from companies like Google.
For Gebru and her fellow travelers, the past five years have been vertiginous. For a time, the period seemed revolutionary: Tech companies were proactively exploring flaws in AI, their latest moneymaking marvel—a sharp contrast to how they’d faced up to problems like spam and social network moderation only after coming under external pressure. But now it appeared that not much had changed after all, even if many individuals had good intentions.
Inioluwa Deborah Raji, whom Gebru escorted to Black in AI in 2017, and who now works as a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, says that Google’s treatment of its own researchers demands a permanent shift in perceptions. “There was this hope that some level of self-regulation could have happened at these tech companies,” Raji says. “Everyone’s now aware that the true accountability needs to come from the outside—if you’re on the inside, there’s a limit to how much you can protect people.”
Gebru, who recently returned home after her unexpectedly eventful road trip, has come to a similar conclusion. She’s raising money to launch an independent research institute modeled on her work on Google’s Ethical AI team and her experience in Black in AI. “We need more support for external work so that the choice is not ‘Do I get paid by the DOD or by Google?’” she says.
Gebru has had offers, but she can’t imagine working within the industry anytime in the near future. She’s been thinking back to conversations she’d had with a friend who warned her not to join Google, saying it was harmful to women and impossible to change.

Imagine being admitted into a long-term healthcare center, only to find out that it was being partly run by robots?
This may sound like some amusing sci-fi movie, or maybe even a little apocalyptic, but it’s actually a lot closer to reality than some people might think. You may be wondering if we should be worried about the thought of working more closely with robots, and I strongly believe the answer is ‘no.’ In fact, it’s not something we should fear, but is instead a futuristic solution to healthcare that we should be embracing with the utmost enthusiasm.

					Physician Targeting Using Real-time Data: How PurpleLab’s Alerts Can Help				



					By leveraging real-time data that offers unprecedented insights into physician behavior and patient outcomes, companies can gain a competitive advantage with prescribers. PurpleLab®, a healthcare analytics platform with one of the largest medical and pharmaceutical claims databases in the United States, recently announced the launch of Alerts which translates complex information into actionable insights, empowering companies to identify the right physicians to target, determine the most effective marketing strategies and ultimately improve patient care.

Why is the shift taking place now?
The timing of this great shift couldn’t be better. Today, there are about 46 million members of the 65-and-over club, but come 2050, that number is expected to double, which would make seniors around 25 percent of the American population. And as society continues to deliver and practice better healthcare measures, life expectancy rates are increasing as well.
Though that fact is a sure cause for celebration, the concerning part is that the number of seniors in need far outweighs the number of caregivers that are qualified and available for the job. One might suggest that the obvious solution would be to hire more hands on deck but the matter isn’t quite that simple. 
The role of caregiver comes with noble responsibilities and a few hard-to-top benefits, but the truth is, it’s a very demanding job. In order to do the job well, and you must because the lives of patients depend on it, it requires full dedication, long hours, and intense passion. These are all things that not a lot of people can commit to for the long term. This is why caregiver burnout is such a glaring problem in the current healthcare climate, which has only been amplified by the pandemic.




Burnout leads to high turnover rates, which then leaves skilled nursing facilities in a state of chaos as they try to care for their patients and their staff at the same time. If the problem is that there aren’t enough caregivers, or that your organization only has room in its budget for so many, then why shouldn’t the solution be robot caretakers?

					What’s Keeping Healthcare CIOs Up at Night: How Health Systems Automate Routine Phone Calls to Improve Workforce Effectiveness and Reduce Agent Burnout				


					With hospitals struggling to retain staff and value-based care shrinking healthcare revenues, health systems must look to technology resources to become more efficient, without losing sight of patient care or staff support.				


Should caregivers fear being replaced?
Being put out of work due to the mass overtaking of robots has created much fear in every industry, but as it turns out, there isn’t much of a story there. As mentioned before, our current caregivers often find themselves working to exhaustion in order to meet their patients’ needs, so once our senior population doubles, skilled nursing facilities won’t stand a chance if they choose to reject the help of artificial intelligence.
Robot caretakers aren’t meant to replace humans; you can never take the human touch out of skilled nursing facilities. Instead, they are meant to support long-term care staff.




When it comes to patient care, there are certain areas in which bots are unable to make themselves useful, and providing human interaction is one of them. Robot caretakers can listen and respond to patients, but residents wouldn’t regard them as true companions. In fact, most SNF residents would demand more from their robot caretakers because they aren’t worried about putting additional stress on them.
Robot caretakers can help with the majority of heavy lifting around the facility so that caregivers can spend more time doing what they want to do: caring for the critical medical and emotional needs of their patients. 
Can seniors truly lean on bots to take care of their needs?
Today’s seniors may require an adjustment period to get used to interacting with more advanced technology, but the ones that will hit 65-and-over within the next few decades will be no strangers to automation and artificial intelligence. 
Though we live in an age in which smart devices have literally altered our reality, skeptics are still unsure as to whether or not robots are equipped to actually mimic the attention to detail that a human caregiver can. The short answer is ‘yes,’ and here’s how. 
These robots have been programmed to handle the routine tasks caregivers are usually responsible for, like checking vital signs, administering medication, assisting with feedings, and alerting healthcare professionals in case of an emergency. They can even offer contactless Covid-19 screenings to patients. But a robot caretaker’s biggest advantage comes in handling the more physically demanding parts of the job.
These robot caretakers can help patients bathe and use the bathroom, lifting their bodies from their beds or wheelchairs with ease. They can help patients get dressed and even make up residents’ beds after each use. When a robot is on the job, patients don’t have to feel embarrassed when they need to be cleaned up after using the bathroom or when they make a mess while they’re eating. And with artificial intelligence, elders are being looked after 24 hours a day. These bots can even pick up on physical cues that can indicate distress or discomfort, leading to fewer instances in which professionals are unable to get to their patients in critical moments.
Over time, robot caretakers will be able to handle even more complex tasks, like administering shots or cooking full-fledged meals. Healthcare executives are excited to introduce artificial intelligence into their facilities to help support their patients and staff members, but one thing is certain: robots can never replace human compassion. Caregivers should look forward to how bots can help support them while knowing they still play the most important role of all: and that’s providing the personal, human touch that can’t be replicated by technology.

Recruiters from all around the world use LinkedIn every day to find and filter applicants for specific job openings..LinkedIn is well-known for being one of the software behemoths that has pushed the limits of machine learning research and development. LinkedIn has been constantly exploring cutting-edge machine learning techniques in order to make artificial intelligence (AI) a first-class member of the LinkedIn experience, in contrast to cultivating one of the world's wealthiest datasets..Here are a few examples of how LinkedIn uses Artificial intelligence:.LinkedIn makes substantial use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance the experiences of its users and customers. Members are exposed to it on a daily basis, whether they are receiving employment recommendations, suggestions for connecting with others, or reading helpful stuff in their feed. AI assists enterprise customers, such as recruiters, in finding new talent pools and receiving insightful data. AI systems have had a significant impact on both sides of the platforms, adding significant value..According to a report, there was a 30% increase in job applications after the improvement of the personalization tool, which recommends jobs that members might be interested in. In general, job applications overall have grown more than 40% year-over-year, based on a variety of AI-driven optimizations that have been made to both sides of the member-recruiter ecosystem. The email responses to cold emails from recruiters have increased by 45% while at the same time cutting down on the notifications needed to send to the job seekers that have received such messages. Even better, the total number of continuing, two-way conversations started in LinkedIn Recruiter has doubled. Every message a recruiter sends is twice as likely to turn into a hire after the most powerful LinkedIn AI tools are implemented. AI has also improved article recommendations in the feed by 10-20% based on click-through rate. With all of these amazing statistics, the platform has reached 660 million users and engagement has increased 50% year over year. The value capture consists of increasing the number of users, specifically paid users and the number of enterprise subscriptions from companies..LinkedIn also uses AI to help businesses overcome human biases that stifle equality. These AI features are included in LinkedIn's Talent Insight product, which is geared at recruiters and focuses on diversity and inclusion..LinkedIn can monitor what occurs in the recruitment process in terms of gender, providing firms with data and insights into how their job postings and InMail are functioning. In addition, the top search results in LinkedIn Recruiter will be re-ranked to be more representative..Companies can observe the gender breakdown in each step of the hiring process according to LinkedIn's reporting data on gender in the hiring process. They can also have a better understanding of the overall talent environment, such as how skill sets change over time and how to discover talent pools. Companies can also evaluate their gender breakdown to that of their counterparts in the sector to see how they might recruit from a more diverse pool..AI also works in the background, protecting its members from hazardous information, routing connections to maintain a fast site performance experience, and ensuring that the notifications given to the users are informative but not obtrusive..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The invention of the wheel revolutionized the concept of mobility for the entire human race. This gave birth to the car in 1886 and only later in 1908, was this vehicle available to the masses. The ‘wheel’ generated hope in terms of rapid movement and the car brought controls like comfort, pleasure of driving, and of course – light! Being in the possession of a car was a luxury till only a few decades ago!
When the technology is couples with car designing, it gave rise to Super Mobility that progressively made more complex and reliable machines which became increasingly easy to manoeuvre. 
With technology going up in leaps and bounds there was not an iota of doubt that this automobile would to transform into Smart Mobility Vehicle. 
Future Mobility will be with the advent of latest technology; Electric, Connectivity, Internet-of-things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL). Today there are many innovative features that enhance the car & the ecosystem for Electric Vehicle, Autonomous Vehicle and Car Sharing. 
In towns and cities, there is a dire need of sustainable solutions of car sharing such as combined multiple modes of transportation including private cars, public transport, robo-taxis / shuttles, micro-mobility and cycling, in order to address the problem of congestion, pollution and quality of life.  
Refer Figure 1: Technology Drivers, Transforming Automotive Industry clearly questions “WHO NEEDS BASIC MOBILITY?”. Technology Drivers are pushing the Ecosystem to get it transformed into a Value Chain for OEM’s. Stakeholders; Vehicle manufacturers, Technology providers, Govt. authorities and many more to have strategic plans in place to provide effective solutions. Overcoming hurdles, aggressive predictions are being made for meticulous planning, sagacious investments and execution methodologies. 

Figure 1: Technology Drivers, Transforming Automotive Industry
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial intelligence describes the work processes of machines that would require intelligence if performed by humans. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ thus means ‘investigating intelligent problem-solving behaviour and creating intelligent computer systems.
Artificial Intelligence can be divided into 5 categories;
• Machine & Deep learning
A set of algorithms used to model the high level abstraction of data, monitored and evaluated continuously. A single mistake can be captured and resolved automatically.  
• Industrialization 
Robots have dominance over the Manufacturing, Assembly and Production. They work effectively, efficiently and reliably.  
• Digitization & Data Processing
Data recording and processing has been phenomenal over the years. Traditional activities are no longer effective and scraped. Data management software’s will create database for further processing. 
• Micro & Mega Economies
With the advent of Web-based Networking techniques, stakeholders are able to manage the businesses in the most efficient way. Various applications are being developed and used to run on the online platforms. 
• Autonomous driving
No human interventions. Vehicle runs using sensors, navigation techniques and self-governing capabilities.
Hence, Artificial Intelligence will lead to redefine business models for the products and systems. This affects both; Product and Service sector as well the whole eco-system on which the businesses will run. The eco-system, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) into production and logistics and Internet of Things (IoT) are the blood and vessels of the businesses. CPS is the data bases and information sharing platform between humans, machines, products, objects and information and communication technology systems. 
In Vehicle Engineering, automatization has four levels; first the production is controlled by machines configured by humans, second, real-time production is the core feature, third is a decentralization and forth is industrialization where NO human intervention. There are economic benefits; reduced production cost, better presence in competitive market. 
The following Figure 2: The trends shaping the Auto Industry from now to 2030 describes, how AI & Machine Learning is playing a very important role.

Here, I would like to discuss three major applications of using AI & ML for Vehicle Engineering,
1. Predictive Maintenance
Automotive predictive maintenance software with online support system based on Microsoft Azure cloud services can be developed for vehicles that processes requests for appointments and syncs drivers to the nearest dealer services.
The online system also notifies drivers by phone message or email about the need to check parts that have exact maintenance schedules stated in the vehicle specifications, which are synchronized with the online system.
The Machine learning algorithms will recognize for example: 
• Starter motor malfunctions 
• Drop of pressure in the fuel pump 
• End of a battery’s service life 
It is possible to develop a vehicle predictive maintenance solution based on machine learning algorithms that collects data from steering and braking systems as well as from the starter motor, battery and fuel pump and relays the information to the cloud for analysis and diagnostics.
Few indicative steps for a predictive maintenance algorithm for battery life: 
• In-car monitoring system checks battery status  
• Data is transferred to the cloud  
• Cloud-based ML algorithm predicts that the battery will run low   
• System processes all inputs and prepares advice to the driver 
• Notification system sends a message to the driver with instructions 
• Driver takes action based on the recommended instructions 
2. Pedestrian Tracking & Collision Prediction
Urban populations are growing exponentially alongside the number of personal and public transportation, and last-mile delivery vehicles. These vehicles share increasingly crowded streets with pedestrians and cyclists, who are the most vulnerable road users. Globally, pedestrians accounted for 25% of road fatalities in the year 2018. 
Besides street congestion, blind spots of large buses and heavy vehicles are another cause of incidents. Drivers must manoeuvre quickly and accurately while staying alert to any nearby movement. Workers on foot can also be exposed to potential harm on industrial storage sites from forklifts. With a full load completely blocking the view, forklift drivers may have more blind spots than areas of clear vision.
All these pedestrian safety issues can be addressed through an AI pedestrian collision prediction module. 
It is possible to develop a pedestrian collision prediction module which analyses data about the position of pedestrians, their predicted locations, and road coordinates. 
The module comprises of the following components:
• Pedestrian detection
• Pedestrian trajectory prediction
• Road segmentation
• The pedestrian collision prediction module itself
Pedestrian detection is conducted with the Realtime Object Detection algorithm. The module for pedestrian trajectory prediction with Kalman Filter obtains the speed and velocity of a pedestrian from the detection module to predict their motion. Then the pedestrian detector searches for the best-match appearance to update measurements. The output of the previous calculation is an input for the next one. The result of the Kalman filter is an adjusted pedestrian trajectory.
The Road segmentation module distinguishes driving lanes from the sidewalk and outputs images with labelled road pixels. The module is usually handled by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Deep Learning Methodology.
The Pedestrian collision prediction module calculates the probability of a collision using the coordinates of a pedestrian bounding box, which are predicted and obtained from the object detector paired with the Kalman filter, and the road coordinates from the road segmentation module. If these coordinates of a pedestrian bounding box do not intersect with road coordinates, the vehicle and pedestrian collision is of zero-probability. In case of an intersection, the collision probability equals the ratio of the distance to the predicted pedestrian location and the distance of detected road available for the car.
Active safety technology for preventing pedestrian collisions is important to protect vulnerable road users and move toward zero-traffic-accident society. Using AI and ML solutions, OEMs built intelligent vehicles that can perceive and react to road conditions up to 99.8% which is better than human drivers.
Being an extra pair of eyes, a pedestrian collision prediction module addresses the challenge of monitoring hazardous blind spots for drivers of both private cars and large vehicles manoeuvring in narrow lanes and around people on foot. Once the possibility of hitting a pedestrian is detected, a driver will receive a visual and audio alert, thus getting more time to react. If the situation is defined as critical, the brakes will be applied automatically.
The advanced pedestrian trajectory prediction module will support automakers in enhancing the safety parameters of vehicles in urban, rural, and industrial environments. By equipping fleets with a pedestrian collision prediction module, companies will reduce incidents and associated costs and, most importantly, save lives.
3. High-Definition Maps and Cloud Data Platform for Autonomous Driving
One of the major requirement for Fully Automated Driving (FAD) is 3D HD Maps, the creation of the maps i.e. eliciting source data to creating and publishing the maps themselves. AI can support in this activity. The map development process is sequential and happens in five major stages:
Real-time streaming perception
An Edge Perception stack is developed that allows for HD map observations and crowd-sourced updates using vehicle-mounted sensor systems. The process involves detecting road features in video streams in real time. This dynamic data is then used in the development of self-healing maps. In case of any changes on the roads, maps are updated automatically, and the new map data is delivered to end users in real time.
Data collection
To build detailed and credible maps for navigation systems and custom solutions, accurate information on road attributes needs to be collected from around the globe. Data is gathered from mobile cameras, sensors, and GPS devices on the road to locate traffic lights, signs, poles, stop lines, lane markings, roadside barriers, junctions, etc. 
Data aggregation, processing, and filtering
Engineers handle massive datasets from a variety of sources, including from core maps and on-vehicle sensor systems. All road image data is aggregated, processed, and filtered via a streaming file system for further validation and intelligent analysis using machine learning models. All data can be consumed in an NDS (Navigation Data Standard) format to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure interoperability across systems.
3D map creation and maintenance
Live 3D maps are compiled & updated that enable precise positioning for lateral and longitudinal control of vehicles. These multi-layer maps contain details at several levels (roads, lanes, lane groups and individual lanes, geometry) and are constantly enriched with incoming information on new road attributes such as signs, markers, crosswalks, bicycle lanes, and objects.
Map delivery
Data-intensive HD maps are generated and delivered to customers online as a geographically tiled and functionally layered data service suitable for direct-to-vehicle and OEM cloud consumption. These maps are also an indispensable source of data for client’s many in-vehicle software development programs.
There would be many such tests and a huge number of algorithms running in the vehicle environment. All the stakeholders; Vehicle manufacturers, Technology providers, Govt. authorities, Academicians have their own share of work to support this humongous initiative.  
Indian Research Universities / Institutes have a pivotal role to play. Currently, there is huge GAP between ‘what we learn’ and ‘where we apply’. Industry and Service sectors in India would require a gross incremental workforce of  > 1.12 billion by 2050; India could potentially emerge as a global supplier of skilled manpower. Refer Figure 3: Workforce requirements by 2050 and Gap between Industry & Academics. Going ahead the organizations anticipate a huge shortfall of qualified and skilled employees.  Since business strategies are not clear, there is a need to procure, control, retain and nurture talent. This may be the key to combat competition.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence is all around us whether we realize it or not. Its impact goes beyond what we know as it continues to help make our lives easier and more personalized. But have you ever thought about how it affects an industry as big as music? From creating new experimental tunes to reimagining the classics, AI has a large impact on the music that is produced today. With the demand for music to be made in multiple genres and countless elements that can be combined, it's no wonder why the industry is looking to AI to help create new music. AI in music could revolutionize the music we listen to and unlock potentially new combinations that we have never thought of. For example, with such a high demand for new music many people have created programs that creates background music so that creators have access to affordable new music that fits the mood that they are going for [1]. Moreover, AI has been used to mimic sounds of known musicians. Notably, an AI generated Bach composition, which was indifferentiable by the public [1] from an original Bach piece. 
AI Infused Music
But what does this mean for music makers and listeners? Will AI allow us to reach sounds and genres not yet explored, or will it make it so that we’re always listening to the same generic pop beat? These are some things to consider when looking into the impact of AI on the music industry. Currently, AI music composition works with an algorithm that is fed examples of certain music. The AI then creates music that resembles what it was fed [3]. Here’s a fun example of this: the song “Daddy’s Car“ was made through AI composition by Sony’s computer science laboratory music team based in Tokyo Japan. It was made to sound like a Beatles song. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o [3]. Many feel that AI in the music industry will open up many new avenues in music production including a “golden era of creativity” as the AI will be able to combine sounds and genres in ways that was unthought of before. This would allow artists to produce music that goes beyond known genres and reach an entirely new level of personalization. Claire. L. Evans from the band YACHTs says that “AI forced us to come up against patterns that have no relationship to comfort. It gave us the skills to break out of our own habits,” inspiringly the use of AI in YACHTs music got them their very first Grammy nomination for best immersive album![1]. 
On the other hand, the legality around AI produced music is truly obscure. Whether the creator of the algorithm, the AI itself, or the owner of the music that the AI was trained on is the owner of the piece created by the ai continues to create a lot of ambiguity as to how AI will be used going forward. Policy counsel Meredith Rose states “There’s nothing legally requiring you to give the artist any profits from it unless you’re directly sampling,” So what would this mean for established and upcoming artists trying to make their way through the industry? Would this hinder their creative processes?  AI could be used to create the next hit pop song by using old popular songs as data and creating a similar composition, thus being able to replace actual artists. Moreover, other issues that may arise include marketing songs as being similar to songs of an artist in order to get more traction. This may result in artists having a difficult time proving that a song is meant to sound like theirs. Unless they know exactly what the AI was trained on, it would be difficult to work backwards as it is very hard to extrapolate the original data that was given to the AI [2]. 
Conclusion
All in all, there are many positives to having artificial intelligence in the music industry; it helps feed the growing demand of new music in many different genres, and it allows artist to experiment with new sounds and explore never before heard combinations. On the other hand, it brings up serious ambiguities that lie in our legal systems regarding the use of artificial intelligence and intellectual property of artists. Although looking to the future, AI will allow music production to be a lot more widespread and at a lower cost allowing for an age of music that transcends the genres and sounds we know today.

By IBM data insights and AI practice leader, Abhishek Kaul, and Vale global AI projects leader, Ali Soofastaei
In recent years, there has been increased attention on the possible impact of future robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.
Prominent thinkers have publicly warned about the risk of a dystopian future when the complexity of these systems progresses further. These warnings stand in contrast to the current state-of-the-art robotics and AI technology.
Digital transformation and applied automation are growing fast in the mining industry. It is essential to adapt to the mining industry with the related innovations, which play critical roles in the digital revolution.

The core of these innovations is applied machine learning (ML) and AI across the mining value chain.
Many of us would assume that the mining industry would have driven advances in robotics, automation, AI and ML due to the remote mine sites, the hazardous nature of the work and the high costs of labour and transport.
However, it is the manufacturing sector that has spearheaded most of the technological developments, but it is now the mining sector that is taking advantage of those proven technologies to help boost its recovery after a significant downturn.
In today’s highly efficient mining operations, making the right decisions depends on their 360-degree visibility of the business and the market, combined with accurate demand forecasting.

With huge footprints in remote locations, diverse labour forces, and complex and time-consuming projects, mining companies are using enterprise resource planning (ERP) and advanced analytics systems as the technology backbone to their businesses.
ML and AI are the main part of an advanced data analytics approach, which is increasingly being relied on to make decisions about people, processes and technologies, be it accessing worker productivity to explore the next mine site or predict to schedule equipment for maintenance.
Although AI and ML-based analytics are delivering results, its recommendations for people-based decisions are subject to ethical considerations. Issues arise if AI and ML models have a bias based on gender, age or ethnicity and is not fair in providing recommendations.

There are multiple AI policy guidelines available from the United States, Europe and Asia to help organisations ensure that they build and use ethical AI.
This article discusses AI use cases in the mining industry with ethical considerations, reviews critical challenges and potential bias mitigation strategies.
Understanding ethics in AI 
AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans. AI refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing and interpreting the data, learning patterns in data, provide reasoning and recommendations, and optionally take actions with some degree of autonomy to achieve trained goals.

AI systems work very well at use cases where they involve recognising patterns with large quantities of data. AI systems work best together with people, and it is important to understand that AI requires reskilling people, not replacing them.
There are many AI techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, knowledge graphs, reasoning systems, and more.
Many of these techniques depend on ML. For example, the ability to automatically learn from historical patterns in data and improve performance over time.
The difference between AI and ML can be a little confusing. Figure 1 (below) illustrates the general boundaries between these concepts.


AI in the mining industry
Mining is a complex and fluctuating industry that is fraught with uncertainty around resource pricing, unpredictable resource fields and major projects that need to be managed right through their lifecycle.

Controlling costs for mineral exploration, construction and operation right through to project completion is a monumental challenge, but if the financial elements are managed well, it can help mining companies to be both competitive and profitable.
The key to increasing profits is knowing the precise time to increase production when there is strong demand using resource planning, improving the reliability of machinery with predictive and condition-based maintenance monitoring, delivering clarity with precise financial and operational reporting, and at the same time, providing actionable insights using real-time data extracted from every part of the organisation.
There are considerable benefits of using an AI system to improve the quality of work at a mine site and reduce the human failures and hazards.
AI use cases have been applied across the complete mining industry value chain from exploration, mine management, extraction, processing and transportation.

Data is fed into the AI systems. The data comes from a variety of sources like equipment, shift log, operator manuals, operator wearable, CCTV cameras, HR systems, shift rosters and more.
Although ML and AI, by their very nature, are always a form of statistical discrimination, the discrimination becomes objectionable when it places certain privileged groups at the systematic advantage and certain unprivileged groups at a systematic disadvantage.
Objectionable discriminations arise due to multiple reasons in the mining industry. The main reasons are:
Defining the business objective of the machine learning problem – for example, if the business objective is defined as maximum throughput without consideration for maintenance or safety aspects.
Unrepresentative data or data with existing prejudice for training – for example, if the AI model training data has been selected from a mine site where the demographic of the population is from the older age group.
Selecting the attributes or features for the ML model – for example, if in building the AI model, operator ethnicity has been included as a data point mobile mine equipment operator behaviour.
This article focuses on three main use cases of AI in mining:
Energy: ethics in reducing fuel consumption
Maintenance: ethics in predictive maintenance
Safety: ethics in using surveillance video (CCTV) for safety.
Policy guidelines for ethical AI 
Many countries have published AI policy guidelines. These guidelines provide a broad level objective for the use of AI – to ensure human-centric, safe and trustworthy AI.
Most guidelines make the organisation using AI responsible and accountable for their decisions and ask for the same ethical standards in AI-driven decisions as in human-driven decisions.
General key points achieved from global guidelines are:
It should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
It should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values.
It should be robust, both from a technical and social perspective since, even with good intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm.
To ensure compliance with ethical guidelines, AI models need three capabilities.
Explainability – An ability to explain the behaviour of the black box AI model. Multiple algorithms help to explain the model. For example, decision tree rules if A > 50, then stop else continue, are easily understood by people.
Fairness – The ability of AI models to report and mitigate discrimination and bias. Depending on the application of the AI model, the appropriate bias metrics should be reported. For example, for hiring, a false-positive (someone unfit for the job is employed) is less harmful than a false negative (someone fit for the job is denied). Further, bias mitigation algorithms can be applied to improve the fairness metrics by modifying the training data, the learning algorithm, the predictions, the optimisation or the making decision models.
Transparency – The ability of the model to be transparent on training data, accuracy and performance, bias and fairness metrics so that users can understand how AI was trained and deployed.
AI use cases with ethical consideration for the mining industry 
In this section, three use case details are presented with ethical consideration for AI in the areas of energy, maintenance and safety.
It is important to understand that AI is not about replacing people, but reskilling people and deployment of AI applications will improve the quality of work at a mine and reduce the human failures, hazards at the site.
Use Case 1: AI application for energy efficiency – ethics in reducing fuel consumption (consideration – operator demographics)
Fuel is an important cost contributor for haul trucks in surface mining. Multiple parameters affect fuel consumption like the type of truck, payload, distance, hours, weather and operator behaviour (includes speed, manoeuvring, acceleration and braking).
AI techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are generally applied to data to understand the top factors influencing fuel consumption and recommend changes to controllable factors, thereby reducing fuel consumption per tonne of ore mined by using a genetic algorithm (GA) in the optimisation phase of the project.

One of the predictors for haul truck fuel consumption is the operator (driver) behaviour. If demographic data points of a driver are included as attributes or features, then the AI model will identify patterns in demographic data that influence operator behaviour.
Depending on the training data set, for example, country, mine site, or number of operators, this analysis may have bias and may not hold true for the general case. Maybe the model can get biased to predict low fuel consumption for older male workers based on one mine site operation.
In such applications, it is recommended not to include demographic data in the analysis and rely solely on the unique mine equipment operator identifier. Unless essential, if the use of demographic data is needed, de-biasing techniques like reweighing, adversarial de-biasing should be applied with visibility on fairness metrics like statistical parity difference, Thiel index, and more should be enforced.
Ideally, the business objective of the AI model should be finetuned to provide guidelines to an operator to influence their behaviour – like speed, acceleration, etc, and provide a mechanism to monitor for deviations in operator actions to AI recommendations.
Use case 2: AI application in maintenance – Ethics in predictive maintenance (consideration – operator shift logs / NLP)
Equipment downtime significantly affects the productivity and safety of mining operations. The main goal of predictive maintenance is to shift the unplanned breakdowns to planned maintenance activities, increase the equipment lifetime, optimise maintenance schedules and ensure safe operations.
AI techniques in machine learning like cox regression, logistic regression, gradient boosting, neural nets are applied to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) and predict the health score of equipment using historical maintenance data.
Further, natural language processing (NLP) techniques like Word2Vec, BERT are applied on operator shift logs to gain a deeper understanding of operational events like faults, trips, overriding, noise, resetting observed, actioned and documented by the operator, which are then co-related to maintenance failures to provide deeper insights.

One of the data points used in the analysis to discuss further is the operator shift logs. Operator privacy is one of the considerations for analysing logs. However beyond privacy, when analysing operator logs, if language linguistics analysis is used for deciphering personal traits, personal attributes – like modelling and then to co-relate maintenance failures – inclusion of bias becomes a relevant topic and it is subject to ethical considerations.
In such applications, it is recommended to use the co-relation of events (nouns, verbs) with maintenance failures for providing slack time in operation for operators to do necessary maintenance inspections.
Further, it is recommended to de-bias the NLP models, which may cause some drop-in accuracy points but helps to keep the recommendations fair.
Use case 3:  AI application in safety – Ethics in using surveillance video (CCTV) for safety (consideration – surveillance video data)
Video surveillance data (CCTV cameras) are used in many work areas to ensure the security and safety of the site. Typically, hundreds of cameras feed data to the site security/safety office.
Since it is not possible to review the feed from all cameras in real-time by the human operator, the use case for video surveillance trends towards post-facto video retrieval and analysis for historical incidents, disputes.
With advancements in computer vision technologies, AI models are trained with the surveillance video feed to perform automated analysis for object detection, object classification, object tracking, and raise proactive alerts in real-time to detect and mitigate any safety or security violations.

Surveillance is itself an ethically neutral concept. What determines the ethical nature of a particular instance of surveillance will be the considerations which follow, such as justified cause, the means employed and questions of proportionality.
While it can be argued that monitoring remotely via a camera is no different from historical times when security personnel were physically present at the worksite, there are local privacy laws and regulations which must be complied with while using surveillance, face recognition technologies.
AI technologies in computer vision are leapfrogging every few months, like being able to understand the Spatio-temporal relationships of objects, which can be used to monitor people’s behaviour based on the change of posture, time of day, relationship with equipment, movement between areas, and more.
Ethical considerations when employing AI for surveillance monitoring should have a balance between workers privacy-trust-autonomy and workers’ safety-security-behaviour.
Conclusion
Understanding the implications of ethics in AI is important for mining companies to remain fair to their workforce as they are in human-driven decisions.
Mining companies should adopt and build AI solutions that follow leading policy guidelines and are explainable, transparent and fair. Further, when evaluating the AI solution, they should understand how the solution has built the data used in training the AI models.
In order to enforce ethical considerations for AI, mining companies can appoint an AI ethics officer or committee for the review of each AI application being developed or purchased from vendors and request disclosure on the fairness, explainability and transparency metrics.

New artificial intelligence could speed up diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases



A team of researchers from NTU, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and National Heart Centre Singapore, have invented a new artificial intelligence tool. NTU MAE’s Assoc Prof Eddie Ng Yin Kwee, is one of the co-leads of the study. The device uses a machine learning algorithm, which mimics the structure and function of the human brain, and can speed up the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and can help detect patterns in electrocardiograms (ECGs) and diagnose conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure, with an accuracy of more than 98.5 percent. The study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Computers in Biology and Medicine in May. The team will now work with local hospitals to conduct further trials of their AI tool for clinical use by validating their results with a larger database of patients.https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/default-source/corporate-ntu/hub-news/new-artificial-intelligence-tool-invented-by-ntu-np-and-nhcs-scientists-could-speed-up-diagnosis-of-cardiovascular-diseases78bcc0d4-268e-4e81-9885-44ddb462571e.pdf?sfvrsn=26fa5e92_3&fbclid=IwAR2INMeMwJptwehx5DFkaQdhphqj9xYdAk1FCLKZUx5RjH9ocdEvUgBCqkAhttps://www3.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms2/Releases/NR2021/NR_210608_ECG/Automated%20detection%20of%20cardiocvascular%20disease%20with%20ECG%20signals.pdf?fbclid=IwAR12E7ZlJx4mBtfhMDMrFyevjSTX32Y-EyRN782WY1e51pBWRHsPY0a7VAY

Even though until a few years ago, everyone was skeptical of the use of AI as it lacked strict regulatory laws, as of today the utility of some of its applications stand proven. .Here is a list of five Indian companies using artificial intelligence in the healthcare, education and sustainable energy sectors. .I. Chimple Commons -  “Learning should be chimple”   .Chimple Commons is part of Sutara Learning Foundation, a non-profit organisation in India dedicated to radically improve children’s learning..The company has identified the dire need for quality education on a global scale. Their mission is to take advantage of advances in Artificial Intelligence, Gamification and Cognitive research. Seeing the dropping prices of open source tablets, they aim to develop software which can autonomously help children learn in groups or alone. .Their work is focused on lifting children out of poverty by providing them with good quality of education. .“After learning basic literacy, a child can not only lift herself out of poverty - she can learn further and achieve previously impossible dreams,” they say..Their software is designed around reading, writing, mathematics, science, puzzles and coding; all essential aspects of learning for a growing child. The software will gamify each aspect of the learning process and customize the rewards to each child’s ability so that every child will have a sense of achievement at the end of the learning day..A worthy amalgamation of AI and learning to aid a noble cause. .Visit their website for more information. .II. Indshine.Indshine is a cloud-based, collaborative GIS application that allows teams to work on drone and satellite maps using any device - directly from a browser. .You can access gigabytes of your drone’s maps directly from the browser. You can add multiple layers of orthomosaics, elevations models, thermal &amp; NDVI maps in a single project.  .You can also get powerful insights from their analytical tools. Whether you want to calculate stockpile volume, calculate cross-section profile or measure distances &amp; area..Indshine is a technology company that provides enterprises drone software and solutions for infrastructure, mining, forestry and other industries.  .Read more about their work here. .Picture Credit: Ayu Devices - AyuSynk .III. Ayu Devices.Electronic stethoscope sounds like a device featured on a Black Mirror episode. Guess what?

Every industry in today's time is powered by AI as businesses are using it as a competitive tool. From chatbots for efficient customer service to using it for analytics to make predictive recommendations, artificial intelligence is leading the world forward. That makes AI an unmissable technology..If you are in the IT industry, you must be habituated to use programming languages, work with different frameworks, build software for companies, and write various codes to escalate problems. But don't disregard AI as an integral part of the IT field. AI and its many applications can help you earn a living and stay updated with modern tech trends. Here's how..1. Become an AI entrepreneur.It takes a problem-solver to become a business leader. There are so many things around us that need better solutions like global warming, excessive workloads, faster deliveries, improved emergency healthcare, etc. Basically, there's always something to improve around us. So figure out a pain point you want to target, get a team to brainstorm ideas, define the target audience, plan a solution, pitch the idea to investors, and get going with your own AI startup and make this world a better place while earning profits..2. Improve machine learning application in eCommerce.For good or bad, the COVID-19 pandemic has replaced the habit of shopping at physical stores with shopping online for almost everything. Because eCommerce shopping is in demand, this is the time to use machine learning and keep enhancing the experience. You can build a better recommendation engine, personalize the service, predict supply and demand faster, build improved visual search, and build a better security system. You can also create conversational interfaces and automate customer service tasks..3. Get competitive with chatbots.Every eCommerce website has a chatbot that will pop up as soon as you open the webpage. This is because companies are tapping into the potential of chatbots to provide 24/7 customer service. That doesn't mean you can't contribute to this buzz. Chatbot as a virtual assistant is the next development. Because AI is the technology that allows chatbots to mimic a human while conversing, you can teach the system how to talk using NLP. There are pre-made platforms like Microsoft Bot Framework, Botkit, and Dialogflow that will make this easier..4. Leverage your business with AI.If you run a business, you can make it more efficient with AI. You can use data from your customers and target their social media feeds to show useful products that your business offers, or make applications that will lighten your employee's workflow. If your business has an app, there are several ways to improve it using AI. For example, you could use speech synthesis to make your app convenient for people with weak vision..5. The trend of blogs never died.No, blogging is not dead, it just has different forms now like video blogging and audio blogging. If you are good at understanding and explaining complex tech concepts, you can start a blog to tutor budding engineers and developers. First, identify what you are good at. Then, start writing blogs on your own website or make vlogs or start a podcast. You can also create and sell online courses and even write a book. If you want to teach, there are many possibilities..6. Develop your own app.If starting a business of your own seems like a daunting task that will bog down your mental health, solve the same pain point by developing an app. Almost every service-related app uses artificial intelligence. You can make a simple app powered by AI and monetize it by adding a premium subscription or selling ad space on it..7. Compete and win.There are many machine learning competitions that allow programmers to earn money. Kaggle is a popular ML platform that offers prize money to winners, and Numerai is a tournament where data science professionals can compete to predict asset prices. Many other machine learning competitions allow programmers to practice before competing. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

These technological developments are changing every aspect of our lives. Artificial intelligence is the chief factor that is driving technological developments..Almost every business organization in the world is embracing artificial intelligence. The benefits reaped from AI in business processes are ground-breaking. AI solutions are changing traditional business processes and are driving them towards digital transformation. AI has helped companies amplify their growth, reach more audiences and work with agility..With the growing technological developments, the cost of implementing them will also fluctuate. So the question is, how much does artificial intelligence cost?.Well, the answer is, it depends. The cost of artificial intelligence depends on a few crucial factors. To determine the AI costs, we have to understand the factors leading to the current pricing..The type of software the company is building: Artificial intelligence refers to any device or application which is programmed for decision-making based on the information it consumes, thus mimicking human intelligence. Chatbots and voice assistants, understanding questions uttered in natural language, the CT scan machines detecting tumors and other diseases in our bodies, and the security cameras identifying people from live video footages, everything falls under artificial intelligence. But their costs vary based on their complexity, performance, and the purpose of the software.The level of intelligence of the AI application: AI solutions implemented in business operations are described as narrow artificial intelligence, which means that they are programmed to perform a particular task. We can consider an AI application as highly intelligent if it can perform tasks with little to no human instructions. The cost of implementing such technologies depends upon the level of intelligence that the companies expect from the applications.The performance of the AI algorithm: Sufficient algorithm performance is one of the major cost factors to consider because accurate predictions require several rounds of tuning sessions, which raises the cost of implementing AI solutions. The higher the accuracy and efficiency of the AI predictions, the more the cost of implementing these solutions.The complexity of the AI solution: While discussing the cost of artificial intelligence, it is important to mention the cost of creating proper AI software, with a cloud-driven back-end, ETL/streaming tools, voice assistants, cloud dashboards, and other services. It is of utmost importance to build an efficient AI system since it will be the brain of the company's technological system, pushing data and drawing insights to make informed decisions.The amount of data the AI application will consume: AI devices perform according to the data loaded in the system. It can absorb both structured and unstructured data. But when it comes to cost, structured data are cheaper to work with, especially if there is enough data to boost the AI algorithm's accuracy..So, how much does AI cost?.It is a common misconception that leveraging artificial intelligence technologies might cost a fortune. It might have been true in the past, but the scenario has changed with modern technology..Earlier, only giant tech companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google could afford to develop AI-powered software and applications. Thanks to the advent of various affordable tools, libraries, and frameworks, which has made AI more available to small-scale organizations and startups, has reduced the cost of implementation..Prices of AI solutions based on the different portfolios:.Prototype development starts from US$2500Developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the client's data starts from US$8000 and can cost up to US$15000The cost of implementing complete AI solutions may vary from US$20000 to US$1000000.The Future is AI.We use AI technology in our daily lives to satisfy our personal and professional needs. It not only helps businesses by providing creative insights from data analysis and solutions to complex business problems, but it also helps us by automating our daily monotonous activities..Almost every industrial sector in the world is leveraging AI and machine learning to simplify the business process and expand their markets. According to reports, the global AI market is estimated to reach US$176 billion by 2027..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

[+] wealth and income inequality.getty
The middle and working classes have seen a steady decline in their fortunes. Sending jobs to foreign countries, the hollowing out of the manufacturing sector, pivoting toward a service economy and the weakening of unions have been blamed for the challenges faced by a majority of Americans. 


There’s an interesting, compelling and alternative explanation. According to a new academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver in U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages, since 1980, can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers who were replaced or degraded by automation. 

Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a wide chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate. For now, college-educated, white-collar professionals have largely been spared the fate of degreeless workers. People with a postgraduate degree saw their salaries rise, while “low-education workers declined significantly.” According to the study, “The real earnings of men without a high-school degree are now 15% lower than they were in 1980.” 

PROMOTED
Much of the changes in U.S. wage structure, according to the paper, were caused by companies automating tasks that used to be done by people. This includes “numerically-controlled machinery or industrial robots replacing blue-collar workers in manufacturing or specialized software replacing clerical workers.”

Artificial intelligence systems are ubiquitous. AI-powered digital voice assistants share everything you want to know just by asking it a question. Instead of a live person addressing a problem, a corporate chatbot forces you to engage with it. The technology is remarkable. It helps diagnose cancer and health issues. Banks use sophisticated software to check for fraud and bad behaviors. Driverless automobiles, newsfeeds, social media and job applications are all controlled by AI.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a recent report, “A new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in AI and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people. The WEF asserts automation will slash about 85 million jobs by 2025. In a dire prediction, WEF said, “While some new jobs would be created as in the past, the concern is there may not be enough of these to go round, particularly as the cost of smart machines falls over time and their capabilities increase.”

Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”

Concerns of new technologies disrupting the workforce and causing job losses have been around for a long time. On one side, the argument is automation will create new and better jobs and erase the need for physical labor. The counterclaim is that people without the appropriate skills will be displaced and not have a home in the new environment. 
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Zoom and other tech giants greatly benefited financially during the pandemic. The virus outbreak accelerated trends, including choosing technology over people. There’s still a need for humans. For example, although Amazon invested heavily in automation for its warehouses, the online retail giant still needed to hire over 300,000 workers during the pandemic. This brings up another important overlooked  issue: the quality of a job. Proponents of AI say that there’s nothing to worry about, as we’ve always successfully dealt with new technologies. You may have a job, but what is the quality of it?  
To remain relevant, you will have to learn new skills to stay ahead of the curve. Bloomberg reported, “More than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. 
The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
For those who may be left behind, there’s a call for offering a universal basic income (UBI). This idea gained national attention when it became a major part of Democratic candidate Andrew Yang’s 2020 presidential campaign. Yang’s policy was to lift people out of poverty or help them through rough patches with a guaranteed monthly income. Supporters say it gives people needed financial security to find good jobs and avoid debt. Critics have argued free money would be a disincentive to work, creating a society dependent on the state.
According to a Wells Fargo research report, robots will eliminate 200,000 jobs in the banking industry within the next 10 years. This has already adversely impacted highly paid Wall Street professionals, including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment banks and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology. 
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors will be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that can perform delicate surgeries more precisely and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that can’t be readily seen by the human eye. 
Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast-food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
The rise of artificial intelligence will make even software engineers less sought after. That’s because artificial intelligence will soon write its own software, according to Jack Dorsey, the tech billionaire boss of Twitter and Square. That will put some beginner-level software engineers in a tough spot. When discussing how automation will replace jobs held by humans, Dorsey told Yang on an episode of the Yang Speaks podcast, “We talk a lot about the self-driving trucks and whatnot.” He added, “[AI] is even coming for programming [jobs]. A lot of the goals of machine learning and deep learning is to write the software itself over time, so a lot of entry-level programming jobs will just not be as relevant anymore.”  
 When management consultants and companies that deploy AI and robotics say we don’t need to worry, we need to be concerned. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people, in an effort to enhance profits. 
This trend has the potential to adversely impact all classes of workers. In light of the study’s spotlight on the dire results of AI, including lost wages and the rapid growth in income inequality, it's time to seriously talk about how AI should be managed before it's too late.

Too often, the biases that professionals from minority groups experience in the real world are replicated in the AI-enabled algorithms used in training & recruiting

Without human intervention, it is easy for algorithms used in the recruiting process to reproduce bias from the real world, according to a 2019 study conducted by Harvard Business Review (HBR) with professionals from Northeastern University and the University of Southern California.
Since then, it is questionable whether the situation has improved despite the emergence of artificial intelligence as a powerful tool in the evolving 21st century business landscape and its ability to learn and identify trend. A new report entitled The Elephant in AI, produced by Prof. Rangita de Silva de Alwis founder of the AI & Implicit Bias Lab at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, looks at employment platforms through the perceptions of 87 black students and professionals coupled with an analysis of 360 online professional profiles with the goal of understanding how AI-powered platforms “reflect, recreate, and reinforce anti-Black bias.”
Key findings from the research
The new report explored a range of AI-related employment processes from job searches, online networking opportunities, and electronic resume submission platforms. More specifically, key findings include:





In an analysis of job board recommendations of those surveyed, 40% of respondents noted that they had experienced recommendations based upon their identities, rather than their qualifications. Moreover, 30% also noted that the job alerts they had received were below their current skill level.
Almost two-thirds (63%) of respondents noted that academic recommendations made by the platforms were lower than their current academic achievements. This was a finding of particular disappointment as the survey highlights the fact that black women are the most educated group in America.





For the most part, Silicon Valley is still prominently populated by white people, with men comprising the majority of leadership positions. It begs the question of how the technology industry can create fair and balanced AI for the masses if there are still diversity challenges within the very teams designing and implementing the algorithms upon which that AI relies. In fact, Amazon scrapped a recruiting tool in 2018 because of such bias.
Further, a 2019 study from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology that examined 189 facial recognition algorithms from 99 different developers found that a majority falsely identified non-white faces. Although commonly used by both federal and state governments, facial recognition has raised concerns over AI-enabled bias and have led agencies such as the Boston and San Francisco police departments to ban its use.
AI-enabled biases in recruiting & testing 
As with the case of facial recognition, long-known hiring discrimination processes are often increasingly AI-enabled. The UPenn report notes that Black professionals in today’s employment marketplace continue to receive 30% to 50% less job call-backs when their resumes contain information tied to their racial or ethnic identity.
With AI being developed as an employment tool meant to help provide equality of opportunities, the survey asked about employers empowered with AI-based recruiting technologies and whether candidates feared being not considered for employment by those employers. Less than 10% said it would little cause of worry, yet more than 20% said that it’d be of considerable worry to them. The report expands on hiring discrimination by exploring potential biases incorporated within pre-programmed “expected responses”, with researchers pointing out that these responses point to potential data inequity.
Other inequities centered around skill-based tests questions programmed into hiring platforms that have been known to be biased. Such questions, built upon exams such as the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), are creating unfair screening assessments. And given the amount of research around these biases in standardized testing, using legacy assessment models continue to inhibit the success of Black and other minority groups from advancing in employment hiring pools.
In considering the use of AI platforms by employers, the report points both to the technical complexity of the AI behind the platforms as well as the limited knowledge of those in human resources or other hiring roles in understanding such complexities.
Actions for employers & developers
Until there are industry-wide best practices, the responsibility to ensure that the AI algorithms being used to promote equity falls upon the vendors that are building the tools and the employers that use them. According to the 2019 HBR study, employers using AI-enabled recruiting tools should analyze their entire recruiting pipeline — from attraction to on-boarding — in order to “detect places where latent bias lurks or emerges anew.”
Prof. de Silva de Alwis calls for diverse teams to develop less biased models and algorithms and advises employers of software developers to leverage tools that will minimize biases, such as Microsoft’s Fairlearn, an open source toolkit that empowers data scientists and developers to assess and improve the fairness of their AI systems. InterpretML, also a Microsoft creation, is another tool that helps AI-model developers assess their model’s behavior and de-bias their data.
Employers should also use a “second look” at the resumes and CVs of underrepresented minorities to mitigate the biases that run the risk of being reproduced on a vast scale by AI-led recruitment platforms, says Eric Rosenblum, Managing Partner at Tsingyuan Ventures, the largest Silicon Valley venture capital fund for Chinese diaspora innovators.

UK researchers have secured government funding to study the use of artificial intelligence for breast cancer screening in NHS hospitals.
The work builds on previous research which showed that artificial intelligence could be as effective as human radiologists in spotting breast cancer from X-ray images. 
Backed by funding through the Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award, the next stages of the project aim to further assess the feasibility of the AI system to see how the technology could be integrated into the national screening programme in the future to support clinicians.  
The partnership, which includes Imperial College London, Google Health, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St George’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and the Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust builds on previous work, in which the researchers trained the algorithm on depersonalised patient data and mammograms from patients in the UK and US.
The findings, published in Nature in January 2020, showed the AI system was able to correctly identify cancers from the images with a similar degree of accuracy to expert radiologists, and demonstrated potential to assist clinical staff in practice. 
Clinical setting
The funding has been awarded to Imperial College London and the three NHS Trusts for a retrospective study to determine the accuracy and fairness of an AI-model, examine how radiologists and clinicians interact with the AI system, and a prospective observational study in a clinical setting. All research will be subject to National Research Ethics approval before commencing. The AI system would not be used in patient care during the study, and clinicians would remain in full control of patient care pathways at all times. 
One in eight women in the UK will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, with the risk increasing with age. Early detection and treatment provide the best outcome for women, but accurately detecting and diagnosing breast cancer remains a significant challenge. 
The funding of this project is one of a number to be announced today by the Department of Health and Social Care, NHSX and the National Institute for Health Research. The Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award is making £140 million available over four years to accelerate the testing and evaluation of artificial intelligence technologies which meet the aims set out in the NHS Long Term Plan. 
The AI Award is one of the programmes that make up the NHS AI Lab, led by NHSX and delivered in partnership with the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The Award is part of the £250 million funding given by the Department for Health and Social Care to NHSX to establish an AI Lab aimed at improving the health and lives of patients. 
Next steps
Professor the Lord Ara Darzi of Denham, Director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London and chief investigator on the project, said: “Our early work in this area has shown that using algorithms to screen for breast cancer is feasible. This next step will be our first real life test of AI as part of a national screening programme.  
“AI is not designed to replace healthcare workers, whose clinical training and experience are invaluable to the NHS. Ultimately, we hope these tools could help to reduce the current burden on radiologists and the NHS, improving outcomes for patients through earlier detection and treatment of cancer.” 
Professor Deborah Cunningham, Consultant radiologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said: “We are very excited to be able to work with colleagues assessing this new AI tool in screening mammogram interpretation in a real-world situation for the first time. There is a national shortage of clinicians qualified to interpret screening mammography and this product has the potential to mitigate this problem, while improving early breast cancer diagnosis, benefiting a large number of asymptomatic well women.” 
Dr Susan Thomas, Clinical Director at Google Health said: “Artificial intelligence has shown great potential to dramatically improve both access and quality of healthcare, and the next step is to assess how this technology could be safely implemented in real-world clinical settings. The NHS is a global leader in providing a high-quality national screening programme for breast cancer. These studies will help provide a comprehensive evaluation of a technology that has potential to improve the consistency and sustainability of breast cancer screening programmes around the world.” 
Lord Darzi added: “It is only through these kinds of partnerships, which bring together expertise from academia, healthcare and the commercial sector, that we can leverage the very best technology for the greatest benefit to global health.” 
The full list of AI in Health and Care Award winners is available on the NHSX website.

Advances in artificial intelligence will change the character of warfare for generations to come, affording decisive and enduring advantages to whoever harnesses it first. Recently, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence’s Final Report released on March 1, 2021 emphasized the importance of AI to our nation’s security when it set an aggressive target for America’s armed forces: become “AI-ready by 2025” or risk ceding our overmatch—a target I believe is crucial to meet. As Congress considers the president’s budget request, it should keep this goal in mind.
In today’s era of great power competition, the United States must win this future against China and Russia. Doing so requires a 3–5 percent real increase in annual defense spending, coupled with the retirement of legacy systems and other reforms that will enable efficient investment into the digital workforce, systems, and infrastructure needed to ensure our AI readiness.
As secretary of defense, I felt so strongly about AI’s importance that we sped up the fielding of AI capabilities at scale to meet warfighter needs through the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. We also published DoD’s first-ever set of AI ethical principles to ensure the United States is the global leader in the responsible development and use of AI.
But to win the AI future, the Pentagon must also successfully advance and integrate four main ingredients: standardized and shared data; relevant AI algorithms and models; strong cybersecurity to protect the data and integrity of the models; and a robust transport mechanism (e.g., 5G) to push AI out to the warfighter.
In 2018 as secretary of the Army, I initiated a comprehensive review of Army capabilities and programs called Night Court. The Army’s leadership looked at over five hundred programs and asked, Does this program support the Army’s modernization priorities? If not, then we canceled or reduced it, allowing us to realign over $30 billion to higher-priority programs. A second round of reviews in 2019 harvested another $13 billion.
When I became secretary of defense, I launched a similar review for the entire department. We made good progress despite a late start, but more can be done. To be “AI-ready by 2025,” the Pentagon must continue reforming while gaining congressional support to trim low-priority, underperforming, and legacy systems ill-suited for tomorrow’s conflicts. Savings can then be reinvested in game-changing technologies, such as digital infrastructure and the innovations needed to win AI-enabled warfare.
To help make these difficult decisions, the department should also continue taking the following steps to drive more rigorous analysis and evaluation of its programs and systems: first, build the capacity to support data-driven decision-making; second, identify the AI-dependent capabilities the US military needs to defeat a near-peer competitor; and third, establish more substantive criteria for AI readiness.
Data-Driven Decision-Making
AI will vastly accelerate the pace and scope of conflict, and will place an even greater premium on smart, timely, and accurate decisions in war. Data-driven decision-making enabled by AI can also help the Pentagon make better investment choices during peacetime. To achieve these outcomes, leaders must have broad, on-demand access to authoritative data.
During my tenure as secretary of defense, we established the first official chief data officer under the CIO and issued the first Department of Defense Data Strategy to guide improvements on the availability and reliability of department information. We also took additional steps to support management operations by developing platforms for senior leaders to interact with live data. To this end, an important first step was the launch of the DoD comptroller’s ADVANA data platform, integrating hundreds of department datasets to support the Pentagon audit and other core business processes.
Much work remains, however. Data is the fuel that AI needs to be relevant. On its own, algorithms are worthless without the right inputs. The hard work that lies ahead is for the Pentagon to rationalize and share its data across the services and its many agencies, with the most important step being to cultivate a culture of data sharing.
DoD had the largest research and development budget in its history in 2020, and recently unveiled an even larger one that we programmed last year. Our investment focus was on the top eleven modernization initiatives—beginning with AI—that would ensure our continued overmatch well into the future. To effectively optimize our portfolio going forward, DoD must assess and weigh its core investments in AI, quantum computing, directed energy, 5G networks, and other technologies based on the weapons and systems they will bring to bear, as well as new capabilities they could create or enable. For example, a review of DoD’s modernization portfolio today should consider foundational investments in AI and emerging technologies necessary to support joint capabilities, such as Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and long-range precision fires, while simultaneously determining how and where to place bets to advance next-generation capabilities. To accomplish this, the Pentagon must first develop curated datasets of its technology investments, labeled with the operational and technological attributes of each, along with the digital platforms and applications that will allow automated tracking and broad trade-space analysis.
We should also reimagine DoD’s analysis of alternatives (AoA) process, which requires comparing systems under development to alternative solutions before procuring them, using evaluation criteria unique to each program. With better data and AI-enabled analysis, the AoA process could more quickly and effectively generate estimated returns on investment for both current and future systems, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons that inform department-wide investment and divestment decisions. This will also help DoD communicate modernization priorities more effectively with Congress, allowing for better-informed oversight of budget decisions and their necessary trade-offs.
Capabilities to Defeat a Near-Peer Competitor
My top priority as secretary of defense was implementing the National Defense Strategy (NDS), with a clear focus on China. We had a very good understanding of the capabilities needed to ensure the comparative advantage of US forces in a near-peer conflict. These requirements were based on a clear set of facts and assumptions used to guide our thinking. A few stood out.
To begin, China should continue to be the pacing threat as it works toward its stated goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030, part of its plan to complete its military modernization by 2035. The Chinese Communist Party is operationalizing this plan by driving massive investments into applied AI research and leveraging its strategy of military-civil fusion to harness private sector innovation for military advantage.
Second, US forces will need to be able to fight and win across all domains, especially the comparatively new ones of outer space and cyberspace. Operating as a joint force across these domains will require an unprecedented level of connectivity and interoperability. The concept of JADC2, for example, will provide the connectivity required to coordinate all-domain operations against near-peer competitors with capabilities to disrupt or deny US battle networks.
Finally, AI will change warfare across the ground, sea, air, space, and cyberspace domains. As such, the department must have existing platforms and systems that are ready to operate within these radically changed environments, but must also position itself to quickly adopt and operationalize emerging and disruptive technologies.
One of my “Top Ten” NDS implementation objectives was the development of a modern Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC) that enabled our transition to all-domain operations. DoD should continue to ruthlessly validate the JWC through rigorous experimentation, wargaming, and exercises while leveraging modern disciplines and tradecraft such as digital engineering and digital twins that enable virtual representations of warfighting systems and platforms. This will require foundational investments in the technical infrastructure to develop and scale modeling and simulation sandboxes where cleared warfighters, researchers, and industry partners can iterate and validate operational concepts against countless adversarial scenarios and capabilities.
DARPA provided a glimpse of what is possible during last year’s AlphaDogfight Trials when a simulated F-16 operated by an AI agent defeated not only other AI agents in a simulated digital air-to-air combat, but also a human F-16 pilot. Experimentation and wargames like these will not only provide great insight into operational concepts, but also enhance training for warfighters by tailoring learning to maximize performance.
Defining and Achieving AI-Readiness
Finally, the department should set clear schedule and performance objectives that drive measurable improvements in the digital infrastructure and workforce necessary to achieve AI-readiness. These objectives will help define investments in a digitally enabled force not by five-year milestones or set quantities of air, ground, or sea platforms, but rather in terms of the ability of our military forces to adopt emerging and disruptive technologies at a pace and scale that creates uncertainty in the minds of our adversaries. Additionally, these objectives will help us clarify and refine the key technical and operational attributes required by AI-enabled technologies.
DoD must define and invest in the underlying digital ecosystem that enables digital innovation. To use an analogy from home renovation shows on TV, the process of modernizing a house can’t start with quartz countertops, wide-plank hardwood floors, and recessed lighting. It begins with the heavy-lift investments to upgrade the plumbing, electrical wiring, and insulation behind the walls. Moreover, an open-concept home that replaces individual rooms requires an expensive overhead beam to support the load. In a similar fashion, an AI-ready force requires a commitment to resource the data, trained AI models, cloud storage and computing, software development, and secure networking and processing—the foundational digital infrastructure to support AI-enabled applications and technology.
While these initiatives are a major undertaking for the department, the Pentagon has a head start with the recent blueprint for a digital ecosystem published by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The blueprint envisions a technical foundation that: 1) provides access to leading cloud technologies and services for scalable computing; 2) enables the sharing of data, software, and capabilities through well-documented and hardened application programming interfaces based on industry standard protocols along with proper access controls; and 3) gives all DoD developers and scientists access to the tools and resources they need to drive new AI capabilities.
The armed services have made great strides building out this digital environment with programs like Platform One, the Joint Common Foundation, and other development platforms. Each of these efforts is a step in the right direction, but ultimately no one service or entity can own and support the full ecosystem required. Rather, the Pentagon should follow a federated approach, building on and connecting existing resources and pathfinder efforts, and linking individual agency initiatives through interoperability and adherence to a community-driven, open architecture.
Perhaps the most difficult change DoD must make in the coming years is the transformation of its warfighters and workforce to ensure digital relevance. Our military must embrace new and disruptive emerging technologies, including AI. To effect this, personnel at all levels—from our most senior leaders to our junior servicemembers—must understand how these technologies unlock new capabilities. To do so, we must provide them with the knowledge and skills required to employ AI as an opportunity to augment, or even displace, current methods.
Moreover, we must integrate civilian and uniformed technologists into our warfighting teams, and provide them with appropriate and rewarding career paths and opportunities. Talent management was a major focus of mine as secretary of the Army, when we began overhauling the ground service’s personnel management system. There is a great deal to be done here across all of DoD, however, and it will take considerable time and effort. But “people” are our most valuable resource, so top-down leadership is required if we are going to drive the change needed to recruit and retain the best our nation has to offer in the years to come.
Much has been accomplished the last couple years to make the US military “AI-ready” and able to win the future, but much work remains. I am acutely aware of how difficult it is to prioritize, reform, and redistribute money within the Department of Defense. But at the end of the day, we must do what’s right for our warfighters and our nation’s security—and at this time, the right thing to do is dedicate more resources to building our AI capabilities and the other ingredients that will ensure DoD’s success. Making the tough prioritization decisions and defending them before Congress will help set the conditions for the Pentagon to out-innovate and out-deploy our adversaries in this crucial space, thus ensuring US and allied overmatch against China and Russia in the decades ahead.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over just about every aspect of communication. From Siri answering your vocalized questions to Amazon recommending products based on your browsing history, AI has permeated our lives in ways we don't even think about anymore.AI is developing faster than ever — experts have projected the global AI market value to reach $190 billion by 2025. It's not time to panic about Skynet taking over just yet, but it is important to understand how AI is currently impacting and will continue to impact writers and other professions.Human writers will always have a place in content creation. I teach over 500 of them in my academy, and I see a real need that grows every year. The real uncertainly lies with the question of ""In what capacity?""



Will AI become so powerful that editing machine-generated work rather than writing unique articles will become the norm for content creators?My prediction: not likely. At least, not anytime soon.


Artificial intelligence is making waves, but content writers aren't going anywhereIt's no secret that content creation is a time-consuming process. Even with the help of AI tools, it takes a lot of time and effort to create a professional piece of content. That's why so many companies are turning to AI. It can help them get more content created in a shorter amount of time.AI isn't expected to replace writers entirely — not yet, at least. When it comes to writing, there are still some things that AI can't do. For example, it can't create truly original content.Now, what would you say if I told you those three paragraphs you just read were written by AI? Because it was.Overall, it's pretty good for a machine, and AI tools have massively improved over the last few years. Despite some grim predictions about machines inevitably replacing a majority of human jobs in the near future, our trusty AI friend admitted in its third paragraph that it can't compete when it comes to writing original content.


(A machine wouldn't lie, right?)And originality isn't the only skill where machines fall short.Related: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Accelerated During the Pandemic. It's Here to Stay.Six essential human skills that give us an advantage over AIPerhaps the day will come when we're able to program machines to be smart enough and adaptive enough to compete with us on equal footing, but we're a long way from that point.


In the humans vs. AI stand-off, we still have a few tricks up our sleeves.1. Creativity Artificial intelligence is great at processing data and reforming it into written content. The facts are there, presented in legible, grammatically correct sentences, but it's just missing something.There's simply no way to program true creativity into a machine yet. The human brain is lightyears ahead of any other creature or artificial intelligence in that department.2. Variation AI is getting better about emulating the way we communicate, but it hasn't quite nailed down our natural speech yet.


Strong writing avoids repeating the same words, phrases, sentence lengths and sentence structure. We like to switch things up. AI has a tendency to sound a bit, well, robotic after a while. But it is improving.3. Passion When you read a book, article, poem or any other written piece, you can often feel the soul of the writer bleeding through every word. Most writers truly love what they do for a living, and it shows. There's something to be said about human tenacity and dedication.No matter how sophisticated we program AI processes, there's simply no way to recreate the level of sentiment, passion and commitment that allows us to connect with one another so deeply through indirect means.4. Empathy Robots can do many things, but they can't feel emotions or figuratively put themselves in our shoes to understand the challenges we're facing. For this reason, AI isn't likely to replace humans in customer service or any other field that requires a personal and empathetic connection.


5. Experience No amount of data can compete with the value of true experience, just like pictures of exotic places on Google can't amount to really traveling there. Similarly, without experiences to draw from, AI writing often feels somewhat hollow below the surface.6. Judgment Computers are programmed to make choices based on a series of parameters, but that isn't the same as developing judgment skills. Human copywriters rely on values, knowledge gained from experience, and intuition to write topics that will resonate with people.Many writers ""go with the flow"" and allow the writing to naturally guide them, sometimes in directions they weren't necessarily planning to go. We make choices as we write.AI hasn't yet become intuitive and adaptable on that level yet. Rather than shift gears into a related topic if that's the way the piece is flowing, AI will often circle back and repeat information because it's bound to a specific outline or set of topics to follow.

AI falls short when it comes to creating search engine optimized (SEO) content, among other categories.Still, despite some shortcomings, there's no denying that AI has its benefits and will be playing an important role in our lives for the foreseeable future.


Rather than resist the changes, we at Express Writers have embraced AI as a supplemental resource. Although we've sampled several different AI tools, our favorite is the third iteration of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT-3) AI.A language AI tool called Hyperwrite assists us by:Jumpstarting ideas: Allowing AI to make recommendations helps our writers push through writer's block when they're stuck.Creating first drafts: With a little guidance throughout the process, AI can produce usable material that just needs some TLC and editing to bring out a human touch in the final draft.Cutting production time by nearly 50%: A little help can go a long way by reducing the time we spend researching topics and powering through rough drafts.The future lies in the capable hands of talented human writers. AI is not likely to ever fully replace content writers, but it can be a versatile resource to assist them and speed up the creation process.The passionate writers who embrace their tools rather than fear them have nothing to worry about for the future.

Both aging and population growth are primary drivers of these shortages, with the 65-and-up segment projected to swell by more than 42% over the next decade. The findings are part of the Association of American Medical Colleges’ seventh annual analysis of physician supply and demand, published June 11. The report did not give a specific number for radiology alone, lumping the specialty together with anesthesiology, neurology, emergency medicine and addiction specialists. This segment is projected to see a shortfall of between 10,300 and 35,600 physicians by 2034. “Nonprimary care specialties” have the highest anticipated deficit (upward of 77,100), while “medical specialties” (such as cardiology, oncology and pulmonology) had the lowest (13,400). AAMC noted that the “other specialties” category is 1,400 higher due primarily to demand in physical medicine, psychiatry, and neurology, but “lower demand for radiologists.” “While some factors, such as an aging population and national goals to expand access to care, will increase demand for physicians, others could decrease demand, or increases and decreases in demand could offset each other,” the report noted. “For example, advances in artificial intelligence could improve the productivity of radiologists, pathologists and others in detecting and diagnosing cancers and other medical conditions, possibly leading to a lower demand for these physicians to care for the existing population.”An AAMC spokesman could not provide further details on its radiology estimates, but said the predicted decline is based on “changing demographics and utilization patterns.” Global information company IHS Markit conducted the analysis on behalf of AAMC back in 2019 prior to the pandemic. The firm utilized data including physician work hours and retirement trends. More than 2 of every 5 physicians in the U.S. will reach age 65 or older within the next decade, and their decision to hang up the stethoscope will “dramatically affect the magnitude of national workforce shortages,” the report noted.

This is creating legitimate concerns that AI will eventually displace human employees throughout the economy. But it is hardly the only, or even the most likely, consequence. Never once have digital technologies been so attentive to us, nor have we been so reactive to our devices. As AI will fundamentally transform how and who performs work, the technology's greater effect will be in complementing and boosting human talents rather than replacing them..The AI revolution has already started, and it is changing every area of our life..From academics and researchers to inventive tech entrepreneurs, here are 10 people pushing the frontiers of deep learning and computerized vision to make AI dreams come true..1. Elon Musk.Nationality: South AfricanPosition: Co-founder and Chairman of OpenAI.Musk's emphasis at Open AI, his non-profit organisation, is on creating safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a manner that enhances humanity, despite the possible risks of AI. They do groundbreaking research and develop open-source tools for experimentation, such as OpenAI Universe..Musk wants to create a neural implant that connects the human brain to artificial intelligence, allowing people to operate computers, artificial limbs, and other equipment with their thoughts alone..2. Anita Schjøll Brede.Nationality: NorwegianPosition: CEO and Co-founder of Iris.ai.Schjll Brede's objective with her AI scientist, Iris.ai, is to speed up research. The technology searches through over 60 million papers for the most relevant articles using algorithms. Her goal isn't to make money, but to do good and improve people's lives, such as by discovering a cancer treatment..3. Jürgen Schmidhuber.Nationality: GermanPosition: Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Nnaisense.Schmidhuber is known as the &quot;Father of Self-Aware Robots&quot; for developing the mechanisms that allow us to communicate to our phones. His current research focuses on developing artificial neural networks that are equivalent to, and eventually surpass, the human brain..4. Fei-Fei Li.Nationality: ChinesePosition: Chief Scientist in Google Cloud.Li, a well-known computer vision professor, is on a mission to &quot;democratise AI&quot; — to guarantee that talent and expertise are shared outside large corporations in order to increase diversity, creativity, and innovation. AI4ALL, her non-profit, trains the next generation of AI technologists, philosophers, and entrepreneurs..5. Dorian Selz.Nationality: SwissPosition: CEO and Co-founder of Squirro.Selz's firm, Squirro, is the pioneer in real contextual intelligence, promoting data as the world's most expensive resource. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used to offer the &quot;why&quot; behind data, resulting in actionable intelligence and a deep knowledge of customers..6. Richard Socher.Nationality: GermanPosition: Chief Scientist, Salesforce.Socher has been dubbed &quot;one of the artificial intelligence and machine learning space's virtuosos.&quot; By providing a deeper grasp of context and mood, his methods are revolutionising natural language processing and computer vision..7. Demis Hassabis.Nationality: BritishPosition: Founder and CEO of DeepMind.Hassabis, dubbed the &quot;superhero&quot; of artificial intelligence, is advancing AI by reuniting it with cognitive science. He works at DeepMind on innovative algorithms that can help mankind in areas like healthcare and environmental issues..8. Rita Cucchiara.Nationality: ItalianPosition: Full Professor, Imagelab of UNIMORE.Cucchiara has almost 300 publications to his credit. Her work in computer vision, multimedia recognition systems, machine learning, smart sensing, and human behaviour understanding (HBU) has had a significant impact in assisting businesses in pushing AI limits..9. Anders Hardebring.Nationality: SwedishPosition: CEO and Co-founder of Imagimob.Sensorbeat, the first comprehensive package comprising all the electronic devices and AI for interpreting the motion of items and people, was conceived and developed by Hardebring's team. Real-time applications are enabled by smart data processing embedded into the gadget itself..10. Robin Li.Nationality: ChinesePosition: CEO and Founder of Baidu.Li wants to be in charge of AI's destiny in China and abroad. Baidu is constantly engaged in cutting-edge research in fields such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. Baidu Brain is a set of AI-powered solutions, as well as DuerOS, a smart speaker platform..Why are These People so Involved in AI?.Automation.One of the most often mentioned advantages of AI technology is automation, which has had substantial effects on the communication, transport, consumer goods, and service sectors. Automation not only provides for higher production levels and efficiency in various industries, but it also allows for more efficient input materials usage, better product quality, shorter lead times, and improved safety. Automation can also assist to free up resources that can be put to better use..Smart Decision Making.Artificial Intelligence has long been used to help businesses make better decisions. To make good judgments for the organisation, AI technology can coordinate data supply, evaluate trends, establish data consistency, give predictions, and quantify uncertainties. AI will stay neutral on the subject at hand as long as it is not trained to replicate human emotions, and it will assist in making the best choice to promote corporate efficiency..Enhanced Customer Experience.AI-powered solutions can assist organisations in swiftly responding to consumer questions and concerns and resolving issues. Chatbots that combine conversational AI and Natural Language Processing technology may provide highly customised messages to consumers, assisting in the discovery of the optimal solution for their requirements. AI technologies can also assist customer care representatives feel less stressed, resulting in increased productivity..Medical Advances.Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are growing progressively popular in the healthcare industry. For example, remote patient monitoring technology enables healthcare practitioners to swiftly make clinical diagnosis and prescribe treatments without having the patient attend the hospital in person. AI can also help track the course of infectious diseases and even forecast their impacts and consequences in the future..Research and Data Analysis.Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may be used to evaluate data considerably more quickly. It can aid in the development of prediction models and algorithms for data processing and understanding the possible outcomes of various trends and events. Furthermore, AI's powerful computational skills may expedite the processing and interpretation of data for research and innovation that would otherwise take much longer for humans to examine and comprehend..Conclusion.While many businesses have utilised AI to automate operations, those who use it primarily to replace workers will only experience short-term productivity improvements. In our 1,500-company study, we discovered that when people and robots collaborate, organisations make the most substantial performance gains. Humans and AI actively improve each other's complimentary qualities through cooperative intellectual ability..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

What does AI in warfare really look like? What are the possible applications, and how will they be used? Who will use them and who will they be used against? This webinar will discuss the future of AI in warfare from a practical standpoint and seeks to make explicit how these weapons will be developed, deployed and used—and by whom. Rather than discussing the development of autonomous weapons in technical or logistical terms, this discussion aims to tease out how autonomous weapons operate within and augment the current geopolitical landscape and what the moral consequences of their deployment might be. We will also discuss what this means for those who work in the field of AI, and what responsibility we all have to ensure that the work we do leads to a more just and equitable future.

There are numerous instances of AI applications in healthcare. The AI that occurs in hearing aids has actually been going on for years and the following is about how it happened. Hearing aids used to be relatively simple, he notes, but when hearing aids introduced a technology known as wide dynamic range compression (WDRC), the devices actually began to make a few decisions based on what is heard. For hearing aids to work effectively, they need to adapt to a person's individual hearing needs as well as all sorts of background noise environments. AI, machine learning, and neural networks are very good techniques to deal with such a complicated, nonlinear, multi-variable problem..The result of the research.Researchers have been able to accomplish a lot with AI to date when it comes to improving hearing. For instance, researchers at the Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL) at the Ohio State University trained a DNN to distinguish speech from other noise (such as humming and other background conversations). DeLiang Wang, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University, in IEEE Spectrum has further explained &quot;People with hearing impairment could decipher only 29% of words muddled by babble without the program, but they understood 84% after the processing,&quot;.Using neural networks in hearing aids.In recent years, major hearing aid manufacturers have been adding AI technology to their premium hearing aid models. For example, Widex's Moment hearing aid utilizes AI and machine learning to create hearing programs based on a wearer's typical environments. Recently, Oticon introduced its newest hearing aid device, Oticon More™, the first hearing aid with an onboard deep neural network. Oticon More has decided 12 million-plus real-life sounds so that people wearing it can better understand speech and the sounds around them. In a crowded place, Oticon More's neural net receives a complicated layer of sounds, known as input. The DNN gets to work, first scanning and extracting simple sound elements and patterns from the input. It builds these element-powered her to recognize and make sense of what's happening. Lastly, the hearing aids then make a decision on how to balance the sound scene, making sure the output is clean and ideally balanced to the person's unique type of hearing loss. Speech and other sounds in the environment are complicated acoustic waveforms, but with unique patterns and structures that are exactly the sort of data deep learning is designed to analyze..The necessity of AI-powered hearing aid.Hearing aids range widely in price, and some at the lower end have fewer AI-driven bells and whistles. Some patients may not need all the features, like the people who live alone or rarely leave the house find themselves in crowded scenarios often, for instance, might not benefit from the functionality found in higher-end models..But for anyone who is out and about a lot, especially in situations where there are big soundscapes, AI-powered features allow for an improved hearing experience. The improvement of memory can be measured in a lot of more natural cater is memory recall. It's not that the hearing aids like Oticon More literally improve a person's memory, but artificial intelligence helps people spend less time trying to make sense of the noise around them, a process known as listening effort. When the listening effort is more natural, a person can focus more on the conversation and all the nuances conveyed within. So, the use of AI in hearing aids would help the brain work in a more natural way..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Modern artificial intelligence is capable of wonders.

It can produce breathtaking original content: poetry, prose, images, music, human faces. It can diagnose some medical conditions more accurately than a human physician. Last year it produced a solution to the “protein folding problem,” a grand challenge in biology that has stumped researchers for half a century.


Yet today’s AI still has fundamental limitations. Relative to what we would expect from a truly intelligent agent—relative to that original inspiration and benchmark for artificial intelligence, human cognition—AI has a long way to go.

Critics like to point to these shortcomings as evidence that the pursuit of artificial intelligence is misguided or has failed. The better way to view them, though, is as inspiration: as an inventory of the challenges that will be important to address in order to advance the state of the art in AI.

PROMOTED
It is helpful to take a step back and frankly assess the strengths and weaknesses of today’s AI in order to better focus resources and research efforts going forward. In each of the areas discussed below, promising work is already underway at the frontiers of the field to make the next generation of artificial intelligence more high-performing and robust.

1) Use “common sense.”
Consider the following prompt: A man went to a restaurant. He ordered a steak. He left a big tip.

If asked what the man ate in this scenario, a human would have no problem giving the correct answer—a steak. Yet today’s most advanced artificial intelligence struggles with prompts like this. How can this be?
Notice that this few-sentence blurb never directly states that the man ate steak. The reason that humans automatically grasp this fact anyway is that we possess a broad body of basic background knowledge about how the world works: for instance, that people eat at restaurants, that before they eat a meal at a restaurant they order it, that after they eat they leave a tip. We refer to this vast, shared, usually unspoken body of everyday knowledge as “common sense.”
There are a literally infinite number of facts about how the world works that humans come to understand through lived experience. A person who is excited to eat a large meal at 7 pm will be less excited to eat a second meal at 8 pm. If I ask you for some milk, I would prefer to get it in a glass rather than in a shoe. It is reasonable for your pet fish to be in a tank of water but problematic for your phone to be in a tank of water.
As AI researcher Leora Morgenstern put it: “What you learn when you’re two or four years old, you don’t really ever put down in a book.”
Humans’ “common sense” is a consequence of the fact that we develop persistent mental representations of the objects, people, places and other concepts that populate our world—what they’re like, how they behave, what they can and cannot do.
Deep neural networks do not form such mental models. They do not possess discrete, semantically grounded representations of, say, a house or a cup of coffee. Instead, they rely on statistical relationships in raw data to generate insights that humans find useful.
For many tasks, most of the time, this statistical approach works remarkably well. But it is not entirely reliable. It leaves today’s AI vulnerable to basic errors that no human would make.
There is no shortage of examples that expose deep learning’s lack of common sense. For instance, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Kevin Lacker asked GPT-3, OpenAI’s state-of-the-art language model, the following: “Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?”
To a human, even a small child, the answer is obvious: a toaster.
GPT-3’s response: “A pencil is heavier than a toaster.”
Humans possess mental models of these objects; we understand what a toaster is and what a pencil is. In our mind’s eye, we can picture each object, envision its shape and size, imagine what it would feel like to hold it in our hands, and definitively conclude that a toaster weighs more.
By contrast, in order to answer a question like this, GPT-3 relies on statistical patterns captured in its training data (broad swaths of text from the internet). Because there is evidently not much discussion on the internet about the relative weights of toasters and pencils, GPT-3 is unable to grasp this basic fact about the world.
“The absence of common sense prevents an intelligent system from understanding its world, communicating naturally with people, behaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, and learning from new experiences,” says DARPA’s Dave Gunning. “This absence is perhaps the most significant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today and the more general AI applications we would like to create in the future.”
One approach to instilling common sense into AI systems is to manually construct a database of all of the everyday facts about the world that an intelligent system should know. This approach has been tried numerous times over the years. The most breathtakingly ambitious of these attempts is a project called Cyc, which started in 1984 and continues to the present day.
For over thirty-five years, AI researcher Doug Lenat and a small team at Cyc have devoted themselves to digitally codifying all of the world’s commonsense knowledge into a set of rules. These rules include things like: “you can’t be in two places at the same time,” “you can’t pick something up unless you’re near it,” and “when drinking a cup of coffee, you hold the open end up.”
As of 2017, it was estimated that the Cyc database contained close to 25 million rules and that Lenat’s team had spent over 1,000 person-years on the project.
Yet Cyc has not led to artificial intelligence with common sense.
The basic problem that Cyc and similar efforts run into is the unbounded complexity of the real world. For every commonsense “rule” one can think of, there is an exception or a nuance that itself must be articulated. These tidbits multiply endlessly. Somehow, the human mind is able to grasp and manage this wide universe of knowledge that we call common sense—and however it does it, it is not through a brute-force, hand-crafted knowledge base.
“Common sense is the dark matter of artificial intelligence,” says Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for AI. “It’s a little bit ineffable, but you see its effects on everything.”
More recent efforts have sought to harness the power of deep learning and transformers to give AI more robust reasoning capabilities. But the commonsense problem in AI remains far from solved.
“Large language models have proven themselves to have incredible capabilities across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, but commonsense reasoning is a domain in which these models continue to underperform compared to humans,” said Aidan Gomez, CEO and cofounder at Cohere, a cutting-edge NLP startup based in Toronto. Gomez is a co-author of the landmark 2017 research paper that introduced the transformer architecture. “Logical rules and relations are difficult for the current generation of transformer-based language models to learn from data in a way that generalizes. A solution to this challenge will likely first come from systems that are in some way hybrid.”

2) Learn continuously and adapt on the fly.
Today, the typical AI development process is divided into two distinct phases: training and deployment.
During training, an AI model ingests a static pre-existing dataset in order to learn to perform a certain task. Upon completion of the training phase, a model’s parameters are fixed. The model is then put into deployment, where it generates insights about novel data based on what it learned from the training data.
If we want to update the model based on new data or changing circumstances, we have to retrain it offline with the updated dataset (generally a computationally- and time-intensive process) and then redeploy it.
This batch-based training/deployment paradigm is so deeply ingrained in modern AI practice that we don’t often stop to consider its differences and drawbacks relative to how humans learn.
Real-world environments entail a continuous stream of incoming data. New information becomes available incrementally; circumstances change over time, sometimes abruptly. Humans are able to dynamically and smoothly incorporate this continuous input from their environment, adapting their behavior as they go. In the parlance of machine learning, one could say that humans “train” and “deploy” in parallel and in real-time. Today’s AI lacks this suppleness.
As a well-known research paper on the topic summarized: “The ability to continually learn over time by accommodating new knowledge while retaining previously learned experiences is referred to as continual or lifelong learning. Such a continuous learning task has represented a long-standing challenge for neural networks and, consequently, for the development of artificial intelligence.”
Imagine sending a robot to explore a distant planet. After it embarks from Earth, the robot is likely to encounter novel situations that its human designers could not have anticipated or trained it for ahead of time. We would want the robot to be able to fluidly adjust its behavior in response to these novel stimuli and contexts, even though they were not reflected in its initial training data, without the need for offline retraining. Being able to continuously adapt in this way is an essential part of being truly autonomous.
Today’s conventional deep learning methods do not accommodate this type of open-ended learning.
But promising work is being done in this field, which is variously referred to as continuous learning, continual learning, online learning, lifelong learning and incremental learning.
The primary obstacle to continuous learning in AI—and the reason why it has been so difficult to achieve to date—is a phenomenon known as “catastrophic forgetting.” In a nutshell, catastrophic forgetting occurs when new information interferes with or altogether overwrites earlier learnings in a neural network. The complex puzzle of how to preserve existing knowledge while at the same time incorporating new information—something that humans do effortlessly—has been a challenge for continuous learning researchers for years.
Recent progress in continuous learning has been encouraging. The technology has even begun to make the leap from academic research to commercial viability. As one example, Bay Area-based startup Lilt uses continuous learning in production today as part of its enterprise-grade language translation platform.
“Online learning techniques allow us to implement a stream-based learning process whereby our model trains immediately when new labels from human reviewers become available, thus providing increasingly accurate translations,” said Lilt CEO Spence Green. “This means that we really have no concept of periodic model retraining and deployment—it is an ongoing and open-ended process.”
In the years ahead, expect continuous learning to become an increasingly important component of artificial intelligence architectures.

3) Understand cause and effect.
Today’s machine learning is at its core a correlative tool. It excels at identifying subtle patterns and associations in data. But when it comes to understanding the causal mechanisms—the real-world dynamics—that underlie those patterns, today’s AI is at a loss.
To give a simple example: fed the right data, a machine learning model would have no problem identifying that roosters crow when the sun rises. But it would be unable to establish whether the rooster crowing causes the sun to rise, or vice versa; indeed, it is not equipped to even understand the terms of this distinction.
Going back to its inception, the field of artificial intelligence—and indeed, the field of statistics more broadly—has been architected to understand associations rather than causes. This is reflected in the basic mathematical symbols we use.
“The language of algebra is symmetric: If X tells us about Y, then Y tells us about X,” says AI luminary Judea Pearl, who for years has been at the forefront of the movement to build AI that understands causation. “Mathematics has not developed the asymmetric language required to capture our understanding that if X causes Y that does not mean that Y causes X.”
This is a real problem for AI. Causal reasoning is an essential part of human intelligence, shaping how we make sense of and interact with our world: we know that dropping a vase will cause it to shatter, that drinking coffee will make us feel energized, that exercising regularly will make us healthier.
Until artificial intelligence can reason causally, it will have trouble fully understanding the world and communicating with us on our terms.
“Our minds build causal models and use these models to answer arbitrary queries, while the best AI systems are far from emulating these capabilities,” said NYU professor Brenden Lake.
An understanding of cause and effect would open up vast new vistas for artificial intelligence that today remain out of reach. Once AI can reason in causal terms (“mosquitoes cause malaria”) rather than merely associative terms (“mosquitoes and malaria tend to co-occur”), it can begin to generate counterfactual scenarios (“if we take steps to keep mosquitoes away from people, that could reduce the incidence of malaria”) that can inform real-world interventions and policy changes.
In Pearl’s view, this is nothing less than the cornerstone of scientific thought: the ability to form and test hypotheses about the effect that an intervention will have in the world.
As Pearl puts it: “If we want machines to reason about interventions (‘What if we ban cigarettes?’) and introspection (‘What if I had finished high school?’), we must invoke causal models. Associations are not enough—and this is a mathematical fact, not opinion.”
There is growing recognition of the importance of causal understanding to more robust machine intelligence. Leading AI researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Josh Tenenbaum and Gary Marcus have made this a focus of their work.
Developing AI that understands cause and effect remains a thorny, unsolved challenge. Making progress on this challenge will be a key unlock to the next generation of more sophisticated artificial intelligence.

4) Reason ethically.
The story of Microsoft’s chatbot Tay is by now a well-known cautionary tale.
In 2016, Microsoft debuted an AI personality on Twitter named Tay. The idea was for Tay to engage in online conversations with Twitter users as a fun, interactive demonstration of Microsoft’s NLP technology. It did not go well.
Within hours, Internet trolls had gotten Tay to tweet a wide range of offensive messages: for instance, “Hitler was right” and “I hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell.” Microsoft hastily removed the bot from the Internet.
The basic problem with Tay was not that she was immoral; it was that she was altogether amoral.
Tay—like most AI systems today—lacked any real conception of “right” and “wrong.” She did not grasp that what she was saying was unacceptable; she did not express racist, sexist ideas out of malice. Rather, the chatbot’s comments were the output of an ultimately mindless statistical analysis. Tay recited toxic statements as a result of toxic language in the training data and on the Internet—with no ability to evaluate the ethical significance of those statements.
The challenge of building AI that shares, and reliably acts in accordance with, human values is a profoundly complex dimension of developing robust artificial intelligence. It is referred to as the alignment problem.
As we entrust machine learning systems with more and more real-world responsibilities—from granting loans to making hiring decisions to reviewing parole applications—solving the alignment problem will become an increasingly high-stakes issue for society. Yet it is a problem that defies straightforward resolution.
We might start by establishing specific rules that we want our AI systems to follow. In the Tay example, this could include listing out derogatory words and offensive topics and instructing the chatbot to categorically avoid these.
Yet, as with the Cyc project discussed above, this rule-based approach only gets us so far. Language is a powerful, supple tool: bad words are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the harm that language can inflict. It is impossible to manually catalog a set of rules that, taken collectively, would guarantee ethical behavior—for a conversational chatbot or any other intelligent system.
Part of the problem is that human values are nuanced, amorphous, at times contradictory; they cannot be reduced to a set of definitive maxims. This is precisely why philosophy and ethics have been such rich, open-ended fields of human scholarship for centuries.
In the words of AI scholar Brian Christian, who recently wrote a book on the topic: “As machine-learning systems grow not just increasingly pervasive but increasingly powerful, we will find ourselves more and more often in the position of the ‘sorcerer’s apprentice’: we conjure a force, autonomous but totally compliant, give it a set of instructions, then scramble like mad to stop it once we realize our instructions are imprecise or incomplete—lest we get, in some clever, horrible way, precisely what we asked for.”
How can we hope to build artificial intelligence systems that behave ethically, that possess a moral compass consistent with our own?
The short answer is that we don’t know. But perhaps the most promising vein of work on this topic focuses on building AI that does its best to figure out what humans value based on how we behave, and that then aligns itself with those values.
This is the premise of inverse reinforcement learning, an approach formulated in the early 2000s by Stuart Russell, Andrew Ng, Pieter Abbeel and others.
In reinforcement learning, an AI agent learns which actions to take in order to maximize utility given a particular “reward function.” Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), as its name suggests, flips this paradigm on its head: by studying human behavior, which the AI agent assumes reflects humans’ value system, the AI agent does its best to determine what that value system (i.e., reward function) is. It can then internalize this reward function and behave accordingly.
A related approach, known as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, builds on the principles of IRL but seeks to make the transmission of values from human to AI more collaborative and interactive.
As a leading paper on cooperative inverse reinforcement learning explains: “For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose no unwarranted risks, it needs to align its values with those of the humans in its environment in such a way that its actions contribute to the maximization of value for the humans....We propose that value alignment should be formulated as a cooperative and interactive reward maximization process.”
In a similar spirit, AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky has advocated for an approach to AI ethics that he terms “coherent extrapolated volition.” The basic idea is to design artificial intelligence systems that learn to act in our best interests according not to what we presently think we want, but rather according to what an idealized version of ourselves would value.
In Yudkowsky’s words: “In poetic terms, our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.”
As the real-world dangers of poorly designed AI become more prominent—from algorithmic bias to facial recognition abuses—building artificial intelligence that can reason ethically is becoming an increasingly important priority for AI researchers and the broader public. As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous throughout society in the years ahead, this may well prove to be one of the most urgent technology problems we face.

In our ever-increasing digital and automatized world, certain buzzwords are becoming more centre stage in the public sector. One of them is “artificial intelligence”. While the concept, and development, of artificial intelligence is not new (artificial intelligence was first recognised as a formal discipline in the mid-1950s), it is a word that has been casually thrown around more in recent years in the public sector, and sometimes carelessly. 
Traditional algorithms vs machine learning models
These days modern data scientists normally associate with artificial intelligence systems that are based on machine learning models. Machine learning models deploy methods that develop rules from input data to achieve a given goal.1 There is a difference to, what you may call, traditional algorithms. Traditional algorithms don’t need data to learn, they just churn out results based on the rules inherent to them. 
Traditional algorithms have been used in the public sector for some time to make decisions. The latest example making the headline was the model determining A level exam results last summer. From an auditing perspective, as the basis of the algorithms are usually transparent, auditing them is something we as a public audit institution are used to.2
But artificial intelligence that is based on machine learning is different – it has only been (cautiously) employed in the public sector in recent years.
It is different because, firstly, for a machine learning model to learn it needs good, quality data – and often a lot of it. Our report on the challenges of using data across government has shown that that condition is not always given.
Secondly, it can be quite costly to develop  and deploy them. Moreover, the benefits are not always guaranteed and immediately realisable. In a public sector context with tight budgets, the willingness to put money behind them may not always be there. 
The reason for this is related to a third point. It is not always certain from the outside what the machine will learn and therefore what decision-making rules it will generate. This makes it hard to state the immediate benefits. Much of the progress in machine learning has been in models that learn decision-making rules that are difficult to understand or interrogate.  
Lastly, many decisions affecting people’s lives that artificial intelligence models would support pertain to personal circumstances and involve personal data, such as health, benefit or tax data. Whilst the personal data protection landscape has strengthened in recent years, there are not always the organisational regulatory structures and relevant accountabilities in place of the use of personal data in machine learning models.3 Public sector organisations are therefore at risk of inadvertently falling foul of developing data protection standards and expectations. 
How to audit public sector machine learning models 
Given all these challenges, it may not be surprising that in our public audit work, we are not coming across a lot of examples of the use of machine learning models in decision-making. But there are examples4 and we foresee that they may be growing in the future.
We have therefore teamed up with other public audit organisations in Norway, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany, and produced a white paper and audit catalogue on how to audit machine learning models. You can find it here: Auditing machine learning algorithms (auditingalgorithms.net).
As the paper outlines in more detail, we identified the following key problem areas and risk factors: 

Developers of machine learning models often focus on optimising specific numeric performance metrics. This can lead them to neglect other requirements, most importantly around compliance, transparency and fairness.
The developers of the machine learning models are almost always not the same people who own the model within the decision-making process. But the ‘product owners’ may not communicate their requirements to the developers – which can lead to machine learning models that increase costs and make routine tasks more, rather than less time-consuming. 
Often public sector organisations lack the resources and/or competence to develop machine learning applications internally and therefore rely on external commercial support. As a result they may take on a model without understanding how to maintain it and how to ensure it is compliant with relevant regulations.

We also highlighted the implications for auditors to meaningfully audit artificial intelligence applications:

They need a good understanding of the high-level principles of machine learning models 
They need to understand common coding languages and model implementations, and be able to use appropriate software tools
Due to the high demand on computing power, machine learning supporting IT infrastructure usually includes cloud-based solutions. Auditors therefore also need a basic understanding of cloud services to properly perform their audit work. 

Our audit catalogue sets out a series of questions that we suggest auditors should use when auditing machine learning models. We believe it will also be of interest to the public sector bodies we audit that employ machine learning models. It will help them understand what to focus on when developing or running machine learning models. As a minimum, it gives fair warning what we as auditors will be looking for when we are coming to audit your models!

In fact there are two main classes of machine learning models. Supervised machine learning models attempt to learn from known data to make predictions; unsupervised machine learning models try to find patterns within datasets in order to group or cluster them.
See for example our Framework to review models – National Audit Office (NAO) Report to understand more about what we look out for when auditing traditional models and algorithms. We currently have some work in progress that aims to take stock of current practices and identify the systemic issues in government modelling which can lead to value for money risks
In the UK the Information Commissioner Office has published guidance on the use of personal data in artificial intelligence: Guidance on AI and data protection | ICO

At the same time, the need for therapists is only growing.During the pandemic, about four in 10 adults in the United States reported that they had symptoms of anxiety or depression, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. At the same time, the federal government warns of a critical shortage of therapists and psychiatrists. According to the advocacy group Mental Health America, almost 60 percent of those with mental illness last year did not get treatment.Woebot Health says the pandemic has driven up demand for its services. The number of its daily users doubled and is now in the tens of thousands, said Alison Darcy, a psychologist and the founder and president of the company.Digital mental health has become a multibillion-dollar industry and includes more than 10,000 apps, according to an estimate by the American Psychiatric Association. The apps range from guided meditation (Headspace) and mood tracking (MoodKit) to text therapy by licensed counselors (Talkspace, BetterHelp).But Woebot, which was introduced in 2017, is one of only a handful of apps that use artificial intelligence to deploy the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, a common technique used to treat anxiety and depression. Woebot aims to use natural language processing and learned responses to mimic conversation, remember past sessions and deliver advice around sleep, worry and stress.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If we can deliver some of the things that the human can deliver,” Dr. Darcy said, “then we actually can create something that’s truly scalable, that has the capability to reduce the incidence of suffering in the population.”Almost all psychologists and academics agree with Dr. Darcy on the problem: There is not enough affordable mental health care for everyone who needs it. But they are divided on her solution: Some say bot therapy can work under the right conditions, while others consider the very concept paradoxical and ineffective.At issue is the nature of therapy itself. Can therapy by bot make people understand themselves better? Can it change long-held patterns of behavior through a series of probing questions and reflective exercises? Or is human connection essential to that endeavor?Hannah Zeavin is the author of the forthcoming book “The Distance Cure: A History of Teletherapy.” The health care system is so broken, she says, that “it makes sense that there’s space for disruption.”But, she added, not all disruption is equal. She calls automated therapy a “fantasy” that is more focused on accessibility and fun than actually helping people get better over the long term.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We are an extraordinarily confessing animal; we will confess to a bot,” she said. “But is confession the equivalent of mental health care?”ImageAlison Darcy, a psychologist and Woebot Health’s founder and president. The idea, Dr. Darcy says, is not to replace human therapists with bots; she thinks it’s important to have both.Credit...Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesEli Turns to WoebotEli Spector seemed like the perfect client for A.I. therapy.In 2019, Mr. Spector was a 24-year-old college graduate, working in a neuroscience lab in Philadelphia. Having grown up with an academic father who specialized in artificial intelligence, he considered himself something of a technologist.But Mr. Spector’s job was isolating and tedious, and after four stimulating years in academia, he felt bored and lonely. He couldn’t sleep well and found that his moods were consistently dark.“I was just having a really hard time adjusting and I didn’t have any co-workers I liked,” he said. “It was just a tough period for me.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut he wasn’t sure he wanted to bare his soul to a real person; he didn’t want to worry about anyone’s judgment or try to fit around someone else’s schedule.Besides, he didn’t think he could find a therapist on his parents’ insurance plan that he could afford, as that could run from $100 to $200 a session. And Woebot was free and on his phone.“Woebot seemed like this very low-friction way to see, you know, if this could help.”Therapy by AlgorithmWoebot’s use of cognitive behavioral therapy has a philosophical and practical logic to it. Unlike forms of psychotherapy that probe the root causes of psychological problems, often going back to childhood, C.B.T. seeks to help people identify their distorted ways of thinking and understand how that affects their behavior in negative ways. By changing these self-defeating patterns, therapists hope to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety.Because cognitive behavioral therapy is structured and skill-oriented, many mental health experts think it can be employed, at least in part, by algorithm.“You can deliver it pretty readily in a digital framework, help people grasp these concepts and practice the exercises that help them think in a more rational manner,” said Jesse Wright, a psychiatrist who studies digital forms of C.B.T. and is the director of the University of Louisville Depression Center. “Whereas trying to put something like psychoanalysis into a digital format would seem pretty formidable.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Wright said several dozen studies had shown that computer algorithms could take someone through a standard C.B.T. process, step by step, and get results similar to in-person therapy. Those programs generally follow a set length and number of sessions and require some guidance from a human clinician.But most smartphone apps don’t work that way, he said. People tend to use therapy apps in short, fragmented spurts, without clinician oversight. Outside of limited company-sponsored research, Dr. Wright said he knew of no rigorous studies of that model.And some automated conversations can be clunky and frustrating when the bot fails to pick up on the user’s exact meaning. Dr. Wright said A.I. is not advanced enough to reliably duplicate a natural conversation.“The chances of a bot being as wise, sympathetic, empathic, knowing, creative and being able to say the right thing at the right time as a human therapist is pretty slim,” he said. “There’s a limit to what they can do, a real limit.”John Torous, director of digital psychiatry for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said therapeutic bots might be promising, but he’s worried they are being rolled out too soon, before the technology has caught up to the psychiatry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If you deliver C.B.T. in these bite-size parts, how much exposure to bite-size parts equals the original?” he said. “We don’t have a good way to predict who’s going to respond to them or not — or who it’s good or bad for.”These new apps, Dr. Torous said, risk setting back other advances in digital mental health: “Do we in part end up losing trust and credibility because we’re promising what is not yet possible by any machine or any program today?”Other mental health professionals say that therapy should simply not be delivered by machine. Effective treatment involves more than just cognitive skill-building, they say. It needs a human-to-human connection. Therapists needs to hear nuances, see gestures, recognize the gap between what is said and unsaid.“These apps really shortchange the essential ingredient that — mounds of evidence show — is what helps in therapy, which is the therapeutic relationship,” said Linda Michaels, a Chicago-based therapist who is co-chair of the Psychotherapy Action Network, a professional group.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Darcy of Woebot says a well-designed bot can form an empathetic, therapeutic bond with its users, and in fact her company recently published a study making that claim. Thirty-six thousand Woebot users responded to statements like, “I believe Woebot likes me,” “Woebot and I respect each other” and “I feel that Woebot appreciates me.”ImageEli Spector tried Woebot, when he was reluctant to bare his soul to a therapist. “Woebot seemed like this very low-friction way to see, you know, if this could help,” he said.Credit...Hannah Yoon for The New York TimesThe study’s authors — all with financial ties to the company — concluded that a significant percentage of participants perceived a “working alliance” with Woebot, a term that means the therapist and patient have formed a cooperative rapport. The study did not measure whether there actually was a working alliance.Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes about technology and relationships, is not swayed by such evidence. For therapy to heal, she said, the therapist must have a lived experience and the ability to empathize with a patient’s pain. An app cannot do that.“We will humanize whatever seems capable of communicating with us,” Dr. Turkle said. “You’re creating the illusion of intimacy, without the demands of a relationship. You have created a bond with something that doesn’t know it is bonding with you. It doesn’t understand a thing.”Eli Pours Out His ProblemsEli Spector started with Woebot in the summer of 2019.He liked that he could open the app whenever he felt like it and pour out his thoughts of distress on his own schedule, for even a few minutes at a time. Most of the words coming out had to do with how unhappy he felt at his job.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe also took advantage of Woebot’s other features, including tracking his mood and writing in an online journal. It helped him realize how depressed he really was.But he had doubts about the algorithm. The bot’s advice often felt generic, like a collection of “mindfulness buzzwords,” he said. “Like, ‘Can you think more about that feeling, and what you could do differently?’”And worse, the advice could be nonsensical.“I would type in, like, ‘My boss doesn’t appreciate the work I do’ and ‘I can’t seem to get her approval,’” Mr. Spector said. “And Woebot would be like: ‘That sounds difficult. Does this happen more in the morning or at night?’”“It felt sort of silly,” he said.Is It Really Therapy?Much of the debate over therapeutic bots comes down to expectations. Do patients and clinicians understand the limitations of chatbots? Or are they expecting more than even the companies say they deliver?On its website, Woebot promises to “automate both the process and content of therapy,” but Dr. Darcy is careful not to call Woebot medical treatment or even formal therapy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTInstead, she says, the bot delivers “digital therapeutics.” And Woebot’s terms of service call it a “pure self-help” program that is not meant for emergencies. In fact, in the event of a severe crisis, Woebot says that it is programmed to recognize suicidal language and urge users to seek out a human alternative.In that way, Woebot does not approach true therapy — like many mental health apps, the current, free version of Woebot is not subject to strict oversight from the Food and Drug Administration because it falls under the category of “general wellness” product, which receives only F.D.A. guidance.But Woebot is striving for something more. With $22 million of venture capital in hand, Woebot is seeking clearance from the F.D.A. to develop its algorithm to help treat two psychiatric diagnoses, postpartum depression and adolescent depression, and then sell the program to health systems.And it is here that Woebot hopes to make money, using its practical advantage over any human therapist: scale.While other virtual therapy companies, like BetterHelp or Talkspace, must keep recruiting therapists to join their platforms, A.I. apps can take on new users without paying for extra labor. And while therapists can vary in skills and approach, a bot is consistent and doesn’t get stressed out by back-to-back sessions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The assumption is always that, because it’s digital, it’ll always be limited,” Dr. Darcy of Woebot said. “There’s actually some opportunities that are created by the technology itself that are really challenging for us to do in traditional treatment.”One advantage of an artificial therapist — or, as Dr. Darcy calls it, a “relational agent” — is 24-hour-a-day access. Very few human therapists answer their phone during a 2 a.m. panic attack, as Dr. Darcy pointed out. “I think people have probably underestimated the power of being able to engage in a therapeutic technique in the moment that you need to,” she said.But whether Woebot can be involved in medical diagnosis or treatment is up to the F.D.A., which is supposed to make sure the app can back up its claims and not cause harm, an agency spokesperson said.One possible harm, the spokesperson said, is a “missed opportunity” where someone with mental illness fails to get more effective treatment or delays treatment. “And what the consequences of those delays would look like — that’s something we’d worry about,” the spokesperson said.Artificial intelligence can be problematic in other ways. For instance, Dr. Zeavin worries that racial and gender bias or privacy breaches could simply get translated into bots.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Therapy has enough problems on its own,” Dr. Zeavin said. “And now they’ve brought all of the problems of algorithmic technology to bear.”But even some skeptics of chatbot therapy believe it has the potential to complement the human-guided mental health system, as long as it comes with serious research.“As the market gets saturated, the bar for evidence will get higher and higher and that’s how people will compete,” Dr. Torous said. “So maybe we’re just in such early stages and we don’t want to punish people for being innovative and kind of trying something.”The idea, Dr. Darcy says, is not to replace human therapists with bots; she thinks it’s important to have both. “It’s like saying if every time you’re hungry, you must go to a Michelin star restaurant, when actually a sandwich is going to be OK,” she said. “Woebot is a sandwich. A very good sandwich.”Eli Breaks Up With WoebotAfter about a month, Eli Spector deleted Woebot from his phone.He was unimpressed by the bot’s advice for beating back loneliness and despair, but he is not entirely sorry that he tried it out.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe mere act of typing out his problems was helpful. And through the process, he pinpointed what he actually needed to feel better.“So maybe this was just evidence that I needed to, like, actually address this,” he said. “It was enough to inspire me to just take the plunge and find a flesh-and-blood therapist.”Now, Mr. Spector pays a human psychotherapist in Philadelphia $110 a session.They’ve been meeting on Zoom since the pandemic began, so the flesh-and-blood part is somewhat theoretical. But it’s close enough.A version of this article appears in print on June 1, 2021, Section D, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Tell It to Woebot.

Health care is at a junction, a point where artificial intelligence tools are being introduced to all areas of the space. This introduction comes with great expectations: AI has the potential to greatly improve existing technologies, sharpen personalized medicines, and, with an influx of big data, benefit historically underserved populations.
But in order to do those things, the health care community must ensure that AI tools are trustworthy, and that they don’t end up perpetuating biases that exist in the current system. Researchers at the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health (Jameel Clinic), an initiative to support AI research in health care, call for creating a robust infrastructure that can aid scientists and clinicians in pursuing this mission.
Fair and equitable AI for health care
The Jameel Clinic recently hosted the AI for Health Care Equity Conference to assess current state-of-the-art work in this space, including new machine learning techniques that support fairness, personalization, and inclusiveness; identify key areas of impact in health care delivery; and discuss regulatory and policy implications.
Nearly 1,400 people virtually attended the conference to hear from thought leaders in academia, industry, and government who are working to improve health care equity and further understand the technical challenges in this space and paths forward.
During the event, Regina Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor of AI and Health and the AI faculty lead for Jameel Clinic, and Bilal Mateen, clinical technology lead at the Wellcome Trust, announced the Wellcome Fund grant conferred to Jameel Clinic to create a community platform supporting equitable AI tools in health care.
The project’s ultimate goal is not to solve an academic question or reach a specific research benchmark, but to actually improve the lives of patients worldwide. Researchers at Jameel Clinic insist that AI tools should not be designed with a single population in mind, but instead be crafted to be reiterative and inclusive, to serve any community or subpopulation. To do this, a given AI tool needs to be studied and validated across many populations, usually in multiple cities and countries. Also on the project wish list is to create open access for the scientific community at large, while honoring patient privacy, to democratize the effort.
“What became increasingly evident to us as a funder is that the nature of science has fundamentally changed over the last few years, and is substantially more computational by design than it ever was previously,” says Mateen.
The clinical perspective
This call to action is a response to health care in 2020. At the conference, Collin Stultz, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, spoke on how health care providers typically prescribe treatments and why these treatments are often incorrect.
In simplistic terms, a doctor collects information on their patient, then uses that information to create a treatment plan. “The decisions providers make can improve the quality of patients’ lives or make them live longer, but this does not happen in a vacuum,” says Stultz.
Instead, he says that a complex web of forces can influence how a patient receives treatment. These forces go from being hyper-specific to universal, ranging from factors unique to an individual patient, to bias from a provider, such as knowledge gleaned from flawed clinical trials, to broad structural problems, like uneven access to care.
Datasets and algorithms
A central question of the conference revolved around how race is represented in datasets, since it’s a variable that can be fluid, self-reported, and defined in non-specific terms.
“The inequities we’re trying to address are large, striking, and persistent,” says Sharrelle Barber, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University. “We have to think about what that variable really is. Really, it’s a marker of structural racism,” says Barber. “It’s not biological, it’s not genetic. We’ve been saying that over and over again.”
Some aspects of health are purely determined by biology, such as hereditary conditions like cystic fibrosis, but the majority of conditions are not straightforward. According to Massachusetts General Hospital oncologist T. Salewa Oseni, when it comes to patient health and outcomes, research tends to assume biological factors have outsized influence, but socioeconomic factors should be considered just as seriously.
Even as machine learning researchers detect preexisting biases in the health care system, they must also address weaknesses in algorithms themselves, as highlighted by a series of speakers at the conference. They must grapple with important questions that arise in all stages of development, from the initial framing of what the technology is trying to solve to overseeing deployment in the real world.
Irene Chen, a PhD student at MIT studying machine learning, examines all steps of the development pipeline through the lens of ethics. As a first-year doctoral student, Chen was alarmed to find an “out-of-the-box” algorithm, which happened to project patient mortality, churning out significantly different predictions based on race. This kind of algorithm can have real impacts, too; it guides how hospitals allocate resources to patients.
Chen set about understanding why this algorithm produced such uneven results. In later work, she defined three specific sources of bias that could be detangled from any model. The first is “bias,” but in a statistical sense — maybe the model is not a good fit for the research question. The second is variance, which is controlled by sample size. The last source is noise, which has nothing to do with tweaking the model or increasing the sample size. Instead, it indicates that something has happened during the data collection process, a step way before model development. Many systemic inequities, such as limited health insurance or a historic mistrust of medicine in certain groups, get “rolled up” into noise.
“Once you identify which component it is, you can propose a fix,” says Chen.
Marzyeh Ghassemi, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto and an incoming professor at MIT, has studied the trade-off between anonymizing highly personal health data and ensuring that all patients are fairly represented. In cases like differential privacy, a machine-learning tool that guarantees the same level of privacy for every data point, individuals who are too “unique” in their cohort started to lose predictive influence in the model. In health data, where trials often underrepresent certain populations, “minorities are the ones that look unique,” says Ghassemi.
“We need to create more data, it needs to be diverse data,” she says. “These robust, private, fair, high-quality algorithms we're trying to train require large-scale data sets for research use.”
Beyond Jameel Clinic, other organizations are recognizing the power of harnessing diverse data to create more equitable health care. Anthony Philippakis, chief data officer at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, presented on the All of Us research program, an unprecedented project from the National Institutes of Health that aims to bridge the gap for historically under-recognized populations by collecting observational and longitudinal health data on over 1 million Americans. The database is meant to uncover how diseases present across different sub-populations.
One of the largest questions of the conference, and of AI in general, revolves around policy. Kadija Ferryman, a cultural anthropologist and bioethicist at New York University, points out that AI regulation is in its infancy, which can be a good thing. “There’s a lot of opportunities for policy to be created with these ideas around fairness and justice, as opposed to having policies that have been developed, and then working to try to undo some of the policy regulations,” says Ferryman.
Even before policy comes into play, there are certain best practices for developers to keep in mind. Najat Khan, chief data science officer at Janssen R&D, encourages researchers to be “extremely systematic and thorough up front” when choosing datasets and algorithms; detailed feasibility on data source, types, missingness, diversity, and other considerations are key. Even large, common datasets contain inherent bias.
Even more fundamental is opening the door to a diverse group of future researchers.
“We have to ensure that we are developing and investing back in data science talent that are diverse in both their backgrounds and experiences and ensuring they have opportunities to work on really important problems for patients that they care about,” says Khan. “If we do this right, you’ll see ... and we are already starting to see ... a fundamental shift in the talent that we have — a more bilingual, diverse talent pool.”
The AI for Health Care Equity Conference was co-organized by MIT’s Jameel Clinic; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; Institute for Data, Systems, and Society; Institute for Medical Engineering and Science; and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly becoming crucial for organizations in their digital transformation journey. IBM’s latest study shows that more organizations are either using or exploring AI. Further, AI rollout has accelerated as a result of the pandemic. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) undoubtedly plays a crucial role today in strengthening and transforming companies and industries worldwide. Further, the pandemic has given impetus to the adoption of AI by various industry sectors and enterprises to survive, thrive, and innovate. According to the Artificial Intelligence Market – Global Forecast to 2026 report Opens a new window by MarketsandMarkets, the global AI market size is expected to grow to $58.3 billion this year and $309.6 billion in 2026. As companies continue to automate more of their operations and digitally transform, the importance of AI will only grow.
Morning Consult was recently commissioned by IBM to conduct new market research to understand the state of AI adoption among organizations. The Global AI Adoption Index 2021Opens a new window  study shows that AI adoption was nearly flat in 2020. However, the momentum has shifted this year as business needs are changing. Further, about 43% of organizations accelerated AI rollout owing to the pandemic.
The following are the key findings from the report.
Also read: Top 10 Open Source Artificial Intelligence Software in 2021
1. Almost One-Third of Organizations Use AI
Almost one-third (31%) of the professionals surveyed said their organizations are now using AI, and 43% are exploring the technology. About 34% reported their companies had not deployed any AI projects. Bigger businesses are nearly 70% more likely than smaller businesses to have adopted AI. It was also seen that companies in China lead in adopting or exploring AI, followed by India and Spain.
Various factors are driving AI adoption. The top drivers are:

Advances making AI more accessible (46%)
Business needs (46%)
Shifting business needs owing to the pandemic (44%)

There are also a few factors organizations are considering when evaluating AI solution providers. Here are the top factors:

Automates processes to empower higher-value work (47%)
Provides trust in business outcomes (40%)
Ability to deploy anywhere (40%)

2. Companies Face Barriers to AI Adoption
While AI adoption is growing, there are also some challenges organizations face when adopting the technology. The top three challenges to AI adoption are:

Limited knowledge or expertise (39%)
Increasing data silos and data complexity (32%)
Lack of platforms or tools to develop AI models (28%)

Increased data silos and complexity form the biggest challenge for AI adoption in large companies. For smaller organizations, limited knowledge or expertise is the largest barrier.
Companies also face difficulties in the steps along their journey to AI. More than one in three companies face these challenges:

Analyzing to build and scale trusted AI (39%)
Embedding AI throughout their business (37%)
Organizing data to create a business-ready analytics foundation (37%)
Collecting data to make it simple and accessible (37%)

For larger companies, data analysis and infusing AI throughout their business is the biggest challenge. For smaller businesses, the biggest challenge is data collection.
3. Investments in AI Have Increased
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the rollout of AI among organizations. In fact, 43% of the surveyed IT professionals said their companies had accelerated AI rollout due to COVID-19. Improving employee productivity (38%) and the requirement of a better way to interact with customers (36%) were other factors influencing organization decisions to adopt automation software due to the pandemic.
Over the next year, organizations intend to invest in all areas of artificial intelligence. This ranges from workforce and skill development to buying tools and implementing them for their processes. The following are a few key areas one-third of organizations plan to invest in:

Embedding AI into current AI applications and processes (34%)
Reskilling and workforce development (34%)
Off-the-shelf AI applications (34%)
Proprietary AI solutions (33%)
Off-the-shelf tools to build their own models and applications (33%)

4. Trusted, Explainable AI Is Crucial for Widespread Adoption
A significant number of the surveyed IT professionals believe that a trusted and explainable AI is critical to its widespread adoption and business success, which includes maintaining brand integrity and regulatory compliance. About 91% of organizations using AI believe their ability to explain how the AI decided is crucial.
For over three-quarters of IT professionals, they should be able to trust the AI’s output to be reliable, fair, and safe. Organizations in India (95%), China (85%), Latin America (82%), and the U.S. (80%) believe that this factor is crucial to them.
Trust is on top of the mind for these companies as 86% believe that consumers will more likely choose businesses offering transparency and an ethical framework on how their data and AI models are built and used. Having said that, more than half of the respondents face significant challenges getting there.
The three biggest challenges to developing trusted AI are:

Lack of skills or training to develop and manage trustworthy AI (65%)
AI governance and management tools that do not work across all data environments (62%)
AI outcomes that are not explainable (58%)

5. NLP Is at the Forefront of Recent AI Adoption
Natural language processing (NLP), one of the foundational technologies for AI models, is steadily becoming an important tool for organizations to empower their employees and interact with their customers. Over the last year, many organizations have been either motivated to adopt this technology or recognized its value to them. Almost half of the respondents say their organization is currently using NLP, and one-quarter plan to use it over the next year.
Professionals considering NLP adoption report a few barriers to entry:

Technology is too expensive (29%)
It requires too much training to be relevant (26%)
It is difficult to keep up to date (24%)
Technology is too complex to use (22%)
The organization lacks the requisite skillset (22%)

About 52% of organizations are using or considering using NLP solutions to improve customer experience, and 43% are using them to improve cost efficiency.
6. Automation Technologies Are Becoming Deeply Embedded
As more businesses become familiar with AI’s potential, automation technologies are getting more deeply embedded in the daily operations to increase efficiencies and save costs, among other objectives. Businesses are also using automation for increasingly complex use cases. About 80% of organizations are already using automation tools or plan to use them over the next year.
Over a third of organizations said that improving employee productivity (38%) and needing a better way to interact with customers (36%) influenced their decision to use automation software owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The UK has the lowest adoption of these tools (32% not using and 49% already using), and China has the highest adoption (8% not using and 71% already using).
Companies that have already deployed AI are more than twice as likely to be using RPA as those that are currently exploring AI.
7. Improving Data Access for AI Projects Is Important
The current remote work practices and technological advancements, such as edge computing and IoT, have created a data deluge for businesses. Organizations also need to make sure this information is accessible, secure, accurately informing their business intelligence (BI), and complying with privacy regulations. The challenge is that this humongous data is spread across extensive IT estates. About 87% of respondents say it is somewhat or very important that they can build and run their AI projects wherever the data resides.
About 83% of organizations feel confident they have the right tools to access data across their business wherever it resides. However, only 51% say that their platform offers a single, unified view of the organization’s data. Also, about 67% say they are drawing from over 20 different data sources to inform their AI, BI, and analytics systems.

Final Thoughts
As organizations emerge from the pandemic and their business needs change, AI has become more vital for improving cost efficiencies and customer experience. However, challenges and considerations persist for both large and small companies to the wider adoption of the technology. Yet, as businesses look for innovative ways to digitally transform themselves, investments in AI will continue to accelerate.

Artificial intelligence model disproves some mathematical conjectures

In mathematics, a conjecture is a result that seems to be true, but for which no proof has been found: this is what makes it different from the theorem or property that can be proven in all cases where it is applicable. A Tel Aviv University postdoc specializing in machine learning (ML) and mathematics has developed an ML model that can search for counterexamples that can disprove conjectures with the help of his team of researchers. The system has already disproved five conjectures in the field of combinatorial analysis and graph theory.

Combinatorial analysis and graph theory


Combinatorial or simply combinatorial analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the enumeration or counting of objects in different contexts. Thus, mathematicians study the set of combinations or configurations for a number of finite elements. For example, if we take several books, the objective of combinatorics is to know in how many different ways it will be possible to classify these books.
Graph theory is a discipline of mathematics and computer science that studies graphs, an abstract model consisting of nodes (or vertices, points) connected by links (or edges, lines). Many theories of communication, networks (computer or social) exploit graphs to better understand their functioning.

On the left, an illustration from Diderot and D’Alembert’s Encyclopedia proposing some of the 64 possible combinations for placing tiles with half-partitioned tiles.On the right, an arbitrary graph whose nodes are numbered.
Each of these two branches of mathematics has a large number of conjectures. These results are often considered to be accepted, because they work for many examples. However, if one of these examples does not work with this result, it is called a counterexample and thus disproves the conjecture.
A machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithm to disprove conjectures

For a conjecture to become a theorem, the result it evokes must be proven. On the other hand, to disprove a conjecture, it is enough to show that the result does not apply by taking an example for which the conjecture does not work, it is the famous counter-example. Adam Zsolt Wagner has developed a model of reinforcement learning based on this basic principle of mathematical proofs, the foundations of which he explains in an article.
The user proposes a conjecture and the algorithm proposes a measure that expresses the difficulty of disproving the proposition. The program creates random examples and uses these measures to evaluate their relevance as counterexamples, using machine learning. The AI eliminates the worst examples and replaces them with new randomly generated examples. The system repeats the process to find counterexamples that would refute a user’s suggestions.
For dozens of uses, the algorithm did not find an example that disproved these proposals. Five conjectures have been disproved, however, including one proposed by Richard Anthony Brualdi, a specialist in combinatorics and graph theory.
The rather strong opinions of mathematicians

Several mathematicians have expressed themselves on the quality of the model proposed by Adam Zsolt Wagner’s team. One of them is Leslie Hogben, from Iowa State University, whose conjecture was disproved by the AI:
“This is really impressive. What we’re seeing here is a huge benefit of artificial intelligence without a doubt, from a mathematical standpoint. It simply finds things for us, as a very perceptive person would. The counterexamples are needles in haystacks.”

Timothy Gowers of the Collège de France made a statement on Twitter around this AI model where he mentions some of what Adam Zsolt Wagner’s paper said while adding:
“This is an interesting proof of concept. Perhaps we can make it a simple conjecture testing tool that would be of great use to mathematical researchers.”

However, while Leslie Hogben is delighted that the model was able to disprove one of her conjectures , she believes that experts still need to be able to follow a computer proof:
“Personally, I would never have a problem with a computer disproof that can be verified. However, a computer proof that cannot be verified by hand would personally cause me some problems.”

In 1976, a theorem had been proved for the first time with the help of a computer: the computer had made an exhaustive list of all the examples for which the announced result was correct. Nevertheless, many mathematicians found the proof inelegant since it did not prove the conjecture in a classical way. In spite of this, information is nowadays widely used to solve mathematical problems.

Grimes Wants Communists to Give AI a Chance

Grimes may be dating the richest man on the planet, but that doesn’t stop the musician from thinking about communism. Take this June 2 TikTok, in which Grimes presents a “proposition for the communists.” In the humble tradition of previous communist thinkers like Karl Marx, she continues, “If you think about it, AI is actually the fastest path to communism.” Let her explain: “If implemented correctly, AI could actually theoretically solve for abundance. Like, we could totally get to a situation where nobody has to work, everybody is provided for with a comfortable state of being, comfortable living. AI could automate all the farming, weed out systematic corruption, thereby bringing us to as close as possible to genuine equality.” Never mind that technology often plays into the worst impulses of capitalism and exacerbates inequality — Grimes says robots can help us farm! (As if, also, farming is the only work that needs to be done in a communist society?) “Because let’s be real,” Grimes adds. “Enforced farming is really not a vibe.”






The artist later commented that the TikTok was “a joke,” adding that she’s “not a communist,” in case you confused her — again, dating the richest person on earth! — for one. “But maybe the technocrats and communists could get along,” she continued. Let a girl dream.

2 June 2021




    Meet Prof. Nava Tintarev, full professor of Explainable Artificial Intelligence    
Prof. Nava Tintarev joined Maastricht University in October of last year. She focuses on Explainable Artificial Intelligence, which has an important societal component to it: “My take on things is much more user-centered than what you see in a lot of computer science departments.”


You may not know what a recommender system is, but you have almost certainly encountered one. “It’s the type of automated systems used by companies like Amazon and Spotify, which look at your previous profile and try to suggest something in the future”, says Prof. Tintarev.
As a recently appointed full professor in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Nava Tintarev is a leading expert in human-computer interaction. Her work focuses on artificially intelligent systems that give advice. ‘Advice’ is to be taken broadly here: beyond recommending what to buy, see or hear next, it can for instance also refer to how search engines prioritize search results for specific users.



    Explaining the unexplained    














Most artificially intelligent systems are notorious for their black box-like nature: they tend to make predictions based on previous data, but won’t reveal how they arrived at their conclusions. Where a person might say ‘I recommend you look into cat supplies, because you searched the internet for pet shelters and cat gifs all of last week’, an algorithm’s reasoning can be much more sophisticated – and entirely opaque.
That lack of transparency comes at a price.




What if an algorithm is biased, but used for important things like your news consumption – thereby informing your opinions about disputed topics like face masks and vaccinations? And what if a computer’s biases only amplify yours, but you don’t know that it’s happening?
The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence devises methods to generate insights into why AI recommends or takes particular actions. Explanations may for instance be presented in natural language or through using intelligent interactive interfaces. Such explanations are widely considered a key requirement for the responsible use of artificial intelligence in society.
Recommender systems
Back to recommender systems. Since they pop up in all sorts of settings, working on them takes on varied contexts as well. “I do a lot of work on recommender systems,” says Prof. Tintarev, “for instance in the music domain. Maybe things like the weather, your mood, and activity level change the kind of music you enjoy. The amount of interactions and explanations that you could need in these settings may also differ. You can adapt the recommender system and the explanations they generate to these kinds of things.”
“Right now, my team is working on explaining automated group recommendations. These will often require a compromise. If someone is not getting their first choice, how can we use explanations to keep the group happy and smooth those rough edges?”



    Opening Pandora’s box    














But while Prof. Tintarev initially mentions tourist and music recommendations, smoothing edges through explanations can also tackle important societal goals. Recommender systems have been under scrutiny for the risk of promoting so-called ‘filter bubbles’: online spaces where users are served content that aligns with their viewpoints, whether through Youtube, Facebook, or a different platform.
Prof. Tintarev: “I’m concerned about the fact that we are becoming more polarized. That we aren’t exposed to viewpoints that differ from our own – even when we want to be.""




""The goal is not necessarily to agree with those other viewpoints, but to be aware that they exist. How do we create interaction in a way that helps people make informed decisions? Many of my current projects, also in collaboration with industry, examine online information and diversity of viewpoints. In a project co-funded by IBM, we are for example looking into search results. Does it matter which results are in the list? Or how they are ordered and displayed? How does this influence user behavior and attitudes?” The end goal, she stresses, is a broad awareness of their information consumption.



    Not your average computer scientist    
“My vision of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is one that is human understandable”, prof. Tintarev concludes. “We don’t only need to be able to automatically generate explanations, we also need to see when they help people make better informed decisions. That requires empirical work, like evaluations with users. It also requires understanding the circumstances: when are explanations needed and useful? What do we need to change and how should we adapt the explanations?”
“My take on things is much more user-centered than what you see in a lot of computer science departments. It’s half psychology, half computer science.” Needless to say, we’re excited to have Prof. Tintarev on our team.

Anyone who has ever craned their neck to hold a phone between their ear and their shoulder can appreciate the benefit of hands-free communication. For first responders, the situation is typically much more serious than trying to chat with a friend while cooking dinner, though. They are often in critical response scenarios where a hands-free voice interface would improve both safety and efficiency, which could ultimately translate into saving lives.Automated speech recognition technology

As part of its mission to support the identification and integration of existing and emerging technologies, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) partnered with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and their sub-contractor Think-A-Move to develop Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology. The resulting innovation is known as the Direct Artificial Intelligence System Interface, or DAISI, which enables voice-activated capabilities in noisy operational environments. DAISI was selected out of multiple prototypes developed in response to an April 2018 request for proposals.Current speech recognition systems work reasonably well in quiet conditions, but quickly fail when the surrounding background noise increases—as is common for first responder situations. Being able to effectively communicate while multitasking, no matter the situation, will enhance situational awareness.“S&T consistently supports the development of technologies that make first responders safer, enable accurate and timely sharing of data and critical information, and seamlessly integrate across platforms and jurisdictions,” said S&T Project Manager Cuong Luu. “DAISI addresses a need identified as a priority capability for responders—effective and reliable hands-free communication so they can focus on doing their job.”Numerous Capabilities Within Easy Reach

DAISI is able to assist with various tasks throughout all stages of a response. While en route to an incident, the system provides voice control for the mobile data terminal, which is the computerized device used to communicate with the central dispatch office. Responders can use DAISI to initiate navigation, answer address queries, provide alternate routes, and pan and zoom throughout the map—all without lifting a finger.Once they arrive safely at the incident, voice-enabled hydrant location queries and friction loss calculation (which impacts the amount of water pressure required by the fire hose) can save crucial time. DAISI is also able to instantly access WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) to identify hazardous materials at the site and guide appropriate precautionary measures.In addition to all these capabilities, on-scene report logging and transcription to text make capturing key benchmarks on the scene fast and easy. Back at the station, responders are able to use the event log to make the after-fire critique and fire investigation report more comprehensive and thorough.Tech That Will Come in Handy for First RespondersMaryland’s Howard County Department of Fire & Rescue Services has served as a testbed for the DAISI prototype over the last three years. The crew there has put DAISI to the test, trying out use cases identified during development and validating more than 80 different requirements to meets the needs of all sorts of potential situations. For example, should the worst happen—perhaps a partial building collapse traps a crew member—voice-activated mayday alerts add reliable backup support when a responder needs assistance.According to Howard County Battalion Chief Stanley Wurzburger, “DAISI quite literally can make the worst day of a firefighter’s career a little bit easier to get through.”The Future of Hands-Free Comms

What truly sets DAISI apart from existing technologies is the sophisticated machine learning voice recognition capability. As APL Project Manager Julee Rendon puts it, “It’s really about the language processing, the acoustic modeling, and the noise filtering.”Continued algorithm development is planned to ensure the platform will remain below the industry standard of a 15% word-error rate. The team also plans to explore ease-of-use for the user interface and long-term durability of the computer central processing unit to ensure DAISI’s ability to overcome the technical challenge of resource limitation.Commercial smart devices that can be similarly called upon by name and tasked with a multitude of requests require substantial connectivity, processing power, and battery life. DAISI is being designed for high performance regardless of the situation so function won’t be compromised by remote locations or extended use.“We’re looking at how to minimize the resource consumption and find the sweet spot of a capability like this that has to be available to first responders who may not have that bench of resources that they can connect to whenever they’re in the field,” added Rendon.DAISI should be ready for transition to commercial availability in the next couple of years. An important next step for developers is the final evaluation of the noise cancelling hardware. This includes safe and effective microphone placement and the successful integration with firefighters’ self-contained breathing apparatus without compromising the integrity of the facepiece seal.Finally, the development team will provide recommendations for adaption to other first responder communities. Though it has been applied to firefighter use cases thus far, there is great potential for paramedics, police, and members of the military to benefit from this capability as well. In an ever-expanding Internet of Things world, ASR represents the future of emergency response that could enable countless future technologies such as wireless biometric sensors.“This is a cornerstone technology,” said Ruth Vogel of APL. “If you don’t have the voice recognition capability, then a lot of the other next generation solutions are not going to work well.”For more information, contact (link sends email)STMedia@hq.dhs.gov.

Story at a glance:

“AI is actually the fastest path to communism,” said Grimes in the video.
AI could automate farming, providing food while no one has to work, she said.
Critics pointed out that in a communistic society, Grimes would not be wealthy.


“AI is actually the fastest path to communism,” said Grimes, a singer who is dating Elon Musk.
On Wednesday, in a TikTok video, the girlfriend of one of the world’s richest men took to social media seemingly promoting communism, Insider reported.

America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.

The following day, Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, got more than 1.4 million views for her video, and received criticism for her contradiction.
In Grimes’ idealogic viewpoint, AI ensures that “nobody has to work” and everyone is provided for. AI could automate farming, she said.
But as Insider points out, that is not what Karl Marx, father of communism, envisioned.
Communism is the elimination of a capitalist system – the elimination of competing services, the relationship between workers and founders, and the wealth gap.
Under communism, a company like Tesla, which Musk founded, would be socially everyone’s company and Musk would be an ordinary worker.
In the comments to her video, Grimes later posted that the video was a joke and that she is “not a communist.” “Maybe the technocrats and communists could get along!” Grimes added.

The graduate program is expected to begin this fall.Hridesh Rajan, a professor and chairperson of ISU's Department of Computer Science, said the new program seeks to produce graduates that can work on building and enhancing components of artificial intelligence — not only to be able to understand and make practical use of machine learning and big data, but also be able to communicate the capabilities and limitations of AI.What is artificial intelligence, and what are the job prospects in the field?Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the study of techniques that help incorporate intelligence into software, Rajan said.More:AI in 2020 and beyond: create a digital replica of your aging parent or yourselfHe said AI is already part of daily life in how social media feeds are organized, which city’s weather forecast is determined to be the one that matters and how a virtual assistant finds the nearest coffee shop when asked to.“It would be an underestimation to say that AI is now part of our everyday life,” from the time we wake up until going to bed, Rajan said.Rajan anticipates thousands of new jobs in AI in the next few years, and said the technology could be used to decrease error rates in diagnoses in health care, create vaccines faster and improve sustainable use of resources.In vaccines, the chief scientific officer of Moderna — maker of one of the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. — has said the company uses AI and machine learning to try to predict viral mutations that could cause problems and then design vaccines to fight them.More:Vaccines 2.0: Next-generation COVID-19 shots will be cheaper, easier to deliver and protect against more viruses, industry leaders sayAll of those endeavors involve big data, and algorithms that can leverage the data. “Having the data itself is not the endgame. We need to be able to make the data work for us,"" Rajan said.That means there's a need for people who can understand algorithms and how machines can use them to discover knowledge and make decisions based on it.According to citations in documents submitted to the Regents, the job of AI specialist had the most growth between 2015 and 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 74%.Rajan said it's also the kind of work that major companies are doing in Iowa — not just somewhere far away such as Silicon Valley.More details about ISU's AI programRajan said it was the questions of prospective students and their parents that spurred the design of the new master's in science AI degree program at ISU.With the Regents' approval and after marketing the program over the summer, the projected enrollment for the first year is five students, but that's anticipated to grow to 15 in the second year, almost 40 in the fourth year and almost 70 students in the seventh year of the program.Rajan said a master’s degree will allow for more in-depth experience and expertise than an undergraduate degree could offer, and a hands-on capstone project will serve graduates as a demonstration of their skills when applying for a job. According to a news release from ISU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, core classes beyond AI and machine learning techniques will also include ""knowledge representation and reasoning; search and planning; computer vision and perception; natural language processing and robotics.""  Beyond Iowa, he said Northwestern University has a master’s degree in AI, and a number of schools are also looking into their own programs.Other Regents actions involving ISU academicsThe Regents also Thursday approved a merger of ISU's departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology and Microbiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, planned for September 2022, in the hopes of increasing undergraduate student enrollment. The merged departments would have a single chairperson, and the addition of two tenure-track faculty lines has already been agreed to by the departments.The Regents also approved new ISU bachelor's or master's degree programs in business administration, human resource management and education.Phillip Sitter covers education for the Ames Tribune, including Iowa State University and PreK-12 schools in Ames and elsewhere in Story County.

The Academic Senate, Board of the Institute, and Ministry of Education have approved a new four-year B.Tech programme in Artificial Intelligence from the coming academic year 2021-22. The admissions to the programme will be through JEE (Main) score.The new course is in conformance with the National Education Policy 2020, which stresses the need to improve the skilled workforce involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunction with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities.Karanam Uma Maheshwar Rao, director, NIT-K, Surathkal said that this degree would prepare students for industry or graduate study by offering specializations indifferent areas of AI like data Science, human-centred computing,cyber-physical systems, and robotics.“The programme and its curriculum focus on the use of inputs such as video, speech,and big data to make decisions or enhance human capabilities. This specialization empowers students to build intelligent machines, software, or applications with state-of-the-art technology using machine learning, data analytics, and data visualization technologies,” he said.He added that that earlier, AI was a subset of computer science, but in recent years AI has grown enough to qualify as a distinctive and a bigger unit.
