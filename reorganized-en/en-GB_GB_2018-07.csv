This article was originally published in the Summer 2018 issue of The Record.
When asked how artificial intelligence (AI) will improve our lives, many people think of high-profile examples such as autonomous cars and smart homes. However, AI may be making the fastest inroads where people spend most of their waking hours: the workplace. But how will AI change the nature of work?
DXC Technology believes AI will be key for facilitating the flexible, productive workstyle that today’s workforce expects. AI, robotics and machine learning will shift how people work, replacing highly manual and repetitive jobs on both the factory floor and in the office. However, these roles will be replaced by an equal, or greater, number of jobs in new areas that require more creativity and critical thinking. In fact, a 2017 CCS Insight survey found that almost 50% of the 650 respondents think AI will increase the number of available jobs. When millennials are isolated from that respondent group, that figure jumps to 64%. 
Currently filling peripheral roles in the workplace, AI is rapidly working its way towards playing a larger role. For example, IT administrators are using AI to support bring your own device policies by putting guardrails around devices to safeguard corporate data and ensure that everything employees do can be audited. In addition, the technology can identify undetected malware and other vulnerabilities, or intervene when users take risks.
AI can make employees more productive by guiding them through various processes. Workers who shift from one device to another throughout the day, for example, might benefit from AI-assisted authentication and automated workflow. This could end the error-prone routine of manually tracking document revisions or e-mailing attachments from one device to another.
How we interact with AI-powered systems is changing rapidly too. Conversational systems provide a natural, easy-to-use interface for user-requested actions. They’re also increasingly capable of monitoring conversations, taking notes, documenting action items and creating calendar entries without prompting, which is ideal for meetings. Meanwhile, chatbots are quickly improving employee and customer experiences by immediately answering simple technical questions and providing step-by-step assistance to resolve common issues. Plus, AI can automatically and accurately translate between languages, which will benefit global companies interacting with customers in multiple countries.
AI has grown exponentially over the past few years and will continue to play a pivotal role for DXC – we’re using it to give employees and customers the power to be more productive and they’re responding eagerly.

While there is still much to overcome to achieve AI-dependent health care, most notably data privacy concerns and fears of mismanaged care due to machine error and lack of human oversight, there is sufficient potential that governments, tech companies, and healthcare providers are willing to invest and test out AI-powered tools and solutions. Here are five of the AI advances in healthcare that appear to have the most potential.

1.        AI-assisted robotic surgery
With an estimated value of $40 billion to healthcare, robots can analyze data from pre-op medical records to guide a surgeon's instrument during surgery, which can lead to a 21% reduction in a patient's hospital stay. Robot-assisted surgery is considered ""minimally invasive"" so patients won't need to heal from large incisions. Via artificial intelligence, robots can use data from past operations to inform new surgical techniques. The positive results are indeed promising. One study that involved 379 orthopedic patients found that AI-assisted robotic procedure resulted in five times fewer complications compared to surgeons operating alone. A robot was used on an eye surgery for the first time, and the most advanced surgical robot, the Da Vinci allows doctors to perform complex procedures with greater control than conventional approaches. Heart surgeons are assisted Heartlander, a miniature robot, that enters a small incision on the chest to perform mapping and therapy over the surface of the heart.





2.        Virtual nursing assistants
PROMOTED
From interacting with patients to directing patients to the most effective care setting, virtual nursing assistants could save the healthcare industry $20 billion annually. Since virtual nurses are available 24/7, they can answer questions, monitor patients and provide quick answers. Most applications of virtual nursing assistants today allow for more regular communication between patients and care providers between office visits to prevent hospital readmission or unnecessary hospital visits. Care Angel's virtual nurse assistant can even provide wellness checks through voice and AI.

3.        Aid clinical judgment or diagnosis
Admittedly, using AI to diagnose patients is undoubtedly in its infancy, but there have been some exciting use cases. A Stanford University study tested an AI algorithm to detect skin cancers against dermatologists, and it performed at the level of the humans. A Danish AI software company tested its deep-learning program by having a computer eavesdrop while human dispatchers took emergency calls. The algorithm analyzed what a person says, the tone of voice and background noise and detected cardiac arrests with a 93% success rate compared to 73% for humans. Baidu Research recently announced that the results of early tests on its deep learning algorithm indicate that it can outperform humans when identifying breast cancer metastasis. Prime minister Theresa May announced an AI revolution would help the National Health Service (NHS), the UK's healthcare system, predict those in an early stage of cancer to ultimately prevent thousands of cancer-related deaths by 2033. The algorithms will examine medical records, habits and genetic information pooled from health charities, the NHS and AI.
4.        Workflow and administrative tasks
Another way AI can impact healthcare is to automate administrative tasks. It is expected that this could result in $18 billion in savings for the healthcare industry as machines can help doctors, nurses and other providers save time on tasks. Technology such as voice-to-text transcriptions could help order tests, prescribe medications and write chart notes. One example of using AI to support admin tasks is a partnership between the Cleveland Clinic and IBM that uses IBM’s Watson to mine big data and help physicians provide a personalized and more efficient treatment experience. One way Watson supports physicians is being able to analyze thousands of medical papers using natural language processing to inform treatment plans.

5.        Image analysis
Currently, image analysis is very time consuming for human providers, but an MIT-led research team developed a machine-learning algorithm that can analyze 3D scans up to 1,000 times faster than what is possible today. This near real-time assessment can provide critical input for surgeons who are operating. It is also hoped that AI can help to improve the next generation of radiology tools that don’t rely on tissue samples. Additionally, AI image analysis could support remote areas that don’t have easy access to healthcare providers and even make telemedicine more effective as patients can use their camera phones to send in pics of rashes, cuts or bruises to determine what care is necessary.
In the very complex world of healthcare, AI tools can support human providers to provide faster service, diagnose issues and analyze data to identify trends or genetic information that would predispose someone to a particular disease. When saving minutes can mean saving lives, AI and machine learning can be transformative not only for healthcare but for every single patient.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/07/27/how-is-ai-used-in-healthcare-5-powerful-real-world-examples-that-show-the-latest-advances/,Enterprise & Cloud,How Is AI Used In Healthcare - 5 Powerful Real-World Examples That Show The Latest Advances,False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purchasing a home or car is an exciting moment in a person’s life. Consumers may be comfortable with and even appreciate data-driven recommendations in the search process, for example, from websites that suggest homes based on properties they’ve previously viewed. But what if the decision to grant a mortgage or auto loan is made by a machine-learning algorithm? And what if the logic behind that algorithm’s decision, especially if it rejects the application, is unclear? It’s hard enough being denied a loan after going through the traditional process; being turned down by an artificial intelligence (AI)–powered system that can’t be explained is that much worse. Consumers are left with no way to know how to improve their chance of success in the future.
Elsewhere, for patients and their doctors, the promise of AI programs that can detect signs of disease at ever-earlier stages is cause for celebration. But it can also be cause for consternation. When it comes to medical diagnoses, the stakes are exceedingly high; a misdiagnosis could lead to unnecessary and risky surgery or to the deterioration of the patient’s health. Physicians must trust the AI system in order to confidently use it as a diagnostic tool, and patients must also trust the system if they are to have confidence in their diagnosis.

As more and more companies in a range of industries adopt machine learning and more advanced AI algorithms, such as deep neural networks, their ability to provide understandable explanations for all the different stakeholders becomes critical. Yet some machine-learning models that underlie AI applications qualify as black boxes, meaning we can’t always understand exactly how a given algorithm has decided what action to take. It is human nature to distrust what we don’t understand, and much about AI may not be completely clear. And since distrust goes hand in hand with lack of acceptance, it becomes imperative for companies to open the black box.
Deep neural networks are complicated algorithms modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns by grouping raw data into discrete mathematical components known as vectors. In the case of medical diagnosis, this raw data could come from patient imaging. For a bank loan, the raw data would be made up of payment history, defaulted loans, credit score, perhaps some demographic information, other risk estimates, and so on. The system then learns by processing all this data, and each layer of the deep neural network learns to recognize progressively more complex features. With sufficient training, the AI may become highly accurate. But its decision processes are not always transparent.

To open up the AI black box and facilitate trust, companies must develop AI systems that perform reliably — that is, make correct decisions — time after time. The machine-learning models on which the systems are based must also be transparent, explainable, and able to achieve repeatable results. We call this combination of features an AI model’s interpretability. 
It is important to note that there can be a trade-off between performance and interpretability. For example, a simpler model may be easier to understand, but it won’t be able to process complex data or relationships. Getting this trade-off right is primarily the domain of developers and analysts. But business leaders should have a basic understanding of what determines whether a model is interpretable, as this is a key factor in determining an AI system’s legitimacy in the eyes of the business’s employees and customers.
Data integrity and the possibility of unintentional biases are also a concern when integrating AI. In a 2017 PwC CEO Pulse survey, 76 percent of respondents said potential for biases and lack of transparency were impeding AI adoption in their enterprise. Seventy-three percent said the same about the need to ensure governance and rules to control AI. Consider the example of the AI-powered mortgage loan application evaluation system. What if it started denying applications from a certain demographic because of human or systemic biases in the data? Or imagine if an airport security system’s AI program singled out certain individuals for additional screening at airport security on the basis of their race or ethnicity.
Business leaders faced with ensuring interpretability, consistent performance, and data integrity will have to work closely with their organization’s developers and analysts. Developers are responsible for building the machine learning model, selecting the algorithms used for the AI application, and verifying that the AI was built correctly and continues to perform as expected. Analysts are responsible for validating the AI model created by the developers to be sure the model addresses the business need at hand. Finally, management is responsible for the decision to deploy the system, and must be prepared to take responsibility for the business impact.

A Strategist’s Guide to Artificial Intelligence

For any organization that wants to get the best out of AI, it is important for people to clearly understand and adhere to these roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, the goal is to design a machine-learning model (or tune an existing one) for a given AI application so that the company can maximize performance while comprehensively addressing any operational or reputational concerns.
Leaders will also need to follow the evolving AI regulatory environment. Such regulatory requirements are not extensive now, but more are likely to emerge over time. In Europe, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018, and will require companies — including U.S. companies that do business in Europe — to take measures to protect customers’ privacy and eventually ensure the transparency of algorithms that impact consumers.
Finally, executives should bear in mind that every AI application will differ in the degree to which there is a risk to human safety. If the risk is great and the role of the human operator significantly reduced, then the need for the AI model to be reliable, easily explained, and clearly understood is high. This would be the case, for example, with a self-driving car, a self-flying passenger jet, or a fully automated cancer diagnosis process.
Other AI applications won’t put people’s health or lives at risk — for example, AI that screens mortgage applications or that runs a marketing campaign. But because of the potential for biased data or results, a reasonable level of interpretability is still required. Ultimately, the company must be comfortable with, and be able to explain to customers, the reasons the system approved one application over another or targeted a specific group of consumers in a campaign.
Opening the black box in which some complex AI models have previously functioned will require companies to ensure that for any AI system, the machine-learning model performs to the standards the business requires, and that company leaders can justify the outcomes. Those that do will help reduce risks and establish the trust required for AI to become a truly accepted means of spurring innovation and achieving business goals — many of which have not yet even been imagined.

School leaders and education researchers often rely on test scores to judge how well students are learning. But that ignores many important aspects of learning, such as the liveliness of classroom discussion or how engaged and motivated the students are. Expert observers in a classroom can immediately pick up on these unquantifiable moments of great teaching. But human observations are time-consuming and expensive. You can videotape classrooms, but it can be just as tedious and costly to code and analyze the recordings afterward.

Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, teams of education researchers and computer scientists are experimenting with how to build systems that can “see” into and “listen” in on classrooms and instantly analyze the quality of classroom instruction. The technology is improving rather rapidly now, thanks to improvements in natural language processing and automatic speech recognition. At the same time, it takes an enormous amount of work just to teach the robots how to observe one micro aspect of a classroom at a time.

But Sean Kelly, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Education, is most interested in something called “authentic” questions, for which there are no pre-ordained answers. For example, why do you think that Nathaniel Hawthorne chose to give Hester Prynne a female child instead of a male child? Would the sex of the child make a difference in “A Scarlet Letter”?  Kelly’s earlier low-tech research found that teachers who ask lots of authentic questions tended to create exciting classrooms full of lively discussions, in which students ultimately learned more.
 
 

Kelly and his team of three computer scientists and one English professor succeeded in building a computer model that came close to an expert educator’s ability to discern when a teacher was asking students an “authentic” question. The results of this AI experiment were published June 2018 in Educational Researcher.

“I’m sure if you just let the engineers loose, they could come up with a program that would give teachers all sorts of feedback,” said Kelly. “But would that be the same feedback that a content expert would give? That’s what our research is all about. We were very happy to see reliabilities as high as we did.”
Before you would use this in the real world, you’d want not only more accurate algorithms, but also the ability to discern many more elements of classroom discussions. Kelly dreams of a future when algorithmic observer robots might be able to give student teachers instant feedback to improve their instruction. “You could potentially do it right there at the end of the lesson,” said Kelly. “The beauty of an automated system is that you could potentially collect large amounts of data very efficiently.”  Policymakers could use this tool to get a sense of how different curriculum are playing out in classrooms across an entire state.
These AI systems don’t involve robots in the sci-fi or cartoon sense. The researchers began with human observers who were specially trained to watch English classes. These observers sat in hundreds of hours of middle school classes and then spent countless more hours reviewing audio tapes and classifying teacher talk into categories, such as authentic questions. Then researchers employed a machine learning algorithm on the audiotape to figure out which speech patterns were typically associated with authentic questions and which weren’t. Finally, they used these speech patterns to build a computer model that keeps track of the proportion of questions that are authentic.

To check the accuracy of this computer model, the authors compared it to a traditional approach in which actual people listen to a recording of a teacher and identify the authentic questions by hand. The computer model and the hand-coded approach don’t produce identical results. Sometimes the computer labels something an authentic question that a human doesn’t, and vice versa.
On average, the computer estimated a 3.6 percent rate of authentic questions. Humans found slightly more, a 3.9 percent rate of authentic questions. Statistically speaking, the difference wasn’t significant. Deciding whether a question has a pre-ordained answer is a somewhat subjective endeavor. Even expert human observers disagree on how to categorize a question 20 percent of the time.
But even in this relatively successful experiment, the potential pitfalls of relying on AI for teacher observations are in evidence. Is a teacher with a higher authentic question count a better teacher? Kelly says he’s encountered fantastic teachers who don’t utter authentic questions at all or conduct whole group discussions. “They were more concerned with giving students close feedback on their writing,” he said.
Related: Researchers can predict when a student’s mind is wandering. What should we do about it?
Kelly said he wouldn’t want models like this used to penalize a teacher with a low-performance rating. A human observer would obviously give this writing teacher high marks. But Kelly argues that automated observation could give school leaders insight into whether students are getting enough lively, thoughtful discussions in their classes.  “If a student never gets any authentic questions and discussions, that’s probably not a good thing,” said Kelly. The average 50-minute middle school English class in America typically has less than two minutes of genuine discussion among several students and a teacher, Kelly said.
Kelly predicts that automated classroom observers will be a reality in the not-too-distant future. “The capability of the computer science is quite good,” he said. “With enough of an effort, we can get there pretty quickly. But if you proceed too fast, you’ll be out there with a tool that you don’t know what it’s doing. You need lots and lots of research to show that it’s valid and leading to useful teacher feedback.” Hopefully, decision makers will use automated observer robots to improve instruction and not as a weapon against teachers, repeating the mistakes made using student test scores to pay and punish teachers.

In so many areas, we now have mature solutions in place and, now and again, we hear about interesting and insightful applications of ML & AI towards hitherto unexplored problems that make us go “Oh, wow!”.As the deployed scenarios become richer and more widespread, we have to make sure that security and privacy aspects of AI & ML are adequately thought through. In order to do so, it is important to understand the different ways security and privacy cross paths with the fields of AI & ML. In this series, we will explore those intersections one ‘facet’ at a time with a goal to understand the nature and extent of risks involved and what protections are available or being explored for each.While I have several years of work experience in the information security and privacy space, I am relatively new to AI & ML. (We have just started using ML techniques in our cloud security and dev ops projects at work.) So this series is more from the viewpoint of a security person reasoning about security and privacy in the contexts of AI & ML in a systematic manner. The early parts of the series will focus on somewhat narrow technical aspects. However, over the course of the series, we will also cover the broader social/societal concerns. As the series develops, I would love to hear back from experts in both fields what they think about the way I have organized the presentation.In this first part, I will start with the “let us get the basics right” message from a cybersecurity standpoint without getting much into the internals of AI & ML . In the parts to follow, we will start looking closer (inside the box) at the AI & ML components.Traditional Cybersecurity of AI & ML SolutionsLike any new field, AI & ML bring a bunch of interesting artefacts, associated nuances and caveats with them that pose a challenge from a security standpoint.The two images below (from the Microsoft Azure documentation), show the typical artefacts and stakeholder groups involved at various stages of an end to end AI/ML workflow.The End-2-End Workflow — Lots of systems, data formats, tools, stakeholders, etc.The diaspora of development tools, platforms, frameworks, data handling, etc.Diagrams like these highlight the following characteristics of the nature and types of security challenges we are faced with:There is a huge ecosystem of (some old, some new) tools, languages, frameworks — with functions ranging from data ingestion, data pre-processing, modeling, model evaluation, integration, visualization, packaging & deployment, etc.Multiple stakeholders groups — ranging from traditional software engineers to machine learning engineers, data scientists and statisticians — are involved in any project.The complete working solution usually involves multiple systems coupled together at various interfaces.From a security standpoint, this is a lot of new and unknown things. We are looking at lots of new tools and frameworks, new people (stakeholder groups) and new systems or combinations of systems. Setting aside the specifics/internals of AI & ML for the moment, even just traditional cybersecurity tends to be hard to do well in such a context. This is because often new tools and frameworks take time to become ‘secure enough’, new stakeholder groups may not always have a uniform understanding or awareness of security and, thirdly, solutions involving many systems and interfaces have had a history of interesting security failures at the boundaries/interfaces.A Note about the ‘Data’ in Data ScienceNow let us look at the ‘data security’ side a bit. The following characteristics of data security challenges stand out in the context of AI & ML:In most solutions, huge (HUGE!) amounts of business data is involved. We are talking millions or even billions of records. And, depending upon the problem domain, these can have a tremendous amount of value (e.g., past transactions at a brokerage) or sensitivity (e.g., medical records from a chain of hospitals).Moreover, not only is huge volumes of data involved, the preference is to consider all attributes/aspects (dimensions) of data. This brings up interesting tension with ‘data minimization’ principles of privacy.Unlike traditional software engineering, typically one can’t use ‘dummy data’ for testing/pre-production stages in AI & ML. (The whole point is about ‘learning from data’!) So, at all points in the ecosystem, we are talking about various stakeholders and various systems handling precious real data. (E.g., the team of data scientists collaborating to develop a model have to get access to much of the same data during experimentation that you have painstakingly protected for years on production systems leading to business data getting onto systems it typically never did in the past.) The many iterations and requests for variety of data can disrupt any existing data governance you may have in place.Given that as a field AI & ML have ventured into all walks of life, we are looking at hundreds of hitherto obscure data and record formats (and corresponding readers, encoders and decoders). We have had a colorful history of security bugs just in the handful of the more popular encoding formats. Consider what lies ahead when we account for the multiplier effect.First Steps: Doing the Basics RightWhile they are indeed daunting, many of the above challenges should not be new for security practitioners. We have been through technology paradigm shifts in the past. We have seen how the foundational principles of good security do not change and how it is all about applying them after carefully understanding the nuances and unique requirements of any new context/ecosystem. At the end of the day, it should all boil down to doing the basics right — viz.,Ensure that all team members/stakeholders have a good basic understanding of security and privacy — things like data classification, data protection techniques, authentication/authorization, privacy principles, applicable regulatory requirements, etc. The goal should be to ensure that all stakeholders have role-appropriate understanding of security and privacy and everyone uses the same terminology and knows and understands relevant policy and standards.Have a good data governance structure is in place. Ownership and accountability should be clear for various stakeholders as data changes hands at different stages of each workflow. This is particularly important given the wide circulation of data that will be inevitable in ML & AI projects.Perform diligent threat modeling of solutions — both at component level and from an end to end perspective. This will ensure that security is ‘built in’ into the design and that applicable security requirements are met at every point in the end to end system (where valuable data is processed, stored or transmitted).When threat modeling, particular attention should be paid at boundaries and interfaces between the different sub-systems. Assumptions made by either side at those interfaces should be clearly documented and verified.Also, because production data is involved everywhere, be sure to exhaustively cover all workflows in the threat models— starting from the earliest experiments and proofs of concept to the fully operational system as it would be in deployed in production.Ensure that good programming practices are followed during implementation and, depending on the technologies used, appropriate vulnerabilities are mitigated (e.g., if some part of the solution is web-based, then the authentication token/cookies must be protected from attacks such as XSS, CSRF, etc.)Ensure that all threats/risks identified during threat modeling and considered important enough to address are actually fixed by performing a combination of feature security testing and penetration assessments.Make sure that native security models of different frameworks and sub-systems are adequately understood and rationalized to achieve uniform security across the system. This is particularly important because of the multiple, possibly disparate components and frameworks that will get ‘glued’ together to make up the end to end solution.Be careful about software components that are used by various stakeholders in different stages of the project or imported into the different ‘pipelines’. Use verified and signed components where possible and, where that is not an option, consider other factors such as developer reputation, extent of use, trustworthiness of the repository, comments and reviews, history of security issues/vulnerabilities, etc. These should help assess if the component may be good enough from a security quality perspective.Think about security of your deployment (CICD) pipeline. Do you have good control over who can change the build/release environment? Are you protecting any secrets/connection strings that are required for deployment adequately? Is your production setup locked down enough so that people cannot make ad hoc configuration changes?Exercise good monitoring and security hygiene. Make sure all software components are at their latest security patch level, conduct periodic access reviews, rotate keys/certificates, etc.Lastly, do have a good incident response plan in place so you can deal with a calamity if one does happen.Ok, so there we are! To a security professional, none of the above should sound new/novel. You must have done some or all of these in various problem contexts in the past. So this first aspect of security and privacy in AI & ML is much about applying all that expertise in a new context while partnering with all the stakeholders involved.But realize that we have approached the AI & ML components of the system as a ‘black box’ so far. Things start getting much more interesting when we look closer into that box. That is exactly what we will venture into in the next part of the series.

A 2018 research survey found that companies see competitors gearing up for big data and AI success — and that’s fueling their investment in similar capabilities.










After years of hope and promise, 2018 may be the year when artificial intelligence (AI) gains meaningful traction within Fortune 1000 companies. This is a key finding of NewVantage Partners’ annual executive survey, which finds that investment in big data and AI are increasing rapidly, though ROI remains elusive.
In this webinar, Randy Bean, CEO of NewVantage Partners and author of “How Big Data and AI Are Driving Business Innovation in 2018,” discusses the findings from the 2018 study of Fortune 1000 companies, gives examples, and shares his thoughts on the current and future states of big data and artificial intelligence implementation among leading business organizations.
In this webinar, you’ll learn:

Why gaps continue between what leaders say they are doing with big data and AI and what they are actually doing
Why big data and AI implementation can take far longer than companies anticipate
Why a combined short-term/long-term strategy for big data and AI is essential
How to “innovate around the edges” to achieve big data and AI success

Robots make food better
Making artificial intelligence about people 


                                                    Written by Jelle Steenbergen on Friday 27 July 2018                        

                    








 

Why robots won’t take your job, and how A.I. makes the food industry better at solving problems.
Whenever the subject of artificial intelligence or machine learning is broached, it’s not long before conversation turns towards automation. ‘Will robots take my job?’ is a pressing and increasingly real question on many people's minds. But while it’s true that the food industry is filled with tasks that could very well be done by automated machinery, the truly revolutionary A.I. applications are about people. They augment instead of automate.
 
If a human can’t do it, neither can a machine
One of the fundamental truths about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the all-encompassing algorithms is that it’s only as good as the data it is given. This type of technology thrives on good data, but is rendered ultimately useless without it. Simply put: if a human can’t do it, neither can a machine. This crucial interplay between man and machine is something that is often overlooked, but nevertheless vital to understand. We control what machines learn, and as a result we have the power to make A.I. about people.
 
Addressing a real human need
A.I., then, is about helping people. About addressing real needs and real problems in the areas A.I. excels at. These are three questions that show the strengths of artificial intelligence applications:


What is this?


Are these the same or different?


What happens next?


The first two questions have immediate and far-reaching implications for the food space. In the area of food waste, for example. using image recognition (what’s this?) and quick-fire categorization (are these the same?) is by far the most effective solution for measuring and mapping the sheer scale of the problem. A.I. can be used to determine where along the food chain waste happens, which products are the most vulnerable to waste, and how much food gets wasted. It’s a way of making sense of the images and numbers, and the data then gets passed back to humans, who are able to determine the best course of action to prevent the most amount of food waste. The algorithms augment human ability by helping us understand.

 
Fighting crop disease one seedling at a time
The agricultural sector, too, gets a great deal of mileage out of answers to these three questions. Fighting crop disease is a good example here. By feeding the machine with images portraying the visual symptoms of disease (what is this?), the A.I. can quickly determine whether or not a plant is diseased (are these the same?). Because it can virtually instantly determine this, it is feasible for farmers to select and remove individual blighted crops, thereby preserving most of the hale harvest.
 
Take a self-driving car to the burgerbot
The last question (what’s next?) is rather more complicated. Examples from outside the food industry are easier to find. Predictive power forms the core of self-driving cars, for example. Cutting edge video and photo editing programs also use it to enhance images or fill in blank spaces based. Within the food space, the most interesting example of predictive power, and A.I. in general is the newly minted Creator hamburger machine in San Francisco.

The benefits of automation
Creator (formerly known as momentum machines) is the result of nine years of development. It is a fully automated hamburger machine able to churn out 400 custom made hamburgers an hour without any human interaction. This is the dreaded robot come to take our jobs, then. Yet in many ways Creator is a shining example of augmentation, too. A nearly 15 foot contraption made up of 350 sensors, 50 actuators, and 20 computers, Creator uses the predictive power of A.I. to create perfect burgers, customizable to a degree that humans cannot accomplish. How much ketchup do you want on your burger, in milliliters please? How long would you like it cooked, down to the second or less?
 
Better ingredients and better jobs
By automating the food preparation process Creator is able to do two revolutionary things. The first is that it can source top quality ingredients while maintaining a very accessible price point ($6 per burger). The beef for the burger only gets ground once an order is placed. The vegetables are organic and locally grown. The sauces are homemade fresh every day. In any other restaurant the price would easily be double what Creator is asking. Making high quality, sustainable food available to a wider audience is certainly a good thing.
The second thing Creator does is it doesn’t replace staff, but rather allows them to focus on hospitality, interaction, and personal growth. The machine allows for people to do what people do best, instead of flipping burgers the staff is able to provide guests with a memorable hospitality experience. The staff is paid $16 an hour and given 5% of their time to work on their personal long term goals.
The robot didn’t take their job, it made their job better.
 
A tool like any other
Artificial Intelligence isn’t a looming presence threatening to disrupt the economy and put people out of jobs. It’s a tool like any other. A tool we control and direct as we see fit. Making A.I. about people is about applying the tool to problems that address a real human need. The machine can’t think for itself. They’re only as good as the people behind it. As long as we use it right, A.I. can make our lives better. It’s not up to the machine. It’s up to us.

Home  Industry  Technology UAE, India to partner on artificial intelligence, aim to generate $20bn in benefits
A joint working committee will seek to to increase investment in AI startups and research activities

The UAE has signed a partnership with India to develop artificial intelligence (AI) with plans to generate an $20bn in economic benefits during the next decade. 
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the India – UAE Artificial Intelligence Bridge will “spur discussion and explore options for both countries to grow their AI economies”, a statement said. 
AI is expected to maximise the efficiency and delivery of government services while also boosting the effectiveness of the private sector.
The UAE-India collaboration will seek to evaluate the dynamic nature of AI by convening a joint working committee between the UAE Ministry for Artificial Intelligence, Invest India and Startup India.
The committee will meet once a year with the mandate to increase investment in AI startups and research activities in partnership with the private sector.
The collaboration will broadly focus on three main areas, the statement added. They include – 
– Open Engagement: The working committee will monitor the landscape of AI to identify emerging trends and policy concerns. This will help develop “mutually favourable regulatory frameworks and policies without being outpaced by the speed of technological developments”, the statement said. 
There is potential to work together with governments, technology startups, academia and industry associations to understand how technology is evolving, what it means for the private and public sector, and how its adoption can be accelerated.
– Foster Innovative Ecosystems: Creating an enabling environment requires all concerned stakeholders to invest in AI. Initially this will entail creating AI regulatory sandboxes and the sharing of regulatory expertise to facilitate the entry of AI startups into each other’s jurisdiction. 
“Once the environment is set, the tools will be made available and that will come in the form of sharing datasets to enhance development and innovation of AI startups,” the statement said. 
– Looking to The Future: The collaboration will help both parties play a catalytic role in the development and adoption of breakthrough technologies. Research and development and investment in new technologies, tools and solutions in a controlled regulatory sandbox environment will be facilitated. This will allow stakeholders to engage and understand transformative tech. 
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai said: “Artificial Intelligence will lead human development in the coming years. The UAE and India will be at the forefront of the change to come.”
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi added that the Indian government is launching multiple initiatives through which the potential of AI can be realised in the areas of agriculture supply, healthcare and disaster management services. 
“The road ahead for artificial intelligence depends on and will be driven by human intentions,” he added.

It's a game changer for business, it can enable humans to work smarter and faster than ever before, and it could potentially have a significant impact on economies and the labor market.
But at the root of it all – the function which gives AI value – is the ability to make predictions. Calculating – more quickly and accurately than has ever been possible – what the likelihood is of a particular outcome, is the fundamental advance which AI brings to the table.

To start with, it’s worth defining what we mean when we talk about AI. In recent years the leaps in technology which have been generating the biggest buzz are around machine learning and deep learning. These are specific implementations of technology which can be used to give machines the ability to learn, without human input, by merely being fed data.
PROMOTED
This means they can become increasingly better at routine tasks – such as examining image data from cameras and working out what is shown, or reading through thousands of pages of documents and understanding the relevant pieces of information for the task at hand.

How this will affect the role of humans is a hot topic and the question is very much up in the air. Some predict that the near-future will see us becoming used to working alongside “smart” machines, hugely boosting our productivity. Others say the arrival of these machines will make us redundant when it comes to many forms of labor, leading to widespread unemployment and eventually civil unrest.
In their latest book: Prediction Machines – The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, authors Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb seek to demonstrate how that prediction is fundamental to the changes that AI makes possible. In their book they explain that understanding this concept – and preparing our reaction to it – could determine which of those two possible futures is likely to come about.

Key to this, they argue, will be whether human AI “managers” can learn to differentiate between tasks involving prediction, and those where a more human touch is still essential.
When I met with Joshua Gans – professor of strategic management and holder of the Jeffrey S Skoll Chair of Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto – he gave me some insight into how economists are tackling the issues raised by AI.
""As economists studying innovation and technological change, a conventional frame for trying to understand and forecast the impact of new technology would be to think about what the technology really reduces the cost of,"" he tells me.
""And really its an advance in statistical methods – a very big advance – and really not about intelligence at all, in a way a lot of people would understand the term ‘intelligence.' It's about one aspect of intelligence, which is prediction.
“When I look up at the sky and see there are grey clouds, I take that information and predict that it’s going to rain. When I’m going to catch a ball, I predict the physics of where it’s going to end up. I have to do a lot of other things to catch the ball, but one of the things I do is make that prediction.”
In business, we have to make these predictions many, many times each day. Will we make a higher profit by selling large volumes cheaply, or small volumes at a high price? Who is the best team member to take on a job? Where will we get the best ""bang for our buck"" out of our marketing budget?
Traditionally these predictions relied heavily on “gut instinct” – what our intuition or experience tells us is the likely outcome. They are data-driven too of course – our instincts are informed by what we’ve learned, but there’s only so much time that can be spent reading reports and books.
That generally isn't a constraint for a computer – which, if given the right algorithms, can automatically ingest vast amounts of data and use it to make predictions more quickly and accurately than we could ever hope to ourselves.
“Sometimes we [humans] avoid making decisions because we can’t make a prediction – we may have a ‘rule of thumb’ or something like that,” Gans explains.
“So what’s going to happen is that these prediction machines are going to make predictions better and faster and cheaper, and when you do that, two things happen. The first is that we will do a lot more predicting. And the second is that we will think of new ways of doing things for problems where the missing bit was prediction.”
Self-driving cars are an obvious example. The idea isn't new, but humans had struggled for decades with making them a reality, because there was no way to enable a machine to make the accurate predictions it would need to navigate safely. This changed with the arrival of machine learning and deep learning.
“People weren’t formulating it as a prediction problem and, once we got the tools, lo and behold, they started to make improvements,” Gans says.
So what does this actually all mean, for us as humans?
“Well, firstly, as heavy users of predictions, it’s good news for us,” he says. “Predictions are something we like, and we’re getting them faster and cheaper, so that’s good.”
As an example, he asks me to think about a school bus driver.
“Ok, so we can replace a human driver with an automated vehicle – great! So we throw the driver off the bus and get a robot to go and pick up the children. But then you immediately think – wait a second – a whole load of unsupervised children on a bus sounds like a stupid idea.”
As tempting a solution as it sounds, human rights organizations probably wouldn’t look too kindly on the idea of also giving robots the ability to discipline unruly children during transit.
A more socially acceptable solution could be to replace the drivers with human supervisors or, more productively, educators.
“Then we could start the lessons as soon as the kids get on the bus,” says Gans. “Or we could have the school assembly on the bus. It frees up time – we just have to be imaginative.”
The fact is, no one right now knows what impact AI will have had on society in 20 years’ time, let alone 50 or 100 years.
Advances which genuinely can make humans redundant on a large scale are likely to take some time to come to fruition.
“I know people talk about the concept of the ‘singularity’ and that it’s all going to happen overnight. But I don’t know if it’s actually going to occur that way,” Gans tells me.
""It's likely to be slowly, slowly … and I feel that slow-moving problems are the ones we work out how to deal with. That would be the source of my confidence.""

Artificial intelligence is already reshaping society as we know it in both business and consumer realms. Early use cases with Alexa, autonomous vehicles and AI-driven supply chains provide just a glimpse of the disruption that AI is poised to deliver in the near future and for years to come.Yet despite all the AI hype and initial successes, it remains in its infancy. That makes now the ideal time for young people to build the knowledge, skill sets and connections they need to capitalize on the fast-growing market for AI jobs and build a strong AI career.One reason is simply practical. Gartner predicts that AI may eliminate 1.8 million jobs by 2020, yet is on track to create 2.3 million new positions. It clearly makes sense to map out an AI career path as new roles emerge that focus on problem-solving, collaboration and strategic decision-making.



The second reason is that AI offers a truly exciting opportunity to make an impact on our world. AI is an ideal career path for undergraduates and recent graduates with a passion for technology and an entrepreneurial spirit who relish a challenge and a front-line role in game-changing innovation.Related: This Is How to Get Started With AI When the Only Thing You Know Is the Acronym


AI has been called ""the next Industrial Revolution,"" and I think that analogy is spot on. The convergence of machine learning, big data and internet-scale cloud compute power is opening opportunities to transform healthcare, grow the economy, reduce waste, save energy, improve education, strengthen security and decrease poverty.There's virtually no area of society that will be untouched by AI. Given the myriad possibilities, how does a young person chart his or her course in the AI field?Practical steps to an AI career.One first step is to simply narrow down key interests and strengths. AI offers technological roles in data science, machine learning development and architecting an AI technology stack. And it offers plenty of positions as a user or analyst with AI software, or in sales and marketing, HR, customer support and more.Company type is another important consideration, as B2B and B2C can be distinctly different work environments. Candidates should also target industries they gravitate toward, be it technology, manufacturing, retail, higher education, services or others. To narrow down interests, hands-on research and learning is available through avenues such as:


AI and data science courses. Many free and low-cost online learning opportunities in AI can be found at providers such as Udacity, Coursera, Codeacademy and fast.ai. These courses are a great way to build knowledge and enrich a resume.Industry and company conferences. AI experts and thought leaders discuss trends at conferences hosted by NIPS, Re-Work, O'Reilly, Gartner and others, while AI vendors also sponsor conferences. Students and young professionals are often able to gain free or discounted admission.Related: Robots Are Our Friends -- How Artifical Intelligence Is Leveling-Up MarketingMeetup.com. The website lists many regional in-person meetups among AI enthusiasts, as well as online groups and discussions on topical areas including machine learning, Python, R, data science and advanced statistics.


General immersion. Keeping up-to-date on fast-moving AI news and trends pays off. So does using AI products, sharing code on GitHub or entering a code contest on the global Kaggle community. In short, would-be AI professionals should learn as much as they can, as fast as they can.With this knowledge, young people are better able to address two key questions that can guide AI careers:What's my prospective employer's technology stack?What are the employer's leadership motivations and potential social impact?As a Stanford graduate now working in artificial intelligence, those were critical considerations for me as I looked to move from traditional software companies into the AI space. I had decided to pursue an AI career because of the positive change that AI promises to unleash. It was a matter of finding an employer that aligned with my interests and skills.The technology stack.Impactful AI is not easy to build. It is complex, and the success of any AI company depends on a strong technology base. Yet some companies label themselves as AI simply to jump on the bandwagon. Discerning true AI companies from pretenders sets the stage for a gratifying first job and successful career.


Effective AI must have strong compute power, access to large data sets and the ability to understand, predict, recommend and act. In particular, machine learning is largely driving the recent success of AI. Products with machine learning will be especially impactful.Related: Walking With AI: How to Spot, Store and Clean the Data You NeedCompany direction.What are the motivations of the leadership team? AI can have a major impact on driving positive change. However, since the technology is particularly powerful, it is important to keep in mind what the mission of the company is and the motivations of the leadership team.With AI, keeping in mind potential social impact is also important. In particular, those job-seekers who value a role in bettering society with technology should diligently size up early successes and long-term benefits of any prospective employer.


AI is already transforming the job market. In fact, LinkedIn's 2017 Emerging Jobs Report found that machine learning engineers and data scientists are the two fastest-growing new jobs in the U.S. Now is the time for young people to assess what a role in AI could mean and take proactive steps to launch a successful career.

Machines Can Do That, TooShare full articleRead in appA Stitch Fix warehouse in San Francisco. The company relies on algorithms to help personalize shipments to customers.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesBy Noam ScheiberJuly 7, 2018One of the best-selling T-shirts for the Indian e-commerce site Myntra is an olive, blue and yellow colorblocked design. It was conceived not by a human but by a computer algorithm — or rather two algorithms.The first algorithm generated random images that it tried to pass off as clothing. The second had to distinguish between those images and clothes in Myntra’s inventory. Through a long game of one-upmanship, the first algorithm got better at producing images that resembled clothing, and the second got better at determining whether they were like — but not identical to — actual products.This back and forth, an example of artificial intelligence at work, created designs whose sales are now “growing at 100 percent,” said Ananth Narayanan, the company’s chief executive. “It’s working.”Clothing design is only the leading edge of the way algorithms are transforming the fashion and retail industries. Companies now routinely use artificial intelligence to decide which clothes to stock and what to recommend to customers.And fashion, which has long shed blue-collar jobs in the United States, is in turn a leading example of how artificial intelligence is affecting a range of white-collar work as well. That’s especially true of jobs that place a premium on spotting patterns, from picking stocks to diagnosing cancer.ImageA popular T-shirt sold on the Indian e-commerce site Myntra was conceived by two algorithms. One generated random images; the other identified those that resembled existing designs without duplicating them. “A much broader set of tasks will be automated or augmented by machines over the coming years,” Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tom Mitchell, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist, wrote in the journal Science last year. They argued that most of the jobs affected would become partly automated rather than disappear altogether.The fashion industry illustrates how machines can intrude even on workers known more for their creativity than for cold empirical judgments. Among those directly affected will be the buyers and merchandise planners who decide which dresses, tops and pants should populate their stores’ inventory.A key part of a buyer’s job is to anticipate what customers will want using a well-honed sense of where fashion trends are headed. “Based on the fact that you sold 500 pairs of platform shoes last month, maybe you could sell 1,000 next month,” said Kristina Shiroka, who spent several years as a buyer for the Outnet, an online retailer. “But people might be over it by then, so you cut the buy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMerchandise planners then use the buyer’s input to figure out what mix of clothing — say, how many sandals, pumps and flats — will help the company reach its sales goals.In the small but growing precincts of the industry where high-powered algorithms roam free, however, it is the machine — and not the buyer’s gut — that often anticipates what customers will want.ImageStitch Fix’s business would probably not exist without the use of algorithms. Among other things, they project how many clients will be in a certain situation, or “state,” several months in the future, and what volume of clothes people buy in each situation.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesThat’s the case at Stitch Fix, an online styling service that sends customers boxes of clothing whose contents they can keep or return, and maintains detailed profiles of customers to personalize their shipments.Stitch Fix relies heavily on algorithms to guide its buying decisions — in fact, its business probably could not exist without them. Those algorithms project how many clients will be in a given situation, or “state,” several months into the future (like expanding their wardrobe after, say, starting a new job), and what volume of clothes people tend to buy in each situation. The algorithms also know which styles people with different profiles tend to favor — say, a petite nurse with children who lives in Texas.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMyntra, the Indian online retailer, arms its buyers with algorithms that calculate the probability that an item will sell well based on how clothes with similar attributes — sleeves, colors, fabric — have sold in the past. (The buyers are free to ignore the projection.)All of this has clouded the future of buyers and merchandise planners, high-status workers whose annual earnings can exceed $100,000.At more conventional retailers, a team of buyers and support workers is assigned to each type of clothing (like designer, contemporary or casual) or each apparel category, like dresses or tops. Some retailers have separate teams for knit tops and woven tops. A parallel merchandise-planning group could employ nearly as many people.ImageBombfell, which is similar to Stitch Fix but caters specifically to men, relies on a single buyer for its tops and accessories. The company’s data and algorithmic tools help the buyer project clothing demand.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York TimesBuyers say this specialization helps them intuitively understand trends in styles and colors. “You’re so immersed in it, you almost get a feeling,” said Helena Levin, a longtime buyer at retailers like Charlotte Russe and ModCloth.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Levin cited mint-green dresses, a top seller earlier this decade. “One day it just died,” she said. “It stopped. ‘O.K., everything mint, get out.’ Right after, it looked old. You could feel it.”But retailers adept at using algorithms and big data tend to employ fewer buyers and assign each a wider range of categories, partly because they rely less on intuition.At Le Tote, an online rental and retail service for women’s clothing that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business each year, a six-person team handles buying for all branded apparel — dresses, tops, pants, jackets.Brett Northart, a co-founder, said the company’s algorithms could identify what to add to its stock based on how many customers placed the items on their digital wish lists, along with factors like online ratings and recent purchases.ImageNathan Cates, a Bombfell buyer, in a T-shirt from among the company’s offerings, with Will Noguchi, a stylist.

Mr. Cates is obsessive about touching the fabric before purchasing an item and almost always tries it on first.“If this is a light color, are we going to see your nipples?” he explained. (The verdict on a mint T-shirt he donned at the company’s headquarters in New York? “A little nipply.”)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageOne sector of the fashion industry that is adding jobs is the ranks of the stylists who pick clothes to send to customers, based partly on recommendations from algorithms. One stylist, Mary Kate Makowski, fulfilled an order at Trunk Club.Credit...Whitten Sabbatini for The New York TimesThere are other checks on automation. Negotiations with suppliers typically require a human touch. Even if an algorithm can help buyers make decisions more quickly and accurately, there are limits to the number of supplier relationships they can juggle.Arti Zeighami, who oversees advanced analytics and artificial intelligence for the H & M group, which uses artificial intelligence to guide supply-chain decisions, said the company was “enhancing and empowering” human buyers and planners, not replacing them. But he conceded it was hard to predict the effect on employment in five to 10 years.Experts say some of these jobs will be automated away. The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment of wholesale and retail buyers to contract by 2 percent over a decade, versus a 7 percent increase for all occupations. Some of this is because of the automation of less sophisticated tasks, like cataloging inventory, and buying for less stylistically demanding retailers (say, auto parts).There is at least one area of the industry where the machines are creating jobs rather than eliminating them, however. Bombfell, Stitch Fix and many competitors in the box-fashion niche employ a growing army of human stylists who receive recommendations from algorithms about clothes that might work for a customer, but decide for themselves what to send.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If they’re not overly enthusiastic upfront when I ask how do you feel about it, I’m making a note of it,” said Jade Carmosino, a sales manager and stylist at Trunk Club, a Stitch Fix competitor owned by Nordstrom.In this, stylists appear to reflect a broader trend in industries where artificial intelligence is automating white-collar jobs: the hiring of more humans to stand between machines and customers.For example, Chida Khatua, the chief executive of EquBot, which helped create an exchange-traded fund that is  actively managed by artificial intelligence, predicted that the asset-management industry would hire more financial advisers even as investing became largely automated.The downside is that work as a stylist or financial adviser will probably pay less than the lost jobs of buyers and stock pickers. The good news, said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who studies automation, is that these jobs may still pay substantially more than many positions available to low- and middle-skilled workers in recent decades.And these jobs may be hard to automate in the end.“If I’m the customer explaining what I want, humans need to be involved,” Mr. Khatua said. “Sometimes I don’t know what I really want.”Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiber.

13 major Artificial Intelligence trends to watch for in 2018

By Aditya Chaturvedi -   07/10/2018      7 Minutes Read 




Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the peculiar ability to simultaneously amaze, enthrall, leave us gasping and intimidate. The possibilities of AI are innumerable and they easily surpass our most artistically fecund imaginations. What all we read in science fiction novels or saw in movies like ‘The Matrix’ could someday materialize into reality. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, recently said that ‘AI can be our friend’ and is good for the society. From decision-making to computing to robotics to vehicles and even cosmetics, AI has left its mark everywhere and it will usher in the grandest social engineering experiment in the history of the world.
CBInsights has prepared a list of the major AI trends to follow in 2018. Let’s have a look at the 13 trends In AI that will have a huge impact in years to come.
Robotic workforce
It is no more a closely guarded secret that in the future much of the labor-intensive work in assembly lines of factories would be done by AI programmed robots and not workers. This would bring down the cost of hiring workers and also reduce outsourcing and offshoring.
Recently, a Chinese T-shirt manufacturer Tianyuan Garments Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Arkansas government to employ 400 workers at $14/hr at its new garment factory in Arkansas. Operations were scheduled to begin by the end of 2017. Tianyuan’s factory in Little Rock, Arkansas, will use sewing robots developed by Georgia-based startup SoftWear Automation to manufacture apparel.
In Japan, by 2025, more than 80% of elderly care would be done by robots, not caregivers.
Ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence impacts multiple fields, even those that we least expect it to. Machine learning, a crucial component of AI, refers to the training of algorithms on large data sets so that they learn how to identify desired patterns better at their tasks.
The functioning of AI is getting more versatile with each passing day.
UK’s IntelligentX wants to introduce the world’s first AI brewed beer; DeepFish in Russia is using neural networks to identify fish, and Sweden’s Hoofstep is raising VC money to bring deep learning-based behavioral analysis to horses.

China is all set to prove its prowess in AI and outshine the US and other western countries. The Chinese government is investing a lot in this futuristic technology.
The Chinese government is promoting an intelligence plan. It includes everything from smart agriculture and intelligent logistics to military applications.
In 2017 China’s artificial intelligence startups took 48% of all dollars going to AI startups globally in, more than that of the USA. In deep learning also China publishes six times more patents than the US.
The US is also, seemingly, losing its preponderance in AI startups to China. In technologies like face recognition, China has poured in billions.
In July 2017, the Chinese government said it planned to reach the level of United States in artificial intelligence by 2020 and become the world leader by 2030. One government-backed project is to create a chip that has 20 times the performance and energy efficiency of NVIDIA’s GPUs. Chinese company Cambricon is pledging to make one billion processing units in the next three years and is developing chips specifically for deep learning.
Battlefields in the age of AI
The wars of the future will rely on smart technology like never before. Drones are just the beginning. With the increasing convergence of conventional defense, surveillance, and reconnaissance with cybersecurity, the need for algorithm-based AI only expands.
Cybersecurity is a real opportunity area for AI since attacks are constantly-evolving and the main challenge is new forms of malware. Prima facie, AI would have an extra edge here given its ability to operate at scale and sift through millions of incidents to identify aberrations, risks, and signals of future threats.
The market is mushrooming with new cybersecurity companies trying to leverage machine learning to some extent.
A total of 134 startups have raised $3.65B in equity funding in the last 5 years. About 34 of them raised equity for the first time last year to compete in a market still dominated by larger companies like Cybereason, CrowdStrike, Cylance, and Tanium.
Voice Assistants
Voice-enabled computing was all over at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2018. Barely any IoT device was without integration into the Amazon Echo or Google Home.
Samsung is also working on its own voice assistant, Bixby. It wants all of its products to be internet-connected and have intelligence from Bixby by 2020.
LG made all of its appliances in 2017 WiFi-enabled.
AI to throw the gauntlet before professionals
Skilled professionals — including lawyers, consultants, financial advisors etc —will face the heat of artificial intelligence as much as unskilled and semi-skilled workers.
For instance, artificial intelligence has huge potential to reduce the time and improve efficiency in legal work. As AI platforms become more efficient, affordable and commercialized, this will influence the remuneration structure of external law firms that charge by the hour.
Decentralization and Democratization

Artificial Intelligence isn’t only limited to powerful supercomputers and big devices; it is also becoming a part and parcel of smartphones and wearable devices and equipment. Edge computing is emerging as the next big area in AI.
Apple released its A11 chip with a neural engine for iPhone 8 and X. Apple claims it can perform machine learning tasks at up to 600B operations per second.
Another case for edge AI would be training your personal AI assistant locally on your device to recognize your unique accent or identify faces.

Capsule Networks
Neural networks have myriad architectures. One of the most popular one in deep learning these days is known as convolutional neural networks. Now a new architecture, capsule networks, has been developed and it would outpace the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multiple fronts.
CNNs have certain limitations that lead to lack of performance or gaps in security.
Capsule Networks would allow AIs to identify general patterns with less data and be less susceptible to false results.
Capsule Networks would take relative positions and orientation of an object into consideration without needing to be trained exhaustively on variations.
Dream salaries in AI talent hunt
As per a recent report, the approximate number of qualified researchers currently in the field of AI is 300,000, including students in relevant research areas. Meanwhile, companies require a million or more AI specialists for their engineering needs.
In the US, a Glassdoor search for “artificial intelligence” shows over 32,000 jobs currently listed, with several salary ranges well into the 6 digits. Companies are more than willing to pay handsome emoluments to intelligent AI experts.

 Bigwigs of enterprise AI
As tech giants like Google, Amazon, Salesforce, and Microsoft improve their enterprise AI capability, it would be very difficult for the smaller players to sustain themselves.
Google released Cloud AutoML. Customers can bring their own data to train the algorithms to suit their specific needs.
Amazon began selling AI-as-a-Service with “Amazon AI” under its AWS banner. Amazon AI‘s goal is to serve big.
AI medical diagnostics

Regulators in the US are looking forward at approving AI for use in clinical settings. The advantage of AI in diagnostics is early detection and better accuracy.
Machine learning algorithms can compare a medical image with those of millions of other patients, picking up on nuances that a human eye may otherwise miss.
Consumer-focused AI monitoring tools like SkinVision — which uses computer vision to monitor suspicious skin boils — are already in use. But a new wave of healthcare AI applications will set the ground for machine learning capabilities in hospitals and clinics.
Recently, AstraZeneca, an Anglo–Swedish pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company, declared a partnership with Alibaba subsidiary Ali Health to develop AI-assisted screening and diagnostics applications in China.
GE and Nvidia have also joined hands to bring deep learning capabilities to GE’s medical imaging devices.
Build your own AI
Because of open source software libraries, hundreds of APIs and SDKs, and easy assembly kits from Amazon and Google, the barrier to entry in AI could not have been lower. Google launched an “AI for all ages” project called AIY (artificial Intelligence yourself).
Its first product was a voice recognition kit for Raspberry Pi that enabled the users to give any voice they desired to their personal voice assistant.
Point of no return for Machine Learning? 
2017 was the peak year for machine learning, but now the graph is expected to fall steeply. Courtesy: CBInsights
First was big data, and then came cloud, then the machine learning frenzy. We reached peak machine learning in 2017.
Last year investors pumped in over $15.2B in funding to AI startups across multiple industries. It was a 141% spike in funding from 2016.
Over 1,100 new AI companies have raised their first rounds of funding since 2016. And that’s more than half the historic number of AI startups that have ever raised an equity round.
The normalization and mainstreaming of machine learning will make investors picky about the AI companies they fund.

A.I. for Social Good?
Data science has the power to transform nonprofit work. Leaders are thrilled by the opportunity to scour vast amounts of data for connections but unnerved by the prospect of data tainted by bias and unseen algorithms deciding who gets services. For our July cover package, the Chronicle examines how philanthropy is grappling with what it means when machines take on tasks that humans usually to do.


Opinion: Chatbots, A.I., Cyborgs, and More Have the Potential to Help Fundraising


How Charities Are Using Artificial Intelligence to Boost Impact




 As the five-year-old group gained experience, however, it turned to data to triage incoming messages. Using past text exchanges with people who were suicidal, it trained an algorithm to identify the highest-risk texters, label them “code orange,” and move them to the top of the list. Now, instead of poring over messages, counselors click a button marked “Help another texter.” The algorithm eventually proved so effective that it identified 86 percent of the people who are suicidal within their first couple messages. The result: People at greatest risk got help faster, and overall wait times dropped by roughly 40 percent. Today Crisis Text Line’s algorithms monitor the conversations. An exchange might drop down from code orange if the counselor de-escalates the situation or might move up to code orange as a texter opens up about more severe problems. The group is working on a system that will color code conversations by level of severity.

 The Crisis Text Line employees who supervise counselors often oversee 20 or more conversations at once. The ongoing risk assessment helps them determine which exchanges warrant the most attention. “What we’re talking about is real-time analysis,” says Bob Filbin, chief data scientist at Crisis Text Line. “The true end game of artificial intelligence is thinking like a human would think at the speed or better than a human would think.” Crisis Text Line’s innovation illustrates the potential for artificial intelligence, or A.I., to transform the nonprofit world. But talk of A.I. makes Filbin uncomfortable. He’d rather call it machine learning or data science. The term “artificial intelligence” can be polarizing and comes with baggage about moral values, he says. “People either really like it or really dislike it,” Filbin says. “Personally, I think it distracts from the work.” As Filbin suggests, the nonprofit field is equal parts thrilled and unnerved by the promise of artificial intelligence for social good. Leaders marvel at the opportunity to scour huge amounts of data for connections that would otherwise go unnoticed. But the specter of unseen algorithms deciding who gets services and the fear of bias-tainted data make the technological future seem more menacing than transformational. And nonprofits are terrified about what clients and the public would think about computers taking over tasks traditionally done by people.

Sorting Photos with A.I.
Motion-sensitive cameras snap hundreds of thousands of photographs that scientists at the Lincoln Park Zoo study to learn about the coyotes, raccoons, and other critters that prowl greater Chicago. An employee or volunteer reviews each image and culls any in which incidental motion triggers the camera — a task so painstaking and slow that the zoo has a two-year backlog. The researchers, however, are working with a data-science company to train an algorithm to label the animal images — and to select the roughly 70 percent of photos that include no wildlife at all and the 10 percent that show humans.

 Ambitious Projects The number of charities that deploy artificial intelligence is still minuscule, but interest is growing. Sometimes the technology drives ambitious projects. The Anti-Defamation League, for example, uses artificial intelligence to better understand online hate speech, information that shapes its prescriptions for lawmakers and tech companies. The research would be nearly impossible to do any other way, says Brittan Heller, director of technology and society at the nonprofit. “What A.I. does is identify patterns at scale.” Perhaps the most common nonprofit use is to automate repetitive tasks. To glimpse the hidden lives of urban wildlife, researchers at the Lincoln Park Zoo study thousands of photographs taken by motion-sensitive cameras installed throughout Chicago and its suburbs. The cameras take 400,000 to 500,000 pictures annually, with a staff member or volunteer reviewing each one. It’s an enormous task, and there’s a two-year backlog. Uptake.org, the philanthropic arm of the artificial-intelligence company Uptake, is teaming up with the Urban Wildlife Institute, a research center at the zoo, to train an algorithm to electronically label the photos. Ultimately, the organizations hope the technology will differentiate between, say, a coyote and a racoon. First, however, the algorithm has to learn to weed out the thousands of images in which something other than wildlife — like grass blowing in the wind — triggered the camera. Some 70 percent of photos show no living creatures. Another 10 percent show people.

 Just eliminating those photos could enhance the institute’s ability to influence policy and planning decisions, says Seth Magle, the institute’s director. He often fields questions like, Does your data show there are fewer squirrels this year? “Right now what we have to tell them is, ‘Well, we’re so backlogged I don’t know. I’m still working on data from three years ago,’ "" Magle says. Benefit and Risk Even the biggest backers of artificial intelligence argue that its benefits come with risks. “Like any tool, if it’s misused, it’s going to cause harm,” says Andrew Means, director of Uptake.org. “The new thing is that the scale of harm can be quite large if it goes unchecked. But that also means that the scale of benefit can be larger than ever before as well.”  In addition to the work with the Urban Wildlife Institute, Means and his Uptake.org team are developing A.I. tools to help low-income students decide where to go to college. It’s also building a system to improve collaboration among anti-trafficking groups. For the past five years, Means has been organizing conferences about nonprofit data use, including the Good Tech Fest in May.

 Still, he worries about data science done badly. Analysts don’t always understand the data they work with, know what they can build with it, or grasp its limits. The buzz about data science is attracting new people to the field, not all of whom are skilled, Means says. “They’re misinterpreting data all over the place.” Critics also worry that combining flawed data and advanced analytics will replicate and magnify discrimination. Take criminal-justice data. Researchers and others are concerned that policing practices and prosecution are racially biased. Yet numbers generated from law-enforcement agencies and criminal-justice proceedings are plugged into algorithms designed to predict, for instance, which criminals are likely to land in jail again. It’s fair to ask: Is the algorithm’s end product accurate, or does it reflect bias? “Garbage in, garbage out,” says Roy Austin, who co-authored a report on big data and civil rights when he was director of the Office of Urban Affairs, Justice, and Opportunity in the Obama White House.

 Officials at the Laura and John Arnold Foundation think a lot about such issues. They acknowledge shortcomings in criminal-justice data but still think the information is critical. The foundation is taking on the cash-bail system, which often results in indigent defendants languishing in jail before they are tried. Detention can mean the loss of a job, housing, or even child custody. It also creates an incentive for people to accept a plea deal whether or not they committed the crime. One way the foundation is trying to reduce unnecessary pretrial detention: Public Safety Assessment, which judges can use to help decide whether to release a defendant or set bail. Created with outside experts, the tool relies on an algorithm with nine factors to gauge the risk of a defendant committing a new crime if released before trial or failing to appear for future hearings. The foundation lists on its website those nine factors and how they’re weighted. Perhaps most important, the tool determines risk scores drawing on convictions data, not arrests. “Arrests don’t always lead to convictions, and arrests are sometimes made on a flimsy legal basis,” says Jeremy Travis, executive vice president of criminal justice at the foundation. The assessment is currently in use in 40 jurisdictions, including statewide in Arizona, Kentucky, and New Jersey. More than 500 jurisdictions have expressed interest in it. The foundation is looking for a national organization to help it make the assessment available broadly. Travis says he understands critics’ concerns that such assessments will perpetuate past injustices, but he says the alternative is the inconsistency that comes with each judge.

 “It doesn’t make the decisions for them,” he says. “But if it guides the decisions and there’s less subjectivity in those decisions, that’s progress.” The Omidyar Network is thinking about how data is used by the biggest supporter of nonprofits — governments. It has long supported efforts to encourage policy makers to be transparent and release more data to the public. Over time, the network’s leaders became concerned about how that data was being used. “When the allocation of public resources is being decided by an automated decision-making system, it raises massive questions of fairness, of bias, of inclusion, exclusion, and equity,” says Martin Tisné, an investment partner at Omidyar. Three years ago, the network began making grants related to digital rights. It supports organizations that conduct research on artificial intelligence and recommends how to regulate data use. Last year Omidyar committed $10 million to help create the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, which supports research on A.I. in the public interest. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, the Knight Foundation, and others kicked in $17 million more. The race is on to determine how data use and artificial intelligence will be regulated, Tisné says. “I fundamentally believe that the public should have a voice in those matters.”

 Human vs. Machine The opportunity to automate decision making is alluring. But some leaders worry about removing the human element from decision making. Overwhelmed by people in need, social-service organizations could be tempted to turn tough decisions over to an algorithm, says Allison Fine, an expert on nonprofit leadership and strategy. She argues the field needs to think carefully about what tasks are appropriate for computers. 







Feeding Children EverywhereFeeding Children Everywhere’s Fed 40 mobile app lets people apply easily for temporary food assistance.


 “It’s really easy to begin to have the machines do the hard work of choosing who gets services and who doesn’t,” Fine says. “You’re going to lose that empathetic touch if we head toward too much automation.” Feeding Children Everywhere decided the benefits of A.I. outweigh the costs. The Florida nonprofit’s Fed 40 program lets applicants apply for temporary food assistance, often during a crisis, through a mobile app. Those who qualify are mailed the ingredients for 40 free meals. Roughly half of applicants qualify automatically, but when even one criterion is missed, an employee reviews the application. As the program grew, the nonprofit realized it would need to hire more case workers to keep up with applications. But when employees listed the reasons a denied applicant might be approved after further consideration, it became clear that artificial intelligence could identify the patterns. Some applicants, for example, had made too much money to qualify but recently lost a job or were the victim of a natural disaster.

 The organization used previously approved applications to train an algorithm that now reviews requests that don’t meet basic requirements. As a check, case workers now review applications denied by the algorithm. Eventually, however, technology will make the final call. What clinched the decision? By not hiring more case workers, the charity will provide 200,000 more meals next year. Sensitive to the concern that technology lacks heart, Feeding Children Everywhere named its A.I. effort Project Teresa in honor of Mother Teresa. “Anybody who’s on the team working on this understands that a compassionate approach is our number-one goal,” says Dave Green, the nonprofit’s CEO. 







Feeding Children EverywhereUsing its Fed 40 app and artificial intelligence, Feeding Children Everywhere can sort efficiently through applications for food aid. Thanks to the technology, the organization’s volunteers and staff will prepare and provide 200,000 more meals next year.


 Green says that his family was denied food assistance when he was a child, an experience that has shaped his leadership of the group. He says auditing technology-produced denials in the beginning will ensure that no one truly in need is turned away and that the artificial intelligence will continue to improve over time. “It’s like if you hired an employee to look at those applications; they’d get better and better and better over time, knowing what they can approve or deny,” he says. “The difference is that with an employee, they get promoted, they move to a new department, or they move on to a different job.” The Empathy Factor Technology has always been critical to Beyond 12’s work to help first-generation and low-income college students complete their degrees. The charity pairs students with “virtual coaches,” recent graduates who help them navigate college life by phone, email, and even Snapchat.

 The charity now is using technology to provide automatic services, which in turn will mean the group can work with more students. Step one is an app that sends students notifications about things like the deadline for picking courses. The group also plans to add a chatbot to answer students’ most frequent questions: Can I drop a class after the add-drop period? Where can I find my PIN number for the financial-aid website? Coaches are on hand if students run into problems, and they call every two weeks and text or email between conversations. Over time, Beyond 12 wants to use artificial intelligence to analyze data and predict when a student is headed for trouble. With that, coaches could spend more time working out small issues before they snowball and focus a little less on students who are thriving. “This came from our coaches,” says Alexandra Bernadotte, founder and CEO of Beyond 12. Counselors complain that because basic logistics conversations take so much time, they can’t do enough to inspire students and encourage big-picture thinking. Artificial intelligence will never replace coaches, Bernadotte says. The technology’s greatest promise is to manage rote tasks so employees have more time for the things that people still do best. “Humans can’t scale, but machines can’t empathize.”

Artificial Intelligence Readiness and -Performance BenchmarkCapgemini2018-07-10 


Artificial Intelligence (AI) will disrupt a large breath of markets and transform organizations, institutions and societies. AI is expected to bring profound positive impacts while at the same time there are also possible risks and pitfalls to watch out for. For countries, it is therefore of paramount importance to become ‘AI ready’, thus to gain the ability to reap the benefits of AI. Capgemini Consulting conducted a benchmark of countries to compare and see where they stand in this process of becoming an ‘AI ready’.  “Artificial intelligence readiness is the extent to which a country and its institutions & businesses have the ability to reap the benefits of AI”
The benchmark contains indicators for three large components that are defined as the foundation of AI readiness, namely the (1) Institutional Environment, the (2) Technological Maturity and the (3) Skill Advancement. These are aggregated to form a total score on which a countries rank is based. The results are as follow:


We also conducted an assessment of the level of performance in AI.  “AI performance is the extent to which a country and its institutions & businesses have committed to the pursuit of a leading position in artificial intelligence.”
The AI Performance Benchmark uses performance indicators to indicate a global leadership rank by creating five categories: (1) Personnel, (2) Monetary Impact, (3) Competitiveness, (4) Research & Education and (5) Technology.


The detailed AI Readiness and -Performance Benchmark can be downloaded here: AI Readiness Benchmark.
To avoid missing out on the potential of AI and to safeguard us from any potential risks, companies and countries need to make fundamental changes to become ready for integrating AI holistically into their strategies, operations and lives. These policy changes should be made to aid in this process:

AI awareness should be increased by intensively experimenting with AI
Existing legal frameworks need to be revised to create a favourable AI-enabled environment
SMEs and bigger companies should work collaboratively and prioritize the low complexity and high benefit projects to create quick wins
Data sharing and accessibility should be stimulated in initiatives and innovation hubs
The skills gap between the general workforce and the one that can work with AI needs to be decreased

We can predict the topic of the comic from the description of the comic.xkcd is an excellent example of time well wasted.My circle of friends has a huge nerd crush on Randall Munroe, the author of the xkcd comics, and books like what if?. Mary Kate MacPherson took the initiative, and scraped the transcripts for every comic, and used my patent analyzer code to turn the transcripts into embedding vectors. She then tossed the vectors and labels into tensorflow and crunched the data down into clusters using t-SNE. Those of you who know xkcd.com will be well aware that the comics are numbered sequentially. I have a bet going that Randall will mention when the comic number is the same as the current year (2018) and so I have to publish this article quickly! As of writing this sentence he is already at 2017!Here is a video of how that dimensionality reduction looks, both in 3D and in 2D:Sorry I didn’t have the time to clip and edit the video like I wanted to, so it’s a bit long. Feel free to jump around and see the difference between 2D and 3D, and other settings. A learning rate of 1 worked best for us. The result we used is shown in an annotated screenshot below.The output of t-SNE dimensionality reduction was a bunch of points in 2D space, crunched down from the original 300 dimensional embedding space.Mary Kate MacPherson then looked through the clusters on the 2D result to understand what they mean. The figure below shows us that the articles cluster by topic and entity.This is our look into Randall Munroe’s brain.Looking at the the big picture, we can see that comics about food clump together, as do articles about star wars, trends, wordplay, kids, charts/diagrams, and so forth. As humans we can identify small clusters of a dozen or less items (e.g. kid cluster), but in order to do a really good job, deep learning wants to see lots of examples, and so I will show you how to build an xkcd topic model below using fewer clusters. For context, xkcd.com has a total of about 2,000 comics.Let’s have a look at how the comics cluster in the time domain:Brighter dot = newer comic. Darker dot = older comic.Here is a look at the original code:Original patent application to vectors code… but comics are way more fun!Applying t-SNE and GMM in python, we get the following clusters:Not super nice clumps. Let’s try again….When we see clusters like this one above, it is not a good result. We want to see clumps where there is data, and empty holes between clusters. It reminds me of a quote I often hear from a friend of mine “ The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” And so when we see even distributions like this, it is usually a sign that we need to try again.Here is an example of the type of separation we would like to see:This MNIST example looks way better than what we got from our python code so far… Source: this online book.The color of each dot shows the cluster membership for that dot. There are still not as nice separations as we saw with the embedding projector…I think I found the reason for the mismatch between tensorboard and my python code. I had perplexity at 25 instead of 12. DOH. Now I changed the 2D and 3D perplexity values and reran the code. Here is what we get:Each color is a different cluster. It looks quite similar to the original non-working example… But a later version worked amazing, as you will see…2D slice of the 3D t-SNE results. Clusters 4 and 6 are pretty mixed up.I am pretty happy with the 2D t-SNE result, but GMM didn’t do a great segmentation job:More separation than the last time.Normalizing the 300 columns before t-SNE gave us this result:Let’s just go for it…Let’s back out of nerding out on t-SNE and try to understand the clusters, but first here is the data used to do all this stuff…Just to remind you, we have used comics to create a topic model. Here are the topic model vectors for each comic, and here are the topic labels (just integers) for each comic. I’ve organized stuff into a github repo for your coding pleasure.Here are the cluster dataframes for each comic using the automated methods described above: 3D and 2D. And here is the notebook for applying t-SNE in 2D and 3D. Here are the cluster labels (just integers) for each comic (samples for 10 clusters) using the manual method described below.What does it all mean?Here is our interpretation of the clusters for the 3D t-SNE data clustered by GMM:Cluster examples from this 3D dataset are: ZERO (questions), ONE (tech), TWO (graphs), THREE (dates+places), FOUR (time), FIVE (thinking stuff), SIX (hats! yes, hats!), SEVEN (bad stuff), EIGHT (math), and NINE (interwebz).And here is our interpretation of the 2D cluster data we created using the embedding projector by hand:Cluster examples from this dataset are: ONE (time), TWO (philosophy), THREE (science), FOUR (perspective), FIVE (excited), SIX (Megan), SEVEN (computerwebs), EIGHT (hyphens), NINE (tech), and TEN (thinking stuff).A special thank you to Mary Kate MacPherson for doing all the manual labor on the cluster labeling, and Mathieu Lemay for letting her do it.To make your own cluster labels manually…To get the clusters (labels) manually instead, we run 10,000 iterations of t-SNE (learning rate = 1; perplexity = 12) and instead of using clustering (k-means or GMM) we just eyeballed it and pulled out the IDs for each cluster. I absolutely LOVE that you the reader can head over to projector.tensorflow.org and completely replicate this experiment.Here is a big picture view of how to do this yourself the “manual” way:This is the picture of the hand-made data we used.Now let’s go through this step by step:1) Load the dataHere is a link to an interactive version of the data in the embedding projector:xkcd Embedding projector THIS-IS-SO-COOLVisualize high dimensional data.2) Run t-SNE. Stop when you feel like clustering looks good.3) Create clusters by hand by dragging with the annotation toolThis is the tool you wantDrag the tool to make a box over the points you want to label. We can see that the cluster includes samples such as 1834, 128, 307, 459, 89, and 477. They are about disaster, pain, disaster, angry exclamation… I see a pattern.The points will show up in the list on the right hand side4) Inspect the source of the list on the right, and copy out the HTML DIV of the list (I know: gross, and it has a limit 100, so you don’t get all the data for big clusters)5) replace all the HTML with spaces in notepad++. To do this, simply go to the replace menu (CTRL+H), and replace this regular expression with a space character:<[^>]+>Now replace all double spaces with single spaces until there are only single spaces, and then replace all the single spaces with newlines. Chopping off the first space character, we now have a list of IDs for this cluster. Repeat for each cluster until you covered all the clusters you care about. BAM. Done.You can merge all the clusters into one file either in python or excel. For here it is pretty easy to see how we got to building the pandas dataframe of the topic model.Predict Stuff!It would be really great to build a topic model of xkcd and predict what kind of topic a given comic is about.We know the input (X) is the topic model vector for the comic and the ascending ID of the comic, and the prediction (Y) is the cluster label. So we know this is a categorical problem that will need a softmax, and an MLP (DNN) seems up for the job.Here is the network we used on the 3D t-SNE dataset (random_state=42!):model = Sequential()model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]))model.add(Dropout(0.5))model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))model.add(Dropout(0.5))model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))model.add(Dropout(0.5))model.add(Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax'))And we got very good predictions from this network (89% accuracy):Confusion Matrix[[11  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0] [ 0 27  0  0  0  0  1  2  1  1] [ 0  2 11  0  0  0  0  0  4  2] [ 0  1  0 16  0  0  0  0  0  0] [ 0  0  0  0 24  0  1  1  0  0] [ 1  0  0  1  0 25  0  0  0  0] [ 0  0  0  0  1  0 18  0  0  0] [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0 12  0  0] [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 23  0] [ 0  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 13]]If you do play around with this dataset it would be wonderful to hear about your results!

But does a technical revolution bring shift in employment patterns too?.The Industrial Revolution which began in the 18th century was a transition to new manufacturing processes characterised by new inventions. The industrial revolution effectively increased the output levels and also saw improved systems of transportation, communication and banking. But the Industrial Revolution also took some key sacrifices, the change destroyed traditional jobs, but it also created new ones. The technology of the Industrial Revolution helped in discoveries of the modern industrial marvels and gave us the standard of living we are accustomed to. In the short term it was a difficult transition to the technology of the industrial revolution but in the long term, it was worth it..Short term pain for long term gain holds true for the 21stcentuary marked with artificial intelligence. Like the gruelling employment pattern changes witnessed in the industrial revolution, our generation will go through a similar transition with artificial intelligence to make way for an improved standard of living..Here Is How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the Future of Work:.1. Bring Automation.John Maynard Keynes coined the term &quot;technological unemployment&quot; way back in 1930. Simply described, technological unemployment is the loss of jobs due to advances in automation and other technologies. An Oxford University research carried out by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne in 2013, predicted that 47% of the jobs can be easily automated in the next couple of decades. The research was carried out on 702 occupational groupings and the jobs were grouped into either routine or non-routine and either analytic/interactive or manual categories..While the routine jobs covering the same tasks every day, or month, or year like data entry, production logistics can be easily automated the non-routine jobs requiring creative responses to new things which are less likely to be automated. Similarly, manual jobs involving the work to be done by hands like cleaning, painting can be automated, but those that require high cognitive and good social skills have less chances of automation. These include social media personalities, marketing professionals persuading you to buy their products, relationship managers and empathetic medical professionals..2. Create New Jobs .Artificial intelligence through robotics will take away repetitive, standardised tasks that require the least of the human cognitive mind. The routine jobs will give way to complex and non-routine creative and challenging jobs built on new skills and education. Jobs such as being a YouTube blogger, or an SEO expert or a creative professional that were unheard of in the older times will be up for grabs. The new technologies will pave way to individuals devoting most of their waking hours to hobbies, volunteering, and community services while leaving the routine and mundane work to the robots..3. Increase the Gap Between the Owner and the Worker .Artificial intelligence will further increase the inequality between the highly skilled and less skilled workers. The highly skilled professionals will on the gaining edge of complex new opportunities with educational up gradation and skill adoption.  The less skilled will be on the receiving end as they will need time to adapt with limited resources and skills. Another inequality AI will bring is the widening gap between the owner and the workers. The routine work will be taken up by robots and common customer questions will be answered by a chatbot. This will lead to layoffs and the owner getting richer with increased revenue margins. The profit share that was paid for employees' salaries will now be deployed into buying machines that do not report sick leaves or demand overtime allowances..Artificial Intelligence Is A Job Creator.According to a report from the global research and advisory firm Gartner, artificial intelligence is currently creating more jobs than it is destroying. Surprised? artificial intelligence has bought a net increase of over two million jobs by 2025 and this includes not only the tech friendly job profiles like software engineers and data scientists but also allied jobs such as artificial intelligence trainers and analytics mentors..Artificial intelligence will be at its best when it assists humans to perform jobs and not compete against each other. Artificial intelligence- powered robots should not aim to replace human workers but to make them more efficient at work. An excellent example is when the artificial intelligence-enabled robots free employees from the tedious task of walking the aisles looking for out of stock or damaged products, and instead allows them to focus on fixing problems that require critical thinking to improve customer experience..The potential of artificial intelligence is underexplored and coupled with human intelligence is all set to create wonders and bring a revolutionary change in the way we live today..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial intelligence’s impact on HR

        The robot revolution poses both opportunities and challenges for the human resource management function.    


        By: HRM Asia Newsroom | July 9, 2018

Paul Findlay is the Managing Director at PD Training.



 

The legal compliance team at JPMorgan Chase & Co wait anxiously to see if their new gadget will achieve what they think it can. A machine is reviewing a year’s worth of legal contracts that traditionally would require the team to put in some 360,000 professional hours.
In little over two seconds, the information is delivered. It wasn’t a year, a month, a week or even a whole day. In just 2.85 seconds, an algorithm replicated the efforts of hundreds of contract lawyers and clerks.
The algorithms were given the contracts prior to correction and then the same contracts after they were reviewed and amended. After reviewing thousands, the algorithm learned what was different and what changes were needed. The algorithm kept developing until it was able to produce the same results as if lawyers had reviewed and corrected the document themselves – no law degree required.
Not only is this story astounding and exciting, but it also marks a significant shift in the role of artificial intelligence in our daily lives and the multiple occupations surrounding it. From voice-activated home appliances, self-driven cars, to a trip to the grocery store with no staff member in sight – we have finally reached the age of AI.

AI’s introduction into the employment market has provided human resources management with both challenges and opportunities.
While once AI came with an underlying fear of a robot apocalypse – destroying jobs, industries and everything else in its path – organisations across the private and public sector are now taking the initiative to not only embrace the technology, but to also create AI powered solutions.



Say hello to the freelance market
As part of these powered solutions, the workplace as we know it is changing.
Yes, some jobs are disappearing, but there are plenty of new and exciting roles evolving too. Not only are job roles changing, but the traditional 9-5 employee could also soon cease to exist. The rise of a ‘gig economy’ has established a growing number of workers abandoning traditional employment for self-employment or casual work.
This new market means changes are occurring in talent identification and hiring, with the supply and demand of labour constantly changing. In relation to demand, the rise of AI has played an interesting role in how an employee markets and differentiates themselves – seeking skills that robots cannot learn.
 


A new workplace currency
Emotional intelligence has become a new currency of its own, with those who possess it seen as an emerging elite, the untouchable.
Humans have always excelled not necessarily in calculation but in context, in the space between the processes, in human interaction. Along with emotional intelligence, the emergence of soft skills will become prevalent among human employees. Employers and HR managers will become increasingly reliant on employees who have critical thinking and the capability to deal with complex problems.
According to research by Deloitte Australia, the number of soft skill-intensive jobs will grow 2.5 times faster than other jobs.  Furthermore, the research predicts that soft skill-intensive jobs will make up almost two-thirds of the workforce by 2030.
 


Adapting to the latest revolution
There’s much to consider and answer when it comes to how humans can remain relevant in the Artificial Intelligence Revolution, a world where the algorithms are swallowing jobs and industries.
It’s clear that a much-needed conversation is needed with some of Australia’s leading human resources executives to determine what the current and future opportunities are for the industry and the challenges we may face in the wider HR sector moving forward.
I was fortunate enough to be part of such a conversation, when the Org Dev Institute  (ODi) hosted a roundtable with HR leaders, which unearthed some interesting insights and observations.  I look forward to reading the resulting whitepaper in the near future.
This forward thinking is vital not only to ensure the longevity of the HR industry, but also its prosperity.

Scared by artificial intelligence? Fear not, tech-savvy USC grad says

Electrical engineer Eric Deng sees robots as future caretakers, companions and even therapists of sorts. He’ll join Facebook as its first robotics engineer this fall

Artificial intelligence.
For many, those two words evoke visions of robot overlords running amok and terrorizing citizens. Others lament the steady automation of factory and manufacturing jobs, with precise machinery taking the place of humans.
But to Eric Deng, the future of robotics and artificial intelligence isn’t scary at all. Instead, he sees smart machines as a force for social good. Imagine interactive androids that keep older adults company while monitoring their health. Or friendly and engaging robots that help children with autism develop social skills.
As an electrical engineering undergrad and Stamps Scholar at USC, Deng helped program and design robots to begin taking on those socially assistive roles. The recent graduate heads to work at Facebook this fall as its first robotics engineer, with visions of ensuring that artificial intelligence remains safe, helpful and accessible.

I want to make AI and high-tech systems easier to design, create and use.
Eric Deng

“I want to make AI and high-tech systems easier to design, create and use, with the goal of giving more people the opportunity to build these powerful systems to help themselves and others,” he said.
Inspired to bring a human touch to artificial intelligence
Growing up in California’s Bay Area, Deng seemed destined for a career in the tech industry. He drew inspiration from watching his parents, both engineers, work on various projects in their Fremont home. In addition to its technical aspects, he enjoyed the aesthetic side of engineering — how art and design can influence how a product is used or perceived. He was also fascinated by how and why people make certain decisions.

Deng found a good outlet for his mechanical talents as captain of his high school robotics team. During summers, he took university courses in behavioral economics to better understand human behavior. But he wasn’t sure he could find a field that would allow him to combine his eclectic interests. By the time he enrolled at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, Deng had resigned himself to focusing solely on engineering.
That’s when he stumbled on the Interaction Lab run by Maja Matarić, USC Viterbi’s vice dean for research and the Chan Soon-Shiong Professor of Computer Science, Neuroscience, and Pediatrics. The lab focuses on designing and building robots to help people through social interaction. Its current projects involve developing robot-assisted therapies for survivors of stroke and traumatic brain injury, people with Alzheimer’s disease and children with autism.
The lab’s human-centered approach to artificial intelligence was a great fit for Deng. Rather than just building functional machines to perform a repetitive task, the lab’s researchers have to pay close attention to how robots look, feel and act. Even minor changes in their appearance or behavior can affect how they’re perceived and whether they elicit the desired response.
Some robots, like ones for children, might send the right message if they look cute, Deng said. That’s the wrong look for other robots, though. “If it’s a doctor robot, you don’t want it to be cute,” he said. “You want it to look intelligent and trustworthy and even a little bit more serious.”
Impressed by his early work with her team, Matarić soon took on Deng as a mentee. She acknowledged that many undergrads want to work with her, but they often need guidance and are unsure of their direction. Deng, however, is motivated and self-driven, she said.
“Three years later, he’s basically doing the work of a grad student.”
A complex challenge: making robots seem human
Deng has collaborated with researchers to understand how robots can better follow social norms such as maintaining appropriate personal space or use gestures and nonverbal signals to symbolize various objects.
In another project, he explored how robots can catch and maintain the attention of children with autism. Is it effective to wait patiently or emit soft noises? Are wild and erratic movements counterproductive? The trick is finding the right balance to promote engagement.
“You don’t want to have a mean robot or a rude robot,” Deng said. “The robot could yell and the kid will look up every time, but that quickly deteriorates the rest of the intervention.”
As the hardware lead for the project, he helped design, build and program the robot prototypes, which resemble colorful owls. The research team recently sent a handful of the devices to be tested by kids in their homes, and a short video about the project drew millions of views when shared by Twitter on World Autism Awareness Day.
Deng doesn’t expect these smart machines to replace trained caregivers and therapists anytime soon. Instead, they can fill in the gaps, he said, providing companionship and care when health professionals aren’t available or between regular therapy sessions.
“You aren’t replacing caregivers like nurses,” he said. “You are just allowing them to focus on more complicated work.”
Deng’s achievements in the lab earned him numerous accolades, including the Richardson Endowed Undergraduate Merit Research Award and the Order of Areté. He was named a Viterbi Undergraduate Fellow and Grand Challenges Scholar, in addition to his prestigious Stamps Scholarship, which covered his tuition and provided funding for personal research projects and travel to a major overseas tech conference.
As he wraps up work on a few remaining research papers with fellow Trojans, Deng looks forward to his new position with Facebook, which starts in August. It promises to be a smooth transition — he interned at the social networking giant every summer since coming to USC.
He can’t say much about his new role as its first robotics engineer, partly because the company is just starting to explore new fields.
“The opportunity it presents is pretty exciting,” he said. “It’s so new, you don’t really know what it will turn out to be.”
Killer robots? Highly improbable
As for the future of artificial intelligence, Deng expects to see some automation and replacement of human jobs. But it’s much more likely that the robot revolution will involve assistance rather than automation, he said, with robots encouraging their mortal masters to do better work.
And despite the pop culture cliché of artificial intelligence gone wild, he’s even less concerned about the potential for robots turning into evil monsters intent on destroying society.
“Any technology has potential for harm,” Deng said. “Problems arise when you have homogeneous teams that just think about their specific issue. Then a lot of populations get marginalized.”
As long as we build empathetic, ethical and diverse groups of designers and engineers, he’s convinced humankind has no reason to worry about a robot uprising.

 Data science has the power to transform nonprofit work. Leaders are thrilled by the opportunity to scour vast amounts of data for connections but unnerved by the prospect of data tainted by bias and unseen algorithms deciding who gets services. For our July cover package, the Chronicle examines how philanthropy is grappling with what it means when machines take on tasks that humans usually to do.

He was introduced to coding in Class 8, but he said that at that time it was a passive interest. It remained so till the time he cleared his IIT-JEE, and secured a seat in IIIT-B..“So after coming into the college, the curriculum and the environment made the passive interest grow into an active interest,” he said..The Google offer did not come easy. He was one of the 50 finalists at the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest after he beat 6,000 from students across the globe who cleared the preliminary round of the selection process..Out of those 50 who landed a job at Google’s prestigious AI Research wing, five are from India, including Aditya. The competition saw close to 50,000 participants from a total of 111 counties and 3,098 universities..Explaining the process, Aditya told TNM: “It’s open to all students across the world and you apply with your resume along with a Statement of Purpose and a recommendation letter. Based on this they shortlist you, and there are subsequent rounds of interviews and at the end of it, you get the job.”.“Usually, after a CS degree, people get a proper engineering job but this is a job in the research domain. So more than common problems, it is more about trying to solve open problems and shortlisting potential future problems and finding answers to them,” he said..AI is also Aditya’s subject of choice. “I had a couple of papers and after AI came, I felt like that the field is progressing rapidly and I got the confidence that with a little bit of effort in research we can do a lot more in the future,” he said..But according to him, his focus was never on the job he would get at the end of five years, but on learning..“I never worried about it (getting a job) too much. I knew I would always have one year at the end of the course to prepare to refocus on employment tests. So the focus was mostly on learning as many things as possible and meeting interesting people and ideas. The goal was to develop new interests and master a few,” Aditya said..But even he admits it was kind of a “big deal” when this job was in the realm of possibilities..When asked about his current professional goals. Aditya remains consistent on the learning part..“At this moment, I can't really tell. There are vague ideas here and there but nothing concrete.  All I want to do is learn the maximum as I can and meet as many interesting people as I can,” he said..While his parents work in their family business, his younger brother is studying Commerce. Aditya is set to start his career at Google on July 18.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The firm estimated about 20% of jobs would be automated over the next 20 years and no sector would be unaffected.AI and related technologies such as robotics, drones and driverless vehicles would replace human workers in some areas, but also create many additional jobs as productivity and real incomes rise and new and better products were developed, PwC said.Increasing automation in factories is a long-term trend but robots such as Pepper, created by Japan’s Softbank Robotics, are beginning to be used in shops, banks and social care, raising fears of widespread job losses.'It's going to create a revolution': how AI is transforming the NHSRead moreHowever, PwC estimated that healthcare and social work would be the biggest winners from AI, where employment could increase by nearly 1 million on a net basis, equivalent to more than a fifth of existing jobs in the sector.Professional, scientific and technical services, including law, accounting, architecture and advertising firms, are forecast to get the second-biggest boost, gaining nearly half a million jobs, while education is set to get almost 200,000 extra jobs.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: “Healthcare is likely to see rising employment as it will be increasingly in demand as society becomes richer and the UK population ages. While some jobs may be displaced, many more are likely to be created as real incomes rise and patients still want the ‘human touch’ from doctors, nurses and other health and social care workers.“On the other hand, as driverless vehicles roll out across the economy and factories and warehouses become increasingly automated, the manufacturing and transportation and storage sectors could see a reduction in employment levels.”PwC estimated the manufacturing sector could lose a quarter of current jobs through automation by 2037, a total of nearly 700,000.Transport and storage are estimated to lose 22% of jobs – nearly 400,000 – followed by public administration and defence, with a loss of almost 275,000 jobs, an 18% reduction. Clerical tasks in the public sector are likely to be replaced by algorithms while in the defence industry humans will increasingly be replaced by drones and other technologies.View image in fullscreenImpact of artificial intelligence on jobs.

A majority of people think that artificial intelligence will steal jobs away from human workers. They’re not wrong, but that’s not the whole story.
In a recent survey conducted by Quartz, more than 1,600 respondents in 84 countries said that half of positions would be made redundant by automation in the next five years. A separate survey conducted by Gallup in the U.S. found that 75 percent of adults believe AI will “eliminate more jobs than it creates.”

Xsolla Announces New Backend with Cross-Platform Support, Expanded Payment Solutions in Asia, Instant Access To Core Solutions, and Streamlined Mobile SDK Payments



“[AI is] superhuman, and we think [it] will be in every industry [and] replace 50 percent of human jobs,” Kai-Fu Lee, founder of VC firm Sinovation Ventures, told CNBC in an interview last April. “It is the decision engine that will replace people.”
The data doesn’t bear that out, though.
This week, a study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) suggested that by 2037 in the U.K., widespread adoption of AI could generate more jobs than it displaces. The health care market alone stands to grow by 1 million (about a fifth of its existing jobs), according to PwC, while law, accounting, and advertising firms could gain as many as half a million jobs.
PwC’s findings jibe with Gartner’s, which in December predicted AI would create a net 500,000 jobs by 2020 and 2 million by 2025. Researchers at the McKinsey Global Institute, meanwhile, concluded that while as many as 73 million jobs are at risk of being automated by 2030, new ones will be created in their wake.
That’s not to discount the concerns of workers in manufacturing, transport, and storage industries, which are forecast to be the hardest hit. As economists at MIT and Boston University noted in a March 2017 study, automation doesn’t just affect the workers it directly replaces — the economic pain reverberates, triggering further unemployment.
Luckily, there might be recourse around the corner.advertisement
I recently spoke with futurist Martin Ford, author of the New York Times bestseller Rise of the Robots, about the coming AI revolution. He subscribes to the notion of a universal basic income (UBI) in the form of fixed, regular payments from nations’ governments to citizens, regardless of their employment status or wealth.
Ford isn’t the only one. Universal income advocates include Stanford’s Andrew Ng, Y Combinator president Sam Altman, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes, among others.
Others, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, suggest retraining as a partial solution to the AI dilemma, and a few tech titans have already begun to lay the groundwork for such an effort. Microsoft has committed millions of dollars to Skillful, a nonprofit organization that connects people with IT and health care jobs. And Amazon offers to cover 95 percent of the cost of training warehouse employees for careers outside of the company.advertisement
Still others propose a tax or penalty on the use of AI. Last February, European Union lawmakers considered levying a tax on robot owners to cover training for workers who would lose their jobs, and those lawmakers aren’t the only ones. In September, San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim launched a campaign to push for a “robot tax” on business owners who choose to replace humans with algorithms.
One thing’s clear: The AI transition isn’t going to be easy. In developed countries like the U.S., automation is likely to lead to greater income inequality. A report from U.K. charity Sutton Trust forecast that wealthier workers’ access to education, the rising importance of “soft skills” like communication, and a reduction in “stepping stone” jobs and internships could entrench the divide between rich and poor.
But executives like Mimi Spier, vice president of VMware’s internet of things (IoT) business, take the optimistic view.advertisement
“We’ve long believed that the AI fear of ‘man vs. machine’ is hyperbole, and that ‘man alongside machine’ is the real opportunity — not a threat to today’s workforce,” Spier told VentureBeat in an email. “[There’s a] widen[ing] skills gap between traditional and machine-augmented work, but it also creates a real need for new training, new types of experts, and, ultimately, a shift from the workforce we know to a workforce open to endless possibilities, as far as new skills, productivity, and contributions by humans made hand-in-hand with machines.”

It’s impossible to say precisely how artificial intelligence will disrupt the job market, so researchers at PwC have taken a bird’s-eye view and pointed to the results of sweeping economic changes.

Their prediction, in a new report out Tuesday, is that it will all balance out in the end.
More automation in trucks, factories and elsewhere could cost around 7 million existing jobs in the U.K. by 2037. But the rise in robots and machine-learning software will make the country more productive over the next two decades, growing at a 2% annual clip, to put nearly the same number of jobs back in the system: 7.2 million, PwC estimates.
To be clear, those new jobs won’t involve building robots or coding AI-powered software, which will make up only around 5% of employment, says John Hawksworth, PwC’s chief economist.
PROMOTED
Instead, around 1.5 million, or 22%, of the new jobs will be in health and social work. Demand will rise for areas “that require a human touch and aren’t so easy to automate,” Hawksworth told Forbes, all the more necessary as the population ages.

Most of that growth, though, is just a by-product of a bigger economy.
More taxes will go into government coffers, which will mean more funding for the U.K.’s National Health Service. “Economic growth will promote higher tax revenues for the government to spend more on the NHS, including bringing in more staff,” he says.
Other studies have come to broadly similar conclusions, including one by Oxford Economics in December 2017, Hawsworth adds.
The public and press have become obsessed with the notion that AI will blow a gaping hole in the global economy and leave us all jobless and penniless, but they tend to tend to dismiss the potential productivity gains that AI will bring to boost GDP, says the economist.

Such shifts and rebalancing have happened before, albeit in a more painful way. “In previous industrial revolutions in the U.K., huge numbers of people moving from farms to factories had to develop new skills. Initially that was bad news for people who didn’t want to make that adjustment.”
The Nottingham weavers who were replaced by automatic looms didn’t benefit from a welfare state or government programs aimed at retraining people.
These modern programs will probably become more visible in the coming years.
France’s President Macron has recently pushed for an $18 billion training program to help lower unemployment, and the British government also announced a national retraining program in November 2017, in partnership with industry bodies and trade unions.
That may be helpful, as the coming shift will affect everyone, even consultants who write reports about the impact of AI on jobs.
When PwC combed through OECD data for jobs most likely to be automated, it was a task too big for humans to do quickly.

One of the most important aspect of this research work is getting computers to understand visual information (images and videos) generated everyday around us. This field of getting computers to perceive and understand visual information is known as computer vision.During the rise of artificial intelligence research in the 1950s to the 1980s, computers were manually given instructions on how to recognize images, objects in images and what features to look out for. This method are traditional algorithms and were called Expert Systems, as they require that humans take the pain of identifying features for each unique scene of object that has to be recognize and representing these features in mathematical models that the computer can understand. That involves a whole lot of tedious work because there are hundreds and thousands of various ways an object can be represented and there are thousands (or even millions) of different scenes and objects that uniquely exist, and therefore finding the optimized and accurate mathematical models to represent all the possible features of each objects or scene, and for all possible objects or scene is more of work that will last forever.Then, in the 1990s, the concept of Machine Learning was introduced and it ushered in an era in which instead of telling computers what to look out for in recognizing scenes and objects in images and videos, we can instead design algorithms that will make computers to learn how to recognize scenes and objects in images by itself, just like a child learns to understand his/her environment by exploring. Machine learning opened the way for computers to learn to recognize almost any scene or object we want them too.With the emergence of powerful computers such as the NVIDIA GPUs and state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms for image recognition such as AlexNet in 2012 by Alex Krizhevsky et al, ResNet in 2015 by Kaeming He et al, SqueezeNet in 2016 by Forrest Landola et al, DenseNet in 2016 by Gao Huang et al, to mention a few, it is possible to put together a number of pictures (more like image books for computers) and define an artificial intelligence model to learn features of scenes and objects in these pictures by itself and use the knowledge gained from the learning process to recognize all other instance of the type of scene or objects it will encounter after.To train an artificial intelligence model that can recognize whatever you want it to recognize in pictures, it traditional involves lots of expertise in Applied Mathematics and use of Deep Learning libraries, not to mention the amount of time involved and stress you have to go through to write the code for the algorithm and fit the code to your images. This is where we have provided our solutions.Our team at AI Commons has developed a python library that can let you train an artificial intelligence model that can recognize any object you want it to recognize in images using just 5 simple lines of python code. The python library is ImageAI , a library built to let students, developers and researchers with all levels of expertise to build systems and applications with state-of-the-art computer vision capabilities using between 5 to 15 simple lines of code. Now, let us walk you through creating your first artificial intelligence model that can recognize whatever you want it to.To train your artificial intelligence model, you need a collection of images called a dataset. A dataset contains hundreds to thousands of sample images of objects you want your artificial intelligence model to recognize. But you don’t have worry! We are not asking you to go and download thousands of pictures right now just to train your artificial intelligence model. For this tutorial, we have provided a dataset called IdenProf. IdenProf (Identifiable Professionals) is a dataset that contains 11,000 pictures of 10 different professionals that humans can see and recognize their jobs by their mode of dressing. The classes of professionals whose pictures are in this dataset are as below:· Chef· Doctor· Engineer· Farmer· Firefighter· Judge· Mechanic· Pilot· Police· WaiterThis dataset is split into 9000 (900 pictures for each profession) pictures to train the artificial intelligence model and 2000 (200 pictures for each profession) pictures to test the performance of the artificial intelligence model as it is training. IdenProf has been properly arranged and made ready for training your artificial intelligence model to recognize professionals by their mode of dressing. For reference purposes, if you are using your own image dataset, you must collect at least 500 pictures for each object or scene you want your artificial intelligence model to recognize. To train any image dataset you collect yourself with ImageAI, you must arrange the images in folders as seen in the example below:idenprof//train//chef// 900 images of chefsidenprof//train//doctor// 900 images of doctorsidenprof//train//engineer// 900 images of engineeridenprof//train//farmer// 900 images of farmersidenprof//train//firefighter// 900 images of firefightersidenprof//train//judge// 900 images of judgesidenprof//train//mechanic// 900 images of mechanicsidenprof//train//pilot// 900 images of pilotsidenprof//train//chef// 900 images of chefidenprof//train//police// 900 images of policeidenprof//train//waiter// 900 images of waitersidenprof//test//chef// 200 images of chefsidenprof//test//doctor// 200 images of doctorsidenprof//test//engineer// 200 images of engineeridenprof//test//farmer// 200 images of farmersidenprof//test//firefighter// 200 images of firefightersidenprof//test//judge// 200 images of judgesidenprof//test//mechanic// 200 images of mechanicsidenprof//test//pilot// 200 images of pilotsidenprof//test//chef// 200 images of chefidenprof//test//police// 200 images of policeidenprof//test//waiter// 200 images of waitersNow that you have understand how to prepare own image dataset for training artificial intelligence models, we will now proceed with guiding you training an artificial intelligence model to recognize professionals using ImageAI.· First you must download the zip of IdenProf dataset via this link. Also you can view all the details and sample results of artificial intelligence models trained to recognize professions in the IdenProf GitHub repository whose link is below.https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/IdenProf· Because training artificial intelligence models require high performance computer systems, I strongly advice that you ensure your computer/laptop that you want to use for this training has NVIDIA GPU. Alternatively, you can use Google Colab for this experiment has it offers a free NVIDIA K80 GPU for experiments.· Then you have to install ImageAI and its dependencies.Install Python 3.7.6 and pip(Skip this section if you already have Python 3.7.6)Python Release Python 3.7.6Release Date: Dec. 18, 2019 There are now newer bugfix releases of Python 3.7 that supersede 3.7.6 and Python 3.8 is…www.python.orgInstall ImageAI and dependencies(Skip any of the installation instruction in this section if you already have the library installed )- Tensorflowpip install tensorflow==2.4.0- Otherspip install keras==2.4.3 numpy==1.19.3 pillow==7.0.0 scipy==1.4.1 h5py==2.10.0 matplotlib==3.3.2 opencv-python keras-resnet==0.2.0Install the ImageAI librarypip install imageai --upgrade· Create a python file with any name you want to give it, for example “FirstTraining.py”.· Copy the zip of the IdenProf dataset into the folder where your Python file is. Then unzip it into the same folder.· Then copy the code below into the python file (e.g FirstTraining.py).That’s it! That’s all the code you need to train your artificial intelligence model. Before you run the code to start the training, let us explain the code.In the first line, we imported ImageAI’s model training class. In the second line we, created an instance of the model training class. In the third line, we set the model type to ResNet50 (there are four model types available which are MobileNetv2, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121). In the fourth line, we set the data directory (dataset directory) to the folder of the dataset zip file you unzipped. Then in the fifth line, we call the trainModel function and specified the following values: • number_objects : This refers to the number of different types of professionals in the IdenProf dataset.• num_experiments : This is the number of times the model trainer will study all the images in the idenprof dataset in order to achieve maximum accuracy.• Enhance_data (Optional) : This is to tell the model trainer to create modified copies of the images in the IdenProf dataset to ensure maximum accuracy is achieved.• batch_size: This refers to the number of images the set that the model trainer will study at once, until it has studied all the images in the IdenProf dataset.• Show_network_summary (Optional) : This is to show the structure of the model type you are using to train the artificial intelligence model.Now you can start run the Python file and start the training. When the training starts, you will see results like the one below:=====================================Total params: 23,608,202Trainable params: 23,555,082Non-trainable params: 53,120______________________________________Using Enhanced Data GenerationFound 4000 images belonging to 4 classes.Found 800 images belonging to 4 classes.JSON Mapping for the model classes saved to  C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\json\model_class.jsonNumber of experiments (Epochs) :  200Epoch 1/100 1/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.25002/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.25003/280 [>.............................] - ETA: 52s - loss: 2.3026 - acc: 0.2500..............................,..............................,..............................,279/280 [===========================>..] - ETA: 1s - loss: 2.3097 - acc: 0.0625Epoch 00000: saving model to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\models\model_ex-000_acc-0.100000.h5280/280 [==============================] - 51s - loss: 2.3095 - acc: 0.0600 - val_loss: 2.3026 - val_acc: 0.1000Let us explain the details shown above:1. The statement “JSON Mapping for the model classes saved to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\json\model_class.json” means the model trainer has saved a JSON file for the idenprof dataset which you can use to recognize other pictures with the custom image prediction class (explanation available as you read further).2. The line Epoch 1/200 means the network is performing the first training of the targeted 200  3. The line 1/280 [>………………………..] — ETA: 52s — loss: 2.3026 — acc: 0.2500 represents the number of batches that has been trained in the present experiment 4. The line Epoch 00000: saving model to C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\FirstTraining\idenprof\models\model_ex-000_acc-0.100000.h5 refers to the model saved after the present training. The ex_000 represents the experiment at this stage while the acc0.100000 and valacc: 0.1000 represents the accuracy of the model on the test images after the present experiment (maximum value value of accuracy is 1.0). This result helps to know the best performed model you can use for custom image prediction.Once you are done training your artificial intelligence model, you can use the “CustomImagePrediction” class to perform image prediction with you’re the model that achieved the highest accuracy.Just in case you have not been able to train the artificial intelligence model yourself due to lack of accessing an NVIDIA GPU, for the purpose of this tutorial, we have provided an artificial intelligence model we have trained on the IdenProf dataset which you can use right now to predict new images of any of the 10 professionals that is in the dataset. This model achieved over 79% accuracy after 61 training experiments. Click this link to download the model. Also, if you have not perform the training yourself, also download the JSON file of the idenprof model via this link. Then, you are ready to start recognizing professionals using the trained artificial intelligence model. Just follow the instructions below.Next, create another Python file and give it a name, for example FirstCustomImageRecognition.py . Copy the artificial intelligence model you downloaded above or the one you trained that achieved the highest accuracy and paste it to the folder where your new python file (e.g FirstCustomImageRecognition.py ) . Also copy the JSON file you downloaded or was generated by your training and paste it to the same folder as your new python file. Copy a sample image(s) of any professional that fall into the categories in the IdenProf dataset to the same folder as your new python file.Then copy the code below and put it into your new python fileView sample image and result below.waiter  :  99.99997615814209chef  :  1.568847380895022e-05judge  :  1.0255866556008186e-05That was easy! Now let’s explain the code above that produced this prediction result.The first and second lines of code above imports the ImageAI’s CustomImageClassification class for predicting and recognizing images with trained models and the python os class. The third line of code creates a variable which holds the reference to the path that contains your python file (in this example, your FirstCustomImageRecognition.py) and the ResNet50 model file you downloaded or trained yourself. In the above code, we created an instance of the CustomImageClassification() class in the fourth line, then we set the model type of the prediction object to ResNet50 by calling the .setModelTypeAsResNet50() in the fifth line and then we set the model path of the prediction object to the path of the artificial intelligence model file (idenprof_061–0.7933.h5) we copied to the project folder folder in the sixth line. In the seventh line, we set the path of the JSON file we copied to the folder in the seventh line and loaded the model in the eightieth line. Finally, we ran prediction on the image we copied to the folder and print out the result to the Command Line Interface.So far, you have learnt how to use ImageAI to easily train your own artificial intelligence model that can predict any type of object or set of objects in an image.If you will like to know everything about how image recognition works with links to more useful and practical resources, visit the Image Recognition Guide linked below.Image Recognition GuideNow that we know a bit about what image recognition is, the distinctions between different types of image recognition…www.fritz.aiYou can find all the details and documentation use ImageAI for training custom artificial intelligence models, as well as other computer vision features contained in ImageAI on the official GitHub repository.OlafenwaMoses/ImageAIAn open-source python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep…github.comIf you find this article helpful and enjoyed it, kindly give it a clap.

With artificial intelligence, machines can now examine thousands of medical images – and billions of pixels within these images – to identify patterns too subtle for a radiologist or pathologist to identify.
The machine then uses this information to identify the presence of a disease or estimate its aggressiveness, likelihood of survival or potential response to treatment. 
We are engineers at the Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics. Our team works with physicians and statisticians to develop and validate these kinds of tools.
Many worry that this technology aims to replace doctors. But we believe the technology will work in tandem with humans, making them more efficient and helping with decisions on complicated cases.
Machine learning and medical images
In one study, researchers at Stanford showed that machines were just as accurate as trained dermatologists in distinguishing skin cancers from benign lesions in 100 test images. 
In another, computer scientists at Google used an AI approach called deep learning to accurately identify which patients had diabetic retinopathy – a constellation of changes in the retina due to diabetes – from high-resolution photographs of the retina. Another deep learning project at Google successfully predicted cardiovascular disease risk from retina images. 
Our group has been developing new ways to identify disease in scans like MRI and CT, as well as digitized tissue slide images. 
In biopsied images of heart tissue from 105 patients with heart disease, our algorithms predicted with high accuracy which patients would go on to have heart failure. 
In another study involving MRI scans from prostate cancer patients, our computer algorithms identified clinically significant disease in more than 70 percent of cases where radiologists missed it. In half of the cases where radiologists mistakenly thought that the patient had aggressive prostate cancer, the machine was able to correctly identify that no clinically significant disease was present.

Predicting outcomes and treatment response
Our team has also been developing approaches to predict a patient’s response to specific therapies and monitor early treatments.
Take the case of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy drugs boost the body’s own immune defenses to fight against the cancer. They have shown tremendous promise in comparison to traditional chemotherapy, but certain caveats limit their widespread use. Only about 1 in 5 patients with lung cancer might actually respond to immunotherapy regimens. Additionally, these therapies cost upwards of US$200,000 per patient per year and can have toxic effects on the immune system. Physicians need a way to determine accurately which patients might benefit. 
To identify the likelihood of a successful response before therapy begins, our lab is building software to examine routine diagnostic CT scans of lung tumors. The software looks at tumor texture, intensity and shape, as well as the shape of vessels feeding the nodules. This information might help oncologists optimize the therapy dosage or alter a patient’s treatment plan. 
There are many cancers and other diseases where computational tools to predict disease aggressiveness or treatment response could aid physicians. For example, a study published in 2018 compared women with breast cancer who had been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or standard endocrine therapy. For about 70 percent of the patients, the chemotherapy had no demonstrated benefit compared to the standard approach. Preventing unnecessary and often deleterious chemotherapy thus becomes a key issue for doctors. However, currently, the only way to predict outcome depends upon expensive genomic tests that destroy tissue. 
We have been working on a new way to interrogate digitized tissue images from biopsies of the breast. Our new project is testing the technology on women with breast cancers at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India.
Making it possible
There is a massive opportunity for clinicians, radiologists and pathologists to enrich their decisions with artificial intelligence. That’s particularly true when it comes to building treatment plans tailored to the individual patient. 
Before such technology can be used in hospitals, researchers like ourselves need to do further tests to ensure it’s reliable and valid. This can be done by carrying out tests at multiple medical institutions. 
It’s also important for physicians to be able to interpret the technology. They’re unlikely to adopt technology that cannot be explained by existing biology research. For example, our lung tumor software looks at vessel shape because studies show that the degree of convolutedness of the vessels feeding the tumor can negatively affect drug delivery. 
That’s why it’s crucial artificial intelligence researchers like ourselves engage clinicians early in the development process as equal collaborators.

More than 2,400 people at 160-plus tech companies, including the founders and top researchers at Google’s DeepMind subsidiary, have signed a pledge not to work on autonomous weapons. Their vow is contained in a July 18 letter to “governments and government leaders” that asks for “strong international norms, regulations and laws against lethal autonomous weapons.”“Thousands of AI researchers agree that by removing the risk, attributability, and difficulty of taking human lives, lethal autonomous weapons could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression, especially when linked to surveillance and data systems,” reads the letter, organized by the Future of Life Institute. “The unilateral actions of a single group could too easily spark an arms race that the international community lacks the technical tools and global governance systems to manage. Stigmatizing and preventing such an arms race should be a high priority for national and global security.”Among the signers are Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of the neural-networking software company DeepMind. Acquired by Google in 2014, DeepMind made headlines around the world last year when its AlphaGo neural network defeated the world’s best human Go player. This feat, a first for an artificial intelligence, represented an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous efforts to apply AI to simpler endeavors, such as chess, in part because Go is an exponentially more complex game. While there are roughly 30 branching moves in chess, there are more than 200 in Go.Hassabis, in particular, has not been shy in expressing reservations about the militarization of artificial intelligence; he has signed similar letters from the Future of Life Institute.The U.S. military is keenly interested in advancing AI projects similar to Project Maven, an Air Force image-classification program developed with Google’s help. About a dozen Google employees resigned in protest against the contract, and Google leaders decided not to renew it when it expires next year.Still, Google Cloud head Diane Greene has been courting Pentagon business and, in particular, the huge JEDI cloud contract. Google’s artificial intelligence prowess is seen as key to their pitch for the contract.The pledge does not keep DeepMind from doing work for the military, or even applying a neural net like AlphaGo to an image-classification problem — all of which helps the military as an institution become more lethal.Air Force and other military officials generally contend that neither artificial intelligence nor Google workers are involved in designating, much less striking, targets. The military operates under a 2012 directive that requires human involvement in any decision about taking a life.

News Tech   A.I. Would Create “Winners And Losers” Equally In Job Sector: Report ByCharanjeet Singh 
July 17, 2018         Source: TM Magazine  Billionaires and philanthropist argue from time to time whether Artificial Intelligence would help the society, or, instead, manifest into something horrifying (John Connor might be needed) A recent report claims that AI would create “winners and losers,” not in the resistance, but in the job sector. The PwC Global Artificial Intelligence Study concluded that Artificial Intelligence would create as many jobs in the UK as it will displace over the next 20 years.          The report also claims the “no human in the loop” approach will ultimately mean few job displacement in the industrial sector. A.I. would take over manufacturing jobs by 25%, transport, and storage by 22% and public administration by 18% However, AI would also generate new opportunities compensating the displacement by boosting at least 200,000 jobs alone in the UK.        “Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains,” said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC “This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. The report also concluded that China and North America would see the greatest gains from AI, boosting their GDP by 26% and 14% by 2030 respectively. Source: BBC The report predicts that few sectors will see the biggest gain as AI would increase productivity, product quality, and consumption.         Retail Financial services Healthcare  We have been seeing some major advancements in the A.I in the recent months. So far, A.I has worked towards helping the human species of this world.

The Bengalurean now teams up with his brother to stage the world&rsquo;s first Artificial Intelligence art show in New Delhi on August 17. Raghava is also among a few artists in the world to have had embraced multi-disciplinarity and artificial intelligence in his work. He tells Ralph Alex Arakal how art is undoubtedly the most powerful tool of expression.    Finding new ways bridge art with a new, seemingly unrelated has kept multi-faceted artist Raghava K.K. on his toes for decades. Hacking, brain mapping, world exploration &ndash; if Raghava is to be believed, art has a role to play in all these things. Well, that&rsquo;s just a taste of what the 38-year-old Bengalurean has been working for since he decided to give up on a formal education two decades ago, choosing instead to become a newspaper cartoonist.  Having lived and worked in the United States for many years, Raghava is making his return to the country to team up with his brother Karthik Kalyanaraman. Titled 64/1, the international movement will begin with India&rsquo;s first tryst with Artificial Intelligence-powered art show - an explosive beginning. It will bring artists, scientists and technologists from around the globe under a single umbrella in India.   &ldquo;It is essential for artists to think like scientists and be rigorous in their perception and thought process. At the same time, scientists need to be more creative in how they look at the world. We thought it is very important to bring these worlds together for a better tomorrow,&rdquo; Raghava says.  The first show of 64/1 which is scheduled to take place in August in Nature Morte, a gallery in New Delhi, will feature seven artists, one each from Turkey, New Zealand, England, Germany, Japan, USA and India. &ldquo;This will also make India the pioneer of the world&rsquo;s first Artificial Intelligence (AI) art show and we are very excited to make this happen,&rdquo; adds Raghava.  The campaign will also be their outreach towards discovering the &lsquo;cyborg age&rsquo; which will also see an official launch at the Kochi Biennale later this year. The duo with New York based Ben Tritt is working on using AI to paint alongside a human artist.   The first artist to be inducted as a National Geographic explorer, Raghava, who began his career as a newspaper cartoonist has already progressed in his career as a newspaper cartoonist, storyteller, artistic producer and much more.   Ask him what inspires him to expand the horizon of his professional career cutting across various disciplines and he says embracing the possibility of transcendence in the modern world is all what he aspires for. &ldquo;There is a part in each individual that is unsettled and craving for more. The realisation that we are not defined by who we are, but by who we will be is what inspired me to embark on my journey of life,&rdquo; Raghava says, proving just why he is a motivational storyteller and a four-time TED speaker.    Flashback to 1998 when he chose to leave formal education for good, Raghava recalls with a smile how he convinced his father Kalyanaraman Durgadas, a retired entrepreneur and now author (who won best debut author award at the recent Pune Literary Festival) to let him explore the world himself. &ldquo;As an 18-year-old who had just completed Class 12 in Science at Bishop Cotton Boys&rsquo; School, I was brainy enough to use his philosophical arguments against him. The world will be my classroom, I said, and promised him I would be both emotionally and financially independent to make a difference in the world and keeping my health and mind alert. And then began my new journey,&rdquo; he says. While his father taught him how to lead a respectable life, he credits his mom Leela Kalyanaraman with inspiring him to see life and art though the lens of love, compassion and commitment.    Raghava, still a teen, then approached a top tourism department official in Delhi used his convincing skills of mediation to ensure that his first ticket expenses to Strasbourg, France were met by the central government itself.   &ldquo;My pitch for cartooning people in Europe in an Indian backdrop, to make them feel like they&rsquo;re revisiting their home won me that. Once that happened, meeting new people and associating with them for different causes added a global perspective to my thoughts and ideas, later contributing to me settling down in New York till early this year when I chose to shift my base back to Namma Ooru,&rdquo; he says.    On being asked which avatar of his life he likes living, the witty-yet-thoughtful Raghava pauses for a moment before saying, &ldquo;I have no idea what be the next one is likely to be and I guess that&rsquo;s my favourite as of now.&rdquo; The same reflects further when he explains why training...",,,,,,,,en,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,,

We saw an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to improve that process. This article is all about how we did that, and where we are going with the technology.Let’s start with describing what an internal audit really is:Internal audits are mandatoryHumans review a large corpus of unstructured data looking for risk and controlsThis sounds like a good problem to address with artificial intelligence. But wait… Is this complex task even possible to automate?Yes it is.The rest of this article is about how we went from knowing nothing about audits to building an audit enhancement tool, starting from requirements gathering from subject matter experts, progressing to problem statements, and finally landing at a solution that helps auditors to do their thing.The AuditMap.ai process involves configuring an audit universe, dumping in internal reports and documents, and then using the output of the tool to gain insights on programs, activities, entities, risks, controls, and so forth.My first experience with internal audit was in the medical devices space (nuraleve.com), where we undergo regular ISO, Health Canada, and CE audits. Internal audit is a standard part of the medical devices manufacturing and distribution process on a global basis, and so Mathieu Lemay and I already had some exposure to the structure and function of an internal audits. What we didn’t see while working on the medical devices internal audits for a small company was the scale of internal audit at the enterprise level. It’s absolutely enormous.The internal audit function of many organizations — especially at public companies and governments — is gigantic, mandatory, and not very effective. It took some deep work with audit professionals for us to fully understand the scope of the problem, and to implement the solution.First Things First: Understanding Internal Audit in 3 Easy StepsLike all good projects, we started with the help of our industry partners to briefly create a definition of Internal Audit. This led us to the use cases for applying deep learning.Step 1: Why Internal Audits ExistGaining a fundamental understanding of the purpose of Internal Audit (IA) was a prerequisite before we could begin throwing deep learning around (AI for IA. hahaha) for this highly unstructured data. And so, we turned first to the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) for clarifications:“The internal audit activity should monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the organization’s risk management system.” — IIA-Standard 2110.A1The documentation goes on to further explain:“The internal audit activity should assist the organisation by identifying and evaluating significant exposures to risk and contributing to the improvement of risk management and control systems.” — IIA-Standard 2110 –Risk ManagementSo basically, IA is there to find problems. Now that we had this clear definition of IA from IIA, we set off to understand at both management and process levels, how audits are conducted.Step 2: How Internal Audits Are OrganizedHow enterprises of all sizes achieve “evaluating the effectiveness of [their] risk management system” is through the performance of several internal assessments (“audits”) to get the pulse of various segments of their organization’s operations. We dug deeper into this, to outline these assessments’ underlying methods and processes, and came across this key structure of any risk management system: The Audit Universe. Each company defines the components of their Audit Universe by distinctly identifying:Corporate Structure, and accountability frameworksInternal subdivisions & External ComponentsPrograms of operationsActivities within each programEssentially, the boundary outlined by the Audit Universe identifies all things that can, and are subject to the supervision of the organization. It is within this audit universe that all internal audits and assessments are conducted, thus leading to step 3.Step 3: Conducting an Internal Audit 101Internal auditing, simplified, boils down to being an evaluation of how a segment of the organization performs when compared to their appropriate compliance or policy requirements. Similar to ISO, you say what you do, do what you say, and then verify that you did what you said you should do. Since internal audits are mandatory for all organizations’/groups’ intents and purposes, these activities are expected to adhere to a set of standards. Planning and undertaking these tasks requires a human’s review of a large corpus of unstructured data. This is where AI excels.Auditors want to identify and understand the risks and controls in the operations they’re called to audit through a few different lenses. These variants in perspective are used to comb for potential issues in processes, and involves inspecting entities:By Control Objectives, Strategic objectivesBy Frequency of risk occurrenceBy TypeThe reason for these different views is simply to look for problems. Notably, should a risk area be recurrently identified as consistently lacking for multiple years for which no control is being enforced, then this would be highlighted as an additional note to include in the management audit report. Similarly, if no risks or controls are identified, this can indicate to the auditor that there is a hidden risk within a program or process that is not being evaluated.Oh No! Internal Audit is BrokenThis manual process of doing internal audits is super broken. I described above what intrernal audits are supposed to do. As we worked to understand the nature of internal audit, we discovered an increasing amount of more and more breakages along processes, ranging from bias in audit selection and completeness to inadequate personnel training methods and highly manual labor intensive audit processes.Today internal audit is a broken window into the risks and controls hiding within mountains of internal reports from across the organization.Here are a few examples we found in our requirements collection:Quantifiable overview is not available. Numbers are hard to generate, and so the 50,000 foot view is often misleading. The content’s corpus is generally sampled, as there is too much documentation to analyze manually.The process is dependant on non-quantifiable human decisions: Risks aren’t identified as they should, Controls are ineffectively associated. Not to mention the “Humans have feelings” factor; bias in both background and experience.Knowledge transfer is poor — leading to silos of knowledge and heavy reliance on key staff members.Some programs are over-evaluated while others are rarely audited. Example: credit card audits are too common, and management audits are too rare. If the only risks addressed in audit are financial risks, then other critical factors such as technology risk.The goal of the audit function is to demonstrate process performance and expose problems, rather than to just check a box and say you did an audit.The list goes on…The main pain points for internal audit are audit completeness, better report investigation, and ensuring best practices during the audit. This grindingly manual process of doing internal audits required some significant rework, and was clearly an area that could benefit from our implementation of deep learning models.Example of how to define the audit universe template and risk management framework within AuditMap.aiExample Audit Universe (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment). The full tree is available here.How AuditMap.ai Improves Internal AuditHaving collected end-user requirements and identified flaws in the IA process with subject matter experts, our team was left with an opportunity to improve things. In short, we established our vision as, applying deep learning to internal audit, to bring better business outcomes without compromising audit quality.AuditMap.ai is a natural language understanding tool that enables auditors to direct their assessments to known industry-wide issues: audit completeness, better report investigation, and ensuring best practices during the audit. Applying deep learning accelerates audit functions by resolving routine legwork bogging down the auditors’ ability to assess and report with no compromise on quality.Consider a motivating example…Example — As a Director, knowing what you’re working withThe ability to paint a high level picture for the audit function shouldn’t be hard. Right now, it is. It is the top-of-mind item of audit directors, new or established. AuditMap.ai uses a digital and interactive Audit Universe, and so knowing the lay of the land becomes the new standard. Say, for example, Acting Audit Director “X” needs a big-picture understanding of the risk environment associated to each of the programs under her supervision. Our tools provides the following key capabilities:Automatically identify risks, controls, and other key entities within all audit universe documentation.Map out a knowledge graph of entity relationships to accompany the risk summary.Map and relate risks and controls to documents within the audit universeSegment off the risk statements having high similarity, in an effort to identify areas of possible audit efficiencies, andReveal at a roll-up of the risks by program, revealing where there are no audit documents or risk statements within the audit universe, indicating a program that has been ignored by the audit function.AuditMap provides quantifiable overviews and puts the director and her team of auditors in a position where the critical focus of their efforts is placed on understanding the universe in which their work evolves, and working to deliver the work products the C-suite expects of them.Having a profound understanding of an assessment scope can lead to more discoveries of efficiencies as more people involved in planning are empowered to ask questions along the lines of “How can our work be improved? Can it be simplified? Are there means being conducted outside of the scope of this program that we could leverage?”Our solution required a lot of data labelling on sample audit reports, in order to form a basis for training a model to understand various types of sentences and their meaning. Applied deep learning lends itself quite well to benefiting the performance of a planning phase exploration of programs. Leveraging the capabilities suggested in the examples above, AuditMap.ai can use deep learning models to combine the results of risk and control reports created by AI-powered inferences indexed in an enhanced search engine (ElasticSearch with Kibana) capable of identifying text fragments of interest using syntax and/or semantics. Needless to say, this solution presents a leap forward in business processes automation for audit managers, leaving them more time to coach their teams and share their knowledge without consistently relying on key staff for mundane document understanding tasks.Conclusion and Future WorkIn conclusion, AuditMap.ai uses deep learning to accelerate a wealth of processes within the internal audit function. This holds especially true for contexts requiring a largely resource-intensive effort using digitized documentation, ranging from advanced search methods to document segmentation. In the case of internal audit, the way forward to better, faster, business outcomes is paved by applied deep learning.The few examples demonstrated in the article above, among others, are fully operational and deployed in our AI-powered internal audit solution, AuditMap.aiWe are in the sales cycle now (finally) and our target market is audit shops, the big 5, and large enterprise clients as early adopter customers.

This is to say that the machines can imitate human behavior and replicate humans. In a way , it reduces human efforts , thereby , increasing efficiency at work. But on the other hand , machines taking place of human labour also have negative impact since it takes the place of employment of people.Artificial Intelligence poses a great threat to humanity.  Stephen Hawking who is a cosmologist and theoretical physicist has also cautioned of the forthcoming threats that are likely to happen with the use of AI in the development of weapons.There is a serious need among people to contemplate about the effects and impacts that artificial intelligence will have on human race. Scientists have warned that if these artificial machines and facets take place of human labour , then such a development will lead to mass unemployment. According to World Bank’s 2014 report, countries such as Macedonia, Mauritania and Lesotho had an unemployment rate of 30.2%, 31.9%, and 34.9% respectively (Ford, 2015). There would be increased poverty, hunger, illiteracy, dependency, crime, reduced life expectancy among other things. Earlier , people embraced this ideology, but soon they realised that this is at the cost of such loss of employment.Though , if we look from the context of companies , they are giving positive response. And why not , since the machines do not ask them pay checks after every month. The machines do not look at the clocks or work as per restricted hours.Unemployment has caused anguish in the mindset of youth. Also , they have valid reasons as well. Money spent on education , struggles involved and then scholarly results lead them nowhere , hence it is bound to frustrate them. This takes a negative turn and hampers their growth and then they are indentured to explore the criminal world. To earn money , to fulfil their needs and to accomplish their goals and mainly to live as per what they dreamt of are the few reasons because of which they participate in criminal activities. It has been observed that some of the biggest dons/mafia are highly qualified people. So that leaves us with no question that scholars do get attracted towards the villainous world.Therefore , there should be proper method followed so that the harmony and compatibility between artificial intelligence and youth employment be maintained. The youth should not be made to suffer or lead to reprehensible conditions.         AffairsCloud Recommends Oliveboard Mock TestIBPS RRB Officer - Free Mock TestIBPS RRB Assistant - Free Mock TestSBI Clerk - Free Mock TestSBI PO - Free Mock TestIBPS Clerk - Free Mock TestRBI Grade B - Free Mock Test

In honor of Amazon Prime Day, let’s take a look at the inner workings of this company that is pushing the bounds of innovation, not only with Amazon Prime, but the many other cutting-edge management strategies.

The company that sets the tone for so many aspects of customer experience is breaking down internal barriers and showing how other companies can do the same. Amazon, a leader in customer experience innovation, has taken things to the next level by reorganizing the company around its AI and machine learning efforts.

 
Amazon Uses An AI Management Strategy Called The Flywheel
PROMOTED
Amazon’s approach to AI is called a flywheel. In engineering terms, a flywheel is a deceptively simple tool designed to efficiently store rotational energy. It works by storing energy when a machine isn’t working at a constant level. Instead of wasting energy turning on and off, the flywheel keeps the energy constant and spreads it to other areas of the machine.

At Amazon, the flywheel approach keeps AI innovation humming along and encourages energy and knowledge to spread to other areas of the company. Amazon’s flywheel approach means that innovation around machine learning in one area of the company fuels the efforts of other teams. Those teams use the technology to drive their products, which impacts innovation throughout the entire organization. Essentially, what is created in one part of Amazon acts as a catalyst for AI and machine learning growth in other areas. Amazon is no stranger to AI. The company was one of the first to use the technology to drive its product recommendations. But as AI and machine learning grow, the flywheel approach has become a keystone to Amazon’s expanding business – a central stone at the summit of the company, connecting the organization together. This is particularly unique at a time when many companies silo their AI efforts and don’t integrate them into the overall company.
AI Is Not Located In One Particular Office At Amazon – It’s Everywhere
AI isn’t located in a single office at Amazon, and information is spread throughout departments. Machine learning technology is used by the product recommendation team to improve its product forecasts, and those insights are shared throughout the company. AI and machine learning powers three popular Amazon products: Alexa, the Amazon Go Store, and the Amazon recommendation engine.

The Amazon Echo, which features AI bot Alexa, has been one of the company’s most popular forays into machine learning. Amazon faced an uphill battle at the beginning, especially as it was one of the first companies to try its hand at creating a voice-powered virtual assistant that could fit on a countertop. Once the technology started to come together, divisions across the company realized that Alexa could be beneficial for their products. Some of the first skills for Alexa were integrations with Amazon Music, Prime Video, and personalized product recommendations from an Amazon account. Many companies now have Alexa skills that add value to the customer’s life such as Liberty Mutual and Capital one. Liberty Mutual provides auto insurance information and Capital One allows customers to make a payment through their Amazon device.
The cashier-less Amazon Go store also took advantage of the wealth of data to track customer shopping trends. Data from customers’ smartphone cameras tracks shopping activities and not only helps Amazon Go, but can also be shared with the machine learning team for continued development.
AI also plays a huge role in Amazon’s recommendation engine, which generates 35% of the company’s revenue. Using data from individual customer preferences and purchases, browsing history and items that are related and regularly bought together, Amazon can create a personalized list of products that customers actually want to buy.

 
Creating A Cohesive Customer Experience With Artificial Intelligence
Data from these three main pillars of the company work together to create a cohesive customer experience. A customer can visit the Amazon Go store to get a few items for dinner, ask Alexa to look up a recipe and the product recommendation engine can determine that the customer likely needs to purchase a certain type of sauce pan. Instead of fighting against each other, different divisions share their innovative knowledge to provide a customized and cohesive customer experience.
Amazon has come a long way since its early beginnings in AI and machine learning. The company now sells its machine-learning approach through Amazon Web Services to clients including NASA and the NFL. By taking advantage of AI advancements and applications in other areas of the company, it offers personalized AI solutions to large and small businesses.
In a world where so many companies are hung up with bureaucracy and silos, it is refreshing to see Amazon break down the walls to encourage innovation and growth throughout its entire organization. If other companies want to succeed and stay on the cutting edge of new technology, they might also want to consider a new organizational approach like the flywheel.

But it warned there would be ""winners and losers"" by industry sector, with many jobs likely to change.

""This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. ""Our analysis suggests the same will be true of AI, robots and related technologies, but the distribution of jobs across sectors will shift considerably in the process.""PwC said about seven million existing jobs could be displaced by AI from 2017-2037, but about 7.2 million could be created, giving the UK a small net jobs boost of around 200,000.Some sectors would benefit disproportionately, however, with jobs in health increasing by 22%, scientific and technical services by 16% and education by 6%.By contrast manufacturing jobs could fall by 25%, transport and storage by 22% and public administration by 18%, PwC said.

""It's likely that the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills, as well as capabilities like creativity and teamwork which machines find it harder to replicate.""A growing body of research claims the impact of AI automation will be less damaging than previously thought. In April, the OECD criticised an influential 2013 forecast by Oxford University that found about 47% of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35% in the UK were at ""high risk"" of being automated over the following 20 years.The OECD instead put the US figure at about 10% and the UK's at 12% - although it did suggest many more workers would see their tasks changing significantly.AI 'poses less risk to jobs than feared'Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots'Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk'",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44849492,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E176/production/_99381775_robot-ma.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential campaign and the successful “Leave” campaign in the UK Brexit referendum led the Oxford English Dictionary to select “post-truth” as word of the year for 2016. Since then, anti-elite populism across the North Atlantic has continued to gain victories, chief among them the 2018 victory of the Five Star Movement in Italy. As governments, foundations, academics, political activists, journalists, and civil society in democratic societies struggled to understand the overwhelming political results alongside the apparent information disorder, most observers’ eyes fell on technology. Social media, bots, hyper-targeted behavioral marketing — all have been seen as culprits or at least catalysts in public conversations. Technology has altered the foundations of news and media, and as trust in media continues to decline, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and algorithms have come to play a critical role not only as threats to the integrity and quality of media, but also as a source of potential solutions.The core threats to information quality associated with AI include:Algorithmic curation. Most commonly known as the “filter bubble” concern, algorithms designed by platforms to keep users engaged produce ever-more refined rabbit holes down which users can go in a dynamic of reinforcement learning that leads them to ever-more extreme versions of their beliefs and opinions.Bots. Improvements in automation allow bots to become ever-more-effective simulations of human participants, thereby permitting propagandists to mount large-scale influence campaigns on social media by simulating larger and harder-to-detect armies of automated accounts.Fake reports and videos. Improving automated news reporting and manipulation of video and audio may enable the creation of seemingly authentic videos of political actors that will irrevocably harm their reputations and become high-powered vectors for false reporting.Targeted behavioral marketing powered by algorithms and machine-learning. Here, the concern is that the vast amounts of individually-identifiable data about users will allow ever-improving algorithms to refine the stream of content that individuals receive so as to manipulate their political opinions and behaviors.Our approach to this set of issues is through the analysis of very large datasets, covering millions of stories, tweets, and Facebook shares, across diverse platforms reflecting national presidential politics in America from April 2015 to the present. The results of our work suggest that emphasizing the particular and technological, rather than the interaction of technology, institutions, and culture in a particular historical context, may lead to systematic overstating of the importance of technology, both positive and negative. Many studies do not attempt to address the impact of AI and other technologically-mediated phenomena that they identify and measure, but rather are focused on identifying and describing observable practices. In our own work, we have repeatedly found bots, Russian influence campaigns, and “fake news” of the nihilistic political clickbait variety; in all these contexts, we have found these technologically-mediated phenomena to be background noise, rather than a major driver of the observed patterns of political communication. Excessive attention to these technology-centric phenomena risks masking the real political-cultural dynamics that have confounded American political communication.Studying media ecosystemsWe study propaganda and disinformation in political communication through the lens of media ecosystems. The springboard for our research is a tool built in a decade-long collaboration between our Berkman Klein Center team and our colleagues at MIT Media Lab’s Center for Civic Media: Media Cloud. Media Cloud enables us to discover media network structures that form around specific topics and to shed light on media frames, attention, and influence. Our early work centered on discrete legislative and regulatory controversies, such as net neutrality and the SOPA-PIPA bills. As election year approached in 2016 we turned our attention to the presidential race.Initially, we analyzed the 18 months leading up to the November 8 vote. The Columbia Journalism Review published our preliminary findings in February 2017, and we followed with a more complete analysis of pre-election media in August of last year. Since then we have expanded our research to include analysis of the election’s aftermath, and have combined the election-period study with a review of the first year of the Trump presidency into a book coming out with Oxford University Press in September 2018, entitled Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics. With the support of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, we focused attention on the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on political public media. This work is motivated by the need to better understand the character, scope, and origins of the issue as an essential element in crafting corrective measures. Here we summarize our preliminary conclusions as well as the work of a growing number of researchers investing in this space.Disinformation problems are fundamentally political and social — not technologicalOur research leads us to conclude that political and social factors, not technology, are at the root of current media and information quality problems in American political communication. We analyze the linking, tweeting, Facebook sharing, and text of four million stories related to presidential politics published over a period of nearly three years before and after the 2016 presidential election. Relying on this data, we mapped out media source networks in open web media (online news, blogs, etc.) and on Twitter to learn how media sources clumped together based on similar cross-media linking and sharing patterns. This revealed a startling finding: media sources are, as many have observed, deeply polarized; but they are aligned in a distinctly asymmetric pattern. There is, as it turns out, not a simple left-right division in American political media. Instead, the divide is between the right and the rest of the political media spectrum. Media sources ranging from those with editorial voices that lean towards the center-right, such as the Wall Street Journal, all the way to distinctly left voices such as Mother Jones or the Daily Kos, comprise a single interconnected media ecosystem. In this portion of the media spectrum, attention is normally distributed around a peak focus on mainstream professional journalism outlets and journalistic values and mainstream professional journalism continue to exercise significant constraint on the survivability and spread of falsehoods. By contrast, there is a large gap between media sources in this broad center to center-left to left cluster and media sources on the right. Moreover, attention on the right increases as one moves further from the center, and peaks around media sites that are exclusively right-wing.Network map based on Twitter media sharing from January 22, 2017, to January 21, 2018. Nodes are sized by number of Twitter shares.When we took a closer look at the substance and practices of journalism from the center of the spectrum to its poles, we found major differences in behavior. Media sources on the left and right extremes of the spectrum are prone to sacrificing accuracy in favor of partisan messaging, making them also prone to the spread of disinformation. However, the accountability and fact-checking mechanisms in the media structures on the center and center-left provide a barrier against further propagation and a check on shoddy reporting from the left. Media outlets that strive for objectivity and balance are less susceptible to spreading disinformation.The leading media in the right-wing cluster follow a distinctly different strategy, and repeatedly amplify and accredit, rather than dampen or correct, bias-confirming falsehoods and misleading framings of facts. We find that insular conservative media lack the will or capacity to adhere to objectivity and accuracy in their reporting. Infowars, Gateway Pundit, and conservative political clickbait are a problem, but a bigger problem is when Drudge Report, Breitbart, and Fox News — conservative media sources with much larger audiences — amplify conspiratorial and deceptive stories. This creates a significant gap in information quality for readers of conservative-leaning sources of news relative to those who consume media sources outside the right-wing ecosystem, including left-wing sites.Algorithmic curation and filter bubblesIt is important to understand that if filter bubbles or algorithmic curation were the primary reason for polarization, we would expect to see symmetric patterns of attention clustering by populations of audiences and publisher — all of whom are at the same technological frontier. The stark asymmetry between the right and the rest strongly suggests that differences in political culture and, we argue in our book, institutionally-driven media history of right-wing media, particularly talk radio and Fox News, drove the right into a media dynamic we call the propaganda feedback loop. This occurred before major Internet sites developed; Internet sites adapted to that already-operative media dynamic, rather than causing it.Indeed, when we compare the pre-election coverage and the post-election coverage, attention on the left has shifted more to the center, while attention on the right has remained as right-oriented. Fox News has become more prominent online relative to Breitbart, but at the price of becoming more purely focused on right-oriented content than it was during the election. Fox online has lost hyperlinks from the center-right and center even more than from the center-left and left, and gained links from the right. This pattern is not the simple product of algorithmic filter bubbles. Compared to influence metrics based on social media attention, weblinks are more insulated from platform-imposed algorithms as they reflect the judgment and linking decisions of web authors, rather than attention and sharing patterns of audiences. Nonetheless, the asymmetric polarization appears by this measure too, and it is by this measure that Fox itself has moved to the right since the 2016 election.BotsOver the course of the year we have developed our own versions of several of the most widely-used bot-detection algorithms. We reran all of our analyses after removing accounts that were identified as “bots” by various methods. Although we do in fact identify a good number of accounts that would be considered “bots” by many of these definitions, the overall architecture of communication we observe remains unchanged whether we include these accounts or not. Without stronger evidence that particular major communications dynamics have been swayed by bots, our macro-level observations leave us skeptical as to the importance of bots. Moreover, using micro-scale case studies, we observe bots as background noise rather than as impactful interventions.Functional and structural differencesToday’s media ecosystems are of course inseparable from technology, but if technology was at the core of the disinformation problem, we would expect to see as much disinformation on one side of the spectrum as the other. And yet, that’s not the case. The asymmetry we observe in the structure and practices of media across the U.S. political spectrum is evidence that the dynamics and problems in modern day media cannot be explained by technology alone.Our caution should not be taken as clear evidence that algorithms are unimportant. There is little doubt in our minds that algorithms and machine learning impact media manipulation and disinformation. In large-scale digital media platforms, algorithms serve a curatorial role and act as gatekeepers, and are subject to gaming and manipulation in ways that human editors are not. In our own research, we have seen, for example, that Twitter is littered with disinformation and false accounts, some of which are bots and others sockpuppets. Moreover, we observe that the spread of disinformation is worse on Facebook than on Twitter, and on Twitter than on the open web. Moreover, we observed that, as Facebook was making its algorithm changes over the year, certain of the worst offenders on both the left and the right lost prominence and attention, although new offenders quickly took their place. In our current work we continue to monitor the differences across platforms and to find measures by which to assess the effectiveness of algorithm changes on Facebook or Twitter on the spread of disinformation and misinformation, and, perhaps most importantly, to assess the impact of these changes on the media ecosystem as a whole.Diagnoses, conclusions, and interventions should be based on systemic observations of impact, rather than individual observations of “bad behavior”The media manipulation problem and the public attention afforded it have created an environment of urgency. Insights and research are key to mitigating some of this pressure, but the temptation to leap to assumptions of impact from any observable phenomenon is hard to resist. We are naturally drawn to the novel: trolls, clickbait factories, social media algorithms, targeted advertising, psychographic profiling, and Russian interference captivate the imagination and compel question and inquiry. Identifying instances of such interventions is technically challenging, and when we see hard work bear fruit it is tempting to attribute high importance to these observations. Nonetheless, without a baseline against which to assess the impact of one or several of these phenomena, it is impossible to justify assigning them the importance that they currently receive, or to design interventions that properly address the actually important interventions rather than those that are observable and salient.Putting these novelties into perspective is hampered by our ability to fully and accurately measure media consumption. Audiences reached by misleading and false articles and media sources is measured in the millions. As prolific as this sounds, as described previously this ultimately is a small portion of content and exposure. A second point of uncertainty relates to impact and persuasion — there is scant evidence that false media stories have any impact in changing behavior.A prime example is Russian efforts to influence election-related discourse. Although information around the number of accounts, posts, and impressions seems to be updated regularly, current numbers draw into question the true significance of their reach. In October 2017, Facebook revealed that approximately 80,000 pieces of content published by the now infamous Russian-operated Internet Research Agency were introduced to 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Their subsequent likes and shares increased the reach of the posts to 126 million Facebook users. This is indeed a big scary number. But what we don’t know is how much user attention this content commanded among the many billions of stories and posts that comprised the news feeds of U.S. voters, or if it changed any minds or influenced voter behavior. For example, using one of the tools we developed for this project, we can track the appearance of a given string across Facebook public facing pages, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and the first few posts in 4chan discussions on a timeline down to the minute or second (depending on the platform). Using that utility, we tracked a particular story with strong indications of Russian influence (about John Podesta participating in satanic rituals), and compared all accounts to both the congressionally-released list of Russian Twitter accounts and an additional list of tens of thousands of accounts that are highly likely to be Russian bots or sockpuppets. While we did observe that 5–15% of the accounts were of such provenance at any given minute, the timing and pattern of their participation was unremarkable — a background presence of more-or-less stable existence, rather than a strategic intervention in either timing or in direction, and they therefore did not seem to play an important role in increasing the salience of the story in total or by tweeting it specifically at the major actors who were central in propagating the lie — Wikileaks, Infowars, or, ultimately, Sean Hannity.It is critical not to confound the observation of a novel phenomenon with its actual impact in the world; newness is no proxy for impact. Indeed the discovery of such phenomena is important, but the messaging around the discovery should not be conflated with evidence that the discovered behavior in fact had impact.The rapid advancement of technologies that digitally manipulate sound, images, and videos is a source of growing anxiety. It is too soon to predict whether synthetic media will exacerbate media disorder and epistemic crisis, but if fabricated media are shared, consumed, and interpreted in ways similar to the current versions of deceptive media, it will be spread or contained by the same influential social, political, and media entities. The fantastical nature of the claims that were widely believed by significant numbers of voters — nearly half of Trump voters gave some credence to rumors that someone associated with the Clinton campaign was running a pedophilia ring — suggests that social identity, much more than any technical indicia of truth, are the foundation for beliefs and attitudes about political matters.Our work greatly benefits by consciously focusing on the disinformation forest, rather than on its individual trees. With an eye toward the long-term dynamics between institutions, culture, and technology, we look at algorithms and technology as a relatively new element integrated into the dynamics of broader media systems while keeping grasp of many more traditional vectors and structures. We look across media and across platforms, considering the enduring influence of radio and cable alongside broadcast television and social media platforms. Indeed, a combination of open web media publication and social media network mapping greatly enhances our understanding of the likely impact of bots, sockpuppets, political clickbait, foreign intervention, and microtargeting. Although prolific in absolute terms, the role of these modern vectors of disinformation plays an important but modest role in the overall media ecosystem.It doesn’t look like AI is coming to the rescue anytime soon, if everThere are a number of ways in which AI may help us to address information quality issues, including:Automated detection and flagging of false stories; algorithmic tools to point readers to corrections and fact-checking.Algorithmic tools to detect and defend against coordinated attacks by propagandists.Computational aids to “nudge” of readers and users to expose themselves to media and reporting outside of their echo chambers, thus opening their eyes to a broader range of viewpoints.Despite the strong advances in the field, there is little indication at present that these tools will be able to serve as independent arbiters of truth, salience, or value. Repeatedly in our work, we have seen that stories built around a kernel of true facts, framed and interpreted in materially misleading ways are more important than stories made of clear falsifiable claims. Moreover, the meaning of stories often emerges from the network of stories and frames within which they are located. Stories and their interpretation — and misinterpretation — draw upon and act through existing social and political structures and narratives. As seen in existing applications, AI is effective at channeling and amplifying sentiments and interests of affinity groups, and helping people in ways that they want to be helped, but no present efforts appear to be able to diagnose the level of subtlety involved in the most important present disinformation campaigns we have been studying.Systemic responses are required to address systemic issuesSo what do we do about all of this? There is no silver bullet, but the best thing we can do is to continue to work toward systemic responses to the systemic problems undermining today’s media ecosystem and information quality. We must continue to focus attention on rebuilding and strengthening the political and civic institutions that undergird a well functioning democracy. The insights described here draw primarily on research conducted in the United States, but we need ecosystem-based analyses of media systems in more countries to understand how the vulnerabilities, resilience, and dynamics differ across different political and cultural contexts.Strengthening media accountability mechanisms is vital, and tamping down disinformation and media manipulation is an integral part of the everyday hard work of democracy and governance. But given the perils of placing constraints on political speech, taking a careful and cautious approach to regulation is essential. It is important to be similarly circumspect in what we require of social media companies in addressing disinformation.Last but far from least, there is still much work to be done in understanding the nature, reach, and impact of disinformation, as well as monitoring and evaluating targeted efforts to inoculate readers and inhibit the spread of disinformation. An area of particular concern is the increasing concentration of research capability and political outreach capability in a few private hands. We must continue efforts to bolster public interest research initiatives and develop and implement structures that allow researchers access to key sources of data with mechanisms in place to ensure robust and ethical research standards.The development, application, and capabilities of AI-based systems are evolving rapidly, leaving largely unanswered a broad range of important short- and long-term questions related to the social impact, governance, and ethical implementations of these technologies and practices. Over the past year, the Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab, as anchor institutions of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, have initiated projects in areas such as social and criminal justice, media and information quality, and global governance and inclusion, in order to provide guidance to decision-makers in the private and public sectors, and to engage in impact-oriented pilot projects to bolster the use of AI for the public good, while also building an institutional knowledge base on the ethics and governance of AI, fostering human capacity, and strengthening interfaces with industry and policy-makers. Over this initial year, we have learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities for impact. This snapshot provides a brief look at some of those lessons and how they inform our work going forward.

With the rapid pace of innovation continually disrupting business models, and in many cases entire industries, how will online learning keep up to provide the relevant courseware for today’s and tomorrow’s workforce? This will be essential for economic growth and to support a thriving, college-educated workforce that’s equipped with the very latest knowledge, ideas and technology.
In the future, I believe that institutions at the forefront of online education will be recognized via several capabilities which will have digitally transformed today’s EdTech market. They will include a powerful combination of omni-channel learning pathways, cognitive courseware, virtual counselors and AI-enabled course development and grading.
These innovations, underpinned by artificial intelligence (AI), will help to provide students the ultimate choice in their courseware – including up-to-the-minute courses on high-interest/high-growth subject matter – as well as highly-innovative digital services that support them every step of the way to help maximize their success and personal objectives.











 
 
 
Projecting ahead 5 to 10 years, the following AI-enabled strategic themes and scenarios are some of the aspects I believe will be hallmarks of leading practice:

Omni-choice learning pathways
Firstly, online education will have evolved beyond omni-channel (anytime, anywhere) to omni-choice whereby students will be able to select and configure every pathway in their learning journey to personalize and customize their near-term and long-term learning plan and approach to their unique situation, needs and interests.
As an example, with self-driving cars commonplace – learning will be conducted at home, in class or on the road during lengthy commutes, with students able to pick up and resume their online courses on any device in any location and in any duration and format. AI will help to hyper-personalize this omni-choice functionality so that students can focus more on their actual learning and less on the mechanics of their learning.











 
 
 
Cognitive courseware
Online classes will have evolved from simulations with limited permutations, to more sophisticated interactive, technology-based experiences (e.g. North Star Learning Group’s I-L-X with “hundreds of thousands of paths through the games”) to enable students to learn by doing and from the decisions they’ve made.
Digital strategy advances from other industries such as healthcare, where the traditional delivery model is being disrupted and moving into the home via technologies such as wearables and IoT, will be regularly applied to the education sector to bring the institution into the 21st century. 
As an example, emotionally-intelligent virtual assistants (see “virtual counsellors” below) will monitor student attentiveness and verbally suggest when students should take a break or switch to a different learning modality. They will also help “at risk” students stay on track.











 
 
 
Hybrid classroom/online courses will maximize the best of both worlds and will be customized and personalized down to the individual student while still being consistent and coordinated for multiple students and teachers. In addition, there will be considerable blurring of digital/physical learning options, techniques and possibilities (e.g. 3D printing, digital twins, AR/VR) with students no longer making distinctions between one or the other.
Virtual counsellors
Virtual counsellors, available in a variety of interaction styles including voice, wearable, AR/VR and even humanoid robotics, will help students with guidance and mentorship across every step of their higher education and continuing education journey from institution and course selection, to course engagement and completion, to career planning and even to employment / gig economy suggestions, analysis and match-making.
Rather than replacing human counsellors, they will augment the work of the counsellor so that human counsellors can focus on most meaningful and strategic work activities (much like the present-day, emotionally-intelligent Amelia virtual agent can handle level 1 phone support, but hand over to a human agent for more complex support requirements as and when needed).











 
 
 
AI-enabled course development & grading
With the gig economy (freelancing) having overtaken traditional full-time employment by 2027, the academic market will have industrialized the production of online courseware to quickly develop and deploy online learning courses that meet the fast- and ever-changing needs of freelancers as they compete in the global labor market.
As an example, course developers at leading institutions will utilize AI technologies to help them quickly assemble their courseware and reduce the manual effort required by up to 80 percent. This frees up course developers and administrators to be more strategic and plan their portfolio roadmaps in close collaboration with business and community partners.
Trainable AI (much like “trainable” collaborative industrial robots from Rethink Robotics), will be able to observe a physical class via machine vision and thereafter create a template or blueprint for the online equivalent of the course. This will speed online course creation and the ability for leading institutions to produce up-to-the-minute courseware.











 
 
 
In addition, AI-enabled course grading will be at highly advanced stage in 5 to 10 years where course administrators will be confident of the fairness and accuracy of automated free-text grading algorithms due to advances in machine learning, semantics and natural language processing. If they have questions about a student’s grade, they will be able to speak with the AI system, understand the rationale, and adjust as and where necessary.
Digital ecosystems and purpose-driven objectives
While the future of learning technology will be very different from today’s environment, I believe the brand and reputation of the institution delivering the courseware will be as important, if not more so, than it is today. Students will look for courseware that’s leading-edge in terms of its subject matter, digital delivery and support mechanisms (to give them the best in experience, price, selection and availability), but will also look at the pedigree of the institution, faculty and staff and what they – and their alumni – stand for in their community.
I believe the most successful institutions will be those that develop a robust and respected innovation ecosystem of educational, business and community partners, a world-class faculty and staff, and who achieve market success by offering a vast selection of digitally-sophisticated courseware that keeps pace with a rapidly-changing world.











 
 
 
Leading institutions will embrace both business-driven and purpose-driven objectives and constantly strive to improve the world around them. Digital strategy, innovation, emerging technologies (including 3D printing, AI, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, blockchain and IoT), and collaborative ecosystems may be some of the tools and methods, but ultimately it will be the people involved – working towards a shared vision – who will make the difference.

This bionic hand is special because it uses artificial intelligence to improve its functionality.








A schematic of the bionic hand the team have built.
University of Göttingen






The work carried out by the team and published in Science Robotics, shows that with the help of machine learning, fluid motion of prosthetics can be achieved. At the moment, movement of prosthetics is controlled by motors that are stimulated with external signals from surrounding muscles in the amputee. In the new bionic hand, however, the patient’s intentions are interpreted by a human-machine interface which then sends signals to the prosthetic.  Senior author of the paper Professor Dario Farina from Imperial College’s Department of Bioengineering says, ‘When designing bionic limbs,  our main goal is to let patients control them as naturally as though they were their biological limbs . This new technology takes us a step closer to achieving this.’
The bionic hand relies on eight electrodes to pick up weak electrical signals from the stump of the amputee which then sends signals to a miniature computer in the prosthetic. The machine learning algorithm in the computer interprets the signals and provides the set of instructions needed for the bionic hand to move in the way the patient wants. Not only can it move in the way the patient wants, but the speed of the movement can also be controlled which provides a more natural feeling. Farina says, ‘The new bionic hand is not only more natural, but it is also superior in terms of functionality in daily tasks than what’s currently available to patients.’ Check out the short video below of the comparison of conventional bionic hands and a machine learning bionic hand.

Farina says, ‘Following this clinical study, we hope to have this available on the market for patients within three years.’ Before the bionic hand was tested, there was an initial training phase where the patient could train the machine learning algorithm to interpret their own electronic signals. In future prototypes, the aim is to get rid of this initial training phase. On top of this, the team would like to have the bionic hand receive signals from the patient via wireless technology and have greater control over the individual movement of the fingers. This could be the ‘next generation’ of prosthetics and the future is looking very bright. Watch this space.

This is 2018, and the world is addicted to online shopping, our choice of #ootd is driven by a technological ecosystem where store inventory is displayed on phones and the touch-and-feel experience of old-fashioned shopping is replaced by cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence.Imagine an online web store, or app. Picture this: hundreds of products in various categories—from workwear to lingerie—displayed in photographs, videos and 360-degree models, queries and customization requests processed by chatbots, try-before-you-buy options and new product recommendations based on shopping history. These finer details that make up a satisfying customer journey are made possible by harnessing machine learning.Artificial Intelligence can work both ways—enabling discovery for consumers in a market cluttered with choices and empowering brands and creators to market their products effectively. Delhi-based fashion discovery app Findow addresses both parties in the transaction. Founder Zarine Bajaj describes her platform as “Zomato for fashion”, allowing customers to find fashion brands and stores based on geo-tagged information, trend reports and feedback from other users. Simultaneously, Findow’s smart technology platform is designed to help retailers automate everyday operations, from product inventory and order processing to customer relations. “The app is a great help for new designers, as we enable them to manage their business better,” says Bajaj, adding that her team is also working on virtual store formats to connect brands seamlessly with customers. Earlier this year, Artificial Intelligence start-up Vue.ai, whose clients include Levi’s, Diesel, Cosabella and Tata CLiQ, launched a product to analyse garments and generate human models, negating the need for hours of catalogue photography and digitalization. Much of Artificial Intelligence’s role in fashion retail is aimed at automating the mundane activities that consume hours of human labour, says Atul Rai, founder of Staqu Technologies, a Gurugram-based start-up that has developed image-matching systems, automated meta-tag filters and visual searches for online fashion retail brands. “I believe human beings should not have to spend hours doing repetitive activities,” he says. “For instance, users look for products using certain tags (attributes) and e-commerce sites hire curators to do the work. But the same work can be done through Artificial Intelligence much faster.” AI is also applied to traditionally customer-facing personnel roles. Bengaluru-based tech start-up AskSid works primarily with brands in Europe, creating chatbots and facilitating multi-channel conversations that enable brands to understand consumer requirements based on data. “The bots must be intelligent, building the conversation,” says Sanjoy Roy, co-founder of the start-up. “For that, we must be domain experts who understand fashion ontology.” AskSid draws from a repository of over 40,000 actual consumer conversations to create information and talking points which are fed to the bots. The chatbots are trained to answer questions, but also discover new ones. Roy cites an example from one of their clients, whose customers requested images of the back of a garment. The brand was able to address the concern because it had data extracted from automated conversations between customers and bots.AI’s impact goes beyond the online experience. In February, American fashion brand Tommy Hilfiger partnered with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, to explore the role of AI in trend-forecasting and design. The Reimagine Retail project required students to use IBM Research AI tools and Hilfiger image libraries and create future-smart designs. There’s also Jacquard by Google, a weaving technology that enables communication, navigation and audio features in clothing—its first design is a trucker jacket created by Levi’s with snap buttons on the sleeve that connect the garment with the Jacquard app; however, critics have pointed out that the jacket must offer more functions to justify the price ($350; around  ₹ 24,000) it commands.Internationally, stores like Rebecca Minkoff and Nordstrom have experimented with smart mirrors which customers can use to browse other looks in the store, while adidas employs the Run Genie tool in select stores to recommend shoes based on how much a customer walks. Some stores also employ heat-map analysis from camera networks to assess customer behaviour and drive sales. Artificial Intelligence can certainly ease some of the mundane activities that the retail business entails. But chatbots don’t have every answer, Roy acknowledges. “When human intervention becomes necessary, we connect it to the executive in the most seamless manner possible,” he says. AI application is still in its early stages, especially in India, says Bajaj. “AI is undoubtedly the next big move but one can also sense the fashion industry’s hesitation in adapting it in its entirety, especially among upcoming retail brands and fashion designers. The transition will come once they start introducing themselves to better formats for the development of their brand,” she adds. The potential of AI is on the rise, and the future promises more advance technologies. Amazon is already testing cashier-less stores in the US and Rai says research could make it possible for consumers to upload their image online and try on garments. “We might even have clothes designed by AI in the future,” he adds.

So hard, in fact, that some startups have worked out it’s cheaper and easier to get humans to behave like robots than it is to get machines to behave like humans.“Using a human to do the job lets you skip over a load of technical and business development challenges. It doesn’t scale, obviously, but it allows you to build something and skip the hard part early on,” said Gregory Koberger, CEO of ReadMe, who says he has come across a lot of “pseudo-AIs”.“It’s essentially prototyping the AI with human beings,” he said.This practice was brought to the fore this week in a Wall Street Journal article highlighting the hundreds of third-party app developers that Google allows to access people’s inboxes.In the case of the San Jose-based company Edison Software, artificial intelligence engineers went through the personal email messages of hundreds of users – with their identities redacted – to improve a “smart replies” feature. The company did not mention that humans would view users’ emails in its privacy policy.Being human: how realistic do we want robots to be?Read moreThe third parties highlighted in the WSJ article are far from the first ones to do it. In 2008, Spinvox, a company that converted voicemails into text messages, was accused of using humans in overseas call centres rather than machines to do its work.In 2016, Bloomberg highlighted the plight of the humans spending 12 hours a day pretending to be chatbots for calendar scheduling services such as X.ai and Clara. The job was so mind-numbing that human employees said they were looking forward to being replaced by bots.In 2017, the business expense management app Expensify admitted that it had been using humans to transcribe at least some of the receipts it claimed to process using its “smartscan technology”. Scans of the receipts were being posted to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourced labour tool, where low-paid workers were reading and transcribing them.“I wonder if Expensify SmartScan users know MTurk workers enter their receipts,” said Rochelle LaPlante, a “Turker” and advocate for gig economy workers on Twitter. “I’m looking at someone’s Uber receipt with their full name, pick-up and drop-off addresses.”Even Facebook, which has invested heavily in AI, relied on humans for its virtual assistant for Messenger, M.In some cases, humans are used to train the AI system and improve its accuracy. A company called Scale offers a bank of human workers to provide training data for self-driving cars and other AI-powered systems. “Scalers” will, for example, look at camera or sensor feeds and label cars, pedestrians and cyclists in the frame. With enough of this human calibration, the AI will learn to recognise these objects itself.In other cases, companies fake it until they make it, telling investors and users they have developed a scalable AI technology while secretly relying on human intelligence.How to start an AI startup1. Hire a bunch of minimum wage humans to pretend to be AI pretending to be human2. Wait for AI to be invented— Gregory Koberger (@gkoberger) March 1, 2016
Alison Darcy, a psychologist and founder of Woebot, a mental health support chatbot, describes this as the “Wizard of Oz design technique”.“You simulate what the ultimate experience of something is going to be. And a lot of time when it comes to AI, there is a person behind the curtain rather than an algorithm,” she said, adding that building a good AI system required a “ton of data” and that sometimes designers wanted to know if there was sufficient demand for a service before making the investment.This approach was not appropriate in the case of a psychological support service like Woebot, she said.“As psychologists we are guided by a code of ethics. Not deceiving people is very clearly one of those ethical principles.”Research has shown that people tend to disclose more when they think they are talking to a machine, rather than a person, because of the stigma associated with seeking help for one’s mental health.A team from the University of Southern California tested this with a virtual therapist called Ellie. They found that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to divulge their symptoms when they knew that Ellie was an AI system versus when they were told there was a human operating the machine.Man 1, machine 1: landmark debate between AI and humans ends in drawRead moreOthers think companies should always be transparent about how their services operate.“I don’t like it,” said LaPlante of companies that pretend to offer AI-powered services but actually employ humans. “It feels dishonest and deceptive to me, neither of which is something I’d want from a business I’m using.“And on the worker side, it feels like we’re being pushed behind a curtain. I don’t like my labour being used by a company that will turn around and lie to their customers about what’s really happening.”This ethical quandary also raises its head with AI systems that pretend to be human. One recent example of this is Google Duplex, a robot assistant that makes eerily lifelike phone calls complete with “ums” and “ers” to book appointments and make reservations.After an initial backlash, Google said its AI would identify itself to the humans it spoke to.“In their demo version, it feels marginally deceptive in a low-impact conversation,” said Darcy. Although booking a table at a restaurant might seem like a low-stakes interaction, the same technology could be much more manipulative in the wrong hands.What would happen if you could make lifelike calls simulating the voice of a celebrity or politician, for example?“There’s already major fear around AI and it’s not really helping the conversation when there’s a lack of transparency,” Darcy said.Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Silicon ValleynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedScientists make DNA discovery that could help find pancreatic cancer cureBlue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi HasanLiveTrump reportedly to reveal vice-presidential pick today; Schumer calls Trump case dismissal ‘breathtakingly misguided’ – liveDid Donald Trump just win the election?Arwa MahdawiFlorida judge dismisses criminal classified documents case against Trump",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since China has 731 million internet users, almost twice the U.S. population, Baidu’s data set is capable of fueling AI algorithms to make them even better. With this focus on artificial intelligence, Baidu is exploring some very intriguing applications for artificial intelligence and machine learning including in their offices where facial recognition technology makes standard ID cards unnecessary and allows you to order tea from a vending machine.

They have also recruited top AI talent including one of the world’s most notable AI pioneers Lu Qi, who was previously a Microsoft executive before he became Baidu’s COO in January 2017. Qi will step down in July 2018 for personal reasons. Although he was only at Baidu for a short time, he helped chart a clear strategy for the company’s AI operations that will continue. Here are a few ways Baidu uses artificial intelligence and machine learning.
DuerOS is Baidu’s voice assistant
Since Baidu can leverage its expansive data set, its voice assistant called DuerOS has accumulated more conversation-based skill sets than Alexa, Siri or Cortana. Partnering with other tech companies is one way Baidu hopes to accelerate innovation. They have teamed up with more than 130 DuerOS partners, and the voice assistant is in more than 100 brands of appliances such as refrigerators, TVs, and speakers. Since homes in India, Japan, Europe, and Brazil are more like homes in China, there may be better opportunities for DuerOS to globalize since Alexa, Cortana and Echo are optimized for American households. At CES 2018, Baidu debuted its DuerOS-powered smart screen called Little Fish VS1. This technology can recognize and respond to individual faces.

Mobile partners to accelerate AI-powered devices

Unlike its competitors, Baidu was steadfast in its commitment to desktops and missed the shift to mobile. To survive, Baidu needed a new strategy and artificial intelligence technology provided just the platform to turn the business around. That’s one of the reasons Baidu has committed so aggressively to AI investment. Today, AI products and services are priorities to make them the core of the company’s future. Now, they are partnering with Huawei to develop an open mobile AI platform to support the development of AI-powered smartphones and Qualcomm to optimize its DuerOS for IoT devices and smartphones using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Mobile Platform.
Self-driving cars
Even though automated driving is currently against the law in China, Baidu is working on autonomous-driving technology. Through the program called Apollo, Baidu’s artificial intelligence technologies are made available to car makers for free as a brain for their cars. In exchange, Baidu gets access to the data to make their algorithms smarter. It is hoped that Apollo will give any car manufacturer a fair shot at creating a viable product, just like Android did for smartphone makers. Even with this accelerated approach, it is expected that fully autonomous cars won’t be in production until 2020-2021.

Deep learning in the medical field
To find tumors and early warning signs for cancer, pathologists look at biopsied tissues magnified to 40X, but they are searching for micrometastases that can be as small as 1000 pixels in diameter. Deep learning-based algorithms can now be used to process the images and locate possible micrometastases. Baidu has developed a deep learning solution to predict if the cells are normal or cancerous. The results of using the algorithms in this way are promising—a lower number of false positives, better tumor localization scores, and improved efficiency. Computer vision that results in better detection of disease (or at least equal to human medical professionals) is a very compelling form of artificial intelligence, and one Baidu is actively working on.
Baidu recently spun-off its financial services arm on the heels of selling off other business units such as its food-delivery service Waimai and IQiyi  Inc., a streaming video service comparable to Netflix. These moves are intended to streamline operations so Baidu can invest aggressively in artificial intelligence initiatives such as autonomous vehicles and voice assistants. By leveraging partnerships, its unique space in Chinese culture that is less averse to AI, the Chinese government’s support as well as an enormous population that creates the data that allows AI insights, Baidu’s bet on AI might just be the ticket to its long-term success.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

The use of artificial intelligence in our everyday lives is on the increase, and it now covers many fields of activity. Something as seemingly banal as avoiding a traffic jam through the use of a smart navigation system, or receiving targeted offers from a trusted retailer is the result of big data analysis that AI systems may use. While these particular examples have obvious benefits, the ethical and legal implications of the data science behind them often go unnoticed by the public at large.
Artificial intelligence, and in particular its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, may only be neutral in appearance, if at all. Underneath the surface, it can become extremely personal. The benefits of grounding decisions on mathematical calculations can be enormous in many sectors of life, but relying too heavily on AI which inherently involves determining patterns beyond these calculations can also turn against users, perpetrate injustices and restrict people’s rights.
The way I see it, AI in fact touches on many aspects of my mandate, as its use can negatively affect a wide range of our human rights. The problem is compounded by the fact that decisions are taken on the basis of these systems, while there is no transparency, accountability or safeguards in how they are designed, how they work and how they may change over time.
Encroaching on the right to privacy and the right to equality 
The tension between advantages of AI technology and risks for our human rights becomes most evident in the field of privacy. Privacy is a fundamental human right, essential in order to live in dignity and security. But in the digital environment, including when we use apps and social media platforms, large amounts of personal data are collected - with or without our knowledge - and can be used to profile us, and produce predictions of our behaviours. We provide data on our health, political ideas and family life without knowing who is going to use this data, for what purposes and how.
Machines function on the basis of what humans tell them. If a system is fed with human biases (conscious or unconscious) the result will inevitably be biased. The lack of diversity and inclusion in the design of AI systems is therefore a key concern: instead of making our decisions more objective, they could reinforce discrimination and prejudices by giving them an appearance of objectivity. There is increasing evidence that women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and LGBTI persons particularly suffer from discrimination by biased algorithms.
Studies have shown, for example, that Google was more likely to display adverts for highly paid jobs to male job seekers than female. Last May, a study by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency also highlighted how AI can amplify discrimination. When data-based decision making reflects societal prejudices, it reproduces – and even reinforces – the biases of that society. This problem has often been raised by academia and NGOs too, who recently adopted the Toronto Declaration, calling for safeguards to prevent machine learning systems from contributing to discriminatory practices.
Decisions made without questioning the results of a flawed algorithm can have serious repercussions for human rights. For example, software used to inform decisions about healthcare and disability benefits has wrongfully excluded people who were entitled to them, with dire consequences for the individuals concerned. In the justice system too, AI can be a driver for improvement or an evil force. From policing to the prediction of crimes and recidivism, criminal justice systems around the world are increasingly looking into the opportunities that AI provides to prevent crime. At the same time, many experts are raising concerns about the objectivity of such models. To address this issue, the European Commission for the efficiency of justice (CEPEJ) of the Council of Europe has put together a team of multidisciplinary experts who will “lead the drafting of guidelines for the ethical use of algorithms within justice systems, including predictive justice”.
Stifling freedom of expression and freedom of assembly
Another right at stake is freedom of expression. A recent Council of Europe publication on Algorithms and Human Rights noted for instance that Facebook and YouTube have adopted a filtering mechanism to detect violent extremist content. However, no information is available about the process or criteria adopted to establish which videos show “clearly illegal content”. Although one cannot but salute the initiative to stop the dissemination of such material, the lack of transparency around the content moderation raises concerns because it may be used to restrict legitimate free speech and to encroach on people’s ability to express themselves. Similar concerns have been raised with regard to automatic filtering of user-generated content, at the point of upload, supposedly infringing intellectual property rights, which came to the forefront with the proposed Directive on Copyright of the EU. In certain circumstances, the use of automated technologies for the dissemination of content can also have a significant impact on the right to freedom of expression and of privacy, when bots, troll armies, targeted spam or ads are used, in addition to algorithms defining the display of content.
The tension between technology and human rights also manifests itself in the field of facial recognition. While this can be a powerful tool for law enforcement officials for finding suspected terrorists, it can also turn into a weapon to control people. Today, it is all too easy for governments to permanently watch you and restrict the rights to privacy, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement and press freedom.
What can governments and the private sector do? 
AI has the potential to help human beings maximise their time, freedom and happiness. At the same time, it can lead us towards a dystopian society. Finding the right balance between technological development and human rights protection is therefore an urgent matter – one on which the future of the society we want to live in depends.
To get it right, we need stronger co-operation between state actors - governments, parliaments, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies - private companies, academia, NGOs, international organisations and also the public at large. The task is daunting, but not impossible.
A number of standards already exist and should serve as a starting point. For example, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights sets clear boundaries for the respect for private life, liberty and security. It also underscores states’ obligations to provide an effective remedy to challenge intrusions into private life and to protect individuals from unlawful surveillance. In addition, the modernised Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data adopted this year addresses the challenges to privacy resulting from the use of new information and communication technologies.
States should also make sure that the private sector, which bears the responsibility for AI design, programing and implementation, upholds human rights standards. The Council of Europe Recommendations on human rights and business and on the roles and responsibilities of internet intermediaries, the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, and the report on content regulation by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, should all feed the efforts to develop AI technology which is able to improve our lives. There needs to be more transparency in the decision-making processes using algorithms, in order to understand the reasoning behind them, to ensure accountability and to be able to challenge these decisions in effective ways.
A third field of action should be to increase people’s “AI literacy”. States should invest more in public awareness and education initiatives to develop the competencies of all citizens, and in particular of the younger generations, to engage positively with AI technologies and better understand their implications for our lives. Finally, national human rights structures should be equipped to deal with new types of discrimination stemming from the use of AI.
It is encouraging to see that the private sector is ready to cooperate with the Council of Europe on these issues. As Commissioner for Human Rights, I intend to focus on AI during my mandate, to bring the core issues to the forefront and help member states to tackle them while respecting human rights. Recently, during my visit to Estonia, I had a promising discussion on issues related to artificial intelligence and human rights with the Prime Minister.
Artificial intelligence can greatly enhance our abilities to live the life we desire. But it can also destroy them. It therefore requires strict regulations to avoid morphing in a modern Frankenstein’s monster.

Consider yourself lucky if you happen to be studying machine learning, data science, business intelligence, or any other field that relates to AI. While automation slowly eats away at human jobs, the demand for AI talent continues to grow at an accelerating pace.
According to employment search platform Indeed, AI-related job postings have doubled in the past three years. 
“When it comes to the future of work, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are poised to impact nearly every facet of the workforce in some way,” says Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, Chief Economist at Glassdoor, another prominent employment directory website. “These technologies are being used for popular services like customer service chatbots at Bank of America, easy-to-search images on Facebook, and even automated fashion suggestions for apparel shoppers on Amazon.”
An increasing number of industries and domains are waiting to be disrupted and enhanced by machine learning and deep learning. Here are a number of exciting venues worth exploring if you’re interested in using your AI chops to develop game-changing technologies.
#1 Self-driving cars — Volkswagen
The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!Your email address*I agree to TNW storing and processing my personal data to receive the requested newsletter(s). For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*In a foreseeable future, AI algorithms will replace human drivers in cars. The technology still has challenges to overcome, and every once in a while we read about crashes and incidents that involve self-driving car test programs. But the industry is poised on ironing the kinks and rolling out self-driving cars to the masses in the next few years. And they’re looking for talented AI experts to help improve their self-driving cars technologies.
The field of autonomous driving has drawn the interest of not only big and emerging tech companies but also traditional car makers. Among them is German automotive giant Volkswagen, which has recently increased its involvement in the AI industry. The company has its own AI labs, where its experts on working on a range of projects, including the enhancement of the way self-driving cars see and react to events that happen around them.
In 2017, Volkswagen partnered with graphics chipmaker Nvidia to expand its AI projects. In early 2018, the carmaker partnered with self-driving car startup Aurora to accelerate the development of its fleet of self-driving cars.

# 2 Banking — JPMorgan Chase
AI algorithms perform best where there’s an abundance of quality data. And there are very few domains that have as much historical and structured data as the financial industry. There are many ways that AI can help make financial institutions become more efficient at providing services to their customers. Some examples include detecting and preventing fraud, algorithmic trading, and providing banking assistance to customers. In addition to many fintech startups that work on specific AI solutions, we’re seeing several large financial institutions and banks gradually transform into tech companies in their own right, acquiring startups and AI talent to develop their own solutions and maintain their competitive edge in a fast-changing market.
An example is JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, and among the leading financial institutions employing technology and AI algorithms in different fields. The firm recently hired Manuela Veloso, the former head of Carnegie Melon University’s Machine Learning Department, as its first head of artificial intelligence research. The company’s tech budget for 2018 topped $10 billion, and AI will be a good part of it. “Looking five to 10 years out, the pace of technological innovation will only quicken as artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, distributed ledgers and big data will all shape our future,” Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto said in a letter to shareholders in April.
JPMorgan has already rolled out several AI-powered services for its clients, including the use of AI algorithms to help investors make better investment and trade decisions.
#3 Healthcare — Philips
From making healthcare services available to more people to diagnosing and treating diseases faster and with more precision, health institutions are leading various projects to employ AI in medicine and healthcare. At Philips, a long-standing tech company and a global leader in health technology, you’ll be able to work on AI solutions that will reshape the entire health care cycle, from assisting health care providers to achieve better outcomes to helping consumers manage their own health and adopt healthier lifestyles. 
Philips’ focus is on combining AI and other technologies to understand and constantly adapt to the changing healthcare needs, a concept it calls “adaptive intelligence.” The company follows the vision that AI doesn’t replace healthcare professionals but augments their abilities and that enables 24/7 healthcare whenever, wherever needed. 
In an interview with the Journal of mHealth, Jeroen Tas, Chief Innovation and Strategy Officer at Philips said, “Supporting clinicians by streaming data, interpreting data, providing effective visualisations, detecting deviations from normal, providing early warnings – these are all areas where we can use AI to focus on supporting the clinicians to make the right decision at the right time.”
Philips is especially well-positioned to achieve this goal because it has a long history of developing hardware and software solutions for consumers, patients, clinicians and health institutions.  The company also has many years of experience in AI research in the field of medicine and healthcare. Philips already has several working AI-powered solutions at different levels, including research, diagnosis and treatment, home care and population health management. 
Some examples include HealthSuite Insights, Philips’ platform for data scientists, which enables them to create and access quality health data sources and create analytical models for different purposes such as diagnosis and treatment. CareSage is another AI-powered solution offering predictive analytics. It helps prevent avoidable hospital admissions and emergency room visits by aggregating different health data sources and performing predictive analytics. 
IntelliSpace Console gathers real-time information from connected health devices in the complex ICU setting and combines them with data obtained from hospital information systems and health records to help clinicians with predictive insights of the patient’s health and support them with timely and effective treatment decisions.

#4 Computer vision — Panasonic
As our robots and AI algorithms become increasingly involved in interactions with the physical world, they need to better understand what’s going on around them. The field of computer vision is a subset of AI that helps computers analyze the content of images and video and distinguish different objects. Computer vision is an important part of AI-powered technologies such as self-driving cars, security cameras, social media, healthcare, banking and more. The cool part of becoming involved in computer vision is that you get to work on a variety of interesting projects in different fields.
One of the companies actively involved in developing computer vision technology is Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic, which collaborates with research centers and universities to develop deep learning technologies. Panasonic is working on several interesting computer vision projects for special purposes, such as better pedestrian detection for autonomous vehicles and automatic inspection of dams through highly detailed image analysis.
#5 Cybersecurity — Palo Alto Networks
As organizations continue to generate more and more data every day, security and IT teams are finding it increasingly difficult to protect networks and prevent data breaches. According to estimates, an average organization has to process over 200,00 security events every day. Hopefully, AI and machine learning can advance security teams by perusing through data at ultrafast speeds and finding alarming patterns that need further investigation by a human analyst.
This is a fast-evolving field and many companies are employing AI to enhance their security systems to be able to respond to the growing needs of the market. Among them is Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise security company based in Silicon Valley, which has been integrating AI into its cyber threat detection and prevention software in the past year. 
Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks introduced Magnifier, a behavioral analytics solution that uses machine learning algorithms to investigate network traffic and discover stealthy activity that might be hiding a data breach. The company is working on many other projects and is on the lookout for AI talent.
#6 Emotion detection — Affectiva
In recent years, thanks to advances in natural language processing (NLP), we’ve all become used to accomplishing tasks through voice and conversational interfaces. Millions of people use Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google and AI-powered assistants to find answers to questions, set up alarms, play music, read emails, do shopping, turn on the lights and air conditioners, or lock and unlock doors.
The next step in AI chatbots and digital assistants is understanding intent and context, which will enable them to engage in more meaningful conversations and perform much more complicated tasks. This is the focus of many large tech companies as well as AI startups, and they’re all looking for the right talent to help them propel their efforts forward. One such company is Affectiva, a Boston-based MIT Media Lab spin-off focused on building AI that can understand and respond to human emotions.
In 2017, Affectiva released an AI platform that could measure emotion through sensing and analyzing facial expressions. The technology is already being used in several verticals and use cases. The company now aims to expand its AI research and development team and extend its emotion-sensing technology beyond the face to leverage human speech.

#7 Training — Deeplearning.ai
If there’s one thing the world needs, it’s more AI experts. In the near future, a lot of jobs will depend on the work and knowledge of people who are versed in the different fields that relate to artificial intelligence. 
There are several organizations that are hiring AI experts for educational programs. Among them is Deeplearning.ai, the organization founded by Andrew Ng who was also the co-founder of Google Brain and the former chief scientist of Baidu. Ng also has a long history of teaching AI and co-founded Coursera, the online training platform that hosts his famous introductory machine learning course.
Deeplearning.ai, Ng’s new venture, will be focused on teaching deep learning, which at the moment is the most popular field of AI. So, if money is not what you’re after and you want to share your knowledge, helping develop courses to train more people in machine learning and deep learning might be one of the most productive ways to put your AI skills to use.

Artificial Intelligence or AI has enabled us to recreate, to an extent, the human thought process to programs that refine their decision making process and evolve with time to make better decisions. As the application of AI expands to a multitude of fields of applications; logistics systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems, security setups, traffic control etc. Its inclusion in every new and novel field of application is greatly contemplated and looked forward to.One such novel field is drone logistics. Drones have been around for a lot of time, but due to the optimization of their control systems in the last decade, their domestic usage has risen up by a very steep curve. The article is focused on discussing the usage of AI on drone systems:            How does it apply to drone systems?            How does it increase a drone network’s efficiency?            How does it expand endeavors possible with drone technology?Intelligently Programmed Drones Systems of drones operate in an organized way, with set time, paths for each drone, timely and trustworthy data transfer within the individual drones etc.Most drones are operated by a pilot or user who controls the drone’s path and direction of the camera mounted on the drone. While it is applicable for photographers or people who use drones for recreational purposes, the commercialization of drone technology and its application in different markets has called for the need of automation for the following reasons:    Repetitive tasks performed by drones    Simplicity of tasks removing the need for a human operator    Accuracy of performance of a programmed/fixed task.Let us understand how autonomous drones work.Having the program stored and communicated by a microcontroller, a single, individual drone is programmed to follow a set path according to a set of pre-programmed principles. This could be for example while detecting obstacles using sensors (ultrasonic, infrared etc.) to avoid obstacles, deliver its package or perform any other task it is being utilized for at the designated location. Whether planted in the drone or decided by the drone using the criteria defined by its programmer, the drone completes its mission and returns to its point of take-off or launch, all the while recording any data necessary.Artificially Intelligent Drone Systems Autonomous drone systems can work without AI, so why do we need it? Well, autonomous systems may not need a pilot to operate the drones all the time, but they do need a programmer. A programmer has to work all the time to make the drone’s operation more and more efficient and effective; artificial intelligence can move this responsibility to the drone itself and make it a lot more efficient as the drone will now observe the course of its operation and make changes in its program to achieve the same task allotted to it without the need for human involvement. Given enough tries or iterations, either in real time operation while performing the task or in virtual reality or simulations, the drone can improve upon its program again and again and move towards the best possible or the optimum solution or method for achieving any given task.Let us take an example of a security drone that is designed to observe different people in a mall and classify them according to gender, age, height etc. The drone will be programmed with face detection and image recognition programs that are used to recognize and observe people with a camera. A person manually processing the images captured by the drone on the other hand, may have to work for countless hours to perfect this program to achieve accurate results. An artificially intelligent drone, however, will do it by itself; it will start observing facial hair and compare other features of specimens/people with facial hair with those without them and improve its classification on the basis of gender. It can ‘look’ at the skin of the people and their height to constantly improve its classification of people based on their age. This is an example of an artificially intelligent drone learning how to survey people.A recent example of researchers using AI and drones to identify human behaviour used a combination of deep learning algorithms trained with 20,000 images and a support vector machine was recently published. The drones were able to successfully identify if two individuals were engaging in violent behaviour based on the angles of their limbs.We can, therefore, identify some novel benefits of using artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies with drone systems:Real time data: The data that would normally take days or weeks to be processed and made available can be filtered and processed by artificial intelligence in real time, continuously being updated and communicated.Automated data capturing: Automated data processing opens up a new world for looking over complex physical structures and analyzing the captured data for defects. This can be applied to cell towers, wind turbines and general infrastructure inspection. Automated drones capture the images or other information required quickly, without having to deploy personnel to the top of the cell tower — today it is a manual process and requires individuals to access cell towers, thus exposing them to risks which potentially may cause fatalities. Automated drones can also scan blades on wind turbines without a human piloting the drone. Furthermore, it can carry trained AI models that can be used to quickly detect defects and provide recommendations on whether maintenance is necessary, without having to rely on archaic methods, such as a telescope.Shortening construction project length: Drones combined with AI trained models for detecting all objects and activities inside a job site will eventually automate the process of understanding and predicting the daily changes on a construction site, and will give customers data to better plan and allocate resources more efficiently including optimizing routes for construction equipment travelling across the site and creating a daily deployment schedule for machinery and people.Improving human operation: AI can measure the current efficiency of a driver or operator, and create a model of the most efficient operator from which newly hired operators can learn. It effectively transfers their experiences, through visual simulations, examples of hand movements, among other ways.Public Safety: Through the use of object recognition and reiterative learning, drones may be used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to recognise and preempt risky, antisocial and violent behaviours.Learning on the JobThere are a myriad of examples of drones using AI to improve efficiency and safety.Skycatch, for example, have been operating AI drones on over 5,000 building sites in Japan, scanning the ground to create maps of the terrain, as well as the location of vehicles and and equipment. The drones are able to complete in 15 minutes what can take a team of humans several days.The fixed wing UX11 drone developed by Delair uses deep learning to carry out in-flight calculations, speeding up the data processing chain when carrying out long-range mapping and surveying tasks. This improves workflow and reduces time spent covering large areas.In Kyoto Japan, researchers used a publicly available deep learning package to process aerial images of photos taken by a UAV to identify tree crowns. With am 87% success rate, they showed that the tedious task of traipsing through forests to count individual trees could be sped up and made safer through use of drones and AI.A Final WordThere are numerous application for drones and AI that will in time make daily tasks safer, more efficient and cheaper to perform. The question of ethics of some of these applications has been the subject of public interest. The recent involvement of Google’s Tensorflow in an AI development project with the US Department of Defense’s Project Maven drew considerable negative media attention as well as outcry from Google staffers. Google has since withdrawn from the project but it cannot be ignored that for as long as drones continue to be used for military purposes, they will draw upon AI to perform those missions with increasing accuracy.

A third camp – probably the largest – are happy to admit that the forces of change which are at work are too complicated to predict and, for the moment, everything is up in the air. Previous large-scale changes to the way we work (past industrial revolutions) may have been disruptive in the short-term. However, in the long term what happened was a transfer of labor from countryside to cities, and no lasting downfall of society.
However, as author Calum Chace points out in his latest book 'Artificial Intelligence and the Two Singularities'  this time there’s one big difference. Previous industrial revolutions involved replacing human mechanical skills with tools and machinery. This time it’s our mental functions which are being replaced – particularly our ability to make predictions and decisions. This is something which has never happened before in human history, and no one exactly knows what to expect.
PROMOTED
When I recently met with Culum Chase in London, he told me “A lot of people think it didn’t happen in the past, so it won’t happen now – but everything is different now.

“In the short run, AI will create more jobs as we learn how to work better with machines. But it’s important to think on a slightly longer timescale than the next 10 to 15 years.”
One guiding idea has always been that as machines take care of menial work (be that manual labor, augmenting the abilities of skilled professionals such doctors, lawyers, and engineers, or making routine decisions), humans will be free to spend their time on leisure or creative pursuits.

However, as Chace says, that would require the existence of the “abundance economy” – a Star Trek-like utopia where the means of filling our basic needs - sustenance and shelter - are so highly available that they are essentially free.
Without this happening, humans will find themselves in a situation where they have to go out and compete for whatever paid jobs are still available to humans in the robot-dominated workforce. As a simple example, a fully automated farm would, in theory, provide food at a far cheaper cost than one staffed with human farm hands, machinery operators, administrative staff, distributions operatives and security guards. However, if the owner of the farm still parts with his goods to the highest bidder, there would be inequalities in how that food is distributed among the populace and the potential for a poverty-struck underclass which lacks access to adequate sustenance. Nothing new there – of course, this underclass has always existed throughout history. However, it doesn’t exactly fit with the idea of the Star Trek utopia we need to have in place before we can comfortably hand the reigns to the machines.
This makes it something of a “chicken and egg” problem, and the ideal way for it to play out would seemingly be a gradual and managed transition to a smart machine-driven economy. This process would involve careful oversight of which human roles were being automated, and ensuring that the “plentiful” resources are in place to support those who unfortunately do find that they are being replaced, rather than merely “augmented.”
The problem is that this would require two elements: A concerted and informed effort from governments and regulators to understand the scale of the challenge and enable the right framework for it to happen. And an acceptance by those leading the charge – the tech industry – that there is a more important motive than profit for getting the change right.
Neither of those seems likely to happen any time soon. Despite the “make the world a better place” ethos, big tech’s overriding aim is still to generate growth and profit for their enterprises.
Also, managing the political change could be an even tougher job than persuading a tech CEO that she shouldn’t be focusing on revenue or profits.
“People aren’t stupid,” Chace says, while discussing how automated driving systems look set to erode the employment opportunities for humans whose trade is driving.
“They will see these robots driving around taking people’s jobs, and think ‘it won’t be long until they come for mine’ – and then there will be a panic. And panics lead to very nasty populist politicians, of the left or the right, being elected.”
Chace also doesn’t believe that the concept of universal basic income – currently being trialed in some Scandinavian countries – is the right answer, or at least not in its current form.
“The problem with universal basic income is that it’s basic. If all we can do is give people a basic income, we’ve failed, and society probably isn’t saveable.”
A future where the majority of humans live a subsistence-level income funded by the fruits of a robotic labor force, while a “1 percent” upper class – those in control of the robots – build their empires and reach for the stars – isn’t appealing to those with an egalitarian mindset. However, it could be the direction we’re heading in.
However, argues Chace, it’s not too late to plot a better course.
“We’ve all got a job to do – to wake up our political leaders who are not thinking about this, and wake up our tech leaders – who seem to be deeply in denial.
“If we do grasp the challenge we can have an amazing world for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, a world where machines do the boring stuff and humans do the worthwhile, interesting stuff.”

How AI Is Disrupting the Banking Industry

It’s an exciting time for financial services. A veritable smorgasbord of new, interrelated technologies are brewing up a perfect storm of disruption in the industry, including blockchain, data science, cloud computing and biometrics. Arguably, however, it is the significant advancement being achieved in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) that is having the most transformational impact on banking. In turn, AI is expected to permanently change the industry in profound ways during the coming months and years.
Few business sectors are currently more focused on developing AI for its own betterment than banking, as financial institutions seek to gain a competitive edge on their peers by implementing the technology to achieve improvements in speed, cost, accuracy and efficiency, as well as meet customer needs in an altogether more comprehensive manner. Much of the anticipation surrounds the ability of machines to replicate, and often exceed, what humans are able to do in banking. By collecting and utilising data to identify a whole host of patterns, moreover, those machines can become more adept at predicting activity that will ultimately make banks more efficient, from the front office to the back end.
The banking sectors being influenced by AI 
In terms of improving the customer experience, it is perhaps the chatbots that are currently the most visible form of AI being adopted across the sector. These automated service assistants are providing customers with the convenience of resolving their queries via an online messaging system, perhaps using their laptops or smartphones, instead of having to visit a branch. Through machine-learning techniques, more importantly, chatbots are improving consistently with regards to their ability to accurately identify the customer’s issue(s) and respond with the appropriate solution(s). As such, today they can recognise tens of thousands of variations on common questions a customer is likely to ask.
Chatbots are now practically an industry standard, and while they may not be able to perform more complicated tasks, they are undoubtedly improving their capabilities. In January, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) launched its in-house bot Ceba to more than a million customers, and which at last count could boast of being able to perform 200 tasks. But CBA expects that by the end of the year, this number will hit the 500-mark, while Ceba will also be able to successfully discern 500,000 different ways customers may ask for different banking activities. And then there’s Nina, Swedbank’s AI chatbot, which has been in operation for around two years. In addition to answering customer questions on an online chat platform, Nina can also pass on more complex calls to members of staff. The bot has managed to achieve a 78-percent first-contact resolution within the first three months, in addition to a customer adoption rate of 30,000 conversations per month during this time. 
But in terms of AI development and what could ultimately be achieved in banking, chatbots appear to be just the beginning. At the other end of the complexity scale is the usage of bots on the trading floor, primarily as a way to help traders perform more competently. In sectors such as algorithmic trading, AI algorithms can be developed in order to produce highly refined investment strategies. As opined last year by Michael Harte, Barclays’ group head of innovation, the clearest use case for AI in banking is “in large algorithmic trading”, which means “using vast amounts of high velocity data to outsmart the competition and to provide better instruments and value to customers”. AI is proving especially useful in high-frequency trading, which is a specific type of algorithmic trading characterised by high order rates and often ultra-fast trade execution. Given the short window of time in which trading opportunities present themselves in such markets, robots can be programmed to more efficiently capitalise on such opportunities than humans.
Swiss bank UBS last year debuted its two new AI systems on the trading floor, one of which is a system that analyses reams of market data to identify trading patterns, and thus formulates new strategies for trading volatility for the bank’s clients. Through machine learning, therefore, the system can improve its trading performance, which should ultimately translate into greater market returns for UBS’ trading division. The second is a relatively more straightforward protocol that was jointly developed with Deloitte and which addresses the post-trade allocation preferences of the bank’s clients. The system scans through emails sent by clients to identify their requests for splitting up large block trades among their various funds, before executing the transfers. By doing so, a 45-minute task can now be accomplished in just a few minutes, thus freeing up time for bankers to focus on more important jobs.
Indeed, management of customer data appears to be one area in which AI adoption is progressing comparatively quickly. The UBS emails are just one form of such data; others include news articles, recorded phone conversations and legal documents, with JPMorgan Chase’s contract intelligence (COIN) being an example of the latter. While manual review of the approximate 12,000 commercial credit agreements per year is estimated to take 360,000 hours, or 173 years, the use of COIN reduces that time down to just a matter of a few seconds. Clearly the time and cost implications of such a powerful analytical tool can be substantial. 
Similarly, AI is making considerable inroads on the compliance and security aspects of banking. With money laundering continuing to be a persistent problem for the global banking industry, there is now much anticipation over what technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, data mining and analytics can do to combat this threat, especially now that banks are being fined more frequently due to failings/inadequacies in their anti-money-laundering infrastructures. HSBC is among the keenest to explore such options—in April, it was revealed that following a successful pilot, the bank had partnered with big data startup Quantexa to utilise AI software to counter money laundering. According to Quantexa’s press release, “The technology will allow HSBC to spot potential money laundering activity by analysing internal, publicly available, and transactional data within a customer’s wider network”.
Moreover, the new venture follows another AI-based HSBC partnership last summer with startup Ayasdi to automate anti-money-laundering investigations that were previously being conducted by thousands of humans, according to the bank’s COO Andy Maguire. The aim of the initiative is to improve efficiency in this area, especially given that the overwhelming majority of money-laundering investigations at banks do notfind suspicious activity, which means that engaging in such tasks can be incredibly wasteful. In the pilot with Ayasdi, however, HSBC reportedly managed to reduce the number of investigations by 20 percent without reducing the number of cases referred for more scrutiny.
In addition to having an impact on specific divisions with the bank, AI is also playing a crucial role in changing banks’ inner organisational structures. For instance, US banking giant Wells Fargo announced last year the establishment of a new AI Enterprise Solutions team, which would operate under a new Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation group. According to the bank’s official announcement, the group aims “to help increase connectivity for the company’s payments efforts, accelerate opportunities with artificial intelligence, and advance application programming interfaces to corporate banking customers”, with the ultimate goal of helping the company “create innovative digital banking experiences”, as well as make it easier for customers to achieve their financial goals.
A profound impact on banking-industry employment awaits?
While there is much expectation over the positive change that AI can bring, there is also considerable trepidation surrounding the technology. One of the most frequent concerns being raised is the high degree of substitutability bank employees are likely to have with robots. As machines continue to become more advanced, those jobs that involve significant repetition such as bank tellers are likely to be at risk first, before jobs that require more complexity begin to be threatened. According to Lex Sokolin, who is the global director for fintech research firm Autonomous Next, AI adoption across the financial-services industry could save US companies up to $1 trillion in productivity gains and lower overall employment costs by 2030. Sokolin also predicts that such changes in financial services will only be gradual until 2025, before accelerating from then until 2030.
And according to a recent Autonomous Next report, banking and lending will see the biggest transformation, with $450 billion in savings being potentially achievable—as well as a whopping 1.2 million jobs being at risk; followed by insurance with $400 billion in savings and 865,000 jobs under threat; and finally the investment-management sector, in which 460,000 jobs could go while $200 billion in savings could transpire. What’s more, of those AI-induced banking-job losses, 70 percent will be in the front office—485,000 tellers, 219,000 customer-service representatives and 174,000 loan interviewers and clerks; and they will be replaced by chatbots, voice assistants and automated authentication and biometric technology. In other areas of the bank, 96,000 financial managers and 13,000 compliance officers will be let go in favour of AI-powered anti-money-laundering, anti-fraud, compliance and monitoring tools. AI-based credit-underwriting and smart-contracts technology will also be responsible for the shedding of 250,000 loan officers.
Moreover, such fears regarding employment are confirmed by some of the world’s most reputable banking leaders. Ex-Citigroup head Vikram Pandit, for example, expects that AI could render as many as 30 percent of banking jobs obsolete in the next five years, asserting that AI and robotics “reduce the need for staff in roles such as back office functions”. Japan’s Mizuho Group plans to replace 19,000 employees with AI-related functionality by 2027, and recently departed Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan had once considered replacing almost 100,000 of the bank’s personnel with robots.
At the same time, however, conflicting data suggests that the proliferation of AI will be accompanied by a rise in banking jobs. A recent study from Accenture found that by 2022, a net gain in jobs of 14 percent is likely to materialise among those companies that effectively utilise AI, along with a 34-percent increase in revenues. With complex algorithms likely to be employed by AI, banking shareholders, regulators and other parties with vested interests are unlikely to be assured if there is no one around to explain the workings and methodologies of the machines. Such a view seems to be demonstrably supported by Mr. Ken Wong, head of AI Lab (Fintech and Innovation Group) at Singapore’s OCBC Bank, who recently acknowledged that his bank has made more hires related to AI since last year: “Besides data scientists, who develop AI algorithms and models, we are also hiring more engineers to manage these AI applications, and business managers who understand how to leverage AI within the business to increase efficiencies and improve customer experiences.”
It may also be the case that only the most mundane jobs such as data entry will be sacrificed for machine superiority. New jobs are likely to be created around the AI software in such fields as compliance to ensure regulators are provided with sufficient communication and explanations of the AI being implemented. What’s more, Accenture sees AI as being a likely catalyst for liberating humans to be able to work on more interesting and complex jobs. Its survey of 1,300 bank employees found that 67 percent of respondents expect AI to improve their own work-life balance, while 57 percent expect the rise of the machines to actually help their own career prospects.
Whilst a rise in job numbers associated with higher AI-adoption rates seems ideal, however, some evidence suggests that most financial institutions are not yet fully confident in how to effectively apply the technology for the best results. This may go some way towards explaining the ambiguities of the aforementioned numbers and trends. New research from capital-markets research and consulting firm TABB Group, conducted on behalf of augmented-intelligence-solutions provider Squirro, for example, found that 67 percent of banks are actively using AI today, despite the fact that 87 percent of those exploring the technology remain unsure of how to deploy it effectively. As Miguel Rodriguez, vice president of customer success at Squirro, observed, the report “has shown that banks are increasingly receptive to using AI and machine learning in their organisation, but it also highlighted what needs to be done to ensure maximum value is gained”.
AI has become something of a buzzword, not just in banking but for many industries. But behind the hype lies the potential for genuine transformation in the way the banking industry—and indeed, the world—functions. And with specialised hardware being equipped with ever-increasing processing power to enable more robust AI systems, as well as vastly improved infrastructure to mine and feed data to such systems for even greater capabilities, the banking industry is now realising the extent to which machine intelligence can positively redefine how it operates. Of course, several questions remain, such as how exactly banks can co-ordinate AI’s awesome power with the customer’s need for human interaction when needed. Nevertheless, some dramatic changes now loom on the horizon for banking.

Thank! There is a serious misconception that AI in finance means forecasting the stock market and that “everyone does it” when in fact, operations, marketing and security have the greatest impact. There is also a serious problem when financial companies seek to hire someone to improve their work and gain machine learning experience. As a result, they have a scientist who spends most of his time with Excel macros! Not an ideal situation for either side.

State Bank of India, the India's largest lender, has SBI Intelligent Assistant (SIA) -- a smart chat assistant, evolved from the ""cutting edge technology of artificial intelligence, that efficiently resolves queries of NRI customers, similar to that of a bank representative.  ""It provides instant solutions on everyday banking queries in the chat box on the SBI portal,"" the state-run lender said.  The bank is also in the process of instituting an 'Innovation Centre' that will explore how emerging technologies such as AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can help in making internal banking processes more efficient. Another state lender Bank of Baroda has evolved an innovative concept by setting up of hi-tech digital branch equipped with advanced gadgets like artificial intelligence robot named Baroda Brainy and Digital Lab with free Wi-Fi services.  Private sector banks too are using the advance innovative technology for improving workforce productivity and enhancing the customer experience.  ""The Indian banking industry is on a rapid digital journey and has been adopting technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning which will reshape the future.  ""The Indian banks are using AI as a tool to detect human behaviour, increase efficiency in automated processes and reduce cost for iterative activities,"" said Tobias Puehse, vice president, Innovation Management, Digital Payments and Labs, Asia Pacific, Mastercard.  Allahabad Bank said that its app 'emPower' is scheduled to get major enhancements like Chatbot and artificial intelligence based e-commerce payments.Supratim Chakraborty, Associate Partner, Khaitan &amp; Co, said that given the immense competition in the banking sector, push for process driven services and the demand from customers to provide more customised solutions, many banks are opting for technologies using AI.  However, the complexity involved in these technologies creates several regulatory challenges.  ""Justice Srikrishna Committee has opined that the biggest challenge in regulating emerging technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things lies in the fact that they may operate outside the framework of traditional privacy principles,"" said Chakraborty. He opined that RBI will have to play a more proactive and dynamic role in framing regulations to balance the business interest of banks and at the same time ensure customer privacy and information protection. When asked about the implications of use of new technology, Kalpesh Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, said that investing in the right AI technology can have a major impact on bank's operational efficiency and that its success boils down to the customer impact above all else. ""Indian banks are making AI investments in areas that are data intensive, systematic and critical to the bank's focus on profitability, customer experience, productivity and compliance,"" he said. According to a global consultancy firm PwC, in this era of technology disruption, enterprises are under immense pressure to digitise operations, and they see a future where human work can be augmented through the use of software robotics. These enterprises, the report said, are beginning to view a digital workforce as part of their digital transformation strategy by combining elements of robotic process automation (RPA), AI and analytics to automate business processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@etcio.com,,,,

The technology itself is getting better and smarter day by day, allowing more and newer industries to adopt the AI for various applications. Banking sector is becoming one of the first adopters of AI. And just like other segments, banks are exploring and implementing the technology in various ways.The rudimentary applications AI include bring smarter chat-bots for customer service, personalising services for individuals, and even placing an AI robot for self-service at banks. Beyond these basic applications, banks can implement the technology for bringing in more efficiency to their back-office and even reduce fraud and security risks.Unsurprisingly, research firms are bullish on the potential of AI in banking. According to Fintech India report by PwC in 2017, the global spending in AI applications touched $5.1 billion, up from $4 billion in 2015. There is a keen interest in the Indian banking sector as well.Advent of AI banking in IndiaAccording to Accenture’s recent Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2018 report, 83% of Indian bankers believe that AI will work alongside humans in the next two years — a higher than the global average of 79%. “93% bankers in India said they increasingly use data to drive critical and automated decision-making. More partner-supplied customer data means a higher degree of responsibility for banks. Yet, 77% Indian bankers agree that most firms are not prepared to confront impending waves of corrupted insights from falsified data,” said the report.“AI is not new to India. Research institutions and universities have been working with various AI technologies for decades, and especially in the area of social transformation. With enabling technologies becoming a lot more accessible and inexpensive, AI is now becoming mainstream, with large enterprises and start-ups looking at different opportunities. Our research shows that the adoption of AI has the potential to add nearly $1 trillion to the Indian economy in 2035. AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, and a lot more needs to be done to realise its full potential,” says Rishi Aurora, managing director, financial services, Accenture.“Application of AI and ML (machine learning) to different functions within the banking industry has enabled them to offer a far more personalised and efficient customer service. By achieving that, banks have also been able to gain better insights into their customers’ preference and expectations from the bank. Accordingly, automation of back-end workflows has shown better outcomes. According to various industry reports, more than 36% of large financial institutions are already investing in such technologies, and close to 70% are planning to in the near future,” according to Darshan Shah, MD, South Asia, LenddoEFL, a Singapore-based fintech company.Not just customer supportState Bank of India, the largest bank in India, last year conducted “Code for Bank” hackathon to encourage developers to build solutions leveraging futuristic technologies such as AI and Blockchain into the banking sector. Private banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have already introduced chat-bots for customers service. Some have even gone ahead with placing robots for customers service. Last year, Canara Bank installed Mitra and Candi robots at some of its offices.“Payment companies are using AI to offer personalised payment experience to consumers. By applying AI and analyzing past payment patterns, payment systems can prompt the preferred payment instrument which best suits a purchase at the time of checkout. Say a consumer avails EMI option frequently for his big-ticket purchases, then the best EMI option is made available to the consumer at the time of checkout. Such personalised consumer experiences drive up consumer spending and creates stickiness to the product consumers are using,” saidVarun Rathi, cofounder and COO, Happay, a Bangalore-based start-up focused on digital payment solutions.Pune-based Persistent Systems’ chief architect, corporate CTO, Abhay Pendse lists out some common uses of AI in banks:Fraud Detection: Anomaly detection can be used to increase the accuracy of credit card fraud detection and anti-money laundering.Customer Support and Helpdesk: Humanoid Chatbot interfaces can be used to increase efficiency and reduce cost for customer interactions.Risk Management: Tailored products can be offered to clients by looking at historical data, doing risk analysis, and eliminating human errors from hand-crafted models.Security: Suspicious behaviour, logs analysis, and spurious emails can be tracked down to prevent and possibly predict security breaches.Digitization and automation in back-office processing: Capturing documents data using OCR and then using machine learning/AI to generate insights from the text data can greatly cut down back-office processing times.Wealth management for masses: Personalized portfolios can be managed by Bot Advisors for clients by taking into account lifestyle, appetite for risk, expected returns on investment, etc.ATMs: Image/face recognition using real-time camera images and advanced AI techniques such as deep learning can be used at ATMs to detect and prevent frauds/crimes. Not without challengesA wide implementation of a high-end technology like AI in India is not going to be without challenges. From the lack of a credible and quality data to India’s diverse language set, experts believe a number of challenges exist for the Indian banking sector using AI.According to Accenture’s Rishi Aurora, “A key challenge is the availability of the right data. Data is the lifeblood of AI, and any vulnerability arising from unverified information is a serious concern for businesses. Imagine for example, the risks that could arise from KYC compliance AI systems if the data sources are incorrect. Or consider the efficacy of a fraud detection AI system without the right kind of data. Structured mechanisms for collecting, validating, standardizing, correlating, archiving and distributing AI relevant data is crucial.”Abhay Pendse echoes the sentiment, stating, “India has 150+ languages with sizable spoken population. Applications which use speech to text or text to speech rely on natural language processing (NLP) libraries and techniques. Banks can use the existing technologies to start with to support some major Indian languages, but in order to effectively reach out to wider population in India, much more progress is required on NLP front.”“Data access and data privacy is a central aspect of any AI work banks do. These aspects will be of paramount importance with introduction of regulations in Europe such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). GDPR regulation is currently applicable to European citizens, but India and other countries have their own data privacy regulations. Banks in India will have to build AI systems with GDPR and similar privacy regulations in mind,” he said.Experts also have also stressed the need for more skilled engineers to drive the segment.“The biggest challenge is the scarcity of trained human resources; the existing workforce is not familiar with latest tools and applications. Secondly, the AI technology is a big threat to redundant employees in the banking sector. The mass adoption of AI may cause a grave unemployment problem in the sector,” said Rachit Chawla , CEO of Finway Capital, a Delhi-based non-banking financial company.“One of the important challenges that is faced by Industry and not just banks in India is unavailability of people with right data science skills. With only small number of good data scientists available to do AI work, the industry needs to work with universities in India to develop skilled data scientists as well as develop in-house training programs to train employees on data science skills.Also identification of right use cases for AI implementation with the help of domain experts and data scientists can help banks in successful implementation of AI technologies for banking functions,” Abhay stressed.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expected that artificial intelligence in U.S. education will grow by 47.5% from 2017-2021 according to the Artificial Intelligence Market in the US Education Sector report. Even though most experts believe the critical presence of teachers is irreplaceable, there will be many changes to a teacher’s job and to educational best practices.

Teacher and AI collaboration
AI has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. As AI educational solutions continue to mature, the hope is that AI can help fill needs gaps in learning and teaching and allow schools and teachers to do more than ever before. AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline admin tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability—uniquely human capabilities where machines would struggle. By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for AI in education is one where they work together for the best outcome for students. Since the students of today will need to work in a future where AI is the reality, it’s important that our educational institutions expose students to and use the technology.
Differentiated and individualized learning
Adjusting learning based on an individual student’s particular needs has been a priority for educators for years, but AI will allow a level of differentiation that’s impossible for teachers who have to manage 30 students in each class. There are several companies such as Content Technologies and Carnegie Learning currently developing intelligent instruction design and digital platforms that use AI to provide learning, testing and feedback to students from pre-K to college level that gives them the challenges they are ready for, identifies gaps in knowledge and redirects to new topics when appropriate. As AI gets more sophisticated, it might be possible for a machine to read the expression that passes on a student's face that indicates they are struggling to grasp a subject and will modify a lesson to respond to that. The idea of customizing curriculum for every student's needs is not viable today, but it will be for AI-powered machines.
PROMOTED
Universal access for all students
Artificial intelligence tools can help make global classrooms available to all including those who speak different languages or who might have visual or hearing impairments. Presentation Translator is a free plug-in for PowerPoint that creates subtitles in real time for what the teacher is saying. This also opens up possibilities for students who might not be able to attend school due to illness or who require learning at a different level or on a particular subject that isn’t available in their own school. AI can help break down silos between schools and between traditional grade levels.

Automate admin tasks
An educator spends a tremendous amount of time grading homework and tests. AI can step in and make quick work out of these tasks while at the same time offering recommendations for how to close the gaps in learning. Although machines can already grade multiple-choice tests, they are very close to being able to assess written responses as well. As AI steps in to automate admin tasks, it opens up more time for teachers to spend with each student. There is much potential for AI to create more efficient enrollment and admissions processes.
Tutoring and support outside the classroom
Ask any parent who has struggled to help their teenager with algebra, and they will be very excited about the potential of AI to support their children when they are struggling at home with homework or test preparations. Tutoring and studying programs are becoming more advanced thanks to artificial intelligence, and soon they will be more available and able to respond to a range of learning styles.

There are many more AI applications for education that are being developed including AI mentors for learners, further development of smart content and a new method of personal development for educators through virtual global conferences. Education might be a bit slower to the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, but the changes are beginning and will continue.

This year has seen, what appears to be, an unusually high level of soothsaying predictions on technological ‘Revolutions’, and how they will affect us all. How the latest technology buzz-word, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, will replace 50% of our jobs. Emerging new business models replacing the old, such as Uber and Airbnb. How the changing work landscape is driven by ‘Millenials’, who not only care for a salary but want access to many other perks believed to be unique to them.
The above may or may not be true, but it overlooks some significant demographic changes, both globally and in our backyards.
Artificial Intelligence
What is Artificial Intelligence? Is AI ready to take over the functions of the human world, implement nuclear armageddon and attempt to wipe out humanity? Can anyone state they have seen a convincing form of humanoid robot?
Most of us have seen some form of robot which can only just stand up. Has anyone had a meaningful conversation with a computer? Try adding a reasonably complex sentence from English into French or German in ‘Google translate’ and see what rubbish gets churned out. It might get the message across, but only just.
When the term, ‘AI’ is used it is usually a loose term with no relation to any form of ‘intelligence’. The reality is the manipulation of massive amounts of data which only a computer can do. The major change from 20 years ago is the speed with which we can process logic arguments. This ‘Big Data’ processing is not new. There are great success stories which have generated business and added employment.
Let’s call this Narrow AI (ANI). We are many years away from the culmination of ANI to become General AI (AGI), with the ability to reason, understand complex ideas, think in the abstract and generally learn from mistakes. As scientists we are a long way from understanding the human brain, never mind developing something to replicate a human mind or teach itself.
The crazy prophesying: We’re expected to believe 50% of jobs within the next 20 years are being taken over by robots, self-driving cars and trucks. Progress isn’t being made, and reasonably rapid, exponential progress due to operating at higher speeds.
Business (and personal) competitiveness has many more influences to compete against. In a world being made smaller by increased computerisation and technological innovation, AI and robotics are far down on the list.
New Business Paradigms
Although we have seen many advances in digital usage, such as Apple’s iTunes and Amazon’s webstore changing the landscape. One great example was the success of the ‘Tesco Clubcard’ and their use of the company ‘Dunnhumby’, a Big Data startup. It made suggestions based on a buyers shopping profiles with money off vouchers for future purchases – A marketers dream in a very ‘bricks-and-mortar’ establishment. A great example of the ‘Big Data’ generation within a very successful startup. It is not ‘AI’.
New business models taking advantage of these latest data-driven advances include Amazon, Google, Apple, Uber, Airbnb and Facebook all offering advantages to customers never seen before.
Many of these groups are collaborating in the field of neural advances and supercomputer technology, such as IBM’s Watson (with Apple), Google’s D-wave (with NASA) and Facebook’s FBLearnerflow. This area of AI is being researched (in the field of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing), which we have yet to see on the high street or in any meaningful mass consumer way.
Global Demographics
The rise of the East: Take the UK as an example, there were approximately 200,000 Graduates in 2016 entering the job market, while there were 7.7 million Chinese graduates alone, more than seven times that of 15 years earlier! In a rapidly globalising market, our graduates have to compete in a much bigger pool of talent.
Keeping with the UK as an example, as one of the World’s top nations for its research and development in many areas, such as Automotive (F1), Aerospace, Metallurgy, Pharma, Medical, Computer Services and High-end Manufacturing, amongst others. However, no nation can rest on its laurels. In this era of government and state austerity, it can quickly be overtaken by overseas competitors, as they increase R&D spend versus the UK’s cutbacks.
Demographic Time Bomb & Changing Work
Millenials (those born between the early 90’s and early 2000’s) are perceived in many circles to be particularly wanting. The reality is every generation, now and before us wanted purpose, feedback and a degree of work-life balance but it appears to be more explicit than before.
I don’t see any difference in the motivations of employees today, except for a rapidly changing work landscape.
There was a demographic explosion post-WWII resulting in the highest birth and mortality rates of a century. Due to increases in medical science, healthcare and prolonged peacetime, we are now experiencing the beginning of an increase in new pensioners. Retirees are increasing as we see Baby-boomers reach state pensionable age, putting pressure on those supporting them, either physically or fiscally. Currently, every pensioner across Europe is supported by four of working age. It is forecast this will reduce by 2060 to one pensioner for every two of working age.
The unwritten contract of Jobs-for-Life our grandparents enjoyed, has disappeared, as we see our parents and colleagues being made redundant. Vast swathes of employees and industries face significant changes due to global industrial changes, such as the ongoing ‘Lower-for-longer’ oil price crisis. The stability contract between employer and employee has eroded, leading to a rise in job-hopping.
100 Year Life
Two-thirds of baby-boomers are now expected to live past 80 years old, while only one quarter expected to at the turn of the 20th century.
It is conceivable that a majority of children born today could live to see 100 years, as we see rapid increases in healthcare, diagnostics and treatment. Thus creating the potential to turn-around the traditional education, work & raising a family, then retirement at 60-plus into considering a working life punctuated by sabbaticals and mid-career breaks.
Against this backdrop, the added costs of supporting society with increases in school-age leaving. Many more students are opting for a degree before entering the workplace, even with the increased cost of tuition, albeit making them more suitable for modern employment. Retirement age is increasing, for the UK it will be 67 in the 2020’s and possibly to 70 by 2060.
It is inevitable working age people start to ask questions on how best to live their lives.
A Learning Life
Lifelong learning will be a necessity. Changes in the education industry offer more opportunities with the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC’s).
Increased numbers of adult students will be more demanding of these institutions and expect more outcome-based results, rather than many of the rote-learning courses criticised in the past or ‘useless’, humanities and arts subjects. Cognitive, task-based, problem solving and interpersonal skills and abilities will be the key to this as will on-the-job learning as a pre-requisite for the future.
We are right to be aware of new technological advancements (such as AI and robotics). The challenges of a rapidly ageing population, increasing global competition and the life we live from the cradle to the grave, as we expect to live for much longer.
New business models: This presents some significant business opportunities for individuals and groups with relevant insights. Many under-served sectors of society could benefit from the application of digital skills, not least for the baby-boomer generation, one of the fastest growing users of the internet (‘Silver Surfers’).
Global demographic changes mean our R&D efforts either at the local Country, State or European level need better coordination and more investment if we are to ensure we remain competitive. Innovation is a tricky subject, but investment has always been key to its success.
As we see changes in the work landscape, re-education becomes a norm throughout life, it will bring other challenges, as we could see many younger graduates competing for work with much older, more experienced workers.
Change is a given and that change highlights itself to be exponential. Over the next few decades, there will be some exciting and quite unusual developments in the field of AI, as it possibly migrates from the Narrow to the General field.
We should be worrying about it less than the societal changes surrounding us. All these changes provide excellent material for budding startups as changes in demographics, social orders and advances in technology interact.

Future of Robotics & Artificial Intelligence

By Alex Jaumann -   07/24/2018      6 Minutes Read 




According to a Forrester report, robots will eliminate 6 percent of all jobs in the U.S. by 2021. McKinsey’s assessment is even more expansive — they believe that by 2030 one-third of American jobs could become automated.
This, however, doesn’t mean that life will soon be like “The Jetsons.” As technological developments have done in the past, the next generation of robots utilizing artificial intelligence and automation to streamline processes currently handled with the assistance of human workers will significantly alter the job market. This idea represents a form of disruptive innovation, a term that refers to when an emerging technology can utilize fewer resources, thus competing better against those without it.
The impact that automation has already had is significant. Despite the fact that more than 5 million factory jobs since 2000 have ceased to exist, U.S. manufacturing output has increased — between 2006 and 2013 it rose by 16.7%! To determine people’s feelings about this, we surveyed over 2,000 people and asked what industries they work in, how they feel disruptions might affect their labor market, what they think they will do if directly affected, how many people understand the concept of disruptive innovation, and how will it potentially impact their jobs in coming years. Continue reading to see what we learned.
Ignorance Is Innovative Bliss
Knowledge Is Innovative Power
Understanding what disruptive innovation is and how it might potentially affect your industry can be the difference between seeing a disruption coming (letting you get ahead of it) and possibly losing your customer base to a newer and younger competitor.
Of the 2,000 professionals polled, fewer than 40 percent were familiar with “disruptive innovation.” Disruptive innovation was coined in a 1995 issue of the Harvard Business Review; it regarded the evolution of technology in each industry. Despite Millennials living in a time where new technology is causing vast disruptions in the modern marketplace due to their purchasing decisions, almost 60 percent of survey respondents of that generation were unaware of the concept.
Gen Xers were the most familiar with the phrase (54 percent), while almost 40 percent of millennials also were in touch with the concept. However, centennials were the least familiar with disruptive innovation.
By industry, publishers were the most familiar with disruptive innovation. Perhaps because it has been facing disruption by digital competitors since the introduction of e-readers in the late ’90s, the publishing industry is one of the best modern examples of disruption. Other industries like manufacturing (41 percent), technology (44 percent) and retail (37 percent) also reported higher levels of understanding when we asked about disruptive innovation.
Looming Disruptive Concerns
Of those who acknowledged they were afraid of possible downsizing in their market, the publishing industry had the highest level of concern, with 50 percent of respondents telling us they were fearful of layoffs. While major layoffs in the publishing sector have already occurred, the continued trend toward digital publishing is a disruptive force that may have yet to fully run its course. Those in the retail industry (almost 49 percent) and construction (43 percent) also expressed fear of possible layoffs, perhaps because of disruptive innovations currently being developed and tested such as clerk-less stores and 3D printers capable of creating homes and commercial buildings.
The least concerned respondents worked in real estate, where less than 22 percent were concerned about layoffs. While real estate may seem like an industry that requires a human touch, certain research suggests artificial intelligence will reduce the number of them and could eventually even replace traditional real estate agents and brokers.
Already, artificial intelligence can automate house hunting processes. Consumers enter specific parameters into a computer (like location, budget, and preferences) and receive hundreds of recommended listings that match their request — largely for free and without having to set up a meeting and time to view!
Respondents who felt layoffs would most impact them were temporary employees (60 percent). Fifty-six percent of consultants and 53 percent of junior managers also admitted concerns about layoffs. Upper management, trained professionals, and administrative staff were the least concerned. Despite their cavalier attitude to being replaced, the 2016 Economic Report of the President to Congress offers a more dire assessment — those in the $40/hour wage range face a 31% chance of job loss due to automation.
Disruptive Innovation: For Better or Worse
When we asked survey respondents how they thought disruption might affect them, over 38 percent said it might cost them their jobs. Considering that almost half of those who understood disruptive innovation were concerned about layoffs, the fear of losing their job may come from a better understanding of the shifting marketplace.
Despite evidence to the contrary, 37 percent of participants didn’t think disruption would affect them at all, while almost 17 percent thought disruption might make their jobs easier. Additionally, around 4 percent were convinced their job would get easier, or they would be let go.
Professionals in publishing, retail and insurance were more likely to believe disruption might cost them their jobs, while respondents in real estate and the government believed disruption and the rising popularity of automated processes might ultimately make their jobs easier in the long run.
Anticipating Disruptive Innovation
The rise of artificial intelligence and other new technologies are already causing disruptions to governments around the world. It’s no surprise, then, that 35 percent of those in the field anticipate that major changes will come because of the internet. Speaking about the private sector, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking believes the advancements within artificial intelligence are a legitimate concern, one that could lead to many middle-class jobs disappearing from the workforce. Every job role, outside of those who are self-employed, generally feels the same way, regardless of industry.
Automation — or tasks being completed without the need for, or with minimal input from, humans — is the next largest concern in most industries. It’s the leading technology concern within the retail field. Malls and shopping areas that have failed to adapt to eCommerce are already seeing this play out with increased vacancies. Experience is one of the differentiators that automation hasn’t cracked — not yet, at least.
Life After Disruptive Innovation
If men and women are displaced due to disruption, their plans vary slightly as to whether they’d seek a new job in the same industry or a different one. Men were more likely to find a job in their current field (44 percent), while women were more likely to find a job in a different industry (45 percent). While some men (14 percent) and women (18 percent) would pursue additional education, it doesn’t seem to be the first choice for either gender.
Age also plays a factor in what respondents would do. Centennials (57 percent) and millennials (nearly 42 percent) would opt to find a new job within their current field — with the former being more likely to hit the books and seek additional education (19 percent). Over 30 percent of baby boomers would consider hanging up the “employed” status for good, choosing to retire instead of looking for another job.
Ahead of the Tech Curve
Artificial intelligence, digitization, and automation have already created a disruption in long-standing industries and societies and will continue to do so. The first and second industrial revolutions were periods of vast societal upheaval due to the way that they transformed the nature of labor. Disruptive innovation in this Third Industrial Revolution — with the ability of computers to reduce communication time, complete tasks and transform an ever-evolving number of data input into systems of pure information that can be reorganized into vast interactive networks that function akin to complex ecosystems — will be equally historic and important.
What the future holds for the professionals who work in fields looking to automate is still uncertain, but those informed about it will be at an advantage in how they respond to new tech developments. For those who understand disruptive innovation, almost half are concerned about downsizing and layoffs. However, even those that aren’t going to be replaced in the immediate future will be impacted by others’ jobs being automated. More unemployed people often translates to a depressionary effect on the wages of those employed. To address this and other effects, The Wall Street Journal has endorsed a guaranteed minimum income in the United States while countries like Switzerland and Finland are considering similar measures.

Sometimes it seems the clouds over climate science just won't lift. Computer models of Earth's climate have multiplied in number, complexity, and computational power, yet they remain unable to answer more precisely some of the questions most on the public's mind: How high must we build sea walls to last until 2100? How bad will heat waves get in the next decade? What will Arctic shipping routes look like in 2030? Climate models all agree that global temperatures will continue to rise in response to humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, but uncertainties stubbornly persist over how quickly that will happen and how high temperatures will go.
Tapio Schneider, a German-born climate dynamicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, believes climate science can do better. And he's not alone. Later this summer, an academic consortium led by Schneider and backed by prominent technology philanthropists, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, will launch an ambitious project to create a new climate model. Taking advantage of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), satellite imaging, and high-resolution simulation, that as-yet-unnamed model—the Earth Machine is one candidate—aims to change how climate models render small-scale phenomena such as sea ice and cloud formation that have long bedeviled efforts to forecast climate. A focus will be on the major source of uncertainty in current models: the decks of stratocumulus clouds that form off coastlines and populate the trade winds. A shift in their extent by just a few percentage points could turn the global thermostat up or down by a couple of degrees or more within this century—and current models can't predict which way they will go.
Within 5 years, the team hopes its AI-fortified model will drive out that uncertainty and others by learning on its own how clouds behave, from both actual observations and purpose-built cloud simulations. It's a lofty goal, Schneider admitted late one May afternoon in sun-soaked Pasadena, sitting outside with his newly assembled team. They had just wrapped up a workshop, the third he had convened in the past year, bringing together leading climate scientists and engineers to discuss the future of their field. ""We're under no illusions,"" Schneider said. ""This is not going to be a cakewalk.""

There are reasons for skepticism. The United States already has many climate models, and some people question why it needs another, further dividing resources. Others question the technology and wonder whether the philanthropists backing the project have given it the scrutiny that an agency such as the National Science Foundation would provide. The team's unorthodox message and means won't make it easy to win people over, says David Randall, a climatologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. ""I think the existing modeling centers will push back. If Tapio is getting funding, that in principle could have gone to someone else.""
Climate modelers have always followed two imperatives. First, they've folded ever more features of Earth into their simulations. Models once contained only the atmosphere and ocean; now, they have subroutines for ice sheets, land use, and the biosphere. Second, they've sought higher and higher resolutions—modeling interactions on smaller and smaller scales—riding the wave of Moore's law on government-owned supercomputers. By one estimate, the computing power those models use has increased by a factor of 100 million since the 1970s. As the models grew increasingly complex, they more fully reflected the vagaries of our planet—unknown unknowns turned to known unknowns. Yet the uncertainties remained.
At their most basic, all the models work the same way: They take the globe and chop it into a mesh, with cells some 25 kilometers to 50 kilometers on a side, and use a set of code called a dynamical core to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere and ocean over years and centuries. But much of what happens on the planet—cloud formation, for example—arises at scales smaller than those grids. Therefore, those phenomena have to be described indirectly—""parameterized"" in the jargon of climate science—with rule-of-thumb equations. The modelers then adjust those various knobs to best represent the world as they know it—a process called tuning. ""It's a mix of intuition and empiricism and some physically observed laws,"" says Isaac Held, Schneider's mentor and a scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a prominent modeling center in Princeton, New Jersey.Advertisement



Tapio Schneider hopes his planned global climate model will reduce uncertainties over how high and how fast temperatures will rise.

Make no mistake: Current models do an admirable job of re-creating the world. But their shortcomings drive scientists bonkers. They struggle to re-create Arctic temperatures and melting sea ice. Their distribution of rainfall is off, biased against the extreme torrents that can cause flooding. ""The rain is falling in the wrong place and at the wrong rate,"" says Paul O'Gorman, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who formerly worked with Schneider. And, especially important, the models often fail to simulate those thick stratocumulus clouds, which typically form off the coasts of the western Americas and help cool the region.
Schneider, 46, has not always been fixated on clouds. Early in his career at Caltech, he focused on large-scale atmospheric flows, such as the Hadley cell. That atmospheric conveyor belt shifts air from the equator to the subtropics—the type of pattern that climate models can simulate using simple laws of physics. But while on an appointment at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, he became increasingly convinced that climate models could do a better job integrating new data on cloud behavior. He returned to Caltech in 2016 to seek a solution, adding a joint appointment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, where he had become a close collaborator with one of JPL's cloud gurus, João Teixeira.
That was the start of what is now a collaboration of about two dozen people. AI, particularly a variant called machine learning, was on the upswing, and Schneider and Teixeira mused that it might help with the cloud problem. Soon they recruited Andrew Stuart, a soft-spoken computational mathematician at Caltech. The team found additional recruits at JPL, which has a vast archive of satellite data on clouds, and across the country at MIT, where researchers had built an ocean model infused with every possible satellite and buoy measurement of the seas.
The MIT group had ambitions to go bigger, and its members welcomed Schneider's overture. ""Always the idea was to go to an Earth system model,"" says MIT physical oceanographer Raffaele Ferrari. ""But the atmospheric community wasn't particularly primed to think the same way.""
At first, the nascent collaboration was not set on creating a new climate model; the United States already has six prominent models. ""It was more a question of how can we build a better model,"" Schneider says. But they wanted to be certain that a full climate model would incorporate their innovations. They decided the best way would be to build a new model, albeit one starting with existing code. Doing so meant they needed a computation whiz who could take their equations and make them run on a next-generation supercomputer.
A U.S. Navy expert reported for duty. Frank Giraldo, an applied mathematician at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, is behind the Navy's new dynamical core, the mathematical engine at the heart of its next-generation weather and climate models. His core, the Non-hydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere, is designed from the ground up for modern parallel computing. The core is also flexible and self-contained. It can solve equations to various degrees of accuracy in the same model, which should allow the Earth Machine to give a low-resolution overview of the planet while zooming in on clouds in real time.

Learning the climate
A new data-driven climate model will use satellite observations and high-resolution simulations to learn how best to render its clouds. Similar methods will also be applied to other, small-scale phenomena, such as sea ice and ocean eddies.

Crucial input to the new model will come from simulations that have recently painted a much sharper picture of the low clouds and how they behave. Called large eddy simulations (LESs), those models trade the global scale and centuries-long time horizons of a climate model for narrow scope and high resolution. The models re-create several days in the life of small parcels of the atmosphere, with cells only 10 meters on a side. At such resolutions, key aspects of cloud formation—such as the convection that lofts sun-heated air upward until the water vapor it carries condenses into clouds—arise directly from physical laws. The results sometimes closely resemble reality, says Chris Bretherton, a leading cloud scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Several years back, Bretherton led a project that used LESs to study how a 2°C temperature rise affected low ocean clouds. Two feedbacks emerged, both of which would exacerbate warming. First, higher temperatures appeared to allow more dry air to penetrate thin clouds from above, preventing them from thickening and reflecting more of the sun's energy. Second, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels trap heat near the clouds' tops, preventing their cooling. Because such cooling drives the turbulence that forms clouds, the effect could impede cloud formation, fueling further warming. If CO2 emissions continue unabated, Bretherton says, ""It's possible that most of our low clouds in the tropics would melt away.""
Other evidence, including actual cloud observations, also suggests ""that the low-cloud feedback is positive and that low clouds will amplify climate warming,"" says Stephen Klein, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
Those breakthroughs have not yet made their way into global models because no bridge, or technical way to get them there, has emerged. But Schneider's team is building one: an LES that can simulate cloud behavior over days within a domain of up to 100 kilometers on a side—about the size of one cell in a climate model. Their LES is based on a Caltech-developed model called the Python Cloud Large Eddy Simulation (PyCLES) that focuses on low clouds. ""These simulations may not be perfect,"" Schneider says, ""but they're much, much better than anything else we have."" If all goes according to plan, Giraldo's code will run 1000 PyCLES-type models on the fly as individual cells inside the Earth Machine. The machine will also use AI to study the observed and simulated clouds, extrapolating what it learns to improve the rules of thumb it uses to simulate clouds across the globe. Soon, virtual cloud decks will sprout off the California coast.
Incorporating AI into climate modeling is a work in progress. Several researchers, including Bretherton's group and Michael Pritchard, a climate modeler at the University of California, Irvine, trained one form of AI, neural networks, on high-resolution simulations of the atmosphere. They then used the AI to replace several classic rules of thumb, such as how quickly the temperature and humidity change in rising air. ""All of these are in the feeling-around type of phase,"" Bretherton says.

 

But neural networks and climate are an uneasy fit. The algorithms do best on problems such as classification—for example, learning from millions of labeled photos what a dog looks like. The code builds up an intricate model for what an object looks like that is often wholly inexplicable to human reasoning. The approach works for dogs—but may break down when it encounters something outside its training data—say, a camel. And for climate change, the future is a camel. For that reason, Stuart and Schneider are not banking on neural networks to guide the Earth Machine's AI. Instead, they seek a compromise, something between traditional rules of thumb and pure AI. They hope to develop code that can use hard-won knowledge of clouds and then fill in gaps with its learned intuition, essentially replacing the manual tuning typically done by modelers with a machine.
That learning won't be driven by individual cloud systems, which are imprinted with the atmospheric chaos that begat them. Rather, the AI will learn from seasonal or annual statistics on cloud coverage and other factors, wiping out the noise of weather. As Stuart and Schneider move each rule of thumb over to the AI's hands, they'll wire the model to calculate probabilities, allowing an overall reckoning of uncertainty not yet seen in current climate models. And, partly at the prompting of their engineering-minded funders, they'll develop metrics to gauge how accurately the model renders the world. They're betting on recent insights that, for some aspects of the climate system, short-term accuracy in a model indicates decades-long viability.
Success is far from guaranteed, the team agreed after the May workshop. ""It could be that what we do ends up not improving the numbers, just to be completely scientifically honest,"" Stuart said. But even so, he added, the approach should spark new ideas across climate modeling. ""I'd say that's the worst-case scenario,"" Schneider quickly interjected. ""This is why I say we can't fail entirely. But I do hope we will do more than that.""
As Schneider assembled his team and developed a general plan, he still faced a big question: Who would support their dream? That the U.S. government would finance yet another climate model seemed unlikely. Even before President Donald Trump's White House proposed cuts in climate science, former President Barack Obama's administration had explored whether the country needed to support so many models.
Fortunately for the Caltech team, the tech philanthropists—particularly Allen, who has already invested heavily in oceanography—were looking for something to make a splash. They sought a risky investment with a big potential payoff that could make climate forecasting more concrete. Schneider already had preliminary support for the Earth Machine from Charles Trimble, a Caltech alumnus who miniaturized the GPS receiver, and the Heising-Simons Foundation in Los Altos, California. But to reach their full ambitions, they needed more, some $5 million annually—a goal that now seems in sight, though the exact financing was still being finalized at press time.
The mix of ambition, metrics, and innovation embodied in the Earth Machine was exactly the type of work that Allen wants to fund, says Chris Emura, a Seattle, Washington-based computer engineer leading Allen's engagement with Schneider. Over the past year, Allen's team has been enmeshed in the modeling world, visiting leading centers to gauge what they can and can't do. Schneider's project, Emura says, has some audacity to it, with a high degree of ""responsible risk."" The team also has garnered interest from the Windward Fund, a conservation charity in Washington, D.C., that began an effort last month to support work that improves near-term practical climate predictions. And, this week, Schneider's endeavor confirmed backing from Schmidt Futures in New York City, the science-focused philanthropy of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Wendy Schmidt, president of the Schmidt Family Foundation in Palo Alto, California. ""It's an attractive blend of conservative and bold approaches,"" says Stuart Feldman, the philanthropy's chief scientist.


These simulations may not be perfect … but they're much, much better than anything else we have.


Tapio Schneider, California Institute of Technology


As rumors of the Earth Machine have spread, the project has drawn a mix of support, envy, and skepticism. A new approach like that is desperately needed, says Trude Storelvmo, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Oslo. ""This is a very welcome and innovative idea."" She adds that it could bolster the case for expanded observations of clouds—necessary because NASA's current cloud satellites have worked nearly a decade longer than planned.
In contrast, Amy Clement, a cloud scientist at the University of Miami in Florida, laments the focus on building more complex models. ""As a result, in my opinion, we are losing a lot of our ability to gain fundamental understanding of the climate system."" However, she adds, given Schneider's acumen as a climate scientist, the model might lead to such understanding. Bretherton, meanwhile, likes the group's ambitions but questions whether a new model is needed to realize them. ""We already have too many climate models in the United States,"" he says. ""It divides our resources and makes scientific progress slower.""
Other people think the project is discounting rewards that will come when existing models are pushed to run globally at higher resolutions. Much of the climate science community in Europe, for example, is invested in a proposal called Extreme Earth, which would push models to a resolution of 1 kilometer per cell. Although such code would require a network of supercomputers and wouldn't run as long as traditional models, it would also eliminate many parameters that Schneider is seeking to improve with AI, replacing them with physics. ""I'm so frustrated with the idea of parameterizing these things,"" says Bjorn Stevens, a climate scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. ""What I find more exciting is getting rid of those rules of thumb.""
There's also a big assumption baked into the Earth Machine: that the cloud problem can even be solved, adds Joel Norris, a cloud scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. Perhaps any sort of parameterization, even one tuned by AI, cannot crack clouds to a meaningful degree. ""It may be the case you can't reduce the uncertainty,"" Norris says. Some satellite observations essential to rendering clouds, such as the exact location of water vapor in the lower atmosphere, simply don't exist. And Schneider's team could be shocked when it sees how apparently unconnected parts of the model go awry when clouds are tweaked, Held adds. ""There's just a lot of connections.""
Schneider's team is aware of all those concerns and shares many of them. But the members are ambitious and have grown impatient waiting for a breakthrough. They've lived with human-driven climate change, and its dogged uncertainties, as a reality for their entire adult lives. It's time for the clouds to lift.

Since 1999 when the company was launched in founder Jack Ma's apartment, Alibaba's core business remains to sell goods, but its influence and operations have expanded to make it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.

China’s commitment to AI
One of the reasons Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies such as Tencent and Baidu, collectively known as BAT, are making extraordinary gains in artificial intelligence is the support, investment and commitment of the Chinese government to become the dominant AI player in the world. With plans to build a $1 trillion AI industry by 2030, China is on a path to overtake the United States as the world’s leader in technology. Along with an enormous population that generates critical data to inform AI algorithms and help make them better as well as a society who is keen on technological change and not as pushy on regulation, China is fertile ground to develop AI applications, and Alibaba is moving full throttle ahead.
In fact, Alibaba invested in seven research labs that will focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, network security, natural language processing and more.

       Robots to pack: drones to deliver: More than 200 robots in automated warehouses can process 1 million shipments each day. Once the robots received the orders on Singles' Day, they packaged and shipped the goods, and, in some cases, their efficiency allowed same-day shipment. Alibaba also used drones for some deliveries.

These technological advances that helped power Singles’ Day last year resulted in $25 billion in sales, up from $17.8 billion in sales for Single’s Day 2016 and more than the GDP of Iceland and nearly $20 billion more than Cyber Monday in the U.S.
Turning physical shops into ""smart stores.""
In addition to turning some physical shops into “smart stores” for Singles’ Day, Alibaba is introducing “digitalization in a box” under its Tmall brand to smaller retailers. Alibaba has redone about 1 million mom-and-pop shops and 100 superstores McKinsey Global Institute, 42% of global e-commerce transactions took place in China, more than Japan, France, Germany, the UK and the U.S. combined. Many believe that it will only be those retailers who embrace digitization who will survive, and Alibaba is providing the structure to make it possible.
Investment in SenseTime, DAMO Academy, and research
As China’s largest R&D spender, Alibaba is the largest single investor in SenseTime; an AI start-up known for its facial-recognition technology, that launched an AI lab in Hong Kong. The lab hopes to ""advance the frontier of AI"" by supporting other start-ups as they commercialize their AI tech and develop ideas and products. Researchers and other industry participants can also collaborate with start-ups in the lab.
Alibaba plans to spend $15 billion over three years on DAMO (discovery, adventure, momentum, and outlook) Academy
City Brain: AI control for cities
With its City Brain project, Alibaba hopes to help cities run their operations by artificial intelligence. Already improving traffic issues, City Brain uses a cloud-based system where data about a city and everyone in it is stored and processed through AI algorithms. The project’s success in reducing traffic jams by 15% was achieved by monitoring every vehicle in the city. Already successful in Hangzhou, City Brain is going to Malaysia next.
In addition to these examples, Alibaba uses AI to optimize its supply chain, build products and drive personalized recommendations. Ultimately, Alibaba aspires to be the tech giant to provide cloud-based AI which would make AI available to anyone with a computer and internet connection as well as an AI chip available through the cloud.
With all of these applications, it shouldn’t be a surprise that Alibaba’s Cloud Unit recently signed a contract with a Chinese food and ag conglomerate Tequ Group to deploy facial and voice recognition on its pig farms. From traffic to pigs, what will Alibaba use AI and machine learning for next? We can’t wait to find out.

As the world sees it, only the right skills take you places and not just the academic background. Candidates with the most appropriate skills are likely to produce the best outcomes in a particular job function. But only a technology that maps the job skills can help companies avoid the mistake of making a bad hire. After all, the cost of a bad hire is way beyond monetary.Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisitTraditional indicators of job-skills mapping are fundamentally weak. Every year millions of students enter the job market but data available which is indicative of their employability is only piecemeal. A resume is unable to send the right signals about a candidate's skills and competencies. Lack of adequate feedback leaves candidates in a directionless puzzle.At the same time companies continue to struggle through piles of resumes and sifting them sometimes goes beyond human capacity. HR heads especially in industries like retail and customer service, may find it exhausting to go through thousands of resumes that come in. Many times employable candidates get missed from the recruiter's purview due to weak resume signals like tier of college, tier of city among many others.

As the world sees it, only the right skills take you places and not just the academic background. Candidates with the most appropriate skills are likely to produce the best outcomes in a particular job function. But only a technology that maps the job skills can help companies avoid the mistake of making a bad hire. After all, the cost of a bad hire is way beyond monetary.Traditional indicators of job-skills mapping are fundamentally weak. Every year millions of students enter the job market but data available which is indicative of their employability is only piecemeal. A resume is unable to send the right signals about a candidate's skills and competencies. Lack of adequate feedback leaves candidates in a directionless puzzle.At the same time companies continue to struggle through piles of resumes and sifting them sometimes goes beyond human capacity. HR heads especially in industries like retail and customer service, may find it exhausting to go through thousands of resumes that come in. Many times employable candidates get missed from the recruiter's purview due to weak resume signals like tier of college, tier of city among many others.

When he was awarded the Fields Medal—widely regarded as the Nobel Prize for mathematics—in 2010, little did Cedric Villani know that he would embark on a political journey half a decade later.A staunch proponent of European integration, the celebrated mathematician joined French president Emmanuel Macron’s political movement in 2016, adhering to its progressive voice and pledge to champion multilateralism and curb the populist tides that had swept the continent. Against all odds, Villani, who wears velvet cravats and gives Ted Talks about how sexy math is, ran for office on an ‘En Marche’ (Macron’s party) ticket and unseated a long-standing politician.

A staunch proponent of European integration, the celebrated mathematician joined French president Emmanuel Macron’s political movement in 2016, adhering to its progressive voice and pledge to champion multilateralism and curb the populist tides that had swept the continent. Against all odds, Villani, who wears velvet cravats and gives Ted Talks about how sexy math is, ran for office on an ‘En Marche’ (Macron’s party) ticket and unseated a long-standing politician. 

France’s best-known scientist decided to shift to the policy arena to serve decision-makers with the expertise they desperately need and reconcile politics with science, tech and innovation. A few months into his current mandate, he authored a report on French artificial intelligence commissioned by Macron, outlining France’s long-term strategy to become a leader in the field, overhaul digital innovation around AI and make sure labor-market and technological disruptions support inclusivity and diversity. 

Adweek met with Villani to discuss his vision for French AI, his approach to integrating it across Europe and plans to lure foreign players. 

Adweek: It's a rare thing to see scientists get involved in electoral politics. What prompted you?
Cedric Villani: I have always been interested in politics, and I have published countless white papers about a host of policy issues. But indeed, it wasn’t natural to run for office and seek public representation. The previous administration had tried to offer me cabinet positions, but I had declined. This time, I really felt aligned with Macron’s vision for Europe and approach to propel France into the 21st century, finally. 

Also, when I’m looking at the pressing issues facing France, Europe and the planet, I had the feeling that our politicians weren’t up to the task. We needed additional technical expertise. And on the campaign trail, Macron had shown a deep understanding of future environmental, technological and social trends. 

But beyond that, there is this idea that scientists and engineers should be at the service of policy makers to guide their decisions. For example, in the context of my work on AI, I’m now contributing to a new report on hyperloop transport technologies, an area on which many elected officials are poorly informed. Overall, working in politics is fascinating. It’s one of the only fields where you can tackle and have an impact on a series of issues. It’s also a real honor to represent my constituents, their interests and their aspirations.

What’s the main takeaway from your report?
Our priority is research and development. It’s where competition is the fiercest, with Asian countries, notably. We’re also fighting for AI talent, scientists and engineers, which will become tomorrow’s raw commodities. 

France’s AI strategy is now centered around three pillars: experimentation, sharing and sovereignty. And these will underpin policies and investments. To achieve our goals, we’re setting up ethics committees to regulate and monitor AI developments, training programs to build the right workforce around AI and interdisciplinary learning at the university level to breed new talent. It’s an action plan that will be deployed over the next few years. 

Are these investments up to the task ahead?
Our investment plans are between $1 billion and $10 billion, depending on whether you factor in public-private partnerships. At first glance, it’s not much compared to what is being allocated by China or Germany, but there are a few things to consider. Those investments will only target research, development and innovation. These investments will be complemented by further action on education, employment and training, and they will be subject to change as trends in AI evolve. 

What will matter more in the near future is what will be done at the European level to support European champions capable of competing with China and the U.S. But AI is not just a question of investment. It’s a question of political will. And Emmanuel Macron is the first French president who is thoroughly committed to finally breeding a culture of innovation. This strategy will work if we foster synergies between the private sector, policy-makers, higher education institutions and so on. 

How will you measure the success of this program?
We haven’t set tangible KPIs, but we will examine how many jobs we can create, how much job destruction we can avoid through training, how many top tech firms in the field we can elevate on the global stage, how many startups have will have emerged through our support and so on. 

Thanks to this roadmap, how will France’s top tech, media and telecoms firms be involved?
Bringing leading businesses on board is the priority underpinning this roadmap. There is a vast awareness and training challenge ahead of us. We also need to mobilize our research institutes, which will play a key role. Right now, AI research institutes are scattered across the country. That’s where innovation will start. These research institutes will then serve the private and public sector to inform training and policy and bolster national champions. We are remodeling research around the private sector’s AI needs. That’s the revolution. 

France lacks a giant such as Apple or Google. Can this program shape the rise of such a player?
Again, it’s a question of scale. We need European actors using European technology. I don’t know if we can breed giants such as Apple or Google in the near future, but if it ever happens, it will take shape at the European level. We have different economic structures, models and consumption patterns. 

But it is vital to support our won leaders in tech and telecoms such as Orange to equip them with homegrown technology. There is this narrative around the GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) being independent, but they were also supported by public research, public policy and protectionist measures such as the Buy American Act. 

Your report focused on four key sectors: transport and security, health, the environment and defense. Why?
We are emphasizing these sectors in which we have national champions, but also because it is urgent for us to forge the right industrial and tech policies to support them. These are sectors where we need to focus on experimentation because AI is already playing a key role. In trailing industries, we need to invest more. For instance, our financial sector will not complete its AI transition without our help. Of the four sectors you mentioned, the environment is the most interesting. It highlights President Macron’s commitment to curbing climate change, notably by using AI to usher in a new era for sustainable agriculture. 

The FrenchTech label has been gaining resonance worldwide. Are you working closely with that ecosystem?
FrenchTech is a quality label and an extraordinary ecosystem with which we will be working very closely. We have seen the success of French Tech labeled firms in startup and tech fairs around the world. Our role is really to guide and help these French AI and tech firms raise funds and gain international recognition. 

President Macron and his administration have hammered out the message “France is back.” What do you have to say to foreign actors looking at French AI and French innovation?
Yes, we are obsessed with restoring France’s standing in the business and tech communities worldwide. We have a bastion of startups with state of the art technologies and innovation that deserve the attention of foreign investors and risk capital. But they were undermined by previous policies. So we’re gaining momentum. Macron has also signaled to the world that our AI and economic strategies and innovation policies are part of a greater plan for European cooperation. 

AI comes with countless opportunities, but also many threats. How are you trying to address the underlying dangers of AI?
Protecting citizens from the dangers of AI is also a key priority. On the one hand, we need to anticipate employment trends and protect and retrain those who will lose their jobs. On the other hand, we have to address data protection. That’s why we’re establishing Ethics Committees that will be responsible for overseeing and regulating the impact of AI on data privacy. The GDPR is an excellent first step. Finally, we need to develop better expertise on the regulatory side. Regulators are not trained on AI and are ill-equipped to anticipate looming threats, audit algorithms and so on. 

What’s your vision for AI training? How do we retain talent?
My blueprint recommends a three-tiered approach. First, train and support leading talents, engineers and researchers to build an AI elite. For that, we also need more public-private partnerships like those that can be found in the U.S. so that we can have top engineers working on AI innovation in French universities but also supporting startups on tech firms. 

Then, we need to train and develop a technical workforce through apprenticeships, professional degrees and so on. These are the jobs of the future that will assist tomorrow’s most qualified engineers. 

And finally, we need to teach people who don’t have technical backgrounds on how to use AI tools in their professions: lawyers, teachers, PR professionals, consultants, etc. We need European cooperation to retain talent. 

We need a European network for AI to allow students and professionals to train in different countries. We must inspire young talents to develop something fabulous at home. In a sense, we need to breed a form of European solidarity towards AI and a patriotic spirit of innovation and science. 

The Germans, through their research centers, have already carved a path to achieve this objective. Consider leading figures in the field—such as Yann LeCun in France or Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton in Canada—who are icons in deep learning; they decided to support research and innovation at home when the largest multinational firms were trying to hire them. 

Justin Trudeau told me that Bengio aims to stay in Canada to make his country a leader in the field. But for now, these are exceptions. If a French talent wants to develop a homegrown model for autonomous vehicles, we need to provide the resources, databases, public data and support for him to accomplish his goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Q&#038;A: France&#8217;s Top Mathematician-Turned-Politician Discusses Artificial Intelligence', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/frances-top-mathematician-turned-politician-discusses-artificial-intelligence/', 'datePublished': '2018-07-23T13:47:54-04:00', 'articleBody': ""When he was awarded the Fields Medal—widely regarded as the Nobel Prize for mathematics—in 2010, little did Cedric Villani know that he would embark on a political journey half a decade later.\r\n\r\nA staunch proponent of European integration, the celebrated mathematician joined French president Emmanuel Macron’s political movement in 2016, adhering to its progressive voice and pledge to champion multilateralism and curb the populist tides that had swept the continent. Against all odds, Villani, who wears velvet cravats and gives Ted Talks about how sexy math is, ran for office on an ‘En Marche’ (Macron’s party) ticket and unseated a long-standing politician. \r\n\r\nFrance’s best-known scientist decided to shift to the policy arena to serve decision-makers with the expertise they desperately need and reconcile politics with science, tech and innovation. A few months into his current mandate, he authored a report on French artificial intelligence commissioned by Macron, outlining France’s long-term strategy to become a leader in the field, overhaul digital innovation around AI and make sure labor-market and technological disruptions support inclusivity and diversity. \r\n\r\nAdweek met with Villani to discuss his vision for French AI, his approach to integrating it across Europe and plans to lure foreign players. \r\n\r\nAdweek: It's a rare thing to see scientists get involved in electoral politics. What prompted you?\r\nCedric Villani: I have always been interested in politics, and I have published countless white papers about a host of policy issues. But indeed, it wasn’t natural to run for office and seek public representation. The previous administration had tried to offer me cabinet positions, but I had declined. This time, I really felt aligned with Macron’s vision for Europe and approach to propel France into the 21st century, finally. \r\n\r\nAlso, when I’m looking at the pressing issues facing France, Europe and the planet, I had the feeling that our politicians weren’t up to the task. We needed additional technical expertise. And on the campaign trail, Macron had shown a deep understanding of future environmental, technological and social trends. \r\n\r\nBut beyond that, there is this idea that scientists and engineers should be at the service of policy makers to guide their decisions. For example, in the context of my work on AI, I’m now contributing to a new report on hyperloop transport technologies, an area on which many elected officials are poorly informed. Overall, working in politics is fascinating. It’s one of the only fields where you can tackle and have an impact on a series of issues. It’s also a real honor to represent my constituents, their interests and their aspirations.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the main takeaway from your report?\r\nOur priority is research and development. It’s where competition is the fiercest, with Asian countries, notably. We’re also fighting for AI talent, scientists and engineers, which will become tomorrow’s raw commodities. \r\n\r\nFrance’s AI strategy is now centered around three pillars: experimentation, sharing and sovereignty. And these will underpin policies and investments. To achieve our goals, we’re setting up ethics committees to regulate and monitor AI developments, training programs to build the right workforce around AI and interdisciplinary learning at the university level to breed new talent. It’s an action plan that will be deployed over the next few years. \r\n\r\nAre these investments up to the task ahead?\r\nOur investment plans are between $1 billion and $10 billion, depending on whether you factor in public-private partnerships. At first glance, it’s not much compared to what is being allocated by China or Germany, but there are a few things to consider. Those investments will only target research, development and innovation. These investments will be complemented by further action on education, employment and training, and they will be subject to change as trends in AI evolve. \r\n\r\nWhat will matter more in the near future is what will be done at the European level to support European champions capable of competing with China and the U.S. But AI is not just a question of investment. It’s a question of political will. And Emmanuel Macron is the first French president who is thoroughly committed to finally breeding a culture of innovation. This strategy will work if we foster synergies between the private sector, policy-makers, higher education institutions and so on. \r\n\r\nHow will you measure the success of this program?\r\nWe haven’t set tangible KPIs, but we will examine how many jobs we can create, how much job destruction we can avoid through training, how many top tech firms in the field we can elevate on the global stage, how many startups have will have emerged through our support and so on. \r\n\r\nThanks to this roadmap, how will France’s top tech, media and telecoms firms be involved?\r\nBringing leading businesses on board is the priority underpinning this roadmap. There is a vast awareness and training challenge ahead of us. We also need to mobilize our research institutes, which will play a key role. Right now, AI research institutes are scattered across the country. That’s where innovation will start. These research institutes will then serve the private and public sector to inform training and policy and bolster national champions. We are remodeling research around the private sector’s AI needs. That’s the revolution. \r\n\r\nFrance lacks a giant such as Apple or Google. Can this program shape the rise of such a player?\r\nAgain, it’s a question of scale. We need European actors using European technology. I don’t know if we can breed giants such as Apple or Google in the near future, but if it ever happens, it will take shape at the European level. We have different economic structures, models and consumption patterns. \r\n\r\nBut it is vital to support our won leaders in tech and telecoms such as Orange to equip them with homegrown technology. There is this narrative around the GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) being independent, but they were also supported by public research, public policy and protectionist measures such as the Buy American Act. \r\n\r\nYour report focused on four key sectors: transport and security, health, the environment and defense. Why?\r\nWe are emphasizing these sectors in which we have national champions, but also because it is urgent for us to forge the right industrial and tech policies to support them. These are sectors where we need to focus on experimentation because AI is already playing a key role. In trailing industries, we need to invest more. For instance, our financial sector will not complete its AI transition without our help. Of the four sectors you mentioned, the environment is the most interesting. It highlights President Macron’s commitment to curbing climate change, notably by using AI to usher in a new era for sustainable agriculture. \r\n\r\nThe FrenchTech label has been gaining resonance worldwide. Are you working closely with that ecosystem?\r\nFrenchTech is a quality label and an extraordinary ecosystem with which we will be working very closely. We have seen the success of French Tech labeled firms in startup and tech fairs around the world. Our role is really to guide and help these French AI and tech firms raise funds and gain international recognition. \r\n\r\nPresident Macron and his administration have hammered out the message “France is back.” What do you have to say to foreign actors looking at French AI and French innovation?\r\nYes, we are obsessed with restoring France’s standing in the business and tech communities worldwide. We have a bastion of startups with state of the art technologies and innovation that deserve the attention of foreign investors and risk capital. But they were undermined by previous policies. So we’re gaining momentum. Macron has also signaled to the world that our AI and economic strategies and innovation policies are part of a greater plan for European cooperation. \r\n\r\nAI comes with countless opportunities, but also many threats. How are you trying to address the underlying dangers of AI?\r\nProtecting citizens from the dangers of AI is also a key priority. On the one hand, we need to anticipate employment trends and protect and retrain those who will lose their jobs. On the other hand, we have to address data protection. That’s why we’re establishing Ethics Committees that will be responsible for overseeing and regulating the impact of AI on data privacy. The GDPR is an excellent first step. Finally, we need to develop better expertise on the regulatory side. Regulators are not trained on AI and are ill-equipped to anticipate looming threats, audit algorithms and so on. \r\n\r\nWhat’s your vision for AI training? How do we retain talent?\r\nMy blueprint recommends a three-tiered approach. First, train and support leading talents, engineers and researchers to build an AI elite. For that, we also need more public-private partnerships like those that can be found in the U.S. so that we can have top engineers working on AI innovation in French universities but also supporting startups on tech firms. \r\n\r\nThen, we need to train and develop a technical workforce through apprenticeships, professional degrees and so on.

Artificial intelligence is moving from buzzword to functional reality in the hotel industry. The technology is making inroads in a variety of ways, from  personalizing experiences and optimizing rate and occupancy to reputation management, and now InterContinental Hotels Group has created smart rooms fueled by artificial intelligence.The company has teamed up with Baidu on the rooms, which go beyond offering voice assistants that require specific instructions. Guests can do things like tell their room they are “going to sleep,” and the room will recognize the phrase and know what to do with the information, such closing the curtains and turning off the lights. A total of 100 AI powered Club InterContinental suites will be available at InterContinental hotels in gateway cities and key destinations across China within the year.Customized for InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, the AI solution is developed by Baidu’s DuerOS Platform. It integrates AI technology with hotel operations, and this is supported by hardware upgrade and cloud service. The AI smart room will use voice-control technology to deliver a more natural human-computer interactive experience. For instance, guests will be able to freely switch settings between work and leisure modes, and enjoy a more convenient and seamless roomservice experience. This solution will also further fine-tune the current backstage-management system, including customizing information and resetting devices, making hotel management a simpler task.“Millennials are particularly sensitive to technology, often seeking new things to try,” Lin Wang, VP of marketing, IHG Greater China, said in a statement.  “The AI Smart Room will undoubtedly be extremely attractive for them, paving the way for a new level of modernization and consumer satisfaction. We will continue to make use of cutting-edge technology in hotel service and facilities in the future, and we hope this will further strengthen customer awareness and appreciation of smart technology. Meanwhile, we will provide more efficient operation and management services to our hotel owners.”IHG and Baidu inked a strategic partnership on AI development last November. The application of AI has gone beyond smart homes and automatic driving, and now marks a new milestone in the hospitality industry. IHG and Baidu will continue the exploration and innovation in intelligent hospitality solutions, creating more smart options and experiences for guests.InterContinental isn’t the only brand rushing to embrace technology in the hopes of wowing business travelers and wooing millennials. Marriott International is piloting a new facial recognition check-in program in China, and IBM Watson Advertising and Best Western have teamed up to create a new interactive ad powered by artificial intelligence. The ad personalizes vacation planning by providing consumers with travel tips and tricks, recommendations for local accommodations, and special offers based on their travel preferences.In addition, Japanese hotelier Fujita Kanko is implementing a multilingual chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to handle guest inquiries on the websites for some of its Japanese-based properties. Website visitors can use the chatbot in Japanese, English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese or Korean to receive 24/7 assistance.

Yet universities are not adequately preparing students for a changing world. To better prepare students for a changing world, AI needs to be increasingly embedded into higher education.

For students, AI will inevitably impact their careers. Those interested in careers in AI could pursue a wide range of exciting new career possibilities focused on data science, machine learning or advanced statistics. And, even students not focused on AI would benefit from a sound education in artificial intelligence and familiarity with working with machines.
The AI era will inevitably create new job types, ranging from machine regulators to emotion engineers. To succeed, all students will need to understand, at least at a high level, how machines perform. In addition, they should better equip themselves to do what machines cannot do.
PROMOTED
Moreover, traditional roles such as business analyst, sales, human resources and others will be augmented by AI, requiring a new degree of proficiency for front-line staff to interact with machines. Executives and managers will need to work with machines in strategic decision-making and problem-solving roles.

McKinsey predicts that AI will replace up to 800 million jobs by 2030. That’s a drastic reshaping of the workforce — and one that universities can and should help students prepare for. While some schools have world-class AI and technology programs, others have ample room for improvement.
Based on my observations as a Stanford University graduate now working for an AI company, Aera Technology, I’d like to share ideas on how universities can improve student readiness through curriculum requirements, projects with corporations and mentorship programs.

Curriculum Requirements
While it’s impossible for universities to keep up with the rate of change in the technology industry, I recommend that universities re-evaluate their core curriculums to ensure that students are prepared for the new age of employment that is approaching. I strongly advise all universities to incorporate computer science, entrepreneurship and social impact classes into curriculums.
By taking computer science classes, students will be able to understand the back-end systems that drive machines. At a minimum, a high-level understanding of machines is necessary to operate in an augmented workforce.

Entrepreneurship is another focus area, as continuous innovation has become the standard across industries. Entrepreneurship no longer solely drives startups, but it also drives large companies. For students to become leaders in the workplace, they should understand the principles of entrepreneurship and how they can innovate in any environment.
And social impact is more important than ever before. If you are going to build, sell or use AI, IoT or other technologies, you have to be able to understand what impact the technology will have on society. Inherently, by working in the world of technology, you are driving change. Technologists have a societal obligation to drive positive change as much as possible.
Projects with Corporations
One thing I am surprised I do not see at more universities are classes driven by projects with corporations. All students should have the opportunity to take classes that enable them to see how their academic curriculum is setting them up for their careers in the new machine-driven world.
With a complete reshaping of the workforce, getting out of the classroom is necessary for students to understand the emerging job opportunities. An increase in university-corporate projects would provide students with the experience required to determine which careers to pursue. These projects would help companies gain new perspectives and reflect positively on universities.
Mentorship Programs
In college, it is important for students to receive guidance from mentors. With the vast amount of opportunities available, students can become overwhelmed. Through the effective matching of mentors, they can gain insights into how to set up their careers, utilize technology and select the best employer.
Additionally, mentors can offer support throughout the ups and downs of choosing a career path in the new AI world. These programs should be fairly easy to set up since many university alumni want to give back to current students.
Of course, it also falls on students to conduct due diligence on which institutions are geared up to help undergraduates excel in a tech-driven future. Universities that embed AI learning and experience into the academic environment will benefit with positive reviews and successful alumni as AI transforms the job market.Stephanie GlassFollowingFollowI am the Director of Product Marketing at Clari.
