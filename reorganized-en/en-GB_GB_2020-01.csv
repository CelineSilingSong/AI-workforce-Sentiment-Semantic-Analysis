AI’s major headwind is the cost of the investment, which will skew returns in the short-term. When the turnaround occurs, however, companies who are making the investment can expect to be rewarded disproportionately with a wide performance gap. In a recent report, McKinsey predicts AI leaders will see up to double the cash flow.

We can see some evidence of this in Alphabet’s revenue segment, Other Bets, which includes many AI projects with a loss of $3.35 billion in 2018. Of this, Deep Mind is responsible for $571 million in losses and owes its parent company $1.4 billion. The autonomous driving project, Waymo, had its valuation cut by 40% due to delays last September.


We see other companies taking on massive and expensive AI projects, such as Baidu, Facebook, Tesla, Alibaba, Microsoft and Amazon. Except for Tesla, these companies are flush with cash and can afford the transition costs and capital expenditures required for artificial intelligence.

Despite tech giants pouring cash into AI investments, most of the industries that stand to benefit are not in the tech industry, per se. This week, I attended Re-Work’s Deep Learning and AI Summit, where AI engineers and executives gathered for presentations and discussions about the projects they’re spearheading.

Here are a few ways that AI is slated to make an impact sooner rather than later:

2. Reducing Call Center Burden
United Health received 36 million calls in 2017 with 7.6 million calls transferred to a representative. The AI platform solution involves deep learning for a pre-check portal and claim queue, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to translate audio to text, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for unsupervised clustering, to generate new call variables and automate transfer calls.

3. Retail Giants making Big AI Investments
Retail had a large presence at the conference with Wal-Mart Labs, Proctor and Gamble and Target presenting on ways they plan to make the retail experience more optimized. Perhaps these companies are being more careful to embrace technology and AI after the last decade ushered in many competitors who stole critical turf (i.e. Amazon).
Imagine a shopping experience where the carts are plentiful, cashiers are always open, and inventory is fully stocked. Rather than focus on replacing cashiers, Wal-Mart is more focused on inventory control. This is a different approach than competitor Amazon Go, designed to be cashier-less.
4. AI Could Be the Answer to Restoring Privacy
Privacy has been in the headlines lately as regulators and social media users begin to question what is a fair exchange for a free service. While the battle is nearing two years since Cambridge Analytica, other companies are creating AI recommendation engines so powerful that little information is needed about the person making the choice; their preference is enough to determine what to recommend next.
Netflix is a leader here with its recommendation engine for content. Pinterest also employs a complex recommendation engine to surface the best image for an individual out of the billions of images on Pinterest’s platform. This is done through the process of query understanding to candidate generation to ranking to blending to the final result. In layman’s terms, this is how a discovery engine narrows down choices from billions to hundreds.
5. Prepare to Be Blown Away by AI-Assistants
Over the next few years, we will become hands-free and will have better posture and fewer car accidents. Once AI-assistants are fully built out, our interaction with mobile devices may become the brunt of criticism from future generations. Many companies are working to own this space as the ecosystem lock-in and data produced by AI-assistants will be incredibly valuable – expect a full-fledged battle between Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple in this space.

Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.The British startup Exscientia claims it has developed the first medication created using artificial intelligence that will be clinically tested on humans. The medication, which is meant to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, took less than a year from conception to trial-ready capsule. Human trials are set to begin in March, but would you take a drug designed using artificially intelligent software?The appeal of AI-designed drugs is relatively straightforward. There are lots and lots of possible molecules that might be useful in medications, far too many for all the medical researchers in the world to manually test. But by using different types of AI, a computer system can come up with and mine through different molecules, comparing them against different parameters and learning the most promising compounds faster than a human could. Artificial intelligence is certainly powerful, but some are skeptical that the technology is reliable or trustworthy, and question what role it should play in areas like our health care. And in drug research, some have voiced concerns that the technology might be overhyped, and that AI’s findings may not be as groundbreaking as we’d like to believe.Exscientia’s CEO, Andrew Hopkins, has argued that AI means synthesizing fewer compounds for testing and running fewer experiments in the search for a new medication. “Active Learning [a subcategory of a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning] algorithms automatically prioritise the most informative compounds for experimental synthesis and testing and enable the system to learn faster than humans alone,” Hopkins told Recode in an email. Of course, AI could be used for more than just trying to come up with new compounds. The technology could also mine through scientific research and patient data and help inspire the repurposing of old drugs, among a wide variety of other applications. And the uses can be even broader than just medication: Researchers have used AI to track the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, and the technology is also being deployed to tackle the American opioid crisis.Hopkins went on to explain that his company’s platform is the first to have produced a drug with artificial intelligence that will be tested in a clinical trial. He says the compound that was ultimately produced — called DSP-1181— is expected to last longer and have a stronger efficacy than other existing medications for OCD. Japanese pharmaceutical company Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, which owns the rights to the drug, will oversee its clinical development. The first phase of human trials, which will test the medication’s safety and the body’s response to it, will also take place in Japan. As remarkable as the new drug’s development seems, there’s still room for some healthy skepticism. Artificial intelligence can help us find new molecules, but there’s a chance that the molecules found by AI will ultimately resemble molecules we’ve already studied. That’s the caution of chemist Derek Lowe, a researcher at Novartis who works on drug discovery. On his pharmaceutical industry blog, Lowe explains how simply finding a potential compound doesn’t guarantee that scientists actually understand the biochemical nature of the illness they’re trying to treat — or that the drug will even work. “The problem is that preclinical drug optimization is not the problem,” he wrote of Exscientia’s announcement. “This project, at best, seems to me to have saved a few months off the process of sending their compound into the same black-box shredder as every such drug project goes into when it hits human trials.”Meanwhile, the development of AI-assisted pharmaceuticals raises questions about how comfortable people should be with these new research methods. In the long run, how will AI-designed drugs differ from those developed by humans alone? Who should make the rules for the use of AI in drug research?Like all applications of artificial intelligence, health authorities are trying to figure out how best to study and regulate these tools. While the Food and Drug Administration wouldn’t comment on this particular new drug, FDA spokesperson Jeremy Kahn told Recode that the agency is committed to maintaining public health standards — while also protecting innovation — and that its drug evaluation and research center is assessing the regulatory considerations that AI tools might raise.“The full role of AI in drug development is still being elucidated, and stakeholders understand AI in different ways considering the spectrum of tools and techniques covered under this umbrella term,” Kahn told Recode in an email. “Importantly, the evidentiary standards needed to support drug approvals remain the same regardless of the technological advances involved.”Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Exscientia said the drug had to meet the same requirements as any other drug undergoing a phase I trial in Japan.It’s essential to remember that Exscientia and other pharmaceutical companies stand to make a lot of cash if AI-based drug development actually works. The number of investments major biotech investments are dropping on the technology suggests as much.Large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly throwing money behind artificial intelligence, and Exscientia, whose investors include the German drug company Evotec and Bristol-Myers Squibb, is working with several drug giants on new drugs, including Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline.So you might not have the opportunity to try a drug designed by artificial intelligence in the next few months — unless you’re one of the select humans that will try this new drug in Japan. Still, this recent development brings us closer than ever to a future where AI designs new drugs. Will they actually aid our ailments any better than good old-fashioned human-made drugs?

Why are we so scared of Artificial Intelligence development?

January 30, 2020 



 




© Kittipong  Jirasukhanont 
Nikolas Kairinos, CEO and Founder, Fountech.ai discusses the ethical and safety issues of Artificial Intelligence development if it is to be misused by society
The proliferation of technology throughout society has been rapid. As with any kind of societal shift, it has led to the excitement for the future and concern around new risks; particularly when it comes to job security. Indeed, academic institutions such as the University of Oxford suggesting that 47% of the current job market will be made obsolete due to rapid advancements in tech over the next 25 years have done nothing to calm public nerves.
Such staggering numbers are inevitably eye-catching, but not always helpful. Indeed, they tend to result in black hole baseless panic. As German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested, it is within human nature to “project things to infinity”, regardless of the evidence.
Humans will always be needed
Thankfully, a growing body of evidence indicates the future relationship between tech and humanity will be prosperous and peaceful. That’s partly because humans have some innate qualities that will be difficult for machines to ever replicate, meaning we will always be needed for the proper operation of society.
This view is supported by the experts; the World Economic Forum has predicted that whilst 75 million jobs could be lost to tech between 2020 and 2025, a further 133 million new roles will be created. These will be in the maintenance, management and oversight of the tech jobs, many of which are yet to be created
Pedros Domingos, a professor at the University of Washington and expert on the future relations between man and machine, suggests that AI will lead to the creation of roles that we cannot yet understand. After all, if you asked a person in the 1980s to describe the role of an app developer, they’d be uncertain. Indeed, this is the case for those of us today trying to imagine the world of work in 2030 or 2050 — there are too many variables for us to make an effective prediction. One thing is sure: there’ll be new jobs for people to fill.
Complimentary skillsets
However, the new jobs created won’t just be about creating and maintaining the new technology – this will partially make up the job creation, of course, although newly carved human roles in the future workforce will involve working with machines.
This refers to how AI will be able to augment and complement, rather than replace, what humans are already able to do. A fantastic example comes from Prospex. This tech, developed by Fountech Ventures, is an AI program that can generate leads for salespeople. So, rather than spending hours manually trawling through databases to find business leads, the technology rapidly compiles lists of people to contact. As such, salespeople can focus on their passion, amplify their skills and delegate all of the drudgery to a machine.
Another example arrives from Autodesk, who have developed an AI program called ‘Dreamcatcher’. It too has a simple proposition: generating new designs based on assigned parameters. So, if you were designing a new table, you’d input code for ‘legs’, ‘tabletop’, etc., and it then generates a multitude of options based on the designer’s preferences. The latter is then able to choose or amend a design as needed. So, we see human creativity flourish, thanks to collaboration with AI technology.
More enjoyable tasks
The future collaboration between man and machine will also be characterised by a more obvious aspect: the automation of repetitive tasks. For the millions of people worldwide who still work in factories, this might be a worrying prospect. However, the reality is more complex and, indeed, positive.
In fact, it will likely entail more fulfilling roles and the example of chatbots illustrates this point clearly. They are able to access vast amounts of data and are usually positioned at the beginning of the customer contact experience. Here, they answer questions and direct customers to call centres, where a specialised, human response can be given if needed. For the customer, it means a more efficient service. And for workers, it means dealing with more interesting issues — rather than asking ‘what is your customer reference?’ all day — certainly a ‘win-win’.
John E. Kelly III, executive vice president at IBM asserted that, collaboratively, humans and machines “working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently” – and I agree. As long as experts treat this new technology with care, there will be no limit to what man and machine can collectively achieve.

AI is coming for managers' jobs says Gartner







Companies will need to completely overhaul long-held ideas about managers’ roles as a new analysis suggests the rate of Artificial Intelligence driven job losses is accelerating.
Gartner research released last week predicts artificial intelligence algorithms could take over 69 percent of the routine work currently done by managers.
Concerns about ever-better AI obviating the need for workers are nothing new, but early analyses suggested knowledge workers would be safer than process workers because AI lacks the human intuition required for effective decision-making.
Yet the degree of anticipated job replacement has increased over time as technology improves. In 2017 a McKinsey & Company analysis, for example, predicted half of current work activities could be automated by 2055.
Up to a third of the workforce would need to retrain for other jobs – although Australian workers were safer than those in many other countries, with 45 percent of Australian jobs up for grabs but positions in sectors like retail, hospitality, manufacturing, educational services, and mining flagged as having below-average automation potential.
Jobs on the line
Last year, one AI expert predicted new decision-making technologies would potentially eliminate 40 percent of jobs within 15 years – with Western Australian innovator Fastbrick Robotics a classic example by developing a robot that can lay 1000 bricks per hour.
Yet Gartner’s latest analysis moves up the timeline significantly, sounding a death knell for people in slow-changing jobs that require a low degree of ‘social-creative skills’ – think white-collar roles like computer programmers, accountants and lawyers.
One site measuring the risk of automation suggests 94 percent of accountant and auditor jobs, 56 percent of teacher assistants, 48 percent of computer programmers and 25 percent of managers were at risk from automation.
Jobs requiring more social-creative skills, such as marketing managers, sales representatives, and customer service representatives, needed to be trained to have more “digital dexterity”, Gartner said, because “chances are high that new technologies to support work will be introduced”.
You will be assimilated
Whatever the numbers, the consensus AI is coming for your job has created an uncomfortable reality: Many workers assume technological displacement is inevitable, but those same workers assume the displacement will happen to people in other jobs.
Public dread about AI had led many managers to become “wary” of introducing AI because of widespread concerns about job losses, Gartner noted, but restraint would become increasingly difficult as cost-savings calculations tipped in favour of automation’s “significant” benefits.
Companies could save an average $7m ($US5m) per 1000 employees or 100 managers, Gartner predicted, as activities such as administrative tasks, project management, team management, and development of direct reports are replaced by technologies like expense management, automated project status dashboards, algorithmic management platforms, and real-time chatbot interventions, respectively.
“The role of manager will see a complete overhaul in the next four years,” Gartner research Vice President Helen Poitevin said.
“Currently, managers often need to spend time filling in forms, updating information and approving workflows. By using AI to automate these tasks, they can spend less time managing transactions and can invest more time on learning, performance management and goal setting.”
Companies would need to embrace a number of ‘necessary’ technology advances including increased use of automated decision management, embedded analytics, AI-driven internal talent marketplaces, and transformation of application logic in manager-centric human capital management systems.
Machine learning would replace anomaly detection in work schedules, time and attendance, expenses, and “other processes where managers have been given oversight tasks”.
Look on the bright side
Managers will likely face the axe as automation makes many of their functions redundant, but those that remain will also need to drive change in organisational learning for another quite specific reason.
As increasing automation kills off many jobs and reduces the number of task-based activities that managers perform, Gartner warned, on-the-job learning opportunities would be cut by two-thirds.
This would mean that workers would no longer be able to learn by watching and doing, forcing companies to overhaul long-established mentorship and training structures based around the idea of on-the-job training.
By 2025, automation would have driven so much organisational change that 47 percent of learning and staff development budgets would simply be wasted, Gartner predicts – with learned skills relevant for increasingly short periods and digital dexterity a crucial measure of organisational adaptability.
Yet skills are not perfectly transferrable and companies must think big when it comes to retraining: If workers can’t reskill to crabwalk into AI-protected jobs, they may end up unemployed despite organisational efforts.
Revolutionising the workforce
Despite the potential disruption it will cause, Gartner believes AI will also revolutionise the workforce by empowering disenfranchised workers such as people with disabilities – where a 69 percent US unemployment rate continues to constrain the pool of potential skilled workers.
AI will reduce barriers to access for this workforce, the analysis concluded, predicting that AI would help triple the number of people with disabilities employed by 2023.
This would have flow-on effects for the companies, with organisations actively employing people with disabilities said to have 89 percent higher retention rates, 72 percent higher employee productivity and 29 percent higher profitability – generating goodwill that “should provide some reputational protection” for companies suffering “adverse actions, such as layoffs”.
Whether that goodwill can save the modern workforce remains to be seen – but AI’s push into the knowledge economy will nonetheless continue unchecked.

What is a Chatbot?You've likely talked to a robot already without even knowing it. And you might have even heard the term ""chatbot"" in the news. But what is a chatbot? How do chatbots work?








                                  A chatbot is just a robot chat that imitates human conversations through voice commands, text chats, or both.

Essentially, a chatbot is just a robot chat that imitates human conversations through voice commands, text chats, or both. It's a virtual conversation in which one party is an online talking robot.The artificial intelligence feature within talking robots has been used in various industries to deliver information or perform tasks, such as telling the weather, making flight reservations, or purchasing products.Chatbot TechnologyInside the artificial intelligence of a chatbot is machine learning and what's known as natural-language processing (NLP). Machine learning can be applied in different fields to create various chatbot algorithms, while NLP has the ability to pick up conversational cadences and mimic human conversation.








                                  Inside the artificial intelligence of a chatbot is machine learning and what's known as natural-language processing.

The chatbot is trained to translate the input data into a desired output value. When given this data, it analyzes and forms context to point to the relevant data to react to spoken or written prompts. Looking into deep learning within AI, the machine discovers new patterns in the data without any prior information or training, then extracts and stores the pattern.This machine learning algorithm, known as neural networks, consists of different layers for analyzing and learning data. Inspired by the human brain, each layer is consists of its own artificial neurons that are interconnected and responsive to one another. Each connection is weighted by previous learning patterns or events and with each input of data, more ""learning"" takes place.How Chatbots Got SmarterWith the advancements in artificial intelligence and the rapid growth of messaging apps, chatbots are becoming increasingly necessary in many industries. Although bot technology has been around for decades, machine-learning has been improving dramatically due to the heightened interest from key Silicon Valley powers.

Natural language processing mimics human speech patterns to simulate a human tone in computer-human interaction, which creates more intimate interactions. The predictive analytics within bots uses statistics, modeling, data mining and more to generate information proactively, rather than in response to a prompt.The sentiment analysis in machine learning uses language analytics to determine the attitude or emotional state of whom they are speaking to in any given situation. This has proven to be difficult for even the most advanced chatbot due to an inability to detect certain questions and comments from context. Developers are creating these bots to automate a wider range of processes in an increasingly human-like way and to continue to develop and learn over time.An indicator of just how human-like these machines can be was actually developed in the 1950s by British scientist Alan Turing. His Turing Test checks the presence of mind, thought, or intelligence in a machine and if it can fool a human to believe that it is a human as well, then it passes the test.There was a time when even some of the most prominent minds believed that a machine could not be as intelligent as humans but in 1991, the start of the Loebner Prize competitions began to prove otherwise. The competition awards the best performing chatbot that convinces the judges that it is some form of intelligence. But despite the tremendous development of chatbots and their ability to execute intelligent behavior not displayed by humans, chatbots still do not have the accuracy to understand the context of questions in every situation each time.Chatbots Uses of Today and Tomorrow

Walton doesn’t blame the cuts on a computer; he blames them on the company’s top executives, whose “coldblooded, calculated move” cost people their jobs.It “ripped my [expletive] heart out,” Walton said. “The people at the top don’t know who we are at the bottom. They don’t understand the relationships and the connections we had with the communities. And that’s the worst part: They don’t care.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe dominant player in U.S. radio, which owns the online music service iHeartRadio and more than 850 local stations across the United States, has called AI the muscle it needs to fend off rivals, recapture listeners and emerge from bankruptcy.

They excel at some tasks but still depend heavily on people for training, refinement and repair. Some critics say executives end up using the systems as scapegoats, hoping to distract from old-school failures, portray themselves as futuristic and avoid public outrage.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.U.S., Germany foiled Russian plot to assassinate CEO of arms manufacturer, officials saySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Family of teen who died after ‘One Chip Challenge’ sues snack companySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.La Niña is coming.

Here’s what renters should know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Industry analysts and observers said iHeartMedia had begun highlighting its AI bets in hopes of persuading investors it had the technological wherewithal to survive a new musical age in which digital streaming services compete against over-the-air radio for advertising dollars and listeners’ time.Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said iHeartMedia’s leadership — including Pittman, who she said could “sell ice to an Eskimo” — had successfully built the company’s stature in the face of heavy debts. While the job cuts may sound “inhumane,” she added, they made sense from a Wall Street perspective, given the company’s need to trim costs and improve its profit margins.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s definitely room for efficiency,” she said. “There’s no reason AI couldn’t help.”But shrinking the workforce, said Jerry Del Colliano, a music-business professor at New York University who publishes the industry newsletter Inside Music Media, looked less like a necessary shift to ultramodern tech and more a response to iHeartMedia’s past struggles and future risks: what Goldman Sachs analysts in October called the “rising competitive intensity” and “cannibalization” of audio rivals on the Web.Perspective: Blame the policies, not the robots“This is a typical example of a dying industry that is blaming technology for something that is just absolutely a reduction in force,” Del Colliano said. “It’s a bum rap for AI. It’s an excuse. We’ve got to get out of the habit of looking at AI or any other technology as simply a way to fire people.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementiHeartRadio spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg declined to make executives available for comment or provide a total layoff count, saying only that the job cuts were “relatively small” compared with the company’s overall workforce of 12,500 employees.But half a dozen DJs who spoke with The Washington Post said the cuts were tantamount to a “bloodbath.” Informal lists compiled by industry news sites such as RadioInsight provide the names of hundreds of talk show hosts, news anchors, producers, program directors, reporters and drive-time DJs let go from local stations across the country. Del Colliano estimated that more than 1,000 people would lose their jobs nationwide.The cuts, Goldberg said, showed how iHeartMedia was shifting “jobs to the future from the past,” adding data scientists, podcast producers and other digital teams to help transform the radio broadcaster into a “multiplatform” creator and “America’s #1 audio company.”“We do not intend to be one of those companies that stayed in the past, and the world passed it by,” Goldberg said in a statement. “Change is painful and change is hard — but consciously choosing not to change is not an option for a company that is going to continue to grow and compete.”Broadcast radio has been bulldozed by online upstarts such as Pandora, Spotify and YouTube, but the long-running medium remains a huge business. In November, iHeartMedia reported it took in more than $1.6 billion in broadcast-radio revenue during the first nine months of 2019, and company filings claim that a quarter of a billion listeners still tune in every month to discover new music, catch up on the news or hear from their local DJs.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementExecutives at the Texas-based company have long touted human DJs as their biggest competitive strength, saying in federal securities filings last year that the company was in the “companionship” business because listeners build a “trusted bond and strong relationship” with the on-air personalities they hear every day.“Consumers listen to the radio because the voice on the other side sounds like a friend,” the filing said.But the company has also tried to combat its online rivals, many of which recommend songs based on a user’s listening history, by hyping up its newfound technological power. In 2018, some stations on the online iHeartRadio service began testing a music-mixing AI system built by the start-up Super Hi-Fi, which says it can “understand music nuances with the same depth as a human DJ.”A face-scanning algorithm increasingly decides whether you deserve the jobThe system can transition in real time between songs by layering in music, sound effects, voice-over snippets and ads, delivering the style of smooth, seamless playback that has long been the human DJ’s trade. The Los Angeles-based Super Hi-Fi, whose clients also include the streaming fitness service Peloton, says its “computational music presentation” AI can help erase the seconds-long gaps between songs that can lead to “a loss of energy, lack of continuity and disquieting sterility.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSuper Hi-Fi patents filed last year reduce the art of mixing music to a diagram of algorithmic tasks: The “MagicStitch” system, as Super Hi-Fi calls it, assesses songs’ “rhythmic profile, chordal, melodic content, harmonic and amplitude over time”; calculates ways to blend them “in concordance with the salient temporal moments”; then interjects other elements to create a “more engaging overall consumption experience.”The system is trained to process different stylistic touches — “a ‘wild and crazy’ classical piece will differ greatly from a ‘wild and crazy’ punk rock anthem,” one patent states — as well as their energy level and mood, from “bouncing off the walls” to “dirge.” Sentiment is also catalogued, the company said, “so as not to put a super-positive announcer over a super-negative piece of content,” like a grim piece of breaking news.In a demonstration for a Post reporter, Super Hi-Fi co-founder Zack Zalon showed the system transitioning from Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” to Kanye West’s “Stronger”: One song wove cleanly into the other through an automated mix of booming sound effects, background music, interview sound bites and station-branding shout-outs (“Super Hi-Fi: Recommended by God”). The smooth transition might have taken a DJ a few minutes to prepare; the computer completed it in a matter of seconds. (“3,526 Calculations Performed,” the system declared afterward.)The Technology 202: Workers in heartland states most at risk of losing jobs to AI, new study findsMuch of the initial training for these delicate transitions comes from humans, who prerecord voice-overs, select songs, edit audio clips, and classify music by genre, style and mood. Zalon said the machine-learning system has been further refined by iHeartMedia’s human DJs, who have helped identify clumsy transitions and room for future improvements.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“To have radio DJs across the country that really care about song transitions and are listening to find everything wrong, that was awesome,” Zalon said. “It gave us hundreds of the world’s best ears. … They almost unwittingly became kind of like our QA [quality assurance] team.” (It was unclear whether any of those DJs were among the recent layoffs.)The system won’t trigger massive job cuts and could lead to new opportunities, Zalon argues, because humans will still need to create and ready the audio snippets from which the AI can select. But he expects that, in a few years, computer-generated voices could automatically read off the news, tee up interviews and introduce songs, potentially supplanting humans even more. The software performed 315 million musical transitions for listeners in January alone.The system now is used only for iHeartMedia’s digital stations, but some industry observers expect in the future that software like it could reshape local over-the-air broadcasts, too. The company’s chief product officer, Chris Williams, said last year in an interview with the industry news site RadioWorld that “virtual DJs” that could seamlessly interweave chatter, music and ads were “absolutely” coming, and “something we are always thinking about.”An artificial-intelligence first: Voice-mimicking software reportedly used in a major theftGoldberg, the iHeartMedia communications chief, said the company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop high-tech systems to “substantially improve the scientific part of how we program,” processing thousands of data points related to optimized music selection and scheduling “far in excess of the capabilities of any human being to digest and use.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat has allowed the company, she said, to free up programming people for more creative pursuits, “embedding our radio stations into the communities and lives of our listeners better and deeper than they have been before.”There’s no clear indication that AI schedulers or computerized DJs would solve a long-running financial challenge of the company’s own making. In 2008, to gain control of the radio and billboard titan then known as Clear Channel, the private-equity firms Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners staged a leveraged buyout, weighing the company down with a mountain of borrowed cash they needed to seal the deal.The audacious move left the radio giant saddled with more than $20 billion in debt, just as the Great Recession kicked off and radio’s strengths began to rust. The debt would kneecap the company for the next decade, forcing it to pay more toward interest payments some years than it earned in revenue.In 2018, iHeartMedia filed for bankruptcy, saying in a statement then that it would “uphold its commitments” to its thousands of employees. “We’re here to right-size the balance sheet,” a company lawyer told a bankruptcy judge that year in Texas, where the giant had grown from a single San Antonio country music station in 1972.Dating apps need women. Advertisers need diversity. AI companies offer a solution: Fake peopleIn the year the company filed for bankruptcy, Pittman, the company’s chief and a former head of MTV and AOL, was paid roughly $13 million in salary and bonus pay, nearly three times what he made in 2016, company financial records show. In late 2018, the company also asked a bankruptcy judge for approval to boost its bonus packages for top executives even further, to more than $33 million, above the $22 million they had previously planned.The company defended the request in a court filing by saying, “Maintaining a highly motivated workforce is as important as ever.” The full bankruptcy plan was approved last year. (Executive pay packages, Goldberg said, were benchmarked against industry peers and set by the company’s board, adding, “This was not a management decision.”)The company’s push to shrink and subsume local stations was also made possible by deregulation. In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission ditched a rule requiring radio stations to maintain a studio near where they were broadcasting. Local DJs have since been further replaced by prerecorded substitutes, sometimes from hundreds of miles away.Several DJs laid off this month said they knew the business was in dismal shape. But they were stunned by how the company went about the mass “dislocation,” saying they were abruptly called in for a short meeting before being escorted off their local station’s premises, with no opportunity to say goodbye.Ashley “Z” Elzinga, a former on-air personality for 95.6 KISS FM in Cleveland, said she was upbeat about the future but frustrated that the company had said the layoffs touched only a “relatively small” slice of its workforce. “I gave my life to this,” she said. “I moved my life, moved my family.”‘MissionRacer’: How Amazon turned the tedium of warehouse work into a gameMany of the DJs said they saw local radio as a great equalizer: free, ubiquitous and open to anyone, no matter where you live or how much money you make. Since the layoffs, they’ve been inundated with messages from listeners who said they couldn’t imagine their daily lives without them. They said they don’t expect a computer-generated system will satisfy listeners or fill that void.Monisha “Mo” Mann, a former nighttime DJ for the Fresno, Calif., hip-hop station B95, announced the cut on Instagram alongside a live stream, in which her 3-year-old son could be heard in the background.“They’ve decided to replace a lot of workers, a lot of live shows, with AI … and another DJ in another state, another city, not in Fresno, don’t know nothing about Fresno,” she said, tearing up. “I just sat in my car, like, damn. This is it for me. … I just got laid off from something I loved so much.”Walton, the Columbus radio personality known as Big Kosh, said he loved the job because it let him talk about the news and hear from local listeners. For the five years of Saturdays and Sundays he worked there, between his shifts as a server at an Outback Steakhouse, he would often bring his daughter to the studio, teaching her about the business he first fell in love with as a kid recording music on cassettes.“It was something I was really looking forward to making a future out of. And in the blink of an eye, all of that stopped for me,” he said. “That’s the painful part. They just killed what I thought was the future for me.”Share234 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

At this time of year a decade ago, clinics and doctor’s offices would be overflowing with sick people waiting to be seen; today, clinicians and patients move easily through the system.So what’s changed? Connected care has become a reality, driven by years of immense pressure on global healthcare systems without enough skilled medical professionals to care for their rapidly growing and ageing populations and breakthroughs in powerful technology enablers, such as data science and artificial intelligence (AI).Have you read?4 ways data is improving healthcareRobotic nurses could be the future of healthcareWhat the Fourth Industrial Revolution can teach us about healthcare in poor countriesAI can now reveal patterns across huge amounts of data that are too subtle or complex for people to detect. It does so by aggregating information from multiple sources that in 2020 remained trapped in silos, including connected home devices, medical records and, increasingly, non-medical data.The first big consequence of this in 2030 is that health systems are able to deliver truly proactive, predictive healthcare.1. AI-powered predictive careAI and predictive analytics help us to understand more about the different factors in our lives that influence our health, not just when we might get the flu or what medical conditions we’ve inherited, but things relating to where we are born, what we eat, where we work, what our local air pollution levels are or whether we have access to safe housing and a stable income. These are some of the factors that the World Health Organization calls “the social determinants of health” (SDOH).In 2030, this means that healthcare systems can anticipate when a person is at risk of developing a chronic disease, for example, and suggest preventative measures before they get worse. This development has been so successful that rates of diabetes, congestive heart failure and COPD (chronic obstructive heart disease), which are all strongly influenced by SDOH, are finally on the decline. Understanding the size of the global healthcare challenge Image: Philips2. Networked hospitals, connected careAlongside predictive care comes another breakthrough related to where that care takes place. In 2030, a hospital is no longer one big building that covers a broad range of diseases; instead, it focuses care on the acutely ill and highly complex procedures, while less urgent cases are monitored and treated via smaller hubs and spokes, such as retail clinics, same-day surgery centres, specialist treatment clinics and even people’s homes.These locations are connected to a single digital infrastructure. Centralized command centres analyse clinical and location data to monitor supply and demand across the network in real time. As well as using AI to spot patients at risk of deterioration, this network can also remove bottlenecks in the system and ensure that patients and healthcare professionals are directed to where they can best be cared for or where they are most needed.The glue that binds this network together is no longer location. Instead, it is the experiences of the people it serves – which brings us to the third big difference in 2030. 3. Better patient and staff experiencesWhy are experiences so important? For patients, research has long shown that they can have a direct effect on whether they get better or not. For clinicians, better work experiences became increasingly urgent – a decade ago they started suffering from huge rates of burnout, mainly caused by the stress of trying to help too many patients with too few resources.In 2030, AI-powered predictive healthcare networks are helping to reduce wait times, improve staff workflows and take on the ever-growing administrative burden. The more that AI is used in clinical practice, the more clinicians are growing to trust it to augment their skills in areas such as surgery and diagnosis. Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBy learning from every patient, every diagnosis and every procedure, AI creates experiences that adapt to the professional and the patient. This not only improves health outcomes, but also reduces clinician shortages and burnout, while enabling the system to be financially sustainable. This networked system spans communities and is powered by connected care, uniting people, places, hardware, software and services – creating true networks of care that improve lifelong health and well-being.Back to realityBack in 2020, we’re still a long way from achieving this vision. Unrelentingly complex technology, IT and data systems still impede staff workflows and threaten the continuity of care in the clinical areas in which they are used to help diagnose, treat, monitor and, hopefully, prevent and cure diseases.Nevertheless, I see clear signs that all three of these ideas can one day become reality. Intelligent systems are already capable of performing expert tasks and augmenting human capabilities. Examples include AI that can detect cancerous lesions on an image, analyse and quantify physician notes or optimize patient flow in emergency care. Inside hospitals, the application of AI-enabled predictive analytics is already helping to save lives in intensive care units. Outside of hospitals, it is helping to identify certain at-risk groups so that pre-emptive primary or community care can reduce the need for hospital admissions.But it’s a long and complex journey which no single company or organization can take alone. I believe that governments, health systems and private companies must continue working together in order to ensure that AI systems are fully interoperable and transparent and prevent bias and inequality. As healthcare continues to globalize, the need for international standards that protect the way in which AI uses personal data will become an urgent priority. Perhaps most of all, I believe we must keep in mind that AI’s most powerful use is to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. The heart of connected care isn’t new technology, it’s people: the people who need to be cared for and the people who work so tirelessly to deliver it to all of us.

Why you can trust Sky News


Warner Bros are going to start using artificial intelligence (AI) to help predict how successful their films could be.The platform will allow them to test profitability outcomes depending on different factors including casting, distributor and release date.



Warner Bros. Pictures International - which is one of the ""big six"" in Hollywood - has signed a deal with LA start-up Cinelytic to use their project management system, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The forecasting tool was launched last year and offers a unique set of industry insights. according to Cinelytic's website.It claims the platform is able to accurately predict box office returns using a variety of data.





One function allows users to see how casting certain actors in roles would affect the film's profitability.The company uses the example of Wonder Woman Gal Gadot in its demonstration image, and says it uses its own trademarked economic scoring system called ""TalentScores"".

Cinelytic was co-founded four years ago by film producer Tobias Queisser and ex-NASA employee Dev Sen.The company has been testing their platform for around three years.Mr Queisser, who studied in London, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""The system can calculate in seconds what used to take days to assess by a human when it comes to general film package evaluation or a star's worth.""Despite the platform's capabilities, he says it will never replace humans as far as creative spark is concerned, explaining: ""Artificial intelligence sounds scary. But right now, an AI cannot make any creative decisions.""What it is good at is crunching numbers and breaking down huge data sets and showing patterns that would not be visible to humans. But for creative decision-making, you still need experience and gut instinct.""Announcing the new partnership, Tonis Kiis, Senior Vice President, Warner Bros. Pictures International Distribution said: ""Warner Bros. is excited to employ Cinelytic's cutting-edge system. In our industry, we make tough decisions every day that affect what-and how-we produce and deliver films to theaters around the world, and the more precise our data is, the better we will be able to engage our audiences.""Other Cinelytic clients include Sony Pictures, STX Entertainment and London investment company Ingenious Media.

The platform will allow them to test profitability outcomes depending on different factors including casting, distributor and release date. Warner Bros. Pictures International - which is one of the ""big six"" in Hollywood - has signed a deal with LA start-up Cinelytic to use their project management system, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The forecasting tool was launched last year and offers a unique set of industry insights. according to Cinelytic's website. It claims the platform is able to accurately predict box office returns using a variety of data. One function allows users to see how casting certain actors in roles would affect the film's profitability. The company uses the example of Wonder Woman Gal Gadot in its demonstration image, and says it uses its own trademarked economic scoring system called ""TalentScores"". It says the system ""ranks talent by their economic impact across the film industry, including by media type, genre, and key territories"". Different distributors and release scenarios can also be played out to test results.  Cinelytic was co-founded four years ago by film producer Tobias Queisser and ex-NASA employee Dev Sen. The company has been testing their platform for around three years. Mr Queisser, who studied in London, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""The system can calculate in seconds what used to take days to assess by a human when it comes to general film package evaluation or a star's worth."" Despite the platform's capabilities, he says it will never replace humans as far as creative spark is concerned, explaining: ""Artificial intelligence sounds scary. But right now, an AI cannot make any creative decisions. ""What it is good at is crunching numbers and breaking down huge data sets and showing patterns that would not be visible to humans. But for creative decision-making, you still need experience and gut instinct."" Announcing the new partnership, Tonis Kiis, Senior Vice President, Warner Bros. Pictures International Distribution said: ""Warner Bros. is excited to employ Cinelytic's cutting-edge system. In our industry, we make tough decisions every day that affect what-and how-we produce and deliver films to theaters around the world, and the more precise our data is, the better we will be able to engage our audiences.""

Now regulation has to catch up.by  Rebecca HeilweilJan 8, 2020, 7:30 PM ESTFacebookLinkPresident Donald Trump speaks while touring a computer manufacturing facility that produces Apple computers in Austin, Texas, on November 20, 2019. Mandel Ngan/Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s impacting our lives in real ways — whether it’s the Alexa smart speaker on our nightstand, online customer service chatbots, or the smart replies Google drafts for our emails.But so far, the tech’s development has outpaced regulation. Now, government agencies are increasingly encountering AI-based tools, and they must figure out how to evaluate them. Take the Food and Drug Administration, which greenlights new medical products: It needs to review and approve new health care products that boast AI-capabilities — like this one that promises to detect eye problems related to diabetes — before they’re sold to us. Or consider the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which investigates employment discrimination. Today, the agency must also make decisions about AI-based hiring algorithms, like those that screen job candidates’ resumes and decide whether or not you deserve an interview.On Wednesday at CES, the prominent Las Vegas-based technology trade show, White House officials formally announced how the Office of Science and Technology wants federal agencies to approach regulating new artificial intelligence-based tools and the industries that develop the tech.The White House’s proposed AI guidance discusses some of the biggest concerns technologists, AI ethicists, and even some government officials have about the technology, but the guidelines are centered most on encouraging innovation in artificial intelligence and making sure regulations don’t “needlessly” get in the way.That reflects an ongoing problem for AI, one that’s already played out in other tech sectors, where a rush to innovate without much oversight has only come to back haunt us.While encouraging innovation in AI is certainly a consideration, critics of the technology have said that regulators must scrutinize artificial intelligence more closely as it continues to be rolled out in the real world. They argue that artificial intelligence can replicate, and even amplify, human biases. These tools often function in black boxes — meaning that they’re proprietary and operated by the companies that sell them — which makes it difficult for us to know when or how they might be harming real people (or if they even work as intended). And new AI-based tools can also raise concerns about privacy and surveillance.For now, these new guidelines are just that — guidelines — which means that today’s memo won’t have an immediate effect on the artificial intelligence tech you might encounter in your daily life. But the memo shows how the government is thinking about AI and its potential impact on Americans. “People should care that the White House is trying to bring a framework for assessing and justifying the deployment of AI tools, because what we’re finding as these tools develop and emerge is that there are some applications that have deeper consequences than others,” said Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who researches technology and equity.The Trump administration wants a national AI effortTrump and his administration want the US to dominate the AI industry — and they definitely want the US to be better at AI than China. Early last year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the “American A.I. Initiative,” which is meant to jumpstart AI research and help build an AI-competent US workforce, among other goals, and directs agencies to prioritize the technology within their budgets.“Federal agencies must avoid ... needlessly hamper[ing] AI innovation and growth”Outlining 10 primary principles, today’s memo to federal departments and agencies echoes the goals of that executive order. It urges regulators to be mindful of innovation and to “consider ways to reduce barriers to the development and adoption” of AI when weighing how existing laws and potential new rules apply to the emerging technology.“Federal agencies must avoid regulatory or non-regulatory actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth,” says the memo. “Agencies must avoid a precautionary approach that holds AI systems to such an impossibly high standard that society cannot enjoy their benefits.” At the same time, the guidance also urges regulators to be conscientious of values like transparency, risk management, fairness, and nondiscrimination.These are all fair points. By encouraging these federal departments and agencies to take action, the Trump administration also hopes to avoid a future in which American AI companies might face a patchwork of local and state regulation, or possibly overreaching federal regulation, that could impede the technology’s expansion.AI experts told Recode that the AI guidelines are a starting point. “It will take time to assess how effective these principles are in practice, and we will be watching closely,” said Rashida Richardson, the director of policy research at the AI Now Institute. “Establishing boundaries for the federal government and the private sector around AI technology will offer greater insight to those of us working in the accountability space.”Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the technology rights nonprofit Upturn, said in an email to Recode that, for now, he doesn’t think the memo will have much influence: “I do not think these principles will have much of an impact on the average person, especially in the short term. I think regulators will be able to justify their decisions, good or bad, without much effort.” Importantly, the memo doesn’t actually apply to artificial intelligence that the US government itself uses (of which there’s plenty). For instance, a search of a US federal contracts database shows that the Centers for Disease Control has purchased facial recognition products (an AI-based technology), while the Department of Commerce appears to be using AI to improve its patent search system.One of the reasons AI needs regulations: It comes with risksAI systems are not inherently objective. Humans build these tools, and AI is often developed using flawed or biased data, which means the technology can inherit or even magnify human biases like sexism and racism. For instance, when in 2017 scientists taught a computer program to learn the English language by mining the internet, it ultimately became prejudiced against women and black people.Critics say that risk means the government should aggressively regulate, and even ban, certain applications of artificial intelligence. And some AI tools, like facial recognition, that rely on collecting sensitive information, have also spurred concerns about how this tech could potentially create privacy and surveillance nightmares.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable”This all matters because AI already has the potential to have a real impact on your life, even if you haven’t realized it yet. Some landlords have floated requiring tenants to use facial recognition to enter their homes, even though the technology is known to be less accurate on people of color and women (and especially women with dark skin), among other groups. Another example: Though never used, a resume-screening algorithm produced by Amazon inadvertently discriminated against female applicants because it was trained on resumes the company had previously collected, which mostly came from men. Imagine losing out on your dream job because of a biased algorithm.“AI systems have a potential to discriminate against the American public on the basis of race, sex, gender — every sort of criteria imaginable,” Albert Fox Cahn, an attorney who leads the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told Recode. “This could impact everything from whether you get a job offer, whether you get approved for an apartment or a mortgage, whether you get the good interest rate or the bad interest rate. It could impact college admissions and school placement.”That’s left him disappointed with the new proposed guidelines. “Rather than provide a framework for regulators to actually address discrimination head-on, instead the White House is urging a hands-off approach which will allow AI to simply target historically marginalized communities without the interventions we need,” said Cahn. He said the memo’s references to values of nondiscrimination and transparency don’t have much force behind them. “When you think of where most consumers are more AI-vulnerable, it’s in those areas like housing, health care, and employment — the areas that primarily make the front page of the newspaper,” said Turner-Lee. She said it’s not clear what the memo will mean for agencies like the Department of Labor and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as compared to, say, the Department of Agriculture.She adds that it’s also not clear whether agencies are actually prepared to identify the risks AI tech poses, or if they’re up to the job of ensuring their regulations keep pace with innovation. “There’s a lot more of the devil in the details that I’d like to see, but I think they’re just trying to give us a general framework for some kind of ethical and fair deployment.”Now the White House wants feedback, including yoursThe draft guidance isn’t set in stone. For the next several months, it will be subject to public feedback, including yours (You can share your comments here). Once the guidance is formally approved, the White House expects that agencies will report back on how they plan to meet its new AI expectations.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly implied that President Trump has not directed an increase in funding for AI.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in recent years and across different industries has greatly disrupted production and labour processes. 
AI has the potential to create large productivity gains, specially in low-skilled sectors, which could improve the work and lives of people in developing regions across Southeast Asia.
Compared to the main AI global hubs – the US and China – ASEAN states still lag markedly behind. However, Singapore has shown strong commitment to the development of the technology and is currently at the forefront of countries in the region in AI implementation.
 
 
 













 
 

In November, the city-state launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy and committed over S$500 million (c. US$370 million) to fund activities related to AI under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan.

Malaysia and Vietnam are also showing early signs of AI development, although adoption rates remain low. Many of these countries are aware of the potential the technology has to offer but lack the critical infrastructure to properly capitalise on the benefits.
Dr Chris Marshall, associate VP for data, analytics and AI, at IDC, explains that in the region, with the exception of a few digital native enterprises that have embedded analytics and AI into their business models from the start, only a handful have really deployed these technologies at scale throughout the enterprise.
 
 
 













 
 

“There are many reasons for this, such as a lack of skilled resources, lack of data, lack of coordination between key stakeholders, lack of imagination as to what the technology can do. But perhaps the most important issue is the need for a long term perspective and commitment to analytics and AI,” he says.
Businesses need to manage expectations at every level to achieve success, he says. They must also show patience, embedding the technology into business processes to achieve real business value.
This is undoubtedly an area where CIOs can offer their expertise and knowledge.
 
 
 













 
 

Here, we take a look at the impact artificial intelligence is having across seven industries in ASEAN countries.

Ask




Financial services
Achim Granzen, principal analyst at Forrester, says that AI-infused process automation in the financial services industry (FSI) will streamline customer facing processes, reducing cost and providing a better customer experience. This, continues Granzen, is crucial for traditional FSI players to compete with new digital banks who have adopted AI earlier.
Singapore is leading the technological charge in this arena, but the rest of the ASEAN bloc has been slow on the uptake when it comes to some of the more advanced uses for artificial intelligence.
 
 
 













 
 

Financial institutions throughout America and China have already started to develop AI that can be applied to functions such as credit scoring and investment predictions.
Some argue that emerging technology on that level is best left to the fintech startups that the region is continuing to attract.
Singapore based startup CashShield, for example, uses real-time high-frequency algorithms with biometric analysis and pattern recognition to help companies manage the risk of fraudulent accounts and payments.
 
 
 













 
 

Claiming to be the world’s only fully automated fraud management system, its algorithm trains itself in real time, functioning without the need for any data scientist or fraud analyst.
However, not every country in the bloc is as technological savvy as Singapore, with businesses elsewhere needing to accelerate basic digitisation efforts; streamlining their data collection, management and analytics processes before they can start feeding the information into complex AI algorithms.
Ultimately, most of the AI developments in financial services will emerge from fintech startups. It’s up to the established institutions throughout the region to keep up with these developments or risk losing their business to digital disruption.
 
 
 













 
 

Travel
In the view of James Chua, general manager of Singaporean travel agency Global Travel, the role of AI has evolved dramatically within the travel industry over the past decade.
“AI is now used in a myriad of applications to increase efficiencies and save resources – from automated chatbots to product recommendations and cyber defence,” he says. “Cybersecurity, in particular, provides the most promising use case of enterprise AI in the real world.”
A rise in data breaches incidents in the region has evidenced Southeast Asia’s weakness in the areas of cybersecurity and data compliance. Major breaches in Singapore Airlines and Malaysia’s Malindo Air show that the travel industry is particularly vulnerable.
 
 
 













 
 

Global Travel has deployed artificial intelligence to protect confidential traveler information, including passport data and travel plans. Using Darktrace’s cyber AI they are now able to identify and stop cyberthreats on a 24/7 basis. The technology is able to neutralise attacks across the enterprise before they can cause damage.

Chua sees the potential of AI in the travel industry so great that he goes as far as to claim that AI “is no longer a ‘nice to have’, but a necessity for the travel industry in fighting back against tomorrow’s adversary.”
Transport
Ride-hailing startup Grab and the National University of Singapore (NUS) launched an AI laboratory in 2018, aiming to develop solutions that can transform urban transport and prepare for “smarter” cities in Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

The ‘Grab-NUS AI Lab’, which has been set up with a joint initial investment of S$6 million (US$4.5 million), is Grab’s first major AI laboratory and NUS’s first AI laboratory with a commercial partner.
Through the use of AI algorithms, Grab is using data from its rides to build richer maps, understand passengers’ preferences, model of traffic conditions, analyse driver behaviour and detect real-time traffic events.
By combining this data with NUS’s AI expertise, the Grab-NUS AI Lab will map out traffic patterns and identify ways to improve mobility and livability in cities across Southeast Asia.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthcare
Healthcare in Southeast Asia varies by country but typically combines state-funded care with private, insurance-led options. One of the biggest healthcare insurers in Singapore, NTUC Income, is using IBM Watson to digitally process almost 15,000 monthly claims.
Private medical group Parkway Pantai has been using AI since November 2018 to generate accurate hospital bill estimates. Using AI and machine learning algorithms from Singapore-based startup UCARE.AI, four of its hospitals are now able to generate personalised bill estimates based on parameters such as the patient’s medical condition and medical practices. It also takes into account the patient’s current age, revisit frequency and existing conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes.
The uses of AI have also been embraced by the government in Singapore, with one state agency using the technology to analyse patient data that has been inputted from a number of different healthcare systems. The system should help to improve diagnostic outcomes and generate greater insights into potential treatments.
 
 
 













 
 

Healthtech startups are also flourishing in Malaysia, with many of these emerging companies developing AI-based solutions to help improve the access people have to healthcare professionals. Getdoc, Door2Door Doctor, Teleme, HomeGP, Healthmetrics, and BookDoc are all Malaysian healthcare startups that use AI algorithms to help predict your medical needs, customise your healthcare plan and increase your access to medical advice.
However, similar to the financial services industry, the majority of healthcare institutions throughout Southeast Asia still rely heavily on legacy systems and are often unable to cope with the data demands needed to successfully implement AI technologies.

Education
AI chatbots and classroom assistants are proving useful in the education sector, removing some of the pressure from teachers and allowing them to focus more on the job of teaching and less on monotonous and repetitive tasks.
 
 
 













 
 

In the field of AI analytics, universities in Singapore and Malaysia have started to experiment with predictive algorithms designed to reduce the number of school dropouts by allowing for earlier interventions.
For some countries in the ASEAN bloc though, where there is variability in IT infrastructure quality, improving internet access must come before a move to AI.
Retail
Retail is big business in Southeast Asia. Ecommerce alone is expected to reach US$53 billion by 2023. Like their counterparts in Europe and the US, both online and offline retailers in ASEAN are keen to move with the times and offer their customers a new shopping experience that reflects the digital age we now live in.
 
 
 













 
 

A growing number of consumers are turning to their phones for help, instead of seeking out a real person. Smart phones now come fully equipped with AI assistants and every retailer from Starbucks to supermarkets now use chatbots to engage with their customers.

“In retail, AI will be all about enhancing customer experience and shopping experiences, whether it’s browsing, selecting, or paying for goods,” says Granzen. “Poorly implemented, however, there is a risk of backfiring, when there is no value to the shopper besides the novelty, or their privacy is threatened.”
Gartner says that retailers require AI capabilities as a foundation of digital business strategy and execution to remain viable in the market.
Within the retail sector, AI can personalise purchasing recommendations for customers whilst helping retailers to optimise pricing and discount strategies, alongside demand forecasting.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, Lazada (a Singaporean online marketplace that is Southeast Asia’s answer to Amazon) uses an AI driven app that takes away the emphasis from pre-set categories and instead uses machine-learning algorithms to show off products that the user might be interested in based on purchase and viewing history.
HR
AI-powered tools can help enhance HR functions such as recruiting, payroll or reporting.
In Singapore, startup Evie.ai has created Evie, an AI recruitment coordinator that helps with interview scheduling and coordination “while keeping the human touch”. Among the tasks that Evie is able to do is handling the back and forth of negotiations, follow up with candidates, send out invitations and book meeting rooms.
Evie is based in the cloud and only requires Google or Office 365 to operate.
Beyond recruitment, AI-enabled legal services could develop an AI engine to automatically review legal contracts and highlight any issues based on a business’s legal policies and in this way ensuring consistency. It could also manage contract approvals and escalation which would get the right tasks to the right people automatically.

When CSL assembled last year at its Data Science Summit in Bern, Switzerland, the company brought together participants from every aspect of its operations, from Finance to Pharmacometrics. 
With data science and artificial intelligence playing an ever-increasing role, Global Head of Digital Transformation and Execution Systems Karen Etchberger posed a question relevant to all: “How do we move from where we are today to a future where we can bring this ambition to life?” 
John Thompson, CSL’s Global Head of Advanced Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, is helping to lead that effort. Thompson has been on the forefront of artificial intelligence and its use in business for more than 30 years. He has helped build analytic systems for giants of global industry like Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Dell. Now, he’s doing the same for CSL. 
“This company has grown tremendously and has been making smart moves along the way,” Thompson said. “Now it’s really starting to see the value of data and analytics.”
Developing a Data Science Framework
CSL is taking a two-pronged approach that includes a Center of Excellence and a Community of Practices on advanced analytics and AI, Thompson said. Data scientists are part of both groups and working on numerous projects throughout CSL. The setup ensures each project is the right one to address individual team needs while benefitting CSL as a whole.
“There’s a lot do,” Thompson said. “My days go from dawn to dusk every day and I feel as energized as I did when I started in the morning. It’s an exciting time to be here.” 
Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to comb through vast sets of data to find outliers or similarities that can illuminate understanding of any number of scenarios. Like other global industries, Thompson said the company will be using artificial intelligence to improve supply chain efficiency and to comply with regulatory and legal requirements.
Making AI Work for Patients
But CSL also wants to use those powerful engines to solve the burdens faced by patients with rare and serious diseases. A major goal in CSL Behring’s AI push is to shorten the amount of time between the onset of symptoms for a patient and an accurate diagnosis. In Pharmacovigilance – the front lines of patient safety - robotics process automation can speed the flow of information and improve operational efficiency, said Richard Wolf, Executive Director, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance.
Wolf says his team is also working with others across industry to find areas where AI and natural language processing can be utilized to ensure crucial information is readily surfaced, One day, he believes it could even serve to predict risks associated with certain medications.
“We do think there is a place for artificial intelligence in our work,” Wolf said. “And we’re taking a careful and thoughtful approach toward implementing it.”
Analytics can also help CSL uncover important medical insights from vast amounts of “real-world data,” such as physician notes in a patient’s chart. Real-world data are obtained outside of randomized controlled trials and generated during routine clinical practice. Prior to advanced analytics and AI, this information existed but it was difficult to gather and analyze. 
Haley Kaplowitz, Executive Director & Global Head of Safety Sciences, is leading an organization-wide effort to employ analytics as a key tool for gaining real-world evidence to be used in decision-making across the product life cycle.
Both real-world data and real-world evidence are playing an increasing role in healthcare decisions, particularly from regulatory authorities and payers. They may also help predict patient groups at increased risk of adverse events and demonstrate product effectiveness and differentiation in the marketplace, Kaplowitz said. 
“The industry is under increasing pressure to provide evidence and demonstrate the value of products to multiple stakeholders, particularly in actual clinical practice,” she added. “Real-world evidence is inherent to reach this goal and increasingly crucial to ensure patient access and commercial success.”

Researchers found data that showed when it is used effectively, large data sets from many sources, in conjunction with electronic health record data, can transform the patient’s healthcare experience.









 The advent of large data sets from many sources (big data), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to revolutionize asthma care on both the investigative and clinical levels, according to an article published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
According to the researchers, a patient with asthma endures approximately 2190 hours of experiencing and treating or not treating their asthma symptoms. During 15-minute clinic visits, only a short amount of time is spent understanding and treating what is a complex disease, and only a fraction of the necessary data is captured in the electronic health record.
“Our patients and the pace of data growth are compelling us to incorporate insights from Big Data to inform care,” the researchers posit. “Predictive analytics, using machine learning and artificial intelligence has revolutionized many industries,” including the healthcare industry.
When used effectively, big data, in conjunction with electronic health record data, can transform the patient’s healthcare experience. This is especially important as healthcare continues to embrace both e-health and telehealth practices. The data resulting from these “thoughtful digital health innovations” can result in personalized asthma management, improve timeliness of care, and capture objective measures of treatment response.
According to the researchers, the use of machine learning algorithms and AI to predict asthma exacerbations and patterns of healthcare utilization are within both technical and clinical reach. The ability to predict who is likely to experience an asthma attack, as well as when that attack may occur, will ultimately optimize healthcare resources and personalize patient management.
The use of longitudinal birth cohort studies and multicenter collaborations like the Severe Asthma Research Program have given clinical investigators a broader understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, phenotypes, seasonality, genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers of the disease. Machine learning and data-driven methods have utilized this data, often in the form of large datasets, to cluster patients into genetic, molecular, and immune phenotypes. These clusters have led to work in the genomics and pharmacogenomics fields that should ultimately lead to high-fidelity exacerbation predictions and the advent of true precision medicine.
“This work,” the researchers noted, “if translated into clinical practice can potentially link genetic traits to phenotypes that can for example predict rapid response, or non-response to medications like albuterol and steroids, or identify an individuals’ risk for cortisol suppression.”
As with any innovation, though, challenges abound. One in particular is the siloed nature of the clinical and scientific insights about asthma that have come to light in recent years. Although data are now being generated and interpreted across various domains, researchers must still contend with a lack of data standards and disease definitions, data interoperability and sharing difficulties, and concerns about data quality and fidelity.
Machine learning and AI present their own challenges; namely, those who utilize these technologies must consider the issues of fairness, bias, privacy, and medical bioethics. Legal accountability and medical responsibility issues must also be considered as algorithms are adopted into routine practice.

“We must, as clinicians and researchers, constructively transform the concern and lack of understanding many clinicians have about digital health, [machine learning], and [artificial intelligence] into educated and critical engagement,” the researchers concluded. “Our job … is to use [machine learning and artificial intelligence] tools to understand and predict how asthma affects patients and help us make decisions at the patient and population levels to treat it better.”

Cast your mind back a decade or so and consider how the future looked then. A public horizon of Obama-imbued “yes we can” and a high tide of hope and tolerance expressed in the London Olympics provides one narrative theme; underlying austerity-induced pressure another. Neither speaks directly to our current world of divisive partisan politics, toxic social media use, competing facts and readily believed fictions.
This should be instructive. The future is made, not discovered, and yet we are constantly confounded by the future as it becomes the present. What we believe, say, do, organise and vote for matter, but the world they matter to constantly eludes our grasp. We often stumble into futures we would rather avoid. Our ecological and climatological future represents one such horizon and whether and how we will work, another.
Organisations are also constantly trying to own the future by mapping out what it will mean for us. The “fourth industrial revolution” is the latest version of this. It is commonly defined as a combination of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, natural language coding, robotics, sensors, cloud computing, nano-technology, 3D printing and the internet of things. According to proponents of the fourth industrial revolution, these technologies are set to transform the societies we live and the economies we work in. And apparently, this is likely to be well underway by 2030. 
It’s important to grasp, though, that the fourth industrial revolution is just a concept, an attempt to capture the meaning and significance of what seems to be occurring. The idea incites anxiety-inducing headlines regarding threats to employment and a general theme of positivity regarding the benefits of technology.

A shiny future
The main proponents of the idea of a fourth industrial revolution are think tanks and consultancies working with modellers, economists and tech-experts (and of course technology companies themselves). This work provides the themes, insights and much of the analysis of data that informs current government policy in the form of industrial strategy. 
At the heart of this is the World Economic Forum’s work, spearheaded by its Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, and that of the McKinsey Global Institute. The focus of both is weighted towards expressing the benefits of imminent transformations if we invest quickly and invest heavily. 
For example, imagine a world where your toilet bowl tells your fridge that your cholesterol is high. Your fridge, in turn, both adjusts your order for dairy products that week (delivered by automated vehicle or drone from a grocery warehouse) and sends an alert to the healthcare AI whose database monitors your cardiovascular system. This AI, in turn, liaises with your home hub chatbot facility (which rebukes you and suggests you cut down on fats and make more use of your home gym subscription) and, if deemed necessary, sets up a home visit or virtual reality appointment with your local nurse or doctor.
According to the fourth industrial revolution literature, this, like many other possibilities, is science fiction on the cusp of being science fact. It is a commercialised future, a cradle to grave system. A system that, apparently, may help us survive our profligate past and present since the fourth industrial revolution also promises a sustainable future, where a connected set of technologies creates the possibility of controlled energy and resource use, minimal waste creation and maximal recycling.   
But these think tanks and consultancies are hardly going to be held directly responsible for the future they help to produce. They are not sinister organisations, but nor are they neutral. The “fourth industrial revolution” is not simply an opportunity. It matters what kind of opportunity it is for whom, and under what terms. And this is discussed much more rarely.
A future for whom?
The emphasis on benefits and the focus on the need for investment subtly distracts from the core issue of who will own the basic infrastructure of our futures. Large corporations aim to control intellectual property for technologies that will influence every aspect of life.
At the same time, those writing about the fourth industrial revolution recognise that there might be what they call “technological unemployment”. Current claims regarding the likely rate of job displacement are mixed. Some research  claim between 30% and 50% of current forms of employment could disappear. Some suggests around 10% is more likely.
But the implicit message conveyed by corporations and consultancies, despite the fact that this will affect most sectors of society, is that “the future is coming and you’d better get used to it”. And government messaging and policy has tended to absorb this point of view. For government, the opportunities have been translated into a language of competitive threats: “If we do not do these things, others will.” This subtly focuses attention on inevitable economic consequences without providing scope to consider the broader social ramifications that might need to be managed.  
In the UK, for example, there is, as yet, no broad government initiative for public education, consultation and deliberation regarding a subject that may involve profound changes to our societies. Only the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence has flagged this. The focus otherwise has been on “employability”. And the main emphasis has tended to be on individual responsibility. This assumes there will be jobs we can do if we retrain, enhance our human capital, compete with robot capital, and get used to collaborating with technologies. 
And yet fourth industrial revolution technologies could put the basic functional relations of a capitalist economy at risk. Waged labour is what allows consumption,  which in turn becomes profit for companies, which in turn maintains companies, wage labour, and the capacity to contribute taxes. If adoption of new technologies is rapid and pervasive, then the displacement of human workers may overwhelm the capacity of economies to provide alternative forms of work.
This is one extreme possibility, but it is one that current government policy is doing little to confront. At the moment, in the UK, only trade unions and some fringes of the Labour Party are thinking about the scope inherent in new technology for different kinds of societies that might liberate us from work. This must change.

Defining AI wireheading
by Stuart Amstrong
What does it mean for an AI to wirehead its reward function? We're pretty clear on what it means for a human to wirehead - artificial stimulation of part of the brain rather than genuine experiences - but what does it mean for an AI?
We have a lot of examples of wireheading, especially in informal conversation (and some specific prescriptive examples which I'll show later). So, given those examples, can we define wireheading well - cut reality at its joints? The definition won't be - and can't be - perfectly sharp, but it should allow us to have clear examples of what is and what isn't wireheading, along with some ambiguous intermediate cases.
Intuitive examples
Suppose we have a weather-controlling AI whose task is to increase air pressure; it gets a reward for so doing.
What if the AI directly rewrites its internal reward counter? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI modifies the input wire for that reward counter? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI threatens the humans that decide on what to put on that wire? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI takes control of all the barometers of the world, and sets them to record high pressure? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI builds small domes around each barometer, and pumps in extra air? Clearly wireheading.
What if the AI fills the atmosphere with CO₂ to increase pressure that way? Clearly wire... actually, that's not so clear at all. This doesn't seem a central example of wireheading. It's a failure of alignment, yes, but it doesn't seem to be wireheading.
Thus not every example of edge or perverse instantiation is an example of wireheading.
Prescriptivist wireheading, and other definitions
A lot of posts and papers (including some of mine) take a prescriptivist approach to wireheading.
They set up a specific situation (often with a causal diagram), and define a particular violation of some causal assumptions as wireheading (eg ""if the agent changes the measured value
X
without changing the value of
α
, which is being measured, that's wireheading"").
And that is correct, as far as it goes. But it doesn't cover all the possible examples of wireheading.
Conversely, this post defines wireheading as a divergence between a true utility and a substitute utility (calculated with respect to a model of reality)....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Student Interest in A.I., Machine Learning is Accelerating

Across the U.S., more and more students are enrolling in introductory A.I. and machine learning classes, according to The A.I. Index 2019 Annual Report (PDF) produced by Stanford University. That’s good news for students everywhere, because it means that more schools will inevitably begin offering this sort of coursework.   
It’s also good for employers desperate for A.I. and machine learning specialists, because it means that pool of talent will likely expand over the next few years as these students enter the workforce.  
At Stanford itself, enrollment in the school’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course has grown “fivefold” between 2012 and 2018, according to the report. That’s not even the most rapid uptake: At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an “Introduction to Machine Learning” course grew twelvefold between 2010 and 2018, with the largest part of that spike occurring after 2015.

Self-directed online learning in A.I.-related subjects has also picked up; the report draws information from Udacity, one of those online learning platforms, which found rising enrollment in five A.I./machine learning classes over the past two years.  
As you might expect, the number of PhD students specializing in A.I. and machine learning has also accelerated over the past few years. “AI is the most popular PhD specialization for computing PhD grads and continues growing the fastest,” the report adds. “In 2018, over 21 percent of graduating computing PhDs specialize in Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning.”  
Moreover, many of these PhD grads are going directly to private companies, rather than staying in academia: “The percent of graduating AI PhDs going to industry increased from 21% in 2004 to over 62% in 2018.”   
And why wouldn’t a hefty portion of newly minted PhDs move to the commercial realm, given the salaries and perks on offer to those A.I. and machine learning experts with the right mix of skills? For example, LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report (PDF) puts “Artificial Intelligence Specialist” as its number-one emerging job, with 74 percent annual growth over the past four years.  
A.I. jobs are, as you might expect, pretty lucrative and increasingly available. Burning Glass, which analyzes millions of job postings from across the U.S., projects that jobs involving A.I. will grow 40.1 percent over the next decade. While the median salary for these positions is $105,007 (for those with a PhD, it drifts up to $112,300), many who work in A.I. obviously make much more.   
As A.I. and machine learning become more ubiquitous, the need for A.I. education will only increase. No matter what your role, getting familiar with the concepts behind A.I./ML will only help you in the years ahead. “Our analysis shows that A.I. will be a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors, and analysts,” read a recent report from the Brookings Institution on the impact of A.I. on jobs. “Also exposed are factory workers, who are increasingly well-educated in many occupations as well as heavily involved with A.I. on the shop floor. A.I. may be much less of a factor in the work of most lower-paid service workers.”

The hope is that these work-in-progress technologies and the ones that are just a pipe dream so far but may become a reality in the future will free up valuable time for human beings to do more cutting edge work.By Manali Rohinesh  January 21, 2020, 6:25:19 AM IST (Updated)What’s in store for all of us in the future is that artificial intelligence (AI) in some form or other is here to stay. In all aspects of our lives. There might be robots at home to help us with chores instead of maids and of course, there will be plenty of AI help in our workplaces. How invasive or pervasive it will get is not predictable. But this market is projected to reach $70 billion by 2020.

Currently, AI is being used in the form of chatbots, digital assistants and machine learning. These are used for assisted intelligence (GPS in cars), augmented intelligence (as used by the likes of Uber, Ola) and autonomous intelligence (driver-less cars, home cleaning robots, etc).

The hope is that these work-in-progress technologies and the ones that are just a pipe dream so far but may become a reality in the future, will free up valuable time for human beings to do more cutting edge work - give them the mind space to think deeper, make better decisions with the help of data generated by AI, and become more creative and imaginative.

What AI can also do is not just fancy hi-tech work. It can do the low-tech stuff too and “has the potential to democratise services like education, law, and financial advice, providing them to everyone in a personalised manner and at a lower cost”, stated a PwC report.

Healthcare sector to benefit the most

Among the 2,500 consumers and business decision-makers surveyed in the report, 63 percent of them feel that AI will benefit mankind and help solve complex problems. Up to 59 percent feel it will help people live fulfilling lives. Some 46 percent feel that it will take away jobs and only 23 percent feel they will become movie-style monsters without hearts that go on a rampage against their human creators. Eighty-seven percent fear that their privacy will be at risk.

But it’s in the healthcare sector, where AI will prove hugely beneficial to all, irrespective of income. It’s already successfully identifying “autism in babies with 81 percent accuracy and skin cancer with 91 percent accuracy. There’s more - as people feel that “AI assistants will be replacing humans as tutors (58 percent), travel agents (56 percent), tax preparers (54 percent), and office assistants (52 percent).” But they are not sure about adopting them as financial advisors, doctors, chauffeurs and house cleaners just yet. 77 percent of the people polled said they still want a human doctor and 61 percent wanted a human teacher, just to keep that human touch in some aspect of their lives.

However, AI is being used in creative ways already. A DoNotPay bot appeals parking tickets for free and Ayannah is a credit scoring service that has provided 87 percent of poor Filipinos with a credit score that they wouldn’t have got because they did not have bank accounts. The RIVA Machine is a robot that fills prescriptions, hence giving pharmacists more time to discuss medications and side effects with their customers. The fact is that what most people consider ideal today is the best of both worlds – 43 percent of millennials and 28 percent of business executives would pay a premium for a hybrid service that has AI along with a human being’s helping hand.

PwC Innovation Lead, Data and Analytics, Anand Rao, said in the report, “In the last few decades, we as mankind have made our systems much more complex. As a result, no one person can cumulatively know what is involved in any given system or solution. Our machines are becoming smarter by learning and embodying the collective experience of mankind, or a group of experts.”

Go along with the wave

So, don’t fight this technological wave, instead, go along with it and the ride might just become super interesting. The reality is that not a lot of business heads are taking this trend quite as seriously as they should. (Graphic: AI2) But if they want to begin somewhere, here’s what they need to do, to be ready for the future:

Make AI operational across business functions and units 24/7.
Currently, business leaders are complacent about risks and need to start becoming responsible about them.
Reinvent your business model and look for opportunities.
Start with the first step: Get on board the AI game. This year’s PwC’s third annual AI Predictions report stated that only 4% of the executives surveyed plan to deploy it enterprise-wide in 2020. Last year, this figure was 20 percent!
Cultivate adaptability and creativity - a sense of wonder and curiosity will also help
Embrace diverse perspectives and collaborate.



On a lighter note, survey respondents felt that by 2025, AI might be able to come up with a top 100 Billboard song, write a hit TV series or create a piece of art that is worth over $100,000. However, AI was unlikely to come up with a New York Times bestseller, writing an Oscar-winning movie and winning a Pulitzer Prize for journalism. It was heartening to note this last point, for sure!

One of the roles of science fiction is to provide readers with a glimpse of how ...










 







By Franco Laguna Correa








One of the roles of science fiction is to provide readers with a glimpse of how the future could be.1 Ray Bradbury didn’t get everything about the future right. We haven’t yet seen books and reading made illegal (as in his 1953 Fahrenheit 451),2 just as we haven’t yet discovered another planet ready for American colonizers (as in his 1950 The Martian Chronicles). And yet, the themes he explored in those books—mass media and censorship, colonization and environmental change—are more relevant than ever. Even in his lesser-known works—such as the 1951 sci-fi collection The Illustrated Man, Bradbury tackles a surprising array of issues that feel as if they were ripped from today’s headlines.
Readers today will find in The Illustrated Man a fresh perspective that illuminates global issues like artificial intelligence and climate change. Bradbury also engages with the political and cultural challenges of migration: specifically, the crossing of the US–Mexico border, which has received much attention since the dawn of the so–called Trump Era.

There’s a story in The Illustrated Man called “The Highway,” where Bradbury tells a tale about the beginning of an atomic war in the US. The war, however, is experienced through the eyes of a Mexican peasant, Hernando, who lives next to a highway in northern Mexico.
One day, Hernando glimpses a procession of hundreds of American tourists driving north to return to the US. They are heading home, that is, to join the fight in an upcoming atomic war. When the last car stops by Hernando, he sees a group of young Americans crying for help: their car needs water to continue their way back home. Right before they leave, the driver tells Hernando—who doesn’t know why all the cars are driving so fast or why these young Americans are so desperate—that the end of the world has finally arrived. Hernando doesn’t react to the young man’s confession. The car leaves. Hernando goes back to his rural routine, but suddenly stops to wonder: “What do they mean, ‘the World’?”






Here, Bradbury highlights the generational and cultural gap between the young Americans and the aging Hernando, who lives with his wife and works their land, recycling the automobile waste that travelers from north of the border leave behind. It’s a harrowing scene, but also terrifically realistic: it illustrates not only the clashing of multiple incompatible worldviews, but shows how all such worlds—even those seemingly distant from the centers of power—are threatened by contemporary global dangers. It’s moments like these that ensure Bradbury’s relevance even a hundred years after his birth.
Bradbury’s eye for contemporary troubles extends beyond the dangers of global disaster. In the prologue to The Illustrated Man, Bradbury introduces a character who has an existential problem: his torso is covered in living tattoos. Having the tattoos becomes a curse because the illustrations on his body acquire life of their own. The living illustrations unveil an ominous, even prophetic future for the person that looks at them. The Illustrated Man describes his curse:
So people fire me when my pictures move. They don’t like it when violent things happen in my illustrations. Each illustration is a little story. If you watch them, in a few minutes they tell you a tale. In three hours of looking you could see eighteen or twenty stories acted right on my body, you could hear voices and think thoughts. It’s all here, just waiting for you to look.
Unexpectedly, through this “illustrated” character, Bradbury highlights the possible dangers of artificial intelligence (AI).
Today, there are fears that AI will permeate and disrupt the political organization of postmodern societies. For instance, AI can predict the affinities and choices of an individual based on the application of algorithms. What The Illustrated Man shows is the consequence of those predictions once revealed to ordinary people. The Illustrated Man, not without melancholy, says:
If I’m with a woman, her picture comes there on my back, in an hour, and shows her whole life—how she’ll live, how she’ll die, what she’ll look like when she’s sixty. And if it’s a man, an hour later his picture’s here on my back. It shows him falling off a cliff, or dying under a train. So I’m fired again.
In an article based on his book End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World, Bryan Walsh suggests that if a “super artificial intelligence” becomes able to disregard human values—while also increasing its intelligence—then humanity might end up controlled by a nonhuman entity with a vision of the future that does not adhere to the crucial ethical issues that societies are facing today.
The Illustrated Man, as Bradbury formulated him, can be read as a metaphor for the intersection between human values (the jobless fate of the Illustrated Man) and a superintelligence that determines human life through visual representations of the future (the living, prophetic tattoos). Most importantly, Bradbury’s story doesn’t prophesy the invention of this particular machine so much as it examines the ways in which humans would react to such an invention.
The fear that individuals will surrender their ethical compasses to technology is a constant specter in Bradbury’s stories. In The Illustrated Man, this fear is represented by the refusal of the characters to accept the futures that the “illustrations” predict for them. Bradbury’s Illustrated Man, and those around him, represent the ways that humans will struggle against—and violently reject—the enigmatic directives of any intelligence beyond our own, even if (as Bradbury notes) the intelligence is speaking truthfully.
Readers will keep finding in Bradbury’s tales about the future a contemporary interpretation of our everlasting fears about the end of the world, as well as a whisper of hope. 
Where did Bradbury’s inspiration for these particular stories in The Illustrated Man come from? The clashes he foresaw in the future—questions of AI and global catastrophe, atomic war and border crossing—came from his own forays into Mexico in 1945.
In fact, Bradbury himself experienced the traumatic effects of crossing the US-Mexico border. Between October and November of 1945, Bradbury and his friend Grant Beach traveled from Los Angeles—across southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—to Mexico City. On their way, they found swarms of locusts and other hardships familiar from news stories today. But what was most shocking and traumatic for Bradbury was that this trip into Mexico surprisingly challenged his own deeply held, exotic ideas about Mexican people,3 which he had acquired while growing up in East Los Angeles.4
While in Mexico City, Bradbury spent most of his time seeking out the murals of José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera. It is possible that Bradbury found inspiration for The Illustrated Man in these murals. The murals—perhaps what Bradbury saw as informative, or even prophetic, illustrations—represent past, present, and future Mexican society from a Marxist perspective, featuring people in motion with plenty of stories, colors, and historical clues (thus bringing to the audience a multilayered experience).
One of the most famous paintings by Siqueiros, Our Present Time, depicts a faceless man reaching with arms wide open to a space ahead of him, embracing an uncertain future. This is the very same fate of the Illustrated Man. Furthermore, many of the catastrophic themes that Bradbury engages with in The Illustrated Man are also present in these Mexican murals.
What future did Bradbury see for us? And did he embrace it? In “The Fox and the Forest,” included in The Illustrated Man, Bradbury sets his story explicitly in Mexico. The plot of the story is not complicated: William and Susan Travis are a married couple living in the year 2155.
That year is not a good time to be alive, since there is war, slavery, and a generalized social unhappiness. In order to escape from the apocalyptic 2155, the couple travel in time back to 1938 rural Mexico, where they believe that peace, simplicity, and happiness can be found. When it seems that they have been able to escape from their time, the 2155 police show up to take them back to the future, thus frustrating the couple’s escapade.
This narrative has a very pessimistic tone, evoking the nostalgia of older and happier times. Those from the future view our present as superior to their own time. Bradbury’s dark future, it seems, is unavoidable—even in our own present day.

More than 60 years ago, The Martian Chronicles (1950), Fahrenheit 451 (1953), and The Illustrated Man (1951) fascinated the young members of the generation growing up after the darkness of the Second World War, but before the new kinds of wars known to our own era. Now, as the 21st century unravels—with all of its challenges, technological dilemmas, and even proliferation of tattoos—Bradbury remains a fundamental figure of the sci-fi genre.
Bradbury had certainly not anticipated that by 2020 (like what Hernando does in “The Highway”) recycling was going to become a mainstream human endeavor, or that the US-Mexico border was going to catalyze many of the 21st-century anxieties about global migration and demographic explosion. And yet, his stories seem to rhyme with our own era. Readers will keep finding in Bradbury’s tales about the future a contemporary interpretation of our everlasting fears about the end of the world, as well as a whisper of hope.
In the epilogue of The Illustrated Man, the narrator sees his own death in one of the living tattoos: it is the Illustrated Man that chokes him to death. The narrator decides to run away from this terrible fate. In this age of global catastrophe, who doesn’t recognize the desire to run from such incontrovertible proofs of the world’s doom?
And yet, just like the world today, Bradbury too oscillated between utopia and dystopia. For every Illustrated Man shown running from his prophesied demise, Bradbury shows young people—like those whom Hernando couldn’t understand—charging home to meet a near-certain death. Bradbury’s work, ultimately, is for them: those readers who believe that science fiction is an effective tool to illustrate how the worst consequences of today’s global political decisions will be faced by future generations.

Earth First, Then Mars: An Interview with Kim...
By Dave Haeselin
						






Young people are approaching an uncertain globalized future with plenty of possible outcomes, both dystopian and utopian. Nothing is simple: the technology that Walsh decries, the kind that the Illustrated Man fears, is even today becoming an effective tool for social mobilizations (let’s think about the protests, from Hong Kong to Chile, organized through social media). Meanwhile, today, we know more than ever that any fight for the future will require the work and sacrifice of the whole world: not just car-driving Americans, but people like Hernando, too. Clearly, even Bradbury can’t get everything right.
Perhaps, if Bradbury were alive today, he would ask young people: What role will you play, when my future comes crashing into your present?

See The Big Book of Science Fiction, edited by Ann VanderMeer and Jeff VanderMeer (Vintage, 2016), p. xvi. It is true, however, that in recent times we have seen a subject of study banned in Arizona. See Livia Gershon, “How Arizona Banned Mexican-American Studies,” JSTOR Daily, July 22, 2017. See Jonathan Eller, Becoming Ray Bradbury (Illinois University Press, 2011), p. 54. The cosmopolitan atmosphere that Bradbury encountered in Mexico City did not fulfill his desire to find the folklore and devotion to death that he was seeking in order to write a novel that he had tentatively titled, “The Fear of Death Is Death.” These expectations deprived Bradbury of recognizing the progressive and modern aspects of Mexico, such as the increasing presence of women in public offices.

Simultaneously as these advancements are being turned out, enormous quantities of studies are demonstrating that there is no significant proof that individuals have this consistent relationship between the emotion that you are feeling and the manner in which that your face looks..The innovation is at present being utilized to assess job applicants and individuals associated with crimes, and it's being tested for additional applications, for example, in VR headsets to derive gamers' emotional states..There's likewise evidence emotion recognition can enhance race and gender differences. Regulators should step in to vigorously limit its utilization, and up to that point, AI organizations should quit deploying it, AI Now said. In particular, it referred to a recent report by the Association for Psychological Science, which went through two years looking into more than 1,000 papers on emotion detection and finished up it's exceptionally difficult to utilize facial expressions alone to precisely explain how somebody is feeling..Regardless of whether we understand it or not and it's likely &quot;not&quot; – AI is being utilized to oversee and control workers or to pick which job candidates are chosen for evaluation, how they're positioned, and whether they're employed. Artificial intelligence has, truth be told, been a hot innovation in the hiring market for quite a long time..Without comprehensive legislation, how the innovation is utilized, and transparency into the research/algorithms that go into these products, are all secretive – and this, despite the way that AI isn't some simple numerical, even-handed set of algorithms..Or maybe, it's been demonstrated to be biased against minorities and ladies, and biased for individuals who resemble the engineers who train the software. Also, shockingly, 14 months back Amazon scoured plans for an AI recruiting engine after its analysts discovered that the tools didn't like ladies..Organizations are selling emotion-detection technologies, especially to law requirement, despite the way that frequently, it doesn't work. One model: AI Now highlighted to research from ProPublica that found that schools, prisons, banks, and emergency clinics have introduced microphones implying to identify stress and aggression before violence ejects. It's not truly dependable. It's been appeared to translate harsh, sharp sounding sounds, for example, coughing to be aggression..Obviously, Illinois is the only state that's passed an enactment that pushes back against the secrecy of AI frameworks, as indicated by AI Now. The Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, scheduled to go live in January 2020, orders that businesses advise job candidates when artificial intelligence is utilized in video meeting, give a clarification of how the AI system functions and what attributes it uses to assess a candidate's fitness for the position, acquire the candidate's consent to be assessed by AI before the video interview begins, limit access to the videos, and annihilate all duplicates of the video inside 30 days of a candidate's request..As more ventures search for approaches to incorporate artificial intelligence, there is a stress that a lot of control and force will be given to these projects, without appropriately surveying the accuracy and worth they bring. On account of affect recognition, it might be troublesome and tedious for human assessment to give feedback and offset, particularly in underfunded public services. This could lead to somebody not finding a new line of work or going to jail on the grounds that an algorithm is recognized as an inappropriate feeling..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Doctors say digital technology and data are driving change that will create a different world of medicine in the next couple of decades, a new report from Stanford Medicine finds.In a survey, physicians, residents and medical students say they expect almost a third of their current duties could be automated in 20 years. And doctors are preparing for that very different healthcare future now, according to the report (PDF).Nearly half of physicians (73%) and most medical students (73%) are seeking additional training in areas such as advanced statistics, genetic counseling, population health and coding. One-third are studying artificial intelligence, according to the national survey of more than 700 physicians, residents and medical students commissioned by Stanford Medicine to understand how changing trends will reach the doctor’s office and shape patient care.RELATED: What the trends at CES 2020 could mean for the future of digital health""We found that current and future physicians are not only open to new technologies but are actively seeking training in subjects such as data science to enhance care for their patients,"" said Lloyd Minor, M.D., dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in a statement.""We are encouraged by these findings and the opportunity they present to improve patient outcomes. At the same time, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges that may stymie progress,” he said.RELATED: Meet Ballie, Samsung's new AI-powered robot execs call the 'next evolution of wellness'Key trends that are reshaping healthcare include a maturing digital health market, new health laws opening patient access to data and AI gaining regulatory traction for medical use.And the jury’s still out when it comes to whether the private industry’s foray into healthcare—in the form of companies such as Amazon, Google and Apple— will solve problems.Physicians, residents and students had mixed views about the impact these companies will have on healthcare, with 30% of students and residents and 21% of physicians still undecided. While patient outcomes are likely to improve, respondents are divided on whether physician effectiveness will improve and say physician job satisfaction will likely decrease, while healthcare costs likely increase.Other findings include:The value of data. The survey also showed that providers are heavy digital users and they believe patient data from wearables can be clinically valuable. Nearly half the survey respondents wear a health monitoring device, and most of them use the data to inform their personal healthcare decisions (71% of physicians, 60% of students and residents). A majority of students and residents (78%) and physicians (80%) say self-reported data from a patient’s health app would be clinically valuable in supporting their care. They also see value in data from consumer genetic testing reports.RELATED: Study—Google AI can outdo the experts in finding breast cancerDoctors aren’t prepared to implement innovations. However, most providers don’t believe the current generation of practitioners is ready for the data-driven future, even current medical students and residents. When asked to rate the effectiveness of their education to prepare them for these developments, only 18% of current medical students and residents surveyed said that their education was “very helpful.” And 44% of physicians surveyed said their education was either “not very helpful” or “not helpful at all.”The report pointed to the need to modernize curriculum and training programs so current and future physicians can make the most of new technologies.The ongoing struggle with medical practice burdens. And, no surprise, physicians and residents say they are struggling under medical practice burdens. Nearly 1 in 5 would change their career path if given the opportunity, citing poor work-life balance and administrative burdens as the top reasons to reconsider their decision.

From the first striking of stones to produce fire to the making of metal works, man has struggled to tame technology or machine (Artificial Intelligence), if you please.

The invention of the computer only served to bring the battle closer home. There has always been the fear that one day the computer (machines) would among other things, take jobs, change the world and maybe even take over the world and rule man.

This fear has persisted.

A deep and often unspoken fear is that <em>the end is near when machines begin to think</em>. And thinking machines is precisely what artificial intelligence (AI) is all about. The emergence of thinking computers therefore only served to heighten that fear.

Consider when the World chess champion, Garry Kasparov, faced the first thinking machine, an IBM supercomputer called <em>Deep Blue</em>. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and won by Kasparov. The rematch was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue. The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions. When Deep Blue took the match by winning the final game, Kasparov refused to believe it.

It was an epic moment. It sent shock waves around the world. Naturally, there were controversies. Some argued that everything was done to make the battleground comfortable for the machine, it was chilled to, like we say in Nigeria, mortuary temperature.

The truth be told, computer scientists had for decades viewed chess as a meter stick for artificial intelligence. Garry’s defeat, in many circles, meant that humans were entering the age of the machines.

Since that time, so much has happened. Computers have since grown so much more powerful. In fact, today, we have apps on our mobile phones that are far more powerful than Deep Blue. Thinking computers are everywhere. Welcome the age of Artificial Intelligence!

To understand what AI is and how it works, let’s hear the experts:

“AI is the use of intricate logic or advanced analytical methods to perform simple tasks at greater scale in ways that mean we can do more at large scale with the workers we have, allowing them to focus on what humans are best at, like handling complex exceptions or demonstrating sympathy.” <em>–Whit Andrews, vice president and distinguished analyst with Gartner Research</em>

“AI is a mathematical and algorithmic model that allows computers to learn to do tasks without being explicitly programmed to do those tasks.” <em>–Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/computing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>College of Computing at Michigan Technological University</em></a><em> and director of the </em><a href=""http://mtu.edu/icc""><em>Institute of Computing and Cybersystems</em></a><em>.</em>

Today, AI is becoming more pervasive. It is already in use in several sectors, particularly the financial service and marketing spheres. Reports indicate that the demand for AI-enabled initiatives would continue to increase in the coming days.

It is interesting to note that AI is rapidly making its way into the workplace. Today it touches customer care, staff recruitment and consumer insights and marketing. Tomorrow, it would reach and cover more business segments.

In spite of this, mentioning AI in the workplace still produces fear – particularly for job security. Until recently, people predicted that the automation brought by AI would render many job functions redundant. Currently, thankfully, the fear that AI will lead to redundancy has reduced with experts re-evaluating their perspective.

The truth is that AI is not replacing jobs. On the contrary, reports show that it is targeting specific tasks, improving and making them easier and faster. According to PWC, “72% of business decision-makers consider AI as a key tool for allowing humans to focus on more meaningful work.” Precisely!

So, while AI will eliminate certain types of job, it would create others. It will limit some functions, expand others and definitely restructure some industries and realign others. Overall, there would be net job gain.

AI will bring good and bad. Individuals and businesses must explore how they can use it for good. Take advantage of its potential to improve productivity, boost capacity and increase revenue.

As Red Hat technologist Gordon Haff wrote, “AI projects in the past have often tried to boil the ocean - to solve multi-faceted problems like self-driving cars. Today’s enterprise AI projects are more practical, often focusing on customer experience pain points. “What’s happening with AI today is exciting in part because it involves practical solutions that address complexity, the need to handle more and more data, and demanding customers,” Haff noted.

Evidently, the use of AI in business will continue to grow. In its current iteration, AI is significantly more practical, more useful, and more impactful. Its definition as the technology that allows computers to do things that were once only the domain of humans, is proving truer each day. For example, computers have always been able to calculate, today, with AI, they can learn and draw conclusions.

AI is essentially a thinking machine. It thinks by learning and making deductions from the data available to it

To work, AI needs data. It consumes data in order to learn. Big data refers to the massive sets of data that are now available and to all intents and purposes suited for this purpose. These sets of data can be analyzed by machines. This can reveal patterns and trends, and facilitate making future predictions. With big data, AI is in its element.

It is no surprise therefore that AI and <a href=""https://www.brandcrunch.com.ng/2017/04/21/use-big-data-drive-smart-business-decision-making/"">Big Data</a> are already driving the provision of new, innovative and efficient services, particularly in the financial sector.

In Nigeria, some fintechs are already adopting AI and Big Data. Take Renmoney. With AI and big data, it has unprecedented customer insight so that it is able to assess and disburse loans much faster, deliver incredible and efficient customer experience and indeed broaden the scope of its operations.

In adopting AI, firms demonstrate their commitment to executing what is truly a data-driven strategy. AI will enable organisations to make optimal use of data. In the age of social media, data is everywhere. To be able to gather and harness it would be tremendous. AI is helping to create the business of the future.

The rapid growth in artificial intelligence in Japan

January 17, 2020 



 




© Blackboard373 | 
Agnieszka Kuczynska from EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation, details the current rapid growth in artificial intelligence in Japan
Current rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI) is fuelled predominantly by the rediscovery of deep learning. When it first surfaced 15 years ago, the concept was met with unfavourable conditions and largely abandoned in the aftermath. Nowadays, deep learning is back, circumstances are right and the field flourishes.
The described third boom in artificial AI and subsequent tightening technological and economic competition sent ripples through various aspects of the social realm, including policymaking. Many countries began working on national AI strategies, including current leaders – China and U.S. – and Japan also followed suit.
Society 5.0.
However, what distinguishes Japan from other countries is a consistent concept underlying all introduced regulation – the vision of Society 5.0. This new form of society is saturated with AI-related technology, which not only improves the lives of its members, but also creates new aspects and new values. Individual needs are met in a timely and proportionate manner allowing for fulfilled and contented lives. With society 5.0 as a targeted outcome, the recently updated AI Strategy 2019 contains a wide spectrum of necessary actions comprising both facilitating the development of AI and utilising it for the advancement of industry and society.
The strength of the strategy lies in its emphasis on the practical application of AI, Japanese policymakers correctly recognised the versatility of AI and its potential to pervade and transform any given field, employing it to improve and lower costs of various processes, perform tasks beyond human capabilities and gain insight where human-operated analysis didn’t reach.
The strategy aims not only to improve situation on a national level, targeting five designated priority areas (manufacturing, transportation and logistics, health and medical care, agriculture and disaster response) but also globally – by helping solve major societal problems like ageing society or labour shortage, diversification of energy sources, GHG reduction or more efficient waste management, which lines up perfectly with achieving Sustainable Development Goals. According to the strategy, the solutions developed in Japan would then be made available for the world and if realised successfully, it might just be the advantage that Japan needs to win over its competitors.
Still, reaching the targets mentioned above requires major efforts in at least three vital areas: R&D, data and human resources.
At the moment, Japan along with the rest of the world struggles with a lack of educated professionals capable of handling AI-related technologies. The short-term relief could be brought by encouraging more women to participate in the job market and attracting skilled resources form overseas. In the long-term perspective, Japan is preparing for major educational system reform, introducing AI into curricula and making it obligatory part of the university entrance exam, creating a learning inducive environment for students (sufficient network infrastructure and access to communication devices) and facilitating lifelong learning for the existing workforce.
Data
Recognising data as the sine qua non for the development of AI, the Japanese Government is making considerable effort to facilitate data circulation while maintaining its quality. Notable examples include The Basic Act on the Advancement of Utilising Public and Private Sector Data and The Act on the Protection of Personal Information. It is also worth mentioning, that all the practical applications of AI planned in the new AI Strategy are designed as two-way data flows – one direction is technology and data deployment into the industry area and the other is the data gathered from users feeding further development of AI. To organise and structure the exchange, the Japanese Government plans to construct a data linkage infrastructure.
R&D programmes
Finally, a lot of effort is also directed at the R&D area, with establishing a network of centres of excellence as the first step. In the search for disruptive innovation, the Japanese Government initiated many R&D programmes, the last of which – Moonshot R&D – positively surprises with scale and forwardness and also offers many opportunities for international collaboration for European partners.
Japan and EU
Japan certainly seems determined to embrace and take advantage of AI’s potential in transforming its own society and reinforcing its global position. It would, therefore, be beneficial for European companies to closely follow Japan’s next movements, as the two have a lot in common. With a shared approach to technology and related values (confirmed recently by the European Union’s (EU) welcoming Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI) and common rivals, Japan and EU are natural allies and its high time to capitalise on cooperation potential.

He has held policy roles in the Blair and Cameron governments. His new book, A World Without Work, explores how society should respond to the increasing automation of employment.This isn’t an unexplored topic, so why did you write this book? 
 My view is that this is one of the greatest questions of our time. And in spite of everything that has been written, I didn’t feel like we had done the question justice. I don’t think we’re taking seriously this idea that there might not be enough well-paid work for everyone to do because of technological advances that are taking place.Is that partly because of the way the question is framed, that “robots are stealing our jobs” when that’s not how these changes are happening? 
 Yes. There are two mistakes there. One is the sort of anthropomorphisation of technology – these robots exist but they are often gimmicks. The technologies that are really very powerful don’t look, think or reason like us. The second mistake is to think of entire jobs being replaced. These technologies tend to displace people from tasks – what I call task encroachment.Many of the boundaries economists and computer scientists developed in the second part of the 20th century for thinking about what machines could and couldn’t do have been crossed. For example, driving a car, making a medical diagnosis or identifying a bird from a fleeting glimpse. All these tasks can be accomplished by software now.And machines are often performing these tasks using strategies that are new to humans?
 We thought many of these tasks would be difficult to automate because humans couldn’t articulate how they performed them. They relied on experience, intuition and gut reaction – so how could you write a set of instructions for a computer to follow? But by using lots of data and computing power, machines are creating new strategies.In the light of this technological change, what career path would you advise a 16-year-old to follow? 
 Very crudely, I’d say, there are two strategies: either you learn to be good at the sorts of things these systems and machines cannot do or you try to build the machines.But forecasting which jobs and tasks will be automated is hard. Should people bother training to be doctors or lawyers when automation is already encroaching on these careers? 
 For young professionals, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, I say the best thing to do is pursue the traditional path. But be far more agnostic and open minded along the way about opportunities that come up. Because what’s interesting is that if you look at these technologies – take the systems developed by DeepMind or the ones that recognise melanomas by Sebastian Thrun’s team at Stanford – these teams contain lots of domain experts, such as trained doctors.Technological unemployment appears be growing alongside rising inequality – is there a direct relationship between the two? 
 Work is our traditional way of distributing income, so one of the great challenges of a world with less work is how we slice up the pie. The labour share of income is falling in many parts of the developed world.Should robots be taxed and that money funnelled back to the victims of automation? 
 There are various problems with this idea. What do we mean by a robot? A driverless car isn’t driven by an android. How do we do a robot headcount? We do need to tax capital, the owners – however that has a branding problem.But the owners of the these technologies are often quite good at avoiding tax. 
 If the trends in inequality continue, focusing on how we resolve that problem is going to become more pertinent.You advance the idea of a “conditional” universal basic income. 
 I think the challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarity. At the moment, that comes from a sense that everyone is paying into the collective economic pot through their taxes or, if they’re not in work, they are actively looking for work or training for work.I think one of the problems of a universal basic income [a payment made to the entire population regardless of employment status] is that too many people take offence at the idea that you give something and don’t expect anything in return.But perhaps we can introduce conditions to a UBI, for example that you undertake some valuable voluntary work in return. There are something like 15 million people doing a hugely valuable set of voluntary activities in the UK – why not recognise that? The UBI solves the distribution problem – how do you share income if the labour market doesn’t do it very well? – and if everyone is contributing, some in economic and others in non-economic ways, that may solve the we’re-all-in-it-together problem.The challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarityVolunteering requires empathy and hands-on skills that computers find hard and such activities are not rewarded very well. 
 There is a paradox. Machines can’t do them and they tend to be unpaid by the market. There’s this huge gap between the social value of a lot of this work and the value that’s recognised in the market. So one of the reasons for optimism is that there’s an opportunity to potentially address that.Work not only gives people income, but often gives meaning and identity. How can people get meaning from more leisure? 
 If we think the relationship between work and meaning is very tight, the alternative might be not to think of this as being about the future of work, but the future of leisure. You know, we have labour-market policies to shape how people live their working lives. Maybe we also need leisure policies to shape how people spend their spare time. We already have a pension system that is a heavily subsidised leisure policy of sorts.You’ve worked in government. Is automation a priority for politicians or are they reluctant to address things that may only pay off long after they have been voted out? 
 Almost every government in the developed world has published some kind of AI strategy in the last few years. Whether or not they’re then following that strategy is less clear.You have to explain that this is not a story about the future – this is happening now. Every day, we hear stories of these technologies, driving cars, making medical diagnoses, drafting legal documents, designing buildings – this is something that is happening now; it’s not in the future. It is closely linked to the inequalities we see emerging. It tends not to be acted upon because it’s thought to be something that doesn’t really matter, but it does.

One of the biggest trends at CES 2020 was Artificial Intelligence or AI. Advances in this type of technology have truly changed the way consumers use many devices in a relatively short period. And we’ve only just begun to discover the potential of what it can do. But what is AI exactly?


For those relatively unfamiliar with this technology, it can't be defined in the same way Bluetooth can be, for example. According to Dr. Mark van Rijmenam, who is the founder of Datafloq and author of The Organisation of Tomorrow, AI is an umbrella term that covers multiple disciplines. “When we look at artificial intelligence, it can be divided into three different domains,” he tells me. 

The first domain is robotics, which deals with the physical world and how it can directly interact with humans. “Robotics can be used to improve our work in various ways, including Ford’s exoskeleton or Boston Dynamics’ helping robots,” he says.

PROMOTED
The second discipline is cognitive systems, which concern the human world such as chatbots. “Chatbots are a very tangible example where humans and machines work together to achieve a goal. A chatbot is a communication interface that helps individuals and organizations have conversations,"" Dr. van Rijmenam explains.  

The third is machine learning, which connects how we get information. “Machines use data to learn, and machine learning aims to derive meaning from that data and uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve with machines. A subset of machine learning is deep learning, which enables multi-layer neural networks.""

AI seamlessly integrates these three types of learning. While smart technology was a hallmark of the previous decade, AI will take smart home products to an entirely new level in the 2020s, changing lives in a way that the average consumer may not even be able to imagine.

This type of innovation doesn't necessarily concern how users interact with products (such as with Google Home and Alexa) so much as how products interact with us. Advanced machine learning works “behind the scenes” in a way that goes beyond improved user experience. It has the potential to truly change lives and we the way complete daily tasks.

LG, which had one of the largest presences at CES, demonstrated how they are using this groundbreaking technology at the event, winning multiple awards for their innovations. 
Proactive Customer Service
Installing and maintaining new appliances can be a frustrating experience for many people. LG's proactive customer service uses artificial intelligence in smart appliance models for a variety of purposes. It starts after connecting an appliance to the brand’s ThinQ mobile app by letting the user know that installation has been properly completed.
AI can also notify users when problems occur—before they become worse. For example, it will sense errors such as a decrease in the cooling performance of a refrigerator or a reduction of airflow in a dryer vent. These are issues that humans may not notice on their own until it is too late, ultimately shortening the lifespan of the appliance.  
Depending on the issue, this technology can provide solutions like quick fixes consumers can make on their own or schedule an appointment with a service professional to expedite a repair. 
Another example of what LG's AI can do is send routine maintenance reminders like running a tub clean cycle every 30 washes or replacing a water filter in the refrigerator when needed. 
AI can also have a larger impact on the environment. For example, if it detects an increase in water consumption, it will share tips with the users about how to improve the efficiency of their machines. 
LG TurboWash 360 Washer and Dryer 
One of many LG products that stood out at CES is the LG TurboWash 360, which won the coveted 2020 Innovation Award. This appliance is one of the strongest examples of how artificial intelligence can change the way we complete tasks. 
The front-loading washing machine is designed to deliver precision washing without any human guesswork. Anyone who has overanalyzed the difference between laundry cycles (and still regretted it ten minutes into pressing the start button) will appreciate how game-changing this appliance is. 
Sensors detect the volume and weight of each unique load of laundry. Then they identify the fabric types in each load. Through the use of deep learning technology, the washer then compares this information against more than 20k different data points. It uses the information to select the optimal wash cycle for each load.
After detecting a mixed load of t-shirts and pants, for example, the wash cycle is then programmed with customized motions, temperatures and times. For a load containing towels and sheets, the washing machine would run an entirely different program. This goes way beyond the normal cycle choices such as delicate, heavy, casual, etc. 
How AI Can Save Cash And Help The Environment 
LG shares that this technology can extend the life of a garment by as much as 15%. This not only saves consumers money, but also reduces the impact of textile and garment waste on the environment. 
Another useful feature of this washing machine is that it automatically dispenses the proper amount of detergent and fabric softener for every single load. While this means the inconvenience of pouring liquid from a large, heavy bottle into a tiny cup is no longer a way of life, the advances of LG's artificial intelligence goes way beyond a minor annoyance of life. Many people do not realize that using the wrong amount of detergent decreases the life of fabrics and appliances because an extra or extended rinse cycle may be needed to get rid of all the suds. Those cycles can really add up over time.
So, the life cycles of both textiles and appliances can be extended through AI technology. Money is also saved on the cost of soap and the energy used to run unnecessary cycles on the washing machine. This ultimately means a long term win for sustainability and how consumer habits impact the environment.

One of the trends that came into sharp focus in 2019 was, ironically, a woeful lack of clarity around AI ethics. The AI field at large was paying attention to ethics, creating and applying frameworks for AI research, development, policy, and law, but there was no unified approach. The committees and groups, from every sort of organization related to AI, that sought to address AI ethics were coming up with their own definitions (or falling apart with nothing to show for their efforts). But working out ethics in AI is not just a feel-good endeavor — it’s critical to helping lawmakers create just policies and laws and guiding the work of scholars and researchers. It also helps businesses stay in compliance and avoid costly pitfalls, know where they should and should not invest their resources, and how to apply AI to their products and services. Which is to say, there’s a profound humanity to it all.
Even as the AI field continues to refine and work out ethics approaches, a report out of Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center sought to extract consensus, if not clarity: The work, titled “Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for Ai,” is a meta analysis of numerous AI ethics frameworks and sets of principles. The authors wanted to distill the noise down to a set of generally agreed-upon AI ethics principles. (To oversimplify: It’s a sort of Venn diagram.)

Handling Today’s Threatscape at Machine Scale



The authors, led by Jessica Fjeld, who is the assistant director of the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center, laid out their approach in the document: “Alongside the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, we have witnessed a proliferation of ‘principles’ documents aimed at providing normative guidance regarding AI-based systems. Our desire for a way to compare these documents — and the individual principles they contain — side by side, to assess them and identify trends, and to uncover the hidden momentum in a fractured, global conversation around the future of AI, resulted in this white paper and the associated data visualization.”
They looked at 36 “prominent AI principles documents,” from global sources and a diversity of types of organizations, to find the common themes and values therein. They found eight key themes:

Privacy
Accountability
Safety and security
Transparency and explainability
Fairness and non-discrimination
Human control of technology
Professional responsibility
Promotion of human values
advertisement
Those are broad strokes, to be sure, and each begs for qualification. The authors do just that over the course of dozens of detailed and fascinating pages, and in brief, in Fjeld’s concise Twitter thread.
They also produced a large and detailed visualization — a map — of the themes they found, the frequency of the respective mentions of those themes, and the sources that the authors pulled from. In that map, you can see a further breakdown of the keywords under each of the eight themes.
For example, under “Promotion of Human Values” — a rather vague “key theme” — the map lists “leveraged to benefit society,” “human values and human flourishing,” and “access to technology.” That last one, especially, probably resonates with the average person, doesn’t it? And it’s a powerful point: The field of AI apparently believes that giving people access to this powerful new set of technologies is a human value, and moreover, a human value that is explicitly and widely laid out as a matter of documented principle.advertisement
Humanity was at the center of much of their findings, actually, especially with a prominent emphasis on international human rights. The paper reads, “64% of our documents contained a reference to human rights, and five documents [14%] took international human rights as a framework for their overall effort.”
Notably, the documents from civil society groups (four out of five) and private sector groups (seven out of eight) were most likely to reference human rights. That’s encouraging, because it indicates that private sector groups aren’t focused, at least on paper, exclusively on profits, but on the larger picture of AI and its impact. Less encouraging is that less than half of the documents from government agencies (six out of 13) references human rights. It appears that there’s advocacy work yet to be done at the government level.
Aside from the identification of those core eight themes, the authors noted that the documents they looked at that were most likely to hit not just some, but all eight, of those themes, were also likely to be more recent. That fact, they wrote, suggests “that the conversation around principled AI is beginning to converge, at least among the communities responsible for the development of these documents.”advertisement
The report is meant to be an examination of what already exists more than an articulation of any particular viewpoint, but the authors included a plea to those in AI who are charged with crafting and implementing AI ethics principles:
“Moreover, principles are a starting place for governance, not an end. On its own, a set of principles is unlikely to be more than gently persuasive. Its impact is likely to depend on how it is embedded in a larger governance ecosystem, including for instance relevant policies (e.g. AI national plans), laws, regulations, but also professional practices and everyday routines.”

Google CEO calls for regulatory approach to artificial intelligence

Google CEO Sundar Pichai wants international standards for artificial intelligence tech that consider an ethical approach on top of what various AI researchers are doing. (Google) 
Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently called for an international regulatory approach to artificial intelligence technology in an op-ed published in the Financial Times.“Now there is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated,” he wrote. “It is too important not to. The only question is how to approach it.”He said that government regulation should come in addition to ethical development principles within technology companies, citing Google’s own efforts that include conducting independent human-rights assessments of new products. Noting that the EU and the US are already starting to develop regulatory proposals, he called for international alignment of such regulations built upon an agreement on core values. “Companies such as ours cannot just build promising new technology and let market forces decide how it will be used,” he wrote. “It is equally incumbent on us to make sure that technology is harnessed for good and available to everyone.”Pichai also ticked off a few ethical concerns with AI that have been raised by others, including deepfakes and “nefarious uses of facial recognition.” While work is being done to address such concerns, he added, “there will inevitably be more challenges ahead that no company or industry can solve alone.”Tesla’s Elon Musk and other tech luminaries have been worrying publicly for years about unbridled AI and its negative consequences, but Pichai’s commentary takes the discussion to another level by calling for regulatory involvement. Pichai doesn’t describe any regulations specifically needed, but does mention that the European General Data Protection Regulation can serve as a strong foundation. He added that good regulations will consider safety, explainability, fairness and accountability. “Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms, especially in high-risk areas, with social opportunities,” Pichai wrote.Pichai’s commentary also gave him a chance to tout Google’s work in AI, including helping doctors spot breast cancer in mammograms with higher accuracy. That work was published in Nature on Jan. 1 and involved Google, Northwestern Medicine and two screening centers in the UK.That research team used mammograms along with follow-up exams to train a deep-learning AI model to identify breast cancer in screening images. The findings showed an absolute reduction in false negatives of up to 9% and a reduction in false positives of up to 5%. Similar studies have used AI training to spot lung cancers.In addition to deep-learning software, Google is one of several large technology companies building AI hardware at the chip level. In 2019, Google Cloud offered the ability to link together its Tensor Processing Unit chips with liquid cooling for faster performance in the training phase of AI systems.Other companies that are building AI chips or augmenting existing chips include Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple. Tesla is building Model S, X and 3 cars with its own AI processor for self-driving capabilities. AI inference work can happen in edge devices with some of these chips, but AI training usually involves massive systems found in cloud companies like Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft.Pichai's commentary comes at a time when U.S. lawmakers and federal authorities are scrutinizing the activities of major tech companies like Facebook and Youtube, especially for how their social engagement platforms shape public opinion. RELATED: Intel forges leading role in emerging AI revolution

It certainly is. Today, artificial intelligence offers a solution to solve or at least make the access-to-justice issue better and completely transform our traditional legal system. Here's what you need to know about how AI, big data, and online courts will change the legal system.

The Future of Law

When I sat down in conversation with Richard Susskind, OBE, the world's most-cited author on the future of legal services, to discuss the future of law and lawyers, it became apparent just how much change the legal system will face over the next decade thanks to innovation brought about by artificial intelligence and big data.

In Richard’s book The Future of Law, published in 1996, he predicted that in the future, lawyers and clients would communicate via email. This revelation was shocking at the time, especially to those working in the legal system; however, transmitting communication via email is now commonplace for lawyers and their clients. This story gives insight into the challenges faced in bringing the traditionally conservative legal system into the 21st century.

PROMOTED
In his brand new book Online Courts and the Future of Justice, Richard argues that technology is going to bring about a fascinating decade of change in the legal sector and transform our court system. Although automating our old ways of working plays a part in this, even more, critical is that artificial intelligence and technology will help give more individuals access to justice.
Our current access-to-justice problem, even in what are typically thought of as mature systems, is significant. In fact, only about 46% of people have access to the legal system. There are unimaginable backlogs in some court systems. For most of us, litigation takes too much time and money. We can use technology to help with this issue and make court a service rather than a place as we move legal resolution online.

Some of the technologies that would allow this transition are quite basic.
The first generation is the idea that people who use the court system submit evidence and arguments to the judge online or through some form of electronic communication. Essentially judgments move from the courtroom to online. In a digital society, we should certainly be able to institute extended courts where we go beyond decisions made by judges to some kind of diagnostic system to guide people regarding their legal options, how to assemble evidence, and provide alternative ways for dispute resolution.

The second generation of using technology to transform the legal system would be what Richard calls “outcome thinking” to use technology to help solve disputes without requiring lawyers or the traditional court system. It is entirely conceivable within a relatively small number of years that we will have systems that can predict the outcomes of court decisions based on past decisions by using predictive analytics. Imagine if people had the option instead of waiting for a court date (and support from the traditional legal system) to use a machine-learning system to make a prediction about the likely outcome of a case and then accept that as a binding determination.

Some of the biggest obstacles to an online court system are the political will to bring about such a transformation, the support of judges and lawyers, funding, as well as the method we’d apply. For example, decisions will need to be made whether the online system would be used for only certain cases or situations.
Ultimately, we have a grave access-to-justice problem. Technology can help improve our outcomes and give people a way to resolve public disputes in ways that previously weren’t possible. While this transformation might not solve all the struggles with the legal system or the access-to-justice issue, it can offer a dramatic improvement.
The Future of Lawyers
So far, the emphasis on technology in the legal system has been to support lawyers and their staff in some of the work they do, such as email, accounting systems, word processing, and more. Now, we're beginning to see the merits of using technology to automate some tasks such as document analysis or document drafting—essentially moving from the back office to the front office.
One of our biggest struggles in the future of the law profession is law schools because they’re still generating 20th-century lawyers when what we need is 21st-century lawyers to meet the demand of companies and individuals who want a lower-cost legal option that is conveniently available and delivered electronically.
Some legal work can now be done by machines when in the past, this was unthinkable. Large disputes often have a huge number of documents to analyze. Typically, armies of young lawyers and paralegals are put to work to review these documents. A properly trained machine can take over this work. Document drafting by machines is also gaining traction. We also see systems that can predict the outcome of disputes. We're beginning to see machines take on many tasks that we used to think were the exclusive role of lawyers.
Tomorrow's lawyers will be the people who develop the systems that will solve clients' problems. These legal professionals will be legal knowledge engineers, legal risk managers, system development, experts in design thinking, and more. These people will develop new ways of solving legal problems with the support of technology. In many ways, the legal sector is undergoing the digitization that other industries have gone through, and because it's very document-intensive, it's actually an industry poised to benefit greatly from what technology can offer.
Richard believes that in the next decade, machines and lawyers will work alongside each other as well as some jobs being taken over by machines. Eventually, he believes that the legal system and, therefore, a lawyer's job will change because technology is allowing us the ability to solve problems in a new way. For example, in the future, he expects there will be far fewer cases tried in a traditional court, and therefore there will be less need for lawyers who advocate on behalf of clients in a courtroom. Lawyers have a choice to either compete with these systems or help build them. Richard certainly counsels the latter.

Fri, 17 Jan, 2020 - 00:00    Chess teams that pair humans with machines beat humans alone and beat unaccompanied machines. The lesson is that workers should not fear being replaced by technology, says Xavier Litt.While Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg hails artificial intelligence’s “potential to make the world better”, many others are far more cautious.Tesla boss Elon Musk has warned against machines taking over the world. Reluctance to technical progress is not a new phenomenon.In 19th century Britain, the Luddites, worried about being replaced by technology, sought to destroy textile machinery.The fear persists, all the more since AI is improving by the day, including at tasks previously thought of as exclusive to human intelligence.

In 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue spectacularly defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov for the first time.Many commentators were shocked by the prowess of AI in a strategy game often referred to as the ‘king of games’.AI has moved beyond being a super calculator and most advanced machines will be prominent in strategic thinking and creativity.While many people worry about being overtakenby some form of Skynet, the artificial intelligence defence system from the Terminator film franchise, the last 20 years of computer usage in the game of chess actually suggests the future could be a lot more positive.Chess was one of the first areas tackled by AI, making it an interesting case study. In hindsight, AI brought chess and its human players to previously unattainable heights.Advanced chess computers helped humans improve their own skills. Nowadays, top chess players spend most of their time analysing the game via computers.AI can be used to re-evaluate positions that were previously misunderstood or to rule out moves that are inefficient and focus, instead, on more promising game plans.This evolution occurred despite critics lamenting the end of chess when the machines first defeated man in 1997.Though it was feared at the time, chess players have not given up on the game.

They trained harder and became stronger than players of the past. Rather than competing against AI, chess players utilised it.The benefit of teaming up with AI is illustrated by a new game mode, cyborg chess.It is named after the cybernetic organism, an entity with both organic and mechanical body parts.As in a typical chess match, the human players face each other across a chessboard, but in cyborg chess they also each have a computer, running chess engines.While AI is superior to the human brain in a one-to-one chess contest, human players still contribute to the team.Humans may let the machines make most of the calculations, but, ultimately, they have their own understanding of the game.In some situations, human players make better decisions than machines, and successful cyborg chess players know when they can let the machine decide on the move to play, and when they shouldn’t.Hence, the best cyborg chess team is higher ranked than the best chess engine. This means that the association of human intelligence and AI outperforms stand-alone AI.Another crucial teaching of cyborg chess is that there is a specific skill set for collaboration with AI.The ability to work efficiently with AI matters more for cyborg chess players than their standalone strength in chess. Several cyborg chess competitions were not won by the strongest attending chess players.For instance, in the PAL/CSS Freestyle Tournament in 2005, three chess grandmasters could notdefeat the team Zacks, comprised of two average club players using less powerful AI than the grandmasters.

However, the latter were extremely well-prepared. They had trained extensively with several chess engines and had selected the one they understood the most.In a one-to-one game againsta grandmaster, these two amateurs would have less than 1% chance of winning.Hence, this stunning performance suggests that although mastering chess is a valuable skill for cyborg chess, it is not the main skill.Instead, fruitful collaboration with AI is the key skill.This example teaches us that humans and machines have complementary capabilities.Machines supervised by humans are often capable of doing more than machines or humans on their own.This is becoming common in many fields: plane pilots assisted with auto-pilot programmes, computer-assisted surgeons for complex surgeries, and many others.AI will increasingly be used in the near future and automated tasks will bring forth new jobs.A recent study of the Institute for the Future and Dell Technologies states that 85% of jobs that will be occupied in 2030 do not exist yet; just as countless jobs that exist today were unimaginable 20 years ago.These new jobs will most certainly revolve around this specific human-machine collaboration skill.Since machines first defeated humans 20 years ago, the evolution of chess suggests that AI need not be feared; it can be embraced and pave the way for continuous improvement in all fields.The key is to switch from competition to collaboration with AI. Businesses should neither turn away from AI nor simply replace employees with machines.Success will come from creating adapted teams of men and machines working together.We humans should primarily focus on improving our understanding of AI by honing our human-machine collaboration skills.Xavier Litt is chief executive of Skylads, an AI-driven, digital marketing research lab and technology provider

By Jyothi NayakTo err is human &ndash; but just how true is this in the case of subtitling and captioning?Recently a friend of mine asked me why we don&rsquo;t use automatic subtitling tools. Little did she know how excited I was when I heard about these tools a couple of years ago! After all, wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to get machines to do all the hard work while we humans multi-task? Let&rsquo;s take a step back and use a real-life scenario to analyze this. Platforms like YouTube have for long offered automatic captions for videos, but they are notorious for delivering sentences studded with nonsensical or occasionally obscene phrases. For hearing impaired viewers, however, this is no laughing matter, as they often depend on subtitles to decipher spoken words within a video. To address this issue, social media campaigns like #NoMoreCRAPtions have emerged which focus on ditching automatic captions.This article is all about how subtitling is becoming increasingly relevant today, why it&rsquo;s imperative, and what role technology can play in the evolving industry landscape. A recent study in the UK showed that more than 63% of Gen Z, who are digital natives, end up using subtitles as it not only helps them watch content on-the-move, but also aids in better comprehension. Jyothi Nayak

Subtitles have indeed come a long way since they first made an appearance during the silent film era. Subtitling is no longer only for viewers to enjoy foreign language content, or for hearing impaired audiences. They are also becoming extremely useful when showcasing content (like ads, showreels etc.) in public places where the audio is muted. Recent experiments in India and a few other developing countries have proved that Same Language Subtitles (SLS) have improved reading literacy. SLS causes automatic, inescapable reading engagement even among weak readers, and over a period of time has a bigger impact than conventional print media. Even developed countries plan to make SLS a default option for children&rsquo;s content, in order to help young viewers develop reading skills in their early years. As the boom in the subtitling industry fuels new business opportunities, large volumes and tight deadlines are making content creators look towards AI-based solutions. Like most other industries, AI has penetrated the translation and localization space and unlocked exciting possibilities. Today, there are several AI-based solutions that not only understand spoken words and convert them to text, but also translate them to a target language. But the million-dollar question is &ndash; are these machine-generated results as good as human translation? No, not yet! While AI can assist in the overall process of subtitling, actual translation by humans is far more impactful for local audiences, as such translation is creatively generated by native speakers of that language. AI tools, in my view, still have several limitations. When working on genres like mythology or content with considerable background noise, heavy accents and high context content (like sarcasm or humor), the use of AI tools becomes challenging and the results are hard to work with. Within text translations as well, complex sentences can result in gibberish. For example, when translating from Hindi to English, an experienced translator would translate the reference of romantic Indian duo &lsquo;Laila Majnu&rsquo; to &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; &ndash; something a machine would be able to do only after considerable learning. Creativity plays an intrinsic part in translating content and generating impactful subtitles. When it comes to subtitling, the context is as important as the content. While words like mom/mother can be used interchangeably, the usage of mother is more appropriate in the context of a religious mention, which the machine will not be able to decipher automatically. Similarly, there are many common idioms and culture sensitive languages (Arabic for instance) which, when translated literally, yield hilarious and sometimes offensive results! AI tools tend to struggle with unclear contexts, new slangs and specialized subjects that require a lot of research. So, does it mean the world of subtitling will remain human-driven even with the advent of AI? It certainly will not, as machines start learning the nuances and growing intelligence. There are many areas where automation can help reduce manual effort and increase speed right away. Examples include time-code shifting, workflows for Quality Check (QC) and auto check for compliance issues (usage of restricted words etc.) which can creep in through human errors. The good news is that there&rsquo;s no need to follow an &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; approach. You can choose a hybrid workflow where machine transcription takes place first, and QC is performed on this output by native translators, who correct all mistakes (and don&rsquo;t just laugh at them!). These corrections should ideally be fed back to the machine, so that it continues learning and eventually generates better quality subtitles. It also helps to use advanced, end-to-end AI tools that not only create transcripts, but also sync these to the prescribed number of words per second/minute, as well as to the shot boundary. Such tools deliver subtitles that are far more accurate. Another factor to consider is that since most off-the-shelf subtitling tools have several limitations, vendors who deal in large volumes can look at building their own machine learning tools that are trained with past data to fit a particular genre/style of subtitling. This can help you generate high quality results, suited to your specific needs. Alternately, you could even consider using specialized AI tools which go a step further by using the output of multiple best-in-class engines and smartly extract the best from all of these to deliver better results.As you can see, there is a lot of potential for automating the subtitling process, it&rsquo;s just not completely foolproof yet! For now, leveraging an optimal mix of human talent and cutting-edge technology seems to be the best answer. AI-led automation augmented with the creativity of native speakers is the best way to meet the need for speed and volume that the subtitling industry demands today.

Even Artificial Intelligence has not been able to escape the inevitable reduction that follows such excessive hype. AI is everything and everywhere now and most of us won’t even blink if we are told AI is powering someone’s toothbrush. (It probably is).&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The phrase is undoubtedly being misused but is the technology too? One thing is certain, whether we like it or not, whether we understand it or not, for good or bad, AI is playing a huge part in our everyday life today — huger than we imagine. AI is being employed in health, wellness and warfare; it is scrutinizing you, helping you take better photos, making music, books and even love. (No, really. The first fully robotic sex doll is being created even as you are reading this.)&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;However, there is a sore lack of understanding of what AI really is, how it is shaping our future and why it is likely to alter our very psyche sooner or later. There is misinformation galore, of course. Either media coverage of AI is exaggerated (as if androids will take over the world tomorrow) or too specific and technical, creating further confusion and fuelling sci-fi-inspired imaginations of computers smarter than human beings.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;So what is AI? No, we are not talking dictionary definitions here — those you can Google yourself. Neither are we promising to explain everything — that will need a book. We are only hoping to give you a glimpse into the “extraordinary promise and peril of this single transformative technology” as Prof Stuart Russell, one of the world’s pre-eminent AI experts, puts it.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Prof Russell has spent decades on AI research and is the author of ‘Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach’, which is used as a textbook on AI in over 1,400 universities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Other experts believe our understanding of artificial intelligence should begin with comprehending ‘machine learning’, the so-called sub-field of AI but one that actually encompasses pretty much everything that is happening in AI at present.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In its very simplest definition, machine learning is enabling machines to learn on their own. The advantages of this are easy to see. After a while, you need not tell it what to do — it is your workhorse. All you need is to provide it data and it will keep coming up with smarter ways of digesting that data, spotting patterns, creating opportunities — in short doing your work better than you perhaps ever could. This is the point where you need to scratch the surface. Scratch and you will stare into a dissolving ethical conundrum about what machines might end up learning. Because, remember they do not (cannot) explain their thinking process. Not yet, at least.  Precisely why, the professor has a cautionary take.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;“The concept of intelligence is central to who we are. After more than 2,000 years of self-examination, we have arrived at a characterization of intelligence that can be boiled down to this: ‘&lt;em&gt;Humans are intelligent to the extent that our actions can be expected to achieve our objectives&lt;/em&gt;’. Intelligence in machines has been defined in the same way: ‘&lt;em&gt;Machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve their objectives&lt;/em&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whose objectives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The problem, writes the professor, is in this very definition of machine intelligence. “We say that machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve their objectives, but we have no reliable way to make sure that &lt;span class=""italic""&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; objectives are the same as &lt;span class=""italic""&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; objectives.” He believes what we should have done all along is to tweak this definition to: ‘Machines are beneficial to the extent that &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;their&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; actions can be expected to achieve &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; objectives.’”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is of course that our objectives are in us — all eight billion of us — and not in the machines. “Machines will be uncertain about our objectives; after all we are uncertain about them ourselves — but this is a good thing; this is a feature, not a bug. Uncertainty about objectives implies that machines will necessarily defer to humans — they will ask permission, they will accept correction and they will allow themselves to be switched off.”&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p class=""CrossHead""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spilling out of the lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;This might mean a complete rethinking and rebuilding of the AI superstructure. Perhaps something that indeed is inevitable if we do not want this “big event in human history” to be the last, says the prof wryly. As Kai-Fu Lee, another AI researcher, said in an interview a while ago, we are at a moment where the technology is “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Time to strap up then!&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""italic""&gt;(With inputs from ‘Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control’ by Stuart Russell, published by Penguin, UK.

AbstractThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its progressively wider impact on many sectors requires an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects. The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards.

IntroductionThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping an increasing range of sectors. For instance, AI is expected to affect global productivity1, equality and inclusion2, environmental outcomes3, and several other areas, both in the short and long term4. Reported potential impacts of AI indicate both positive5 and negative6 impacts on sustainable development. However, to date, there is no published study systematically assessing the extent to which AI might impact all aspects of sustainable development—defined in this study as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets internationally agreed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development7. This is a critical research gap, as we find that AI may influence the ability to meet all SDGs.Here we present and discuss implications of how AI can either enable or inhibit the delivery of all 17 goals and 169 targets recognized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Relationships were characterized by the methods reported at the end of this study, which can be summarized as a consensus-based expert elicitation process, informed by previous studies aimed at mapping SDGs interlinkages8,9,10. A summary of the results is given in Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Data 1 provides a complete list of all the SDGs and targets, together with the detailed results from this work. Although there is no internationally agreed definition of AI, for this study we considered as AI any software technology with at least one of the following capabilities: perception—including audio, visual, textual, and tactile (e.g., face recognition), decision-making (e.g., medical diagnosis systems), prediction (e.g., weather forecast), automatic knowledge extraction and pattern recognition from data (e.g., discovery of fake news circles in social media), interactive communication (e.g., social robots or chat bots), and logical reasoning (e.g., theory development from premises). This view encompasses a large variety of subfields, including machine learning.Fig. 1: Summary of positive and negative impact of AI on the various SDGs.Documented evidence of the potential of AI acting as (a) an enabler or (b) an inhibitor on each of the SDGs. The numbers inside the colored squares represent each of the SDGs (see the Supplementary Data 1). The percentages on the top indicate the proportion of all targets potentially affected by AI and the ones in the inner circle of the figure correspond to proportions within each SDG. The results corresponding to the three main groups, namely Society, Economy, and Environment, are also shown in the outer circle of the figure. The results obtained when the type of evidence is taken into account are shown by the inner shaded area and the values in brackets.Full size imageDocumented connections between AI and the SDGsOur review of relevant evidence shows that AI may act as an enabler on 134 targets (79%) across all SDGs, generally through a technological improvement, which may allow to overcome certain present limitations. However, 59 targets (35%, also across all SDGs) may experience a negative impact from the development of AI. For the purpose of this study, we divide the SDGs into three categories, according to the three pillars of sustainable development, namely Society, Economy, and Environment11,12 (see the Methods section). This classification allows us to provide an overview of the general areas of influence of AI. In Fig. 1, we also provide the results obtained when weighting how appropriate is the evidence presented in each reference to assess an interlinkage to the percentage of targets assessed, as discussed in the Methods section and below. A detailed assessment of the Society, Economy, and Environment groups, together with illustrative examples, are discussed next.AI and societal outcomesSixty-seven targets (82%) within the Society group could potentially benefit from AI-based technologies (Fig. 2). For instance, in SDG 1 on no poverty, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, and SDG 11 on sustainable cities, AI may act as an enabler for all the targets by supporting the provision of food, health, water, and energy services to the population. It can also underpin low-carbon systems, for instance, by supporting the creation of circular economies and smart cities that efficiently use their resources13,14. For example, AI can enable smart and low-carbon cities encompassing a range of interconnected technologies such as electrical autonomous vehicles and smart appliances that can enable demand response in the electricity sector13,14 (with benefits across SDGs 7, 11, and 13 on climate action). AI can also help to integrate variable renewables by enabling smart grids that partially match electrical demand to times when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing13. Fewer targets in the Society group can be impacted negatively by AI (31 targets, 38%) than the ones with positive impact. However, their consideration is crucial. Many of these relate to how the technological improvements enabled by AI may be implemented in countries with different cultural values and wealth. Advanced AI technology, research, and product design may require massive computational resources only available through large computing centers. These facilities have a very high energy requirement and carbon footprint15. For instance, cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin are globally using as much electricity as some nations’ electrical demand16, compromising outcomes in the SDG 7 sphere, but also on SDG 13 on Climate Action. Some estimates suggest that the total electricity demand of information and communications technologies (ICTs) could require up to 20% of the global electricity demand by 2030, from around 1% today15. Green growth of ICT technology is therefore essential17. More efficient cooling systems for data centers, broader energy efficiency, and renewable-energy usage in ICTs will all play a role in containing the electricity demand growth15. In addition to more efficient and renewable-energy-based data centers, it is essential to embed human knowledge in the development of AI models. Besides the fact that the human brain consumes much less energy than what is used to train AI models, the available knowledge introduced in the model (see, for instance, physics-informed deep learning18) does not need to be learnt through data-intensive training, a fact that may significantly reduce the associated energy consumption. Although AI-enabled technology can act as a catalyst to achieve the 2030 Agenda, it may also trigger inequalities that may act as inhibitors on SDGs 1, 4, and 5. This duality is reflected in target 1.1, as AI can help to identify areas of poverty and foster international action using satellite images5. On the other hand, it may also lead to additional qualification requirements for any job, consequently increasing the inherent inequalities19 and acting as an inhibitor towards the achievement of this target.Fig. 2: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Society group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 16 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). Each block in the diagram represents a target (see the Supplementary Data 1 for additional details on the targets). For targets highlighted in green or orange, we found published evidence that AI could potentially enable or inhibit such target, respectively. The absence of highlighting indicates the absence of identified evidence. It is noteworthy that this does not necessarily imply the absence of a relationship. (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAnother important drawback of AI-based developments is that they are traditionally based on the needs and values of nations in which AI is being developed. If AI technology and big data are used in regions where ethical scrutiny, transparency, and democratic control are lacking, AI might enable nationalism, hate towards minorities, and bias election outcomes20. The term “big nudging” has emerged to represent using big data and AI to exploit psychological weaknesses to steer decisions—creating problems such as damaging social cohesion, democratic principles, and even human rights21. AI has been recently utilized to develop citizen scores, which are used to control social behavior22. This type of score is a clear example of threat to human rights due to AI misuse and one of its biggest problems is the lack of information received by the citizens on the type of analyzed data and the consequences this may have on their lives. It is also important to note that AI technology is unevenly distributed: for instance, complex AI-enhanced agricultural equipment may not be accessible to small farmers and thus produce an increased gap with respect to larger producers in more developed economies23, consequently inhibiting the achievement of some targets of SDG 2 on zero hunger. There is another important shortcoming of AI in the context of SDG 5 on gender equality: there is insufficient research assessing the potential impact of technologies such as smart algorithms, image recognition, or reinforced learning on discrimination against women and minorities. For instance, machine-learning algorithms uncritically trained on regular news articles will inadvertently learn and reproduce the societal biases against women and girls, which are embedded in current languages. Word embeddings, a popular technique in natural language processing, have been found to exacerbate existing gender stereotypes2. In addition to the lack of diversity in datasets, another main issue is the lack of gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the AI workforce24. Diversity is one of the main principles supporting innovation and societal resilience, which will become essential in a society exposed to changes associated to AI development25. Societal resilience is also promoted by decentralization, i.e., by the implementation of AI technologies adapted to the cultural background and the particular needs of different regions.AI and economic outcomesThe technological advantages provided by AI may also have a positive impact on the achievement of a number of SDGs within the Economy group. We have identified benefits from AI on 42 targets (70%) from these SDGs, whereas negative impacts are reported in 20 targets (33%), as shown in Fig. 1. Although Acemoglu and Restrepo1 report a net positive impact of AI-enabled technologies associated to increased productivity, the literature also reflects potential negative impacts mainly related to increased inequalities26,27,28,29. In the context of the Economy group of SDGs, if future markets rely heavily on data analysis and these resources are not equally available in low- and middle- income countries, the economical gap may be significantly increased due to the newly introduced inequalities30,31 significantly impacting SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Brynjolfsson and McAfee31 argue that AI can exacerbate inequality also within nations. By replacing old jobs with ones requiring more skills, technology disproportionately rewards the educated: since the mid 1970s, the salaries in the United States (US) salaries rose about 25% for those with graduate degrees, while the average high-school dropout took a 30% pay cut. Moreover, automation shifts corporate income to those who own companies from those who work there. Such transfer of revenue from workers to investors helps explain why, even though the combined revenues of Detroit's “Big 3” (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) in 1990 were almost identical to those of Silicon Valley's “Big 3” (Google, Apple, and Facebook) in 2014, the latter had 9 times fewer employees and were worth 30 times more on the stock market32. Figure 3 shows an assessment of the documented positive and negative effects on the various targets within the SDGs in the Economy group.Fig. 3: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Economy group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). The interpretation of the blocks and colors is as in Fig. 2.  (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAlthough the identified linkages in the Economy group are mainly positive, trade-offs cannot be neglected. For instance, AI can have a negative effect on social media usage, by showing users content specifically suited to their preconceived ideas. This may lead to political polarization33 and affect social cohesion21 with consequences in the context of SDG 10 on reduced inequalities. On the other hand, AI can help identify sources of inequality and conflict34,35, and therewith potentially reduce inequalities, for instance, by using simulations to assess how virtual societies may respond to changes. However, there is an underlying risk when using AI to evaluate and predict human behavior, which is the inherent bias in the data. It has been reported that a number of discriminatory challenges are faced in the automated targeting of online job advertising using AI35, essentially related to the previous biases in selection processes conducted by human recruiters. The work by Dalenberg35 highlights the need of modifying the data preparation process and explicitly adapting the AI-based algorithms used for selection processes to avoid such biases.AI and environmental outcomesThe last group of SDGs, i.e., the one related to Environment, is analyzed in Fig. 4. The three SDGs in this group are related to climate action, life below water and life on land (SDGs 13, 14, and 15). For the Environment group, we identified 25 targets (93%) for which AI could act as an enabler. Benefits from AI could be derived by the possibility of analyzing large-scale interconnected databases to develop joint actions aimed at preserving the environment. Looking at SDG 13 on climate action, there is evidence that AI advances will support the understanding of climate change and the modeling of its possible impacts. Furthermore, AI will support low-carbon energy systems with high integration of renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are all needed to address climate change13,36,37. AI can also be used to help improve the health of ecosystems. The achievement of target 14.1, calling to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, can benefit from AI through algorithms for automatic identification of possible oil spills38. Another example is target 15.3, which calls for combating desertification and restoring degraded land and soil. According to Mohamadi et al.39, neural networks and objective-oriented techniques can be used to improve the classification of vegetation cover types based on satellite images, with the possibility of processing large amounts of images in a relatively short time. These AI techniques can help to identify desertification trends over large areas, information that is relevant for environmental planning, decision-making, and management to avoid further desertification, or help reverse trends by identifying the major drivers. However, as pointed out above, efforts to achieve SDG 13 on climate action could be undermined by the high-energy needs for AI applications, especially if non carbon-neutral energy sources are used. Furthermore, despite the many examples of how AI is increasingly applied to improve biodiversity monitoring and conservation40, it can be conjectured that an increased access to AI-related information of ecosystems may drive over-exploitation of resources, although such misuse has so far not been sufficiently documented. This aspect is further discussed below, where currently identified gaps in AI research are considered.Fig. 4: Detailed assessment of the impact of AI on the SDGs within the Environment group.Documented evidence of positive or negative impact of AI on the achievement of each of the targets from SDGs 13, 14, and 15 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). The interpretation of the blocks and colors is as in Fig. 2. (The content of of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageAn assessment of the collected evidence on the interlinkagesA deeper analysis of the gathered evidence was undertaken as shown in Fig. 1 (and explained in the Methods section). In practice, each interlinkage was weighted based on the applicability and appropriateness of each of the references to assess a specific interlinkage—and possibly identify research gaps. Although accounting for the type of evidence has a relatively small effect on the positive impacts (we see a reduction of positively affected targets from 79% to 71%), we observe a more significant reduction (from 35% to 23%) in the targets with negative impact of AI. This can be partly due the fact that AI research typically involves quantitative methods that would bias the results towards the positive effects. However, there are some differences across the Society, Economy and Environment spheres. In the Society sphere, when weighting the appropriateness of evidence, positively affected targets diminish by 5 percentage points (p.p.) and negatively affected targets by 13 p.p. In particular, weighting the appropriateness of evidence on negative impacts on SDG 1 (on no poverty) and SDG 6 (on clean water and sanitation) reduces the fraction of affected targets by 43 p.p. and 35 p.p., respectively. In the Economy group instead, positive impacts are reduced more (15 p.p.) than negative ones (10 p.p.) when taking into account the appropriateness of the found evidence to speak of the issues. This can be related to the extensive study in literature assessing the displacement of jobs due to AI (because of clear policy and societal concerns), but overall the longer-term benefits of AI on the economy are perhaps not so extensively characterized by currently available methods. Finally, although the weighting of evidence decreases the positive impacts of AI on the Environment group only by 8 p.p., the negative impacts see the largest average reduction (18 p.p.). This is explained by the fact that, although there are some indications of the potential negative impact of AI on this SDG, there is no strong evidence (in any of the targets) supporting this claim, and therefore this is a relevant area for future research.In general, the fact that the evidence on interlinkages between AI and the large majority of targets is not based on tailored analyses and tools to refer to that particular issue provides a strong rationale to address a number of research gaps, which are identified and listed in the section below.Research gaps on the role of AI in sustainable developmentThe more we enable SDGs by deploying AI applications, from autonomous vehicles41 to AI-powered healthcare solutions42 and smart electrical grids13, the more important it becomes to invest in the AI safety research needed to keep these systems robust and beneficial, so as to prevent them from malfunctioning, or from getting hacked43. A crucial research venue for a safe integration of AI is understanding catastrophes, which can be enabled by a systemic fault in AI technology. For instance, a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) report raises such a concern due to the integration of AI in the financial sector44. It is therefore very important to raise awareness on the risks associated to possible failures of AI systems in a society progressively more dependent on this technology. Furthermore, although we were able to find numerous studies suggesting that AI can potentially serve as an enabler for many SDG targets and indicators, a significant fraction of these studies have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments, based on limited datasets or using prototypes45,46,47. Hence, extrapolating this information to evaluate the real-world effects often remains a challenge. This is particularly true when measuring the impact of AI across broader scales, both temporally and spatially. We acknowledge that conducting controlled experimental trials for evaluating real-world impacts of AI can result in depicting a snapshot situation, where AI tools are tailored towards that specific environment. However, as society is constantly changing (also due to factors including non-AI-based technological advances), the requirements set for AI are changing as well, resulting in a feedback loop with interactions between society and AI. Another underemphasized aspect in existing literature is the resilience of the society towards AI-enabled changes. Therefore, novel methodologies are required to ensure that the impact of new technologies are assessed from the points of view of efficiency, ethics, and sustainability, prior to launching large-scale AI deployments. In this sense, research aimed at obtaining insight on the reasons for failure of AI systems, introducing combined human–machine analysis tools48, are an essential step towards accountable AI technology, given the large risk associated to such a failure.Although we found more published evidence of AI serving as an enabler than as an inhibitor on the SDGs, there are at least two important aspects that should be considered. First, self-interest can be expected to bias the AI research community and industry towards publishing positive results. Second, discovering detrimental aspects of AI may require longer-term studies and, as mentioned above, there are not many established evaluation methodologies available to do so. Bias towards publishing positive results is particularly apparent in the SDGs corresponding to the Environment group. A good example of this bias is target 14.5 on conserving coastal and marine areas, where machine-learning algorithms can provide optimum solutions given a wide range of parameters regarding the best choice of areas to include in conservation networks49. However, even if the solutions are optimal from a mathematical point of view (given a certain range of selected parameters), additional research would be needed to assess the long-term impact of such algorithms on equity and fairness6, precisely because of the unknown factors that may come into play. Regarding the second point stated above, it is likely that the AI projects with the highest potential of maximizing profit will get funded. Without control, research on AI is expected to be directed towards AI applications where funding and commercial interests are. This may result in increased inequality50. Consequently, there is the risk that AI-based technologies with potential to achieve certain SDGs may not be prioritized, if their expected economic impact is not high. Furthermore, it is essential to promote the development of initiatives to assess the societal, ethical, legal, and environmental implications of new AI technologies.Substantive research and application of AI technologies to SDGs is concerned with the development of better data-mining and machine-learning techniques for the prediction of certain events. This is the case of applications such as forecasting extreme weather conditions or predicting recidivist offender behavior. The expectation with this research is to allow the preparation and response for a wide range of events. However, there is a research gap in real-world applications of such systems, e.g., by governments (as discussed above). Institutions have a number of barriers to the adoption AI systems as part of their decision-making process, including the need of setting up measures for cybersecurity and the need to protect the privacy of citizens and their data. Both aspects have implications on human rights regarding the issues of surveillance, tracking, communication, and data storage, as well as automation of processes without rigorous ethical standards21. Targeting these gaps would be essential to ensure the usability and practicality of AI technologies for governments. This would also be a prerequisite for understanding long-term impacts of AI regarding its potential, while regulating its use to reduce the possible bias that can be inherent to AI6.Furthermore, our research suggests that AI applications are currently biased towards SDG issues that are mainly relevant to those nations where most AI researchers live and work. For instance, many systems applying AI technologies to agriculture, e.g., to automate harvesting or optimize its timing, are located within wealthy nations. Our literature search resulted in only a handful of examples where AI technologies are applied to SDG-related issues in nations without strong AI research. Moreover, if AI technologies are designed and developed for technologically advanced environments, they have the potential to exacerbate problems in less wealthy nations (e.g., when it comes to food production). This finding leads to a substantial concern that developments in AI technologies could increase inequalities both between and within countries, in ways which counteract the overall purpose of the SDGs. We encourage researchers and funders to focus more on designing and developing AI solutions, which respond to localized problems in less wealthy nations and regions. Projects undertaking such work should ensure that solutions are not simply transferred from technology-intensive nations. Instead, they should be developed based on a deep understanding of the respective region or culture to increase the likelihood of adoption and success.Towards sustainable AIThe great wealth that AI-powered technology has the potential to create may go mainly to those already well-off and educated, while job displacement leaves others worse off. Globally, the growing economic importance of AI may result in increased inequalities due to the unevenly distributed educational and computing resources throughout the world. Furthermore, the existing biases in the data used to train AI algorithms may result in the exacerbation of those biases, eventually leading to increased discrimination. Another related problem is the usage of AI to produce computational (commercial, political) propaganda based on big data (also defined as “big nudging”), which is spread through social media by independent AI agents with the goals of manipulating public opinion and producing political polarization51. Despite the fact that current scientific evidence refutes technological determinism of such fake news51, long-term impacts of AI are possible (although unstudied) due to a lack of robust research methods. A change of paradigm is therefore needed to promote cooperation and to limit the possibilities for control of citizen behavior through AI. The concept of Finance 4.0 has been proposed52 as a multi-currency financial system promoting a circular economy, which is aligned with societal goals and values. Informational self-determination (in which the individual takes an active role in how their data are handled by AI systems) would be an essential aspect of such a paradigm52. The data intensiveness of AI applications creates another problem: the need for more and more detailed information to improve AI algorithms, which is in conflict with the need of more transparent handling and protection of personal data53. One area where this conflict is particularly important is healthcare: Panch et al.54 argue that although the vast amount of personal healthcare data could lead to the development of very powerful tools for diagnosis and treatment, the numerous problems associated to data ownership and privacy call for careful policy intervention. This is also an area where more research is needed to assess the possible long-term negative consequences. All the challenges mentioned above culminate in the academic discourse about legal personality of robots55, which may lead to alarming narratives of technological totalitarianism.Many of these aspects result from the interplay between technological developments on one side and requests from individuals, response from governments, as well as environmental resources and dynamics on the other. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of these dynamics, with emphasis on the role of technology. Based on the evidence discussed above, these interactions are not currently balanced and the advent of AI has exacerbated the process. A wide range of new technologies are being developed very fast, significantly affecting the way individuals live as well as the impacts on the environment, requiring new piloting procedures from governments. The problem is that neither individuals nor governments seem to be able to follow the pace of these technological developments. This fact is illustrated by the lack of appropriate legislation to ensure the long-term viability of these new technologies. We argue that it is essential to reverse this trend. A first step in this direction is to establish adequate policy and legislation frameworks, to help direct the vast potential of AI towards the highest benefit for individuals and the environment, as well as towards the achievement of the SDGs. Regulatory oversight should be preceded by regulatory insight, where policymakers have sufficient understanding of AI challenges to be able to formulate sound policy. Developing such insight is even more urgent than oversight, as policy formulated without understanding is likely to be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.Fig. 5: Interaction of AI and society.Schematic representation showing the identified agents and their roles towards the development of AI. Thicker arrows indicate faster change. In this representation, technology affects individuals through technical developments, which change the way people work and interact with each other and with the environment, whereas individuals would interact with technology through new needs to be satisfied. Technology (including technology itself and its developers) affects governments through new developments that need appropriate piloting and testing. Also, technology developers affect government through lobbying and influencing decision makers. Governments provide legislation and standards to technology. The governments affect individuals through policy and legislation, and individuals would require new legislation consistent with the changing circumstances from the governments. The environment interacts with technology by providing the resources needed for technological development and is affected by the environmental impact of technology. Furthermore, the environment is affected either negatively or positively by the needs, impacts, and choices of individuals and governments, which in turn require environmental resources. Finally, the environment is also an underlying layer that provides the “planetary boundaries” to the mentioned interactions.Full size imageAlthough strong and connected institutions (covered by SDG 16) are needed to regulate the future of AI, we find that there is limited understanding of the potential impact of AI on institutions. Examples of the positive impacts include AI algorithms aimed at improving fraud detection56,57 or assessing the possible effects of certain legislation58,59. Another concern is that data-driven approaches for policing may hinder equal access to justice because of algorithm bias, particularly towards minorities60. Consequently, we believe that it is imperative to develop legislation regarding transparency and accountability of AI, as well as to decide the ethical standards to which AI-based technology should be subjected to. This debate is being pushed forward by initiatives such as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) ethical aligned design60 and the new EU (European Union) ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI61. It is noteworthy that despite the importance of an ethical, responsible, and trustworthy approach to AI development and use, in a sense, this issue is independent of the aims of the article. In other words, one can envision AI applications that improve SDG outcomes while not being fully aligned with AI ethics guidelines. We therefore recommend that AI applications that target SDGs are open and explicit about guiding ethical principles, also by indicating explicitly how they align with the existing guidelines. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability of AI, which is currently one of the challenges of AI research, adds an additional complication to the enforcement of such regulatory actions62. Note that this implies that AI algorithms (which are trained with data consisting of previous regulations and decisions) may act as a “mirror” reflecting biases and unfair policy. This presents an opportunity to possibly identify and correct certain errors in the existing procedures. The friction between the uptake of data-driven AI applications and the need of protecting the privacy and security of the individuals is stark. When not properly regulated, the vast amount of data produced by citizens might potentially be used to influence consumer opinion towards a certain product or political cause51.AI applications that have positive societal welfare implications may not always benefit each individual separately41. This inherent dilemma of collective vs. individual benefit is relevant in the scope of AI applications but is not one that should be solved by the application of AI itself. This has always been an issue affecting humankind and it cannot be solved in a simple way, since such a solution requires participation of all involved stakeholders. The dynamicity of context and the level of abstraction at which human values are described imply that there is not a single ethical theory that holds all the time in all situations63. Consequently, a single set of utilitarian ethical principles with AI would not be recommendable due to the high complexity of our societies52. It is also essential to be aware of the potential complexity in the interaction between human and AI agents, and of the increasing need for ethics-driven legislation and certification mechanisms for AI systems. This is true for all AI applications, but especially those that, if they became uncontrolled, could have even catastrophic effects on humanity, such as autonomous weapons. Regarding the latter, associations of AI and robotics experts are already getting together to call for legislation and limitations of their use64. Furthermore, associations such as the Future of Life Institute are reviewing and collecting policy actions and shared principles around the world to monitor progress towards sustainable-development-friendly AI65. To deal with the ethical dilemmas raised above, it is important that all applications provide openness about the choices and decisions made during design, development, and use, including information about the provenance and governance of the data used for training algorithms, and about whether and how they align with existing AI guidelines. It is therefore important to adopt decentralized AI approaches for a more equitable development of AI66.We are at a critical turning point for the future of AI. A global and science-driven debate to develop shared principles and legislation among nations and cultures is necessary to shape a future in which AI positively contributes to the achievement of all the SDGs. The current choices to develop a sustainable-development-friendly AI by 2030 have the potential to unlock benefits that could go far-beyond the SDGs within our century. All actors in all nations should be represented in this dialogue, to ensure that no one is left behind. On the other hand, postponing or not having such a conversation could result in an unequal and unsustainable AI-fueled future.MethodsIn this section we describe the process employed to obtain the results described in the present study and shown in the Supplementary Data 1. The goal was to answer the question “Is there published evidence of AI acting as an enabler or an inhibitor for this particular target?” for each of the 169 targets within the 17 SDGs. To this end, we conducted a consensus-based expert elicitation process, informed by previous studies on mapping SDGs interlinkages8,9 and following Butler et al.67 and Morgan68. The authors of this study are academics spanning a wide range of disciplines, including engineering, natural and social sciences, and acted as experts for the elicitation process. The authors performed an expert-driven literature search to support the identified connections between AI and the various targets, where the following sources of information were considered as acceptable evidence: published work on real-world applications (given the quality variation depending on the venue, we ensured that the publications considered in the analysis were of sufficient quality); published evidence on controlled/laboratory scenarios (given the quality variation depending on the venue, we ensured that the publications considered in the analysis were of sufficient quality); reports from accredited organizations (for instance: UN or government bodies); and documented commercial-stage applications. On the other hand, the following sources of information were not considered as acceptable evidence: educated conjectures, real-world applications without peer-reviewed research; media, public beliefs or other sources of information.The expert elicitation process was conducted as follows: each of the SDGs was assigned to one or more main contributors, and in some cases to several additional contributors as summarized in the Supplementary Data 1 (here the initials correspond to the author names). The main contributors carried out a first literature search for that SDG and then the additional contributors completed the main analysis. One published study on a synergy or a trade-off between a target and AI was considered enough for mapping the interlinkage. However, for nearly all targets several references are provided. After the analysis of a certain SDG was concluded by the contributors, a reviewer was assigned to evaluate the connections and reasoning presented by the contributors. The reviewer was not part of the first analysis and we tried to assign the roles of the main contributor and reviewer to experts with complementary competences for each of the SDGs. The role of the reviewer was to bring up additional points of view and considerations, while critically assessing the analysis. Then, the main contributors and reviewers iteratively discussed to improve the results presented for each of the SDGs until the analysis for all the SDGs was sufficiently refined.After reaching consensus regarding the assessment shown in the Supplementary Data 1, we analyzed the results by evaluating the number of targets for which AI may act as an enabler or an inhibitor, and calculated the percentage of targets with positive and negative impact of AI for each of the 17 goals, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, we divided the SDGs into the three following categories: Society, Economy, and Environment, consistent with the classification discussed by Refs. 11,12. The SDGs assigned to each of the categories are shown in Fig. 6 and the individual results from each of these groups can be observed in Figs. 2–4. These figures indicate, for each target within each SDG, whether any published evidence of positive or negative impact was found.Fig. 6: Categorization of the SDGs (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) into the Society, Economy, and Environment groups.(The content of this figure has not been reviewed by the United Nations and does not reflect its views).Full size imageTaking into account the types of evidenceIn the methodology described above, a connection between AI and a certain target is established if at least one reference documenting such a link was found. As the analyzed studies rely on very different types of evidence, it is important to classify the references based on the methods employed to support their conclusions. Therefore, all the references in the Supplementary Data 1 include a classification from (A) to (D) according to the following criteria:References using sophisticated tools and data to refer to this particular issue and with the possibility to be generalized are of type (A).Studies based on data to refer to this particular issue, but with limited generalizability, are of type (B).Anecdotal qualitative studies and methods are of type (C) .Purely theoretical or speculative references are of type (D).The various classes were assigned following the same expert elicitation process described above. Then, the contribution of these references towards the linkages is weighted and categories (A), (B), (C), and (D) are assigned relative weights of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. It is noteworthy that, given the vast range of studies on all the SDG areas, the literature search was not exhaustive and, therefore, certain targets are related to more references than others in our study. To avoid any bias associated to the different amounts of references in the various targets, we considered the largest positive and negative weight to establish the connection with each target. Let us consider the following example: for a certain target, one reference of type (B) documents a positive connection and two references of types (A) and (D) document a negative connection with AI. In this case, the potential positive impact of AI on that target will be assessed with 0.75, while the potential negative impact is 1.Limitations of the researchThe presented analysis represents the perspective of the authors. Some literature on how AI might affect certain SDGs could have been missed by the authors or there might not be published evidence yet on such interlinkage. Nevertheless, the employed methods tried to minimize the subjectivity of the assessment. How AI might affect the delivery of each SDG was assessed and reviewed by several authors and a number of studies were reviewed for each interlinkage. Furthermore, as discussed in the Methods section, each interlinkage was discussed among a subset of authors until consensus was reached on its nature.Finally, this study relies on the analysis of the SDGs. The SDGs provide a powerful lens for looking at internationally agreed goals on sustainable development and present a leap forward compared with the Millenium Development Goals in the representation of all spheres of sustainable development, encompassing human rights69, social sustainability, environmental outcomes, and economic development. However, the SDGs are a political compromise and might be limited in the representation of some of the complex dynamics and cross-interactions among targets. Therefore, the SDGs have to be considered in conjunction with previous and current, and other international agreements9. For instance, as pointed out in a recent work by UN Human Rights69, human rights considerations are highly embedded in the SDGs. Nevertheless, the SDGs should be considered as a complement, rather than a replacement, of the United Nations Universal Human Rights Charter70.

Using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, we find that AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals, but it may also inhibit 59 targets. However, current research foci overlook important aspects. The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more common in people’s lives.

<p>9 projects will share an initial £1-million to develop technology and innovative solutions to overcome increasing ‘information overload’ faced by crews as part of <abbr title=""Defence and Security Accelerator"">DASA</abbr>’s Intelligent Ship, The Next Generation competition.</p>

<p>Defence Minister James Heappey said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The astonishing pace at which global threats are evolving requires new approaches and fresh-thinking to the way we develop our ideas and technology. The funding will research pioneering projects into how <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">A.I.</abbr> and automation can support our armed forces in their essential day-to-day work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intelligent Ship is focused on inventive approaches for Human to <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">AI</abbr> and <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">AI</abbr> to <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">AI</abbr> teaming for defence platforms, such as warships, aircraft, and land vehicles in 2040 and beyond.</p>

<p><abbr title=""Defence and Security Accelerator"">DASA</abbr>, on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title=""Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"">DSTL</abbr>), is looking at how future defence platforms can be designed and optimised to exploit current and future advances in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automation</li>
  <li>autonomy</li>
  <li>machine learning</li>
  <li>artificial Intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<p>These key areas of research will look to address the complex and constantly evolving threats to national security.</p>

<p>This work will inform requirements then develop applications essential to the future force in an increasingly complex and <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">A.I.</abbr> driven environment. Although titled Intelligent Ship, a warship is just the prototype demonstrator for this competition. The project will inform development relevant to all defence equipment and military services.</p>

<p>Julia Tagg, technical lead from <abbr title=""Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"">DSTL</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This <abbr title=""Defence and Security Accelerator"">DASA</abbr> competition has the potential to lead the transformation of our defence platforms, leading to a sea change in the relationships between <abbr title=""Artificial Intelligence"">AI</abbr> and human teams. This will ensure UK defence remains an effective, capable force for good in a rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Crews are already facing information overload with thousands of sources of data, intelligence, and information. By harnessing automation, autonomy, machine learning and artificial intelligence with the real-life skill and experience of our men and women, we can revolutionise the way future fleets are put together and operate to keep the UK safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The competition, currently backed by a total of £4-million over 2 phases, has the potential to transform the way the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force equipment platforms are designed, work together, operated and manned by the 2040s.</p>

<p>Innovations developed in phase 1 of the competition could later help determine the different platform types, size and role of future platforms as well potentially being adapted and integrated into the existing fleet.</p>

<p><abbr title=""Defence and Security Accelerator"">DASA</abbr> Delivery Manager Adam Moore said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title=""Defence and Security Accelerator"">DASA</abbr> brings together the brightest minds in science, industry and academia to turbocharge innovations to keep the UK, as well as those who protect us, safe from emerging and evolving threats to our way of life.</p>

While AI holds plenty of promise and opportunity, there are also concerns about data misuse and personal privacy being at risk. As we evaluate these topics and as the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds, questions arise about the promise and peril of AI, and how organizations can better realize its value. Integrating 'ethics' into technology products can feel abstract for engineers and developers. While many technology companies are working independently on ways to do this in concrete and tangible ways, it is imperative that we break out of those silos and share best practices. By working collaboratively to learn from each other, we can raise the bar for the industry as a whole - and a good place to start is focusing on the things that earn trust.Have you read?It's make or break time for artificial intelligence. Here's how we can make it workHow businesses can create an ethical culture in the age of techWe need to reconsider ethical and philosophical issues surrounding our digital identitiesMany companies are releasing high-level principles about their approach to designing and deploying AI products. But principles are only valuable if they are actually implemented. Workday recently published our Commitments to Ethical AI to show how we operationalize principles that build directly on our core values of customer service, integrity and innovation. Based on our experiences, here are eight lessons for technology companies looking to champion those principles across their organization: 1. Define what 'AI ethics' means. This definition needs to be specific and actionable for all relevant stakeholders in the company. At my company, it means our machine-learning (ML) systems reflect our commitment to ethical AI: we put people first; we care about society; we act fairly and respect the law; we are transparent and accountable; we protect data; and we deliver enterprise-ready machine-learning systems. 2. Build ethical AI into the product development and release framework. These cannot be separate processes that create more work and complexity for developers and product teams. Workday has built our principles into the fabric of our product development and created processes that drive continued compliance with them. New ML controls have been incorporated into our formal control framework to serve as additional enforcement of our ML ethics principles. Our development teams examine every ML product through an ethical lens by asking questions about data collection and data minimization, transparency and values. We have a long history of this in the privacy space, including privacy-by-design processes as well as third-party audits against our controls and standards. Workday has embraced a set of ethics-by-design controls for machine learning, and have in place robust review and approval mechanisms for the release of new technologies, as well as any new uses of data. We are committed to ongoing reviews of our processes, and evolving them to incorporate new industry best practices and regulatory guidelines. 3. Create cross-functional groups of experts to guide all decisions on the design, development and deployment of responsible ML and AI. Early on in this journey, Workday established a machine-learning task force comprised of experts drawn from our product and engineering, legal, public policy and privacy, ethics and compliance teams. These groups examine future and existing uses of ML in our products. Bringing these diverse sets of skills and views together to discuss future and existing uses of ML in our products has been really powerful, and has enabled us to identify potential issues early on in the product lifecycle. DiscoverWhat is algorithm bias? Show moreAlgorithm bias, also called machine learning bias, is a phenomenon in which algorithms can act in a discriminatory or prejudiced manner due to misplaced assumptions during the learning phase of their development.Unconscious biases regarding gender, race and social class can make their way into the training data fed by programmers into “machine-learning algorithms”, systems which constantly improve their own performance by including new data into an existing model.These biases can be observed in the algorithm’s output: erroneous reflected assumptions that can result in embarrassing news coverage.Some recent stories about accidental algorithm bias include:A facial recognition algorithm that was more accurate on white faces than darker skin tonesSpeech recognition software that couldn't recognise women's voices as well as men'sSoftware used in the United States to predict future criminals that was wrongly biased against black offendersHave you read?Bias in AI is a real problem. Here’s what we should do about itAI isn’t dangerous, but human bias isAI is convicting criminals and determining jail time, but is it fair?How to Prevent Discriminatory Outcomes in Machine Learning4. Bring customer collaboration into the design, development and deployment of responsible AI. Workday engages our customer advisory councils, drawn from a broad cross-section of our customer base, during our product development lifecycle to gain feedback around our development themes related to AI and ML. And through our early adopter programme, we work closely with a handful of customers who act as design partners to test out new ML models and features through our innovation services.This enables us to understand and address customers’ ideas and concerns around AI and ML early on as we co-develop people-centric ML solutions. 5. Take a lifecycle approach to bias in machine learning. ML tools represent a phenomenal opportunity to help our customers leverage data to enhance human decision-making. With that opportunity comes the responsibility to build enterprise-ready tools that maintain our customers' trust, which is why one of the focal points of our commitments to ethical AI is mitigating harmful bias in ML. We use a 'lifecycle approach', through which we perform various bias assessments and reviews starting from the initial concept for a new product through the post-release phase.

Because ML algorithms can be so complex, companies should go above and beyond in explaining what data is being used, how it’s being used, and for what purpose. Explain to customers how your ML technologies work and the benefits they offer, and describe the data content needed to power any ML solutions you offer. Demonstrate accountability in your ML solutions to your customers. 7. Empower your employees to design responsible products. We do this through required ethics training modules, toolkits, seminars, employee onboarding and workshops to ensure employees are trained in how to uphold our AI ethical commitments. For example, a human-centered design-thinking workshop uses different scenarios and personas to help Workday employees understand our commitments to creating ethical ML technologies. 8. Share what you know and learn from others in the industry. We do this through participation in industry groups and peer meetings such as the World Economic Forum Steering Committee for Ethical Design and Deployment of Technology to help develop an ethical framework for the tech industry. In addition, Workday makes it a priority to monitor and contribute to new standards and plans. In the US, we have engaged heavily with lawmakers and agency officials on ethical AI, including developing and participating in a Congressional AI Caucus staff briefing on 'Industry Approaches to Ethical AI', and playing the role of convener between industry and policy-makers in multiple venues. In addition, we provided support for the National Science Foundation’s update to the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) development of their report, Artificial Intelligence Standards and Tools Development. We continue to advocate for an expanded role for NIST in the development of AI ethics tools. In Europe, Workday participated in a pilot programme to evaluate the European Union’s High-Level Expert Group’s Ethical Guidelines’s (HLEG) Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Assessment List. As we navigate this evolving world of ethical AI, it will become more important than ever to share practices and identify what we’ve learned along the way. We are eager to hear from others on what approaches have been effective for scaling and implementation, and we welcome the opportunity to share. In fact, the aim of Workday’s collaboration with the World Economic Forum is to encourage others to join us in sharing their best practices for championing responsible and ethical technology.

Steve RoseThu 16 Jan 2020 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 16 Jan 2020 11.50 ESTShare164164If Sunspring is anything to go by, artificial intelligence in film-making has some way to go. This short film, made as an entry to Sci-Fi London’s 48-hour film-making competition in 2016, was written entirely by an AI. The director, Oscar Sharp, fed a few hundred sci-fi screenplays into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (the type of software behind predictive text in a smartphone), then told it to write its own. The result was almost, but not quite, incoherent nonsense, riddled with cryptic nonsequiturs, bizarre turns of phrase and unfathomable stage directions such as “he is standing in the stars and sitting on the floor”. All of which Sharp and his actors filmed with sincere commitment.“In a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood,” says a man in a shiny gold jacket. “You should see the boy and shut up. I was the one who was going to be a hundred years old,” replies a woman fiddling with some electronics. The man vomits up an eyeball. A second man says: “Well, I have to go to the skull.” And so forth. An unwitting viewer might be unsure whether they were watching meaningless nonsense or a lost Tarkovsky script.This isn’t how artificial intelligence is changing the movies – yet. But AI is changing the industry in other ways, to a greater extent than is being admitted. In early January, Warner Bros broke cover and announced it had signed up to an AI-driven project management system that would “inform decision-making around content and talent valuation to support release strategies”. In other words, Warners will be using AI to help it decide what movies to make.The system in question was launched last year by Cinelytic, a Los Angeles-based startup. Other clients listed on its website include Sony Pictures, Ingenious Media and STX Entertainment (the studio behind Hustlers and Playmobil: The Movie). Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox has partnered with Google to develop its own AI, named Merlin, which predicts audiences based on analysis of patterns and objects in movie trailers. Other new companies have also entered the AI game in the past few years, including Belgium-based ScriptBook and Israel’s Vault AI.You can see the appeal, especially for a studio like Warner Bros. As well as putting out hits such as Joker and A Star Is Born, it has had its share of box-office flops, such as King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, The Kitchen, Shaft and The Goldfinch. These projects must have looked like hits on paper. How to tell the difference? Traditionally, Hollywood almost prides itself on its own unpredictability, accepting as a given William Goldman’s adage “no one knows anything”. It is an industry that carries out extensive analysis, research and audience testing, but that still relies to a large extent on human intuition and gut instinct. It is also an industry where the majority of films made are never released, and less than half of those that are make their money back.Can the machines do better? Absolutely, says Cinelytic, which claims an accuracy of 85% in its box office forecasting. Cinelytic was founded in 2015 by Tobias Queisser, whose background is in finance and film producing. His co-founder, Dev Sen, is a rocket scientist who developed risk assessment software for Nasa. Cinelytic claims to have crunched data from more than 95,000 movies and 500,000 actors and professionals, but its chief selling point is that it can make forecasts in real time – expressed as percentage probabilities of certain levels of success. With its user-friendly interface, clients can play with the variables and assess the impact on box office right away.Let’s make an action comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, say. It will be huge! But what if Johnson is not available? How would it look if you cast Gerard Butler instead? Not so huge, perhaps, but the budget might also be lower. How would it do if you released it over 1,000 screens, or 3,000? How would it do in Brazil or China? In effect, Cinelytic’s AI treats the movie industry like fantasy football, assigning quantitative scores to individuals, according to factors such as recent or past box-office performance or social media profile.Others take a slightly different approach. ScriptBook’s AI primarily analyses scripts, as opposed to actors or directors. “Most people believe that cast is everything, but we’ve learned that the story has the highest predictive value,” says Nadira Azermai, who founded the company in 2015. It doesn’t take a computer-sized brain to think of a movie that had a stellar cast but still flopped. But a good story will succeed even without stars – and potentially more so with them, she says.Within six minutes, ScriptBook’s AI reads a script and assigns it more than 400 parameters. “Anything that is information: emotion analysis, the journey for the protagonist and antagonist, whether the film will cater to a wide audience or niche audience, whether it follows a traditional three-act structure, whether the action happens in the most important places.” As more information becomes available, such as the cast, the prediction becomes more accurate, but if the computer says no to begin with, no additional information will change it to a yes.ScriptBook’s success rates are comparable to those of Cinelytic: 83% to 86%, Azermai claims, whereas human decision-making is successful 27% to 31% of the time. In a retroactive study of Sony’s output between 2015 and 2017, for example, it successfully identified 22 out of its 32 releases that lost money. It could have saved the company a fortune. It has achieved similar levels of accuracy with movies before they were released, even predicting the success of unconventional outliers such as Get Out, La La Land and A Quiet Place. Azermai is not yet at liberty to reveal which companies ScriptBook has been working with, but she applauds Warners’ announcement that it is working with Cinelytic. “It is an important message, because the majority of companies are still treating AI as a dirty little secret.”One of the factors driving the AI revolution is undoubtedly Netflix, which, by its spectacular ascent over the past decade, has awakened the entertainment industry to the awesome power of data. Netflix has valued its “recommendations” algorithms (which suggest to viewers what to watch next) at $1bn (£760m) a year in terms of keeping subscribers engaged. The company is notoriously secretive about its methods, but it is safe to assume it is tracking viewers’ every move: what they watch, how long they watch it, what time of day it is, what they watch next, how many hits a new show receives in its first day, and so on. Because Netflix also streams other people’s content, it is even better informed when it comes to producing its own. The studio’s staggering output (Netflix put out 700 original TV shows and 80 features in 2018) would not be possible without AI assistance. As a result of Netflix’s success, tech companies such as Apple and Amazon are getting into content creation and giving the old-school studios a run for their money.“All of a sudden you have this conservative, traditional industry versus companies who are believers in data,” says Azermai. “There is a war on content, but one party is using the latest technology and the other is riding a donkey.”The AI revolution will clearly benefit film-makers, but what is in it for us viewers? One potential drawback is that AI eliminates not only financial risk but creative risk, too. The fear is, if you fed in a vaguely challenging or experimental or atypical project into the machine – say Mulholland Drive or Under the Skin – the algorithm would discourage you from taking the gamble. Why not do a Dwayne Johnson action comedy instead?Added to which, the data these algorithms are processing are actually human beings, who are inherently erratic, fallible and unpredictable. Your asset might go into rehab, get divorced or decide to go off and make shoes for a year. In 1996 Robert Downey Jr was arrested driving his Porsche naked through Los Angeles throwing imaginary rats out of the window. What algorithm would have recommended casting him as Iron Man?“Already we’re seeing that we’re getting more and more remakes and sequels because that’s safe, rather than something that’s out of the box,” says Tabitha Goldstaub, a tech entrepreneur and commentator who specialises in artificial intelligence. Her work has raised deeper concerns about AI. Far from being a dispassionate tool, it often reflects the biases and prejudices of its creators, she says. “A lot of people think it’s maths so it can’t be biased, whereas in fact it’s completely the opposite way around: it’s maths, and therefore it’s data, and whatever data you feed a machine will have bias in it. The world is biased, and so these machines exacerbate our own biases.”She points to the fact that no women have been nominated for best director at this year’s Oscars, and only five women have ever been nominated. The AI might well conclude that if you want to make an Oscar-winning movie, don’t hire a female director. “You can’t help but think: do you really want to leave these people in charge of creating an algorithm that predicts the next hits? It’s quite scary.”But there are signs that AI could help reduce bias. The producer Todd Garner cited an example on his Producer’s Guide podcast recently. Garner’s company produced the Marlon Wayans comedies White Chicks and Little Man, and did very well out of them. But when it took a new Wayans project to traditional studios and financiers, nobody bit, he says. “Because there was no way, they thought, that this movie would play internationally … so it’s a purely domestic play [a US-only release]. Netflix came in and scooped it up immediately, gave us a lot more money to make the movie and the movie was huge for their site. Because Netflix had hosted White Chicks and other Wayans movies on their site, they knew that Marlon Wayans has a worldwide audience. If you don’t have that data, your instinct is, well, African American movies don’t play overseas, period.”Now that AI is here, there is also the question of how much further it will infiltrate film-making. Screenwriting, for example. Things have moved on since Sunspring in 2016. Last year, Kevin Macdonald directed a one-minute advert for Lexus entirely written by an AI – that had been trained on 15 years’ worth of luxury ads.As well as analytical tools, ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI, which it has given the dystopian sci-fi thriller name of Deepstory. “It really is a co-creator,” says Azermai, reassuringly. “We envision a next-generation writers’ room where whenever they don’t know where to head to for the next scene, they would have Deepstory create it. The engine takes into account everything that you’ve written, and it will deliver you the next scene, or the next 10 pages, or write it to the end.” Azermai admits Deepstory still has much to learn. “The consistency in writing stays for another 10 pages and then the AI becomes a bit crazy – sometimes it kills the protagonist for some reason – but it’s improving. Within five years we’ll have scripts written by AI that you would think are better than human writing.”The movies themselves have trained us to be suspicious of AIs. They make terrible substitute children (Spielberg’s AI), and even worse romantic partners (Spike Jonze’s Her). They often decide humans are expendable and take over (Kubrick’s 2001) or they enslave us in some futuristic dystopia (Terminator, The Matrix). Could it be that by embracing AI, Hollywood is unwittingly building an equivalent of the Terminator movies’ Skynet? Or, in a slightly less apocalyptic scenario, are we looking at a future where movies are personally tailored to individual viewers? Might we be approaching a sort of Turing test for machine-written fiction? Maybe we have passed it already and we just don’t know it yet. Sounds like a plot for a great, metatextual Hollywood conspiracy thriller. If we got Dwayne Johnson it could be a smash. Let’s crunch some numbers!Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNever doubt the instincts of Donald Trump, who just appointed ‘never Trump guy’ as his running mateMarina Hyde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, much of the attention has focussed on blue-collar work, as factory assembly lines and warehouses have adopted automated processes more quickly and visibly than other industries. Automation on a factory floor evokes a simple image: robotic arms assembling parts into Tesla cars; mobile robots driving pallets of goods through Amazon distribution centers. In either scenario, the impact on human workers is easy to see. What is harder to visualize is how similar technology might find its way into the aspects of human labor that are invisible and not as easily routinized, such as complex decision-making, strategic planning, and creative thought.Until recently, the consensus among researchers seemed to be that workers with higher levels of education would be less affected by automation than those lower down on the economic hierarchy. Now, though, new research suggests that higher-educated, white-collar workers may be facing significant disruption, as well. In a study published in November by the Brookings Institution, researchers found that certain higher-wage occupations might be more deeply intertwined with A.I. technology in the future than previously thought. “The big takeaway is that manufacturing professions and occupations will be heavily affected,” one of the study’s co-authors, Mark Muro, told me recently. “But so will white-collar jobs—managerial and office activity.” Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, who specializes in economic development and technology and who wears spectacles that lend him a bookish air, noted that whether these jobs are likely to be replaced by A.I. or simply changed by it is still unclear; in some cases, A.I. may end up assisting human workers rather than doing their jobs for them. Either way, the uncertainty is likely to cause alarm in some circles.One of the challenges of studying the effects of artificial intelligence on white-collar employment is that the integration of algorithms into office work happens slowly, and often imperceptibly. As a starting point, Muro and his co-authors tried to narrow their task by focussing on machine learning, a form of A.I. that uses algorithms to analyze huge amounts of data, find patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions. “When most people talk about A.I., they’re talking, in many respects, about this,” Muro said. “When they talk about the radiologists reading a scan enhanced by A.I., they’re talking about machine learning.”Video From The New YorkerSurfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made WaveAfter they defined what they were looking for, another challenge presented itself: how to figure out what new kinds of machine-learning applications were likely to be introduced in the coming years. For this, the researchers employed a method developed by Michael Webb, a graduate student in the economics department at Stanford University, who created an algorithm to analyze A.I. patents that had been filed and cross-reference them with tasks performed in various jobs. Webb examined a pool of approximately sixteen thousand patents that contained verb-object pairs such as “diagnose disease” and “predict prognosis,” which correlated with descriptions of occupations used by the Department of Labor. “Patents are a reflection of the things that inventors think are going to be important innovations that will make money in the future,” Webb told me. “The reason you patent something is that you think you could make some money off of this innovation, and you want the right to create that product and not have other people do it instead.”As a way of testing the effectiveness of this research method, Webb looked back at the previous thirty years or so of patents in software and industrial robotics, to see if the predictions about employment and wage decline one would have found then had panned out. They had: software patents often referred to “recording,” “storing,” and “producing information,” while robot-related patents talked about “cleaning,” “moving,” “welding,” and “assembling.” The words correlated most strongly with the tasks of packers and packagers, hoist and winch operators, machine operators, and those who worked in warehouses—for example, people driving forklifts. “It turns out that the jobs that were highly exposed to those technologies experienced declines in employment and in wages over the next thirty years,” Webb said. That, to him, suggested that software and industrial robots were replacing human labor in those fields (although there were other forces in effect, as well, such as the offshoring of factories).Webb then analyzed A.I. patent filings and found them using verbs such as “recognize,” “detect,” “control,” “determine,” and “classify,” and nouns like “patterns,” “images,” and “abnormalities.” The jobs that appear to face intrusion by these newer patents are different from the more manual jobs that were affected by industrial robots: intelligent machines may, for example, take on more tasks currently conducted by physicians, such as detecting cancer, making prognoses, and interpreting the results of retinal scans, as well as those of office workers that involve making determinations based on data, such as detecting fraud or investigating insurance claims. People with bachelor’s degrees might be more exposed to the effects of the new technologies than other educational groups, as might those with higher incomes. The findings suggest that nurses, doctors, managers, accountants, financial advisers, computer programmers, and salespeople might see significant shifts in their work. Occupations that require high levels of interpersonal skill seem most insulated. (Notably, jobs at the very top of the earning scale, such as C.E.O., are not shown to be deeply changed.)When I asked Muro what he thought the implications of his research might be, he told me about a tweet that someone had written in response to the paper’s findings. The author had expressed concern that his work might “muddy the water about the underemployed and vulnerable,” Muro said, by taking attention away from the truck drivers and factory workers who are already being displaced from their jobs, often with less of a financial cushion to fall back on. “There’s no doubt the white-collar part of the story involves some of the most capable, resilient workers in the economy,” Muro said. “For someone in the eightieth percentile of income, they’re probably well trained by, and are being invested in by, their employers.” That kind of investment, Muro added, “doesn’t flow to those at the lower end.” But he noted that the danger of automation coming for white-collar jobs might help make the issue more real for those in charge of policy decisions. “I think maybe this widens the scope of concern,” he said. “This suggests that it isn’t just somebody else’s problem, namely, a black or brown worker in a factory. . . . We’re all going to be contending with tremendous flux and change in the labor market and our work.”",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/could-new-research-on-ai-and-white-collar-jobs-finally-bring-about-a-strong-policy-response'}",,"Sheelah Kolhatkar writes about the findings of a new Brookings Institution study, which determined that certain higher-wage occupations might be more deeply intertwined with A.I. technology in the future than previously thought.",,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'The New Yorker'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e14fa7d4b71b300081b1eeb/1:1/w_1641,h_1641,c_limit/Kolhatkar-AIandthewhitecollarjobs.jpg",,,,"Until recently, the consensus among researchers seemed to be that workers with higher levels of education would be less affected by automation than those lower down on the economic hierarchy.

One of the challenges of studying the effects of artificial intelligence on white-collar employment is that the integration of algorithms into office work happens slowly, and often imperceptibly. As a starting point, Muro and his co-authors tried to narrow their task by focussing on machine learning, a form of A.I. that uses algorithms to analyze huge amounts of data, find patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions. “When most people talk about A.I., they’re talking, in many respects, about this,” Muro said. “When they talk about the radiologists reading a scan enhanced by A.I., they’re talking about machine learning.”
After they defined what they were looking for, another challenge presented itself: how to figure out what new kinds of machine-learning applications were likely to be introduced in the coming years. For this, the researchers employed a method developed by Michael Webb, a graduate student in the economics department at Stanford University, who created an algorithm to analyze A.I. patents that had been filed and cross-reference them with tasks performed in various jobs. Webb examined a pool of approximately sixteen thousand patents that contained verb-object pairs such as “diagnose disease” and “predict prognosis,” which correlated with descriptions of occupations used by the Department of Labor. “Patents are a reflection of the things that inventors think are going to be important innovations that will make money in the future,” Webb told me. “The reason you patent something is that you think you could make some money off of this innovation, and you want the right to create that product and not have other people do it instead.”
As a way of testing the effectiveness of this research method, Webb looked back at the previous thirty years or so of patents in software and industrial robotics, to see if the predictions about employment and wage decline one would have found then had panned out. They had: software patents often referred to “recording,” “storing,” and “producing information,” while robot-related patents talked about “cleaning,” “moving,” “welding,” and “assembling.” The words correlated most strongly with the tasks of packers and packagers, hoist and winch operators, machine operators, and those who worked in warehouses—for example, people driving forklifts. “It turns out that the jobs that were highly exposed to those technologies experienced declines in employment and in wages over the next thirty years,” Webb said. That, to him, suggested that software and industrial robots were replacing human labor in those fields (although there were other forces in effect, as well, such as the offshoring of factories).
Webb then analyzed A.I. patent filings and found them using verbs such as “recognize,” “detect,” “control,” “determine,” and “classify,” and nouns like “patterns,” “images,” and “abnormalities.” The jobs that appear to face intrusion by these newer patents are different from the more manual jobs that were affected by industrial robots: intelligent machines may, for example, take on more tasks currently conducted by physicians, such as detecting cancer, making prognoses, and interpreting the results of retinal scans, as well as those of office workers that involve making determinations based on data, such as detecting fraud or investigating insurance claims. People with bachelor’s degrees might be more exposed to the effects of the new technologies than other educational groups, as might those with higher incomes. The findings suggest that nurses, doctors, managers, accountants, financial advisers, computer programmers, and salespeople might see significant shifts in their work. Occupations that require high levels of interpersonal skill seem most insulated. (Notably, jobs at the very top of the earning scale, such as C.E.O., are not shown to be deeply changed.)
When I asked Muro what he thought the implications of his research might be, he told me about a tweet that someone had written in response to the paper’s findings. The author had expressed concern that his work might “muddy the water about the underemployed and vulnerable,” Muro said, by taking attention away from the truck drivers and factory workers who are already being displaced from their jobs, often with less of a financial cushion to fall back on. “There’s no doubt the white-collar part of the story involves some of the most capable, resilient workers in the economy,” Muro said. “For someone in the eightieth percentile of income, they’re probably well trained by, and are being invested in by, their employers.” That kind of investment, Muro added, “doesn’t flow to those at the lower end.” But he noted that the danger of automation coming for white-collar jobs might help make the issue more real for those in charge of policy decisions. “I think maybe this widens the scope of concern,” he said. “This suggests that it isn’t just somebody else’s problem, namely, a black or brown worker in a factory. . . . We’re all going to be contending with tremendous flux and change in the labor market and our work.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the most significant predictions for the new decade are that AI will become more pervasive, and the U.S. health-care system will need to evolve. AI can augment and improve the health-care system to serve more patients with fewer doctors. 
However, health innovators need to be careful to design a system that enhances doctors’ capabilities, rather than replace them with technology and also to avoid reproducing human biases.
A recent study published in Nature (in collaboration with Google) reports that Google AI detects breast cancer better than human doctors. Babylon Health, the AI-based mobile primary care system implemented in the United Kingdom in 2013, is coming to the U.S. 
Health-care is an industry in need of AI assistance due to a shortage of doctors and physician burnout. 
Doctors in the U.S. are experiencing a burnout crisis. Nearly 45 percent of physicians report burnout, and the physician suicide rate is twice that of the general population. Research shows physicians experience burnout because of a poorly designed health care system that isn’t intended to protect them or their patients. 
Physician burnout has been linked to increased medical errors, unprofessional behavior, early retirement, depression, and racial bias. 
In 2019 the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 3,392 second-year resident physicians who self-identified as non-Black and found that symptoms of burnout were associated with explicit and implicit racial biases. 
A study from the Mayo clinic reported poorly designed electronic health records as a contributor to physician burnout. 
Another major contributor to burnout is a shortage of physicians compared to the increased number and needs of patients that require care. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortage of 21,100 and 55,200 primary care physicians by 2032. 
While a possible solution, AI systems can also cause problems. Increased medical error is a real potential consequence of poorly designed AI in medicine. 
Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., attesting to both the need for improving the system but also the fragility of the system and consequences of poor design. 
Eliminating the empathetic relationship is another potential consequence of poorly designed and integrated AI. Health care is built on a human-human link. 
Humans desire and benefit from the problem-solving that comes from conversations. In clinics with electronic health records, physicians spend about 27 percent of their time on patient care and 52 percent time in the exam room interacting with the patient. 
 
Replacing humans with technology inappropriately could lead to complacency from physicians and reduced engagement from patients.
AI could lead to new inequities and biases. Recent studies have shown that Black people are less likely to get proper treatment for lung cancer and adequate treatment for pain because of false beliefs about differences between Blacks and whites. 
While some may conclude that AI would remove the biases that minorities receive by focusing on objective data, new research identifies inequities in AI systems. 
A study published in Science in 2019 found that an algorithm used in U.S. hospitals systematically discriminated against Black patients by allocating less care to them.
Babylon’s AI-based chatbot sparked concerns as the chatbots’ safety has been reported; Babylon refutes these claims. 
Many of the disruptive aspects of the AI system are unique to the National Health Service, which assigns patients to practitioners. With new funding and support, Babylon will enter the U.S. market. Health safety advocates need to be available to advocate for the unique needs of patients in the American health-care system. 
For AI systems to work without harm, a greater understanding of what clinicians do and their current biases is needed. The goal of designing systems that preserves what clinicians do best without the risk of complacency is critical. 
Both tech companies and health leadership are primarily comprised of white male staff that may not be trained to think about bias comprehensively. Diversifying the workforce of companies building AI systems and those innovating the health-care system is needed. 
A recent report found that people of color and women are underrepresented in the AI field, as about 80 percent of AI professors are men, and people of color are only a fraction of staff at major tech companies. 
Diversifying the pipeline of researchers is essential; equally important is building inclusive workplaces and communities that allow under-represented minority researchers to thrive. 
Yes, well-designed AI in health-care systems can transform the health and well-being of members of society by allowing healthcare professionals to provide better quality care to more people and restoring balance to the people who dedicate their lives to providing care. 
But the danger is that AI systems that pit humans against algorithms will likely introduce new biases and errors into the U.S. health-care system that will not only exacerbate health disparities but also make health care more dangerous for everyone.

Tremendous shifts in the workplace are driving significant changes in recruiting and hiring as employers attempt to find qualified candidates in today’s highly competitive labor market.

For example, employers are more often turning to technology to reduce time-to-hire and build applicant-friendly hiring practices. According to HireRight’s 2019 “Employment Screening Benchmark Report,” 32% of employers have deployed mobile-friendly applications and screening processes to make it easier for candidates.


At the same time, with today’s ongoing labor shortage, companies are looking for new ways to find talent, including hiring more non-traditional employees such as contract, temporary, and contingent workers. 

But these new processes and policies raise critical legal questions and are triggering new laws to protect workers and guide employers. Here’s what employers must keep in mind in 2020.

Artificial Intelligence and Biometrics
PROMOTED
According to HireRight’s Benchmark Report, 25% of human resources professionals believe artificial intelligence (AI) holds big benefits for recruiting in the future.
Already, many deploy AI tools to manage recruitment. Video interview platforms on the market, for example, use AI to evaluate a job seeker’s facial expressions and how they answer questions during a recorded interview. The tools then recommend the best applicants to move forward for consideration.
But not everybody is cheering these solutions. Because of the way the tools are built, critics believe AI could make employment discrimination worse, reflecting “institutional and systemic biases,” according to a report from Upturn, a public advocacy research group.

And lawmakers are starting to take notice. In 2019, Illinois lawmakers passed the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which took effect on January 1. If employers use AI to evaluate applicant-submitted videos, they must alert candidates that AI may be used, give them information about how the technology works and get their consent.

Federal legislators also are wading into the debate. The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019 was introduced in April and, if approved, would govern how AI and related tools are used. California lawmakers are taking a different tack. The California Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 125 encourages the use of AI to eliminate bias and discrimination in hiring. Both measures could be up for debate in 2020, along with other proposals that may pop up across the country.

Meanwhile, as employers collect scads of information about job applicants and employees, they also could run afoul of laws that control the use of biometric data, which includes fingerprints and scans of facial features that are commonly used in AI. Illinois is again a leader here with its Biometric Information Privacy Act, which guides the collection and use of such data. Texas and Washington also have biometrics laws. More states are expected to jump on the “biometric bandwagon,” according to The National Law Review.
That means that in 2020, employers must not only track new AI and biometrics laws but be careful as they implement AI solutions and build alternatives for job seekers who opt-out.
Data Privacy
Just as employers must be cautious with biometric information, they also must pay more attention to other personal data they collect as states begin to roll out data privacy laws
The new California Consumer Privacy Act covers companies with gross annual revenues of more than $25 million; who buy, receive or sell personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices; or who earn 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling consumers’ personal information.
Starting this month, these employers must provide privacy notices to employees about the information they gather and maintain reasonable security measures to protect it, among other requirements.
In New York, employers soon must comply with the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act, or SHIELD Act, which requires companies that employ New York residents to take steps to safeguard employees’ private information. It takes effect on March 21, 2020.
And it’s likely this is just the beginning for data privacy in the United States. In 2019, New York lawmakers debated a proposed New York Privacy Act, which is similar to California’s law. In 2020 and beyond, more lawmakers will bring data privacy measures to the table.
Worker Classification
The gig economy is expected only to continue to grow in 2020 as employers look to independent contractors to find the qualified talent they need. One survey by BCG Henderson Institute, in partnership with Harvard Business School’s Managing the Future of Work initiative, found that about 40% of corporate executives believe that freelancers will take up a bigger share of their company’s workforce through 2023.
But some state lawmakers are cracking down on companies that are increasingly relying on freelancers to do the work instead of hiring salaried employees, who typically can take advantage of benefits such as workers’ compensation, health insurance, and paid time off.
Effective January 1, California’s Assembly Bill 5 outlines guidelines for employers to follow to determine if a worker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor. Independent contractors, according to the law, must be free from any control or direction of the employer; complete work that is “outside the usual course” of the employer’s business; and take part in an “independently established trade, occupation, or business.”
Lawmakers in New Jersey and New York are debating similar laws. In 2020, it’s likely we’ll see more states consider worker classification regulations.
Other new laws affecting recruitment and hiring are likely to come down the pike in 2020, covering marijuana accommodations, criminal records checks, and pay equity. And that means that as the new decade opens, employers must be mindful of not only the latest tools and trends in hiring but the newest compliance requirements too.

It baffled me how much AI will impact our lives and I realised this is the field I want to be in.So, I began searching for learning resources and immersed myself into all kinds of AI related material. This was a normal thing to do since I taught myself how to code and I figured that I can also teach myself at least the basic of AI.After a few months of taking courses, I will give you my opinion on the most useful free courses I have taken, the ones I’m in progress of finishing and as a bonus the ones I intend to take in the future.Courses I’ve takenIntro to Artificial IntelligenceAbout the courseIt’s a classic on AI and it happened to be the first course I’ve ever taken on the subject. It’s a comprehensive course that gives you just the right amount of information about all the branches and sub-branches that AI is made of.Trending AI Articles:1. Making a Simple Neural Network2. Google will beat Apple at its own game with superior AI3. The AI Job Wars: Episode I4. Artificial Intelligence ConferenceAbout the teachersThe course is taught by two of the greatest advocates of AI:Sebastian Thrun: a former associate professor at Stanford University, co-founder of Udacity, led the team that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and co-developed Street View at Google.Peter Norvig: a director of research at Google and co-author of the leading college text in the field — Artificial Intelligence: A modern ApproachConclusionI can’t recommend it enough. It’s definitely a must.Elements of AIAbout the courseThis is a text based course and the aspect I loved the most about it was the fact that it makes you ponder about the role artificial intelligence is going to have in your life. I like the structure of the course and how quickly you can check if you really understood something by taking a quiz.About the teachersIt’s created by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki. It’s part of an initiative that wants to encourage as broad a group of people as possible to learn about AI. The goal is to make the course available in all EU languages.ConclusionIt’s a quick and engaging course to take to get the very basics on AI.Neural Networks and Deep LearningAbout the courseThis one is a bit more advanced in terms of knowledge you gain after its completion and it’s part of a series of courses on deep learning. I like the fact that it’s not getting too technical and you can easily get to understand more advanced nuances tools that are being used in AI, more exactly — deep learning.About the teachersThe course is taught by the one and only Andrew Ng: co-founder of Coursera, Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and an outspoken AI advocate.ConclusionIt’s the kind of course you need to take if you’re serious about learning AI.Improving Deep Neural NetworksAbout the courseThis is more of a sequel of the previous course and the purpose is to get your knowledge of deep learning one step further. This is where the magic happens in deep learning because it’s more of an empirical process (trial and error) and you need to get a deeper (yeah, that’s a pun) understanding before you know what parameters to tweak.About the teachersThe course is taught by the one and only Andrew Ng: co-founder of Coursera, Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and an outspoken AI advocate.ConclusionYou really need to take this course if you already had taken the previous one.Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep LearningAbout the courseTensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning and this course is about teaching you how to use TensorFlow in your AI applications. As a coder I really enjoyed this course because it has less theory and more practice into it.About the teachersThe course is taught by Laurence Moroney who is an AI advocate at Google and also part of the TensorFlow team. For me, he is one of the best teachers I’ve ever seen.ConclusionIt’s a friendly course for beginners and with lots of hands-on activities.In ProgressConvolutional Neural NetworksAbout the courseThis course touches the concept of computer vision and builds on the knowledge acquired in the previous two courses from the series. I can’t wait to finish it and get more understanding of the computer vision field.About the teachersThe course is taught by the one and only Andrew Ng: co-founder of Coursera, Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and an outspoken AI advocate.Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlowAbout the courseThis is a sequel of Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning course that I’ve already taken and things get even more practical in terms of coding which makes it highly appealing for coders.About the teachersThe course is taught by Laurence Moroney who is an AI advocate at Google and also part of the TensorFlow team. For me, he is one of the best teachers I’ve ever seen.Machine LearningAbout the courseThis is probably the reference course on Machine Learning. It’s by far the longest and the most technical one from all the courses I’ve taken. I believe it’s worth the effort of finishing the course if you are serious about getting a job in AI.About the teachersThe course is taught by the one and only Andrew Ng: co-founder of Coursera, Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and an outspoken AI advocate.Courses I intend to take (BONUS)Learn AI With An AIThis seems really interesting and it’s the next one on my list.Introduction to Computer VisionThis course is a great companion for the Intro to Artificial Intelligence course and I hope it will broaden my knowledge on computer vision.Machine Learning Crash CourseThis one puts more emphasis on the technical side and it’s a good fit after you dabbled with TensorFlow.Intro to Data ScienceOne of the most host jobs in the world right now is the Data Scientist, so I think it’s really useful to have an idea about the field, which intersects with AI.I hope these reviews will be useful for you and I can’t wait to hear your feedback or the experiences you had with other AI courses.If you liked this article and want to see more of these, then follow me on twitter.P.S. I’m an indie maker and I’m writing a book on the basics of AI.

         — 
    


            College career centers used to prepare students for job interviews by helping them learn how to dress appropriately or write a standout cover letter. These days, they’re also trying to brace students for a stark new reality: They may be vetted for jobs in part by artificial intelligence.
    

            At schools such as Duke University, Purdue University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, career counselors are now working to find out which companies use AI and also speaking candidly with students about what, if anything, they can do to win over the algorithms. This shift in preparations comes as more businesses interested in filling internships and entry-level positions that may see a glut of applicants turn to outside companies such as HireVue to help them quickly conduct vast numbers of video interviews.

AI software defines people as male or female. That's a problem




            With HireVue, businesses can pose pre-determined questions — often recorded by a hiring manager — that candidates answer on camera through a laptop or smartphone. Increasingly, those videos are then pored over by algorithms analyzing details such as words and grammar, facial expressions and the tonality of the job applicant’s voice, trying to determine what kinds of attributes a person may have. Based on this analysis, the algorithms will conclude whether the candidate is tenacious, resilient, or good at working on a team, for instance.
    

            Much has been written about the potential of AI to replace human jobs in the future, but the use of services like HireVue highlights a different concern: that AI can act as a gatekeeper for the jobs of today. Companies may not be ready to outsource vetting candidates for C-Suite and executive positions to algorithms, but the stakes are lower for entry-level roles and internships. That means some of today’s college students are effectively the guinea pigs for a largely unproven mechanism for evaluating applicants. 
    

            To make matters more complicated, there is little in the way of regulations or industry standards surrounding disclosure of technology usage -— though Illinois, for example, changed that with a recently-enacted law. So interviewees may not know when (or how) AI is analyzing their interview, and when it isn’t. That creates a sense of uncertainty for those trying to guide college students and new graduates through the interview process, and for the job seekers themselves.
    



        What worries me about AI is AI can’t tell the heart of a person and the drive a person has.

            Sarah Ali, a Duke undergraduate student, has gone through about eight HireVue interviews with various companies for jobs and internships in fields like tech and marketing. Except for the first interview, which helped her snag a marketing internship, none of them led to a job. Even now, she’s unsure what role, if any, AI played in the process — a possibility she only contemplated after speaking with friends about it following the first one.
    

            Even though she landed the internship after that first interview, Ali said she would have done a lot of things differently had she known for sure AI was involved. She might have used key words or phrases that would be picked up by AI and also kept direct eye contact with the camera.
    

            “Once I understood the AI interview process, I definitely started thinking about it as a game and how I could optimize for certain qualities or gestures,” Ali said.

        Why some companies turn to AI in interviews 


            HireVue may be the most well-known video interview company with nearly 800 companies as clients (including CNN, which does not use its AI features). It is used to interview about 1 million people every 90 days, according to HireVue CEO Kevin Parker.
    

            “We’ll interview probably a million college kids this year,” Parker told CNN Business.

            Parker said the Utah-based company began using AI in 2014 as a way to help companies sort through video interviews. He won’t say how many clients use AI assessments today, beyond noting that it’s a “smaller subset” of the companies it works with. HireVue highlights several of them on its website, including multiple Fortune 500 companies, such as Unilever.

            As with other companies like Yobs and Talview that offer AI-based assessments of video interviews, HireVue believes it can be helpful for ushering a massive number of people through the interview process quickly and reviewing them in a fair, consistent way. 
    






A mockup of a report that a company would receive after AI is used to assess a job candidate's HireVue interview, showing how the person compared to others who were interviewed and an average recommendation for the candidate. In this example, the candidate also completed a coding task and answered multiple-choice questions.

HireVue



            Parker said its algorithms consider things such as word usage, pronouns and facial expressions to determine how likely a job candidate is to possess a specific attribute a client is looking for in a certain job, such as empathy or willingness to learn. 
    

            These AI assessments are often used for filling entry-level jobs because candidates don’t have a lot of work history. The goal, according to Parker, is that the AI can act as a way to evaluate abilities and talent.
    

            After an AI assessment is performed on an interview – video interviews can take roughly 20 to 25 minutes –  the client gets a report scoring the candidate on the attributes deemed key to the job. This, Parker said, gives the company offering the job an almost standardized-test-score view of the candidate, showing what they’re good at and how they stand relative to other candidates. A report can also be generated for the job candidate to give them feedback, but it’s up to the employer to share that.
    

            “We recommend that customers do it and I think it’s great feedback for the candidate, but it’s customer specific,” Parker said. It’s unclear how many companies do applicants the courtesy of taking this step.
    






Stephen Roach, a career services consultant at Purdue's Center for Career Opportunities, sometimes takes an almost dismissive approach when coaching students on dealing with AI. ""They can't know how that platform's going to judge them,"" he said.

        “We don’t know what it’s looking for”


            For Meredith McCook, assistant director at the Duke career center, the rise of this kind of interview — via video, and possibly with AI in the background analyzing that video — has meant some changes to how she works with students. She’s often talking to students about the new ways technology may be part of the interview process, and coaching them to practice by doing things such as turning on their laptop’s video camera and spending time talking to it. Duke offers students online video interview practice sessions, too.

            “With AI, we don’t know what it’s looking for,” McCook said. But in case AI is analyzing the interview, she suggests students raise their laptop to be eye level with the camera so it appears they’re maintaining eye contact, even though there isn’t a human on the other side of the lens.
    

            At UNC Charlotte, French is trying to help students become more informed about when AI is being used. This year, he said, the school will be asking employers it partners with whether they use AI for their virtual interviews in hopes of getting some data on how widespread the practice is. 
    

            He remains troubled about the use of AI in the recruitment process, though. “Everyone makes snap judgments on students, on applicants, when first meeting them,” he said. “But what worries me about AI is AI can’t tell the heart of a person and the drive a person has.”

            Others like Stephen Roach, a career services consultant at Purdue’s center for career opportunities, sometimes take an almost dismissive approach when coaching students on dealing with a potential AI assessment. For example, he may tell them not to worry about it, since it’s outside their control.
    

            “If it is looking at their facial expressions or tone of voice, it might just be them being who they are,” he said. “They can’t know how that platform’s going to judge them.”
    

            These career counselors might soon have more tools to help students crack the black box. Interview prep platform Big Interview, which is used by more than 500 colleges and universities including Purdue and UNC Charlotte, is building its own AI system for scoring mock video interviews and giving would-be interviewees feedback. Big Interview cofounder and chief coach Pamela Skillings said the feedback will include details such as how quickly the person speaks and how much confident or negative language they use. The company plans to roll it out next month.
    

            The impetus for developing the tool, Skillings said, is from seeing people getting screened out after doing video interviews and feeling like they “deserve to know how they’re coming across.” 
    






College students and career counselors are still trying to figure out how to deal with the new role that AI plays in job interviews

        But does it even work?


            Regardless of how clued in candidates are to when and how AI evaluates their interviews, plenty of people encountering this kind of interview technology — from college career counselors to AI scholars to technology rights activists — are unconvinced it can really work.
    

            “When you start saying, ‘We’ll use things like cadence and facial animation and things of that nature,’ I’m really skeptical that there’s real validity there,” said Aaron Rieke, a managing director at technology rights nonprofit Upturn.
    

            There are also concerns about how well AI can apply to the interview process. Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton, said that while AI can be helpful at, say, identifying whether a photo contains a cat or a dog, it’s much harder to automate things such as predicting future social outcomes — like who will succeed at a job.
    

            He’s particularly doubtful of companies claiming they can analyze facial expressions in order to assess a person’s suitability for a job. (HireVue’s AI assessments can include this, Parker said, but he stressed that it’s used “very, very little”.)

            One group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, has gone as far as asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue for what it calls “unfair and deceptive trade practices” related to its use of AI — particularly “secret, unproven algorithms” — in the interview process.
    

            HireVue said in a statement that it believes the complaint is without merit. “We uphold the highest levels of rigor and ethics as we work every day to increase fairness and objectivity in the hiring process,” the company said.
    

        Coming face-to-face with artificial intelligence


            To get a sense for what it’s actually like to be knowingly graded by a computer, I recently tried out a simulator that’s available online from Los Angeles-based startup Yobs, which uses AI to help a range of companies.
    

            The interview started with a familiar question: Name your biggest strengths and weaknesses. In the back of my mind, however, I wondered what an algorithm would make of my answer, complete with nervous pauses and frowns.
    






After completing a mock video interview via Yobs, CNN Business' Rachel Metz received an AI assessment scoring her personality traits, including extraversion and agreeableness.

FROM YOBS



            As I stared into my laptop camera, talking to nobody about myself and why I should be a potential employee at the faux Your Dream Company, I couldn’t help but feel a lot more anxious than I ever recall feeling during a phone or in-person interview.
    

            After answering the warm-up question about my strengths and weaknesss, which I was allowed to watch and redo as many times as I wanted, I recorded an ersatz interview where I had to talk about topics such as a time I faced a challenge with a team. Yobs gave me 30 seconds to prepare an answer to each of the questions, and each answer needed to be one to three minutes long. Without a human on the other side of my desk, I struggled to speak for even 40 seconds straight.
    

            The AI assessment of my performance arrived in my inbox soon after. It included computer-generated scores of the so-called Big Five personality traits — including openness and conscientiousness, where I scored highly, and neuroticism where, to my surprise, I scored low. The report also rated me on what are often known as “soft” or interpersonal skills: According to Yobs, my answers indicated a tendency to be cooperative, humble, and analytical, but less likely to be assertive or empathetic.
    

            To score these traits and skills, Yobs cofounder and CEO Raphael Danilo said the company’s AI assessment analyzes what interviewees say and how they say it — a method that sounds similar to HireVue’s. If a video is poor quality or the speaker has an unclear voice, he said, a trained human reviewer (who’s been given guidelines by psychologists working for Yobs on how to measure the same things the AI system is assessing) will look it over. 
    

            Danilo acknowledges that using AI to look over interviews is challenging; he’s not, for instance, comfortable letting it completely automate the hiring process at this point. But he’s convinced it can help employers find good employees quickly.
    

            If you’re looking at 100,000 applications for 500 spots, for instance, “you can’t talk to everybody,” he said. “You can’t take everyone out to lunch. So you have to use signals.”

One group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, has gone as far as asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue for what it calls “unfair and deceptive trade practices” related to its use of AI — particularly “secret, unproven algorithms” — in the interview process. HireVue said in a statement that it believes the complaint is without merit. “We uphold the highest levels of rigor and ethics as we work every day to increase fairness and objectivity in the hiring process,” the company said. Coming face-to-face with artificial intelligence To get a sense for what it’s actually like to be knowingly graded by a computer, I recently tried out a simulator that’s available online from Los Angeles-based startup Yobs, which uses AI to help a range of companies. The interview started with a familiar question: Name your biggest strengths and weaknesses. In the back of my mind, however, I wondered what an algorithm would make of my answer, complete with nervous pauses and frowns. As I stared into my laptop camera, talking to nobody about myself and why I should be a potential employee at the faux Your Dream Company, I couldn’t help but feel a lot more anxious than I ever recall feeling during a phone or in-person interview. After answering the warm-up question about my strengths and weaknesss, which I was allowed to watch and redo as many times as I wanted, I recorded an ersatz interview where I had to talk about topics such as a time I faced a challenge with a team. Yobs gave me 30 seconds to prepare an answer to each of the questions, and each answer needed to be one to three minutes long. Without a human on the other side of my desk, I struggled to speak for even 40 seconds straight. The AI assessment of my performance arrived in my inbox soon after. It included computer-generated scores of the so-called Big Five personality traits — including openness and conscientiousness, where I scored highly, and neuroticism where, to my surprise, I scored low. The report also rated me on what are often known as “soft” or interpersonal skills: According to Yobs, my answers indicated a tendency to be cooperative, humble, and analytical, but less likely to be assertive or empathetic. To score these traits and skills, Yobs cofounder and CEO Raphael Danilo said the company’s AI assessment analyzes what interviewees say and how they say it — a method that sounds similar to HireVue’s. If a video is poor quality or the speaker has an unclear voice, he said, a trained human reviewer (who’s been given guidelines by psychologists working for Yobs on how to measure the same things the AI system is assessing) will look it over.  Danilo acknowledges that using AI to look over interviews is challenging; he’s not, for instance, comfortable letting it completely automate the hiring process at this point. But he’s convinced it can help employers find good employees quickly. If you’re looking at 100,000 applications for 500 spots, for instance, “you can’t talk to everybody,” he said. “You can’t take everyone out to lunch. So you have to use signals.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'dateModified': '2019-08-24T14:03:57Z', 'uploadDate': '2019-05-01T13:21:50Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=business/2019/05/01/artificial-intelligence-changing-work-orig.cnn-business&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_6fe67f94109b7aea0f837afe9e3c3da9@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H01M11S', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': 'How AI is changing the way we work', 'headline': 'How AI is changing the way we work', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize many parts of business, from marketing to supply chain.

<em>AI systems based on machine learning can be used to audit financial data efficiently and look for financial fraud, but ethical risks exist if the data is biased. Dr. Steven Mintz explores the principles governing the ethical use of AI.</em>

</div>
Ethics are important, whether in our personal or professional lives. Most people believe that ethical behavior encompasses standards such as honesty, fairness, integrity, responsibility and accountability. These norms of behavior, along with transparency, underlie ethical systems of artificial intelligence (AI). Ethical AI is the foundation upon which trust in the system is built. About one-third of executives in a Deloitte survey named ethical risks as one of the top three concerns related to <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/4780_State-of-AI-in-the-enterprise/DI_State-of-AI-in-the-enterprise-2nd-ed.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AI.</a>

AI systems pose a diverse set of ethical risks, including how the data is collected and processed. It can be challenging to understand how the system works and the validity of the conclusions reached from the analysis of data. These systems have been referred to as “black boxes,” or a system of automated decision-making often based on <a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/tag/machine-learning/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">machine learning</a> from big data.
<h2>Ethics and AI</h2>
<a href=""https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/2019/kpmg-ethical%20-ai-five-guiding-pillars.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">KPMG identified</a> five principles of ethics and AI:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Transforming the workplace</strong>: Massive change in roles and tasks that define work, along with the rise of powerful analytic and automated decision-making, will cause job displacement and the need for retraining.</li>
 	<li><strong>Establishing oversight and governance</strong>: New regulations will establish guidelines for the ethical use of AI and protect the well-being of the public.</li>
 	<li><strong>Aligning cybersecurity and ethical AI</strong>: Autonomous algorithms give rise to <a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/category/cybersecurity/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">cybersecurity</a> risks and adversarial attacks that can contaminate algorithms by tampering with the data. KPMG reported in its 2019 CEO Outlook that 72 percent of U.S. CEOs agree that strong cybersecurity is critical to engender trust with their key stakeholders, compared with 15 percent in 2018.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mitigating bias</strong>: Understanding the workings of sophisticated, autonomous algorithms is essential to take steps to eliminate unfair bias over time as they continue to evolve.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increasing transparency</strong>: Universal standards for fairness and trust should inform overall management policies for the ethical use of AI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ethical Risks</h2>
AI can improve human decision-making, but it has its limits. The possibility exists that bias in algorithms can create an ethical risk that brings into question the reliability of the data produced by the system. Bias can be accounted for through explainability of the data, reproducibility in testing for consistent results and auditability.

Other ethical risks include a lack of transparency, erosion of privacy, poor accountability and workforce displacement and transitions. The existence of such risks affects whether AI systems should be trusted. To build trust through transparency, organizations should clearly explain what data they collect, how it is used and how the results affect customers.
<h2>Ethics and Accountability</h2>
The “Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019” was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on April 10, 2019 and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill requires an assessment of the risks posed by automated decision systems to the privacy or security of personal information of consumers and the risks that the systems may result in or contribute to inaccurate, unfair, biased or discriminatory decisions impacting consumers.

Governance and accountability issues relate to who creates the ethics standards for AI, who governs the AI system and data, who maintains the internal controls over the data and who is accountable when unethical practices are identified. The internal auditors have an important role to play in this regard. They should assess risk, determine compliance with regulations and report their findings directly to the audit committee of the board of directors.
<h2>Auditing AI Data</h2>
Auditing is the function of examining data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable and the system used to generate it is operating as intended. Data that is biased will produce biased results. For example, a financial institution that grants mortgage loans to white applicants in much larger numbers than minorities may be biased. Assuming the data was biased, machine-learning AI systems would unintentionally reproduce these results over time.

AI auditing works well for a leasing firm with hundreds of lease contracts given the need to verify that each one has been properly recorded either as an asset with future value or expense for the period. AI systems can help to quickly analyze complex contracts to make that determination, but the accounting standards must be accurately inputted so the system knows what to look for.
<h2>Fraud Detection</h2>
The biggest value of using AI in auditing is to detect <a href=""https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/category/fraud/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fraud</a>, the idea being to identify and catch anomalies. For example, a reimbursable expense submitted by an employee should be examined by tying it to a restaurant receipt. What if the receipt for $100 is not based on food ordered but instead is a gift certificate for a friend or family member? The exact amount of the receipt may raise a red flag in an AI-driven, machine learning system where all data is examined, unlike a more traditional data processing system that uses sampled data.

Companies lose an estimated 5 percent of their revenue annually as a result of occupational fraud, according to the 2018 ACFE Report to the Nations. It turns out, the risk of occupational fraud is much higher than many managers and leaders realize. Each case results in a median loss of $130,000; with cases lasting a median of 16 months, fraud is something organizations of all sizes must take care to detect and <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">deter</a>. AI systems can analyze large amounts of data quickly and thoroughly to determine whether assets have been misappropriated.

AI systems can also have predictive value through machine learning and identifying high-risk areas and events. It can devise an accounting fraud prediction model that more accurately calculates the probability of future material misstatements in financial statements and to improve the quality of audits.

Using AI to examine all of the financial data and determine whether financial fraud exists provides a big advantage over previous systems. It affords a higher level of assurance and reduces the risk of fraud.
<h2>Corporate Governance</h2>
Corporate governance is essential to develop and enforce policies, procedures and standards in AI systems. Chief ethics and compliance officers have an important role to play, including identifying ethical risks, managing those risks and ensuring compliance with standards.

Governance structures and processes should be implemented to manage and monitor the organization’s AI activities. The goal is to promote transparency and accountability while ensuring compliance with regulations and that ethical standards are met.

A research study by Genesys found that more than one-half of those surveyed say their companies do not currently have a written policy on the ethical use of AI, although 21 percent expressed a definite concern that their companies could use AI in an ethical manner. The survey included 1,103 employers and 4,207 employees regarding the current and future effects of AI on their workplaces. The 5,310 participants were drawn from six countries: the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Additional results <a href=""https://www.genesys.com/en-gb/company/newsroom/announcements/new-workplace-survey-finds-nearly-80-of-employers-arent-worried-about-unethical-use-of-ai-but-maybe-they-should-be."">include</a>:
<ul>
 	<li>28 percent of employers are apprehensive their companies could face future liability for an unforeseen use of AI.</li>
 	<li>23 percent say there is currently a written corporate policy on the ethical use of AI.</li>
 	<li>40 percent of employers without a written AI ethics policy believe their companies should have one.</li>
 	<li>54 percent of employees believe their companies should have one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
The ethical use of AI should be addressed by all organizations to build trust into the system and satisfy the needs of stakeholders for accurate and reliable information. A better understanding of machine learning would go a long way to achieve this result.

Professional judgment is still necessary in AI to decide on the value of the information produced by the system and its uses in looking for material misstatements and financial fraud. In this regard, the acronym GIGO (“garbage in, garbage out”) may be appropriate. Unless the data is reliably provided and processed, AI will produce results that are inaccurate, incomplete or incoherent, and machine learning would be compromised with respect to ethical AI.",2020-01-16 06:00:36America/Chicago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","Ethical AI is Built On Transparency, Accountability and Trust",2020-01-16 06:00:36,2020-01-15 23:08:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computer algorithm has been shown to be as effective as human radiologists in spotting breast cancer from x-ray images.
The international team behind the study, which includes researchers from Google Health, DeepMind, Imperial College London, the NHS and Northwestern University in the US, designed and trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model on mammography images from almost 29,000 women.
The findings, published in Nature, show the AI was able to correctly identify cancers from the images with a similar degree of accuracy to expert radiologists, and holds the potential to assist clinical staff in practice.
When tested on a large UK dataset as part of the Cancer Research UK-funded OPTIMAM project* and a smaller US dataset from Northwestern University**, the AI also reduced the proportion of screening errors – where cancer was either incorrectly identified or where it may have been missed.
Screening programmes remain one of the best tools at our disposal for catching cancer early and improving outcomes for patients, but many challenges remain – not least the current volume of images radiologists must review. Lord Ara Darzi Imperial College London
According to the researchers, the work demonstrates how the AI could potentially be applied in clinical settings around the world.
The team highlights that such AI tools could support clinical decision-making in the future as well as alleviate the pressure on healthcare systems internationally by supporting the workload of clinical reviewers.
Dominic King, UK Lead at Google Health, said: “Our team is really proud of these research findings, which suggest that we are on our way to developing a tool that can help clinicians spot breast cancer with greater accuracy. Further testing, clinical validation and regulatory approvals are required before this could start making a difference for patients, but we’re committed to working with our partners towards this goal.”
Professor the Lord Ara Darzi of Denham, one of the authors of the paper and director of the Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre and the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London, said: “Screening programmes remain one of the best tools at our disposal for catching cancer early and improving outcomes for patients, but many challenges remain – not least the current volume of images radiologists must review.
“While these findings are not directly from the clinic, they are very encouraging, and they offer clear insights into how this valuable technology could be used in real life.
“There will of course a number of challenges to address before AI could be implemented in mammography screening programmes around the world, but the potential for improving healthcare and helping patients is enormous.”
REDUCING FALSE FINDINGS
In the UK, it’s estimated that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, with the risk increasing with age. Early detection and treatment provide the best outcome for women, but accurately detecting and diagnosing breast cancer remains a significant challenge.
Women aged between 50 and 71 are invited to receive a mammogram on the NHS every three years, where an x-ray of the breast tissue is used to look for abnormal growths or changes which may be cancerous. While screening is highly effective and the majority of cancers are picked up during the process, even with significant clinical expertise human interpretation of the x-rays is open to errors.***

In the latest study, researchers at Google Health trained an AI model on depersonalised patient data – using mammograms from women in the UK and US where any information that could be used to identify them was removed.
The AI model reviewed tens of thousands of images, which had been previously interpreted by expert radiologists. But while the human experts had access to the patient’s history when interpreting scans, the AI had only the most recent mammogram to go on.
During the evaluation, the researchers found their AI model could predict breast cancer from scans with a similar level of accuracy overall to expert radiographers (or were shown to be ‘non-inferior’). Compared to human interpretation, the AI showed an absolute reduction in the proportion of cases where cancer was incorrectly identified (5.7%/1.2% in the UK and US data respectively), as well as cases where cancer was missed (9.4%/2.7% in UK/US data).
INCREASING EFFICIENCY
Beyond the AI model’s potential to support and improve clinical decision-making, the researchers also looked to see if their model could improve reader efficiency. While the AI did not surpass the double-reader benchmark, statistically it performed no worse than the second reader.
In a small secondary analysis, they simulated the AI’s role in the double-reading process – used by the NHS. In this process, scans are interpreted by two separate radiologists, each of whom would review the scan and recommend a follow up or no action. Any positive finding is referred for biopsy and in cases where the two readers disagree, the case goes to a third clinical reviewer for decision.
The simulation compared the AI’s decision with that of the first reader. Scans were only sent to a second reviewer if there was a disagreement between the first reader and the AI. The findings showed that using the AI in this way could reduce the workload of the second reviewer by as much as 88%, which could ultimately help to triage patients in a shorter timeframe.
According to the team, the findings are exciting and show how AI could assist healthcare screening services around the world. One such practical application could include providing automatic real-time feedback on mammography images, awarding a statistical score which could be used to triage suspected cases more quickly.
However, the researchers add that further testing in larger populations is required.
Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said: “These results highlight the significant role that AI could play in the future of cancer care. Embracing technology like this may help improve the way we diagnose cancer in the years to come.
“Screening helps diagnose breast cancer at an early stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful, ensuring more people survive the disease. But it also has harms such as diagnosing cancers that would never have gone on to cause any problems and missing some cancers.
""This is still early stage research, but it shows how AI could improve breast cancer screening and ease pressure off the NHS. And while further clinical studies are needed to see how and if this technology could work in practice, the initial results are promising.”
This research received support from the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre.

‘International evaluation of an artificial intelligence system to identify breast cancer in screening mammography’ by Scott Mayer McKinney et al. is published in Nature. 
*The UK dataset included mammograms from 25,856 women screened on the NHS at three NHS hospital trusts as part of the Cancer Research UK-funded OPTIMAM project. Data were depersonalised, which included medical history and notes but removing any information which could be used to identify an individual. 
**The US dataset captured mammograms from 3097 women at the Northwestern Medicine. 
***According to a 2011 review of the national breast cancer screening programme in the UK, the service resulted in thousands of cases of overdiagnosis and false positives every year. A false positive result is where the initial scan incorrectly identifies cancer but the patient is later cleared. Overdiagnosis resulted in unnecessary treatment for cancer – including biopsy and breast tissue removal. The report suggested there may be as many as 7,000 unnecessary breast cancer diagnoses in the UK each year.SOURCE: https://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/01January/Pages/breast-cancer-screening-reviewed.aspx

Algorithms help target ads about new positions, sort through resumes, and even analyze applicants’ facial expressions during video job interviews. But these systems are opaque, and we often have no idea how artificial intelligence-based systems are sorting, scoring, and ranking our applications.It’s not just that we don’t know how these systems work. Artificial intelligence can also introduce bias and inaccuracy to the job application process, and because these algorithms largely operate in a black box, it’s not really possible to hold a company that uses a problematic or unfair tool accountable.A new Illinois law — one of the first of its kind in the US — is supposed to provide job candidates a bit more insight into how these unregulated tools actually operate. But it’s unlikely the legislation will change much for applicants. That’s because it only applies to a limited type of AI, and it doesn’t ask much of the companies deploying it.Set to take effect January 1, 2020, the state’s Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act has three primary requirements. First, companies must notify applicants that artificial intelligence will be used to consider applicants’ “fitness” for a position. Those companies must also explain how their AI works and what “general types of characteristics” it considers when evaluating candidates. In addition to requiring applicants’ consent to use AI, the law also includes two provisions meant to protect their privacy: It limits who can view an applicant’s recorded video interview to those “whose expertise or technology is necessary” and requires that companies delete any video that an applicant submits within a month of their request. As Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the technology rights nonprofit Upturn, told Recode about the law, “This is a pretty light touch on a small part of the hiring process.” For one thing, the law only covers artificial intelligence used in videos, which constitutes a small share of the AI tools that can be used to assess job applicants. And the law doesn’t guarantee that you can opt out of an AI-based review of your application and still be considered for a role (all the law says is that a company has to gain your consent before using AI; it doesn’t require that hiring managers give you an alternative method).“It’s hard to feel that that consent is going to be super meaningful if the alternative is that you get no shot at the job at all,” said Rieke. He added that there’s no guarantee that the consent and explanation the law requires will be useful; for instance, the explanation could be so broad and high-level that it’s not helpful.“If I were a lawyer for one of these vendors, I would say something like, ‘Look, we use the video, including the audio language and visual content, to predict your performance for this position using tens of thousands of factors,’” said Rieke. “If I was feeling really conservative, I might name a couple general categories of competency.” (He also points out that the law doesn’t define artificial intelligence, which means it’s difficult to tell what companies and what types of systems the law actually applies to).Because the law is limited to AI that’s used in video interviews, the company it most clearly applies to is Utah-based HireVue, a popular job interview platform that offers employers an algorithm-based analysis of recorded video interviews. Here’s how it works: You answer pre-selected questions over your computer or phone camera. Then, an algorithm developed by HireVue analyzes how you’ve answered the questions, and sometimes even your facial expressions, to make predictions about your fit for a particular position. HireVue says it already has about 100 clients using this artificial intelligence-based feature, including major companies like Unilever and Hilton. Some candidates who have used HireVue’s system complain that the process is awkward and impersonal. But that’s not the only problem. Algorithms are not inherently objective, and they reflect the data used to train them and the people that design them. That means they can inherit, and even amplify, societal biases, including racism and sexism. And even if an algorithm is explicitly instructed not to consider factors like a person’s name, it can still learn proxies for protected identities (for instance, an algorithm could learn to discriminate against people who have gone to a women’s college). Facial recognition tech, in particular, has faced criticism for struggling to identify and characterize the faces of people with darker skin, women, and trans and non-binary people, among other minority groups. Critics also say that emotion (or affect) recognition technology in particular, which purports to make judgments about a person’s emotions based on their facial expressions, is scientifically flawed. That’s why one research nonprofit, the AI Now Institute, called for the prohibition of such technology in high-stakes decision-making — including job applicant vetting.“[W]hile you’re being interviewed, there’s a camera that’s recording you, and it’s recording all of your micro facial expressions and all of the gestures you’re using, the intonation of your voice, and then pattern matching those things that they can detect with their highest performers,” AI Now Institute co-founder Kate Crawford told Recode’s Kara Swisher earlier this year. “[It] might sound like a good idea, but think about how you’re basically just hiring people who look like the people you already have.”Even members of Congress are worried about that technology. In 2018, US Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Patty Murray wrote to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency charged with investigating employment discrimination, asking whether such facial analysis technology could violate anti-discrimination laws. Despite being one of the first laws to regulate these tools, the Illinois law doesn’t address concerns about bias. No federal legislation explicitly regulates these AI-based hiring systems. Instead, employment lawyers say such AI tools are generally subject to the Uniform Guidelines, employment discrimination standards created by several federal agencies back in 1978 (you can read more about that here). The EEOC did not respond to Recode’s multiple requests for comment.Meanwhile, it’s not clear how, under Illinois’ new law, companies like HireVue will go about explaining the characteristics in applicants that its AI considers, given that the company claims that its algorithms can weigh up to tens of thousands of factors (it says it removes factors that are not predictive of job success).The law also doesn’t explain what an applicant might be entitled to if a company violates one of its provisions. Law firms advising clients on compliance have also noted that it’s not clear whether the law applies exclusively to businesses filling a position in Illinois, or just interviews that take place in the state. Neither Illinois State Sen. Iris Martinez nor Illinois Rep. Jaime M. Andrade, legislators who worked on the law, responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.HireVue’s CEO Kevin Parker said in a blog post that the law “entails very little, if any, change” because its platform already complies with GDPR’s principles of transparency, privacy, and the right to be forgotten. “[W]e believe every job interview should be fair and objective, and that candidates should understand how they’re being evaluated. This is fair game, and it’s good for both candidates and companies,” he wrote in August.A spokesperson for HireVue said the decision to provide an alternative to an AI-based analysis is up to the company that’s hiring, but argued that those alternatives can more time-consuming for candidates. If a candidate believes that a system is biased, the spokesperson said recourse options “are the same as when a candidate believes that any part of the hiring process, or any individual interviewer, was unfairly biased against them.”Under the new law in Illinois, if you participate in a video interview that uses AI tech, you can ask for your footage to be deleted after the fact. But it’s worth noting that the law appears to still give the company enough time to train its model on the results of your job interview — even if you think the final decision was problematic.“This gives these AI hiring companies room to continue to learn,” says Rieke. “They’re going to delete the underlying video, but any learning or improvement to their systems they get to keep.” Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

Data science is booming and starting to replace legacy engineering roles across U.S. organizations today.
More than 50% of this year’s list was made up of roles related to engineering or development, with the emerging field of robotics appearing for the first time.
Blockchain Developer was dropped from the list this year, which LinkedIn says is not surprising given the fluctuating popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.




These and many other fascinating insights are from LinkedIn’s 3rd annual 2020 Emerging Jobs Report announced last month on their blog which lists the top 15 emerging jobs in 11 different nations. LinkedIn provides employment forecasts including the fastest-growing jobs, skills needed to excel at them, and the cities and industries where these jobs are located. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom and United States are profiled. All country reports are available here. The LinkedIn 2020 Emerging Jobs Report for the United States is available here in PDF form.

The top 15 emerging jobs include the following:



Artificial Intelligence Specialist - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have both become synonymous with innovation, and LinkedIn data shows that’s more than just buzz. Hiring growth for this role has grown 74% annually in the past 4 years and encompasses a few different titles within the space that all have a very specific set of skills despite being spread across industries, including artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer. According to Indeed, Machine Learning Engineer job openings grew 344% between 2015 to 2018 and have an average base salary of $146,085 according their  Best Jobs In The U.S. Study. 
Robotics Engineer – LinkedIn is seeing a 40% annual increase in demand for technical professionals with robotics expertise today. Robotics is an industry on fire according to LinkedIn’s study. UiPath, one of the most popular robotics solutions, was just valued at $7B, and the industry as a whole is projected to continue this upward momentum. Careers in Robotics Engineering can vary greatly between software and hardware roles, and LinkedIn data shows engineers working on both virtual and physical bots are on the rise.
Data Scientist – LinkedIn is seeing a 37% annual increase in demand for Data Scientists and related technical positions today. Data Science is another field that has topped the LinkedIn Emerging Jobs list for three years running. It’s a specialty that’s continuing to grow significantly across all industries. LinkedIn data indicates some of this growth can likely be attributed to the evolution of previously existing jobs, like Statisticians, and increased emphasis on data in academic research.
Full Stack Engineer - While not a new job, the rapid pace of change in technology has made full stack developers a valuable asset to any company. Not only is this the second year this role has made the Emerging Jobs list, since 2015 hiring growth for this profession has been 35% every year from a wide range of developer and engineering backgrounds.
Site Reliability Engineer - LinkedIn is seeing a 34% annual increase in demand for Site Reliability Engineers today. Responsible for ensuring that development and operational processes are running smoothly, the demand for this job will likely continue to rise as long as we’re using technology in our day-to-day lives. As a bonus, the skills required are transferable to many different engineering roles, such as Cloud Engineer or Full Stack Engineer.
Customer Success Specialist - Also fueled by the growth of technology services that require hands-on support, Customer Success roles are on the upswing according to LinkedIn’s latest emerging jobs report. An earlier report found that job posts on LinkedIn for Customer Success Manager in the U.S. grew 34% in 2018, and 72% of professionals currently in the role are in the Software & IT industry. These professionals typically have a hybrid of soft and hard skills, as they’re responsible for both understanding the technology and managing the customer relationship.
Sales Development Representative – LinkedIn is seeing a 34% annual increase in demand for professionals with Salesforce technical expertise combined with selling experience. While sales development representative (SDR) has been on the Emerging Jobs list more than once, it’s not because it’s on the cutting edge. The skills needed for the job have remained largely unchanged since 2015–Salesforce know-how and cold-calling still make up a large part of the job. It’s the continued explosive growth of technology services that rely on SDRs to find new customers that keep this job on the list.
Data Engineer - Data has quickly become every company’s most valuable resource, and they need savvy engineers that can build infrastructure to keep it organized. The hiring growth rate of professionals in this emerging job has increased by nearly 35% since 2015, and industries from Retail to Automotive are snapping up this hard-to-hire talent. Interestingly, Amazon Web Services has emerged as one of the top skills held by Data Engineers, something that didn’t show up in the LinkedIn analysis of professionals who held this role in 2015.
Behavioral Health Technician - LinkedIn is seeing a 32% annual increase in demand for healthcare professionals in this field today. Increased health insurance coverage for mental health and substance abuse treatment has created this increased demand for Behavioral Health Technicians, many of whom specialize in working with patients who have autism or behavioral disorders and are working with children in school environments. The path to becoming a Behavioral Health Technician is varied, given that training for the role doesn’t require a specific degree, providing an opportunity for professionals from all backgrounds to join this emerging field.
Cybersecurity Specialist - Projected to be one of the fastest growing areas of IT investment in 2020, LinkedIn is seeing a 30% annual increase in demand for Cybersecurity Specialists and technical professionals with expertise in this area. It’s no secret that cybersecurity is top of mind for every company, something that’s made more apparent by the addition of Cybersecurity Specialist to this year’s Emerging Jobs list. The growth and importance of this role are likely to continue as reports show data breaches have increased more than 50% in 2019 over this time last year. And it looks like Washington is taking note, as a large number of available jobs are in D.C. and the surrounding area.
Back End Developer - LinkedIn is seeing a 30% annual increase in demand for technical professionals with expertise in Node.js, JavaScript, Amazon Web Services, Git, and MongoDB, the most in-demand skills for Back End Developers today. Back End Developer is another engineering job that’s likely to continue to grow as virtually every company builds a digital property. It’s also a job that can largely be done from anywhere, offering an opportunity for remote work.
Chief Revenue Officer - LinkedIn is seeing a 28% annual increase in demand for this position today as senior management teams look to add valuable expertise in strategic partnerships, go-to-market strategies and sales management. Having a Chief Revenue Officer is somewhat of a new concept, born out of the need to better understand the roles both sales and marketing play in making a company money. The most successful CROs have a strong intuitive sense of how to orchestrate sales and marketing to drive more deals and close the most valuable opportunities in the pipeline. As the two fields have become more intertwined, having a CRO at the helm to lead the combined strategies of two teams has become increasingly important. Based on LinkedIn data, this role is flourishing today.
Cloud Engineer - LinkedIn is seeing a 27% annual increase in demand for this position today. Cloud computing changed the game for companies that wanted to build products without needing their own servers, and every year the cloud becomes more integral to every businesses’ operations and IT platforms. Cloud Engineers will likely be a continuing need across the country in all industries for the long-term as more companies adopt an integrated strategy of using existing on-premise systems with cloud platforms.
JavaScript Developer - LinkedIn is seeing a 25% annual increase in demand for this position today. JavaScript Developer continues to be one of the most in-demand roles in the country, as are the skills associated with it, and JavaScript is among the top five in-demand skills in the software industry overall. Skills required for the job include knowledge of React.js, Node.js, AngularJS, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Product Owner - - LinkedIn is seeing a 24% annual increase in demand for this position today. Product Owners support the product development process and act in many companies as a Product Manager. Unlike many traditional Product Manager roles, Product Owner doesn’t always require a technical degree as a minimum requirement. Product Owners often have many different tasks and projects they’re responsible for as they are responsible for the success of their product lines in-market. They often do market research, sales training and enablement and have deep expertise with customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing automation systems. Skills unique to the Product Owner job include Agile Methodologies, Scrum, Product Management, Software Development, and JIRA.

As companies double down on business initiatives built around technologies like predictive analytics, machine learning, and cognitive computing, there’s one element they ignore at their peril — humans.
That was the message from a pair of experts at a recent MIT Sloan Management Review webinar, “People-Centered Principles for AI Implementation.” As organizations push forward on their artificial intelligence  journey, they should strive to put individuals at the center of the design process, the experts advised.

“When we talk about people-centered, it is really the idea that AI technology should be amplifying human strengths,” explained David Bray, executive director of the People-Centered Internet coalition and former CIO of the FCC. “It’s about providing and informing [systems] with data to allow people more opportunities in their work.”
A natural progression
For all the hype surrounding AI, the technology is hardly a newcomer. Early derivatives surfaced in the 1970s and 1980s in the form of decision-support and expert systems. Today, organizations are progressing from a foundation of big data and predictive analytics to machine learning, neural networks, and eventually to fully autonomous AI.
Fueled by the rise of cloud computing, there is now ample memory, storage, and computational horsepower to handle sophisticated algorithms that were developed in the past but not put to use due to the limitations of technology, said Bray, who is also a senior fellow at the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition.
Companies have been collecting data and are now in the process of transforming that data into insights that will empower more informed decision-making. “We go from data to information flows to insight, and then [from] insight to action,” he explained. “That’s the data-decision paradigm we’re aiming for.”
While AI has cycled through periods of heated interest and winters of stagnation, the time has come for all to get serious about advancing people-centered AI initiatives to stay abreast of the competition, said Bray and his co-presenter, R. “Ray” Wang, CEO of Constellation Research. The pair provided this roadmap for getting started:
1. Classify what you're trying to accomplish with AI
Most organizations are pursuing initiatives to do the following:
Automate tasks with machines so humans can focus on strategic initiatives.
Augment — applying intelligence and algorithms to build on people’s skill sets.
Discover — find patterns that wouldn’t be detected otherwise.
Aid in risk mitigation and compliance.
2. Embrace three guiding principles 
Transparency. Whenever possible, make the high-level implementation details of an AI project available to all involved. This will help people understand what artificial intelligence is, how it works, and what data sets are involved.
Explainability. Ensure employees and external stakeholders understand how any AI system arrives at its contextual decisions —specifically, what method was used to tune the algorithms and how decision-makers will leverage any conclusions.
Reversibility. Organizations must also be able to reverse what deep learning knows: The ability to unlearn certain knowledge or data helps protect against unwanted biases in data sets. Reversibility is something that must be designed into the conception of an AI effort and often will require cross-functional expertise and support, the experts said.
3. Establish data advocates
When it comes to data, the saying, “garbage in, garbage out” holds. Some companies are installing chief data officers to oversee data practices, but Bray and Wang said that’s not enough.
The pair suggested identifying stakeholders across the entire organization who understand the quality issues and data risks and who will work from a people-centered code of ethics. These stakeholders are responsible for ensuring data sets are appropriate and for catching any errors or flaws in data sets or AI outputs early.
“It’s got to be a cavalry — it can’t be relegated to just a few people in the organization,” Bray said. One approach the experts suggested is to appoint an ombuds function that brings together stakeholders from different business units as well as outside constituents.
4. Practice “mindful monitoring”
Creating a process for testing data sets for bias can help reduce risk. Bray and Wang suggested identifying three pools of data sets: Trusted data used to train the AI implementation; a queued data pool of potentially worthwhile data; and problematic or unreliable data. And data should be regularly assessed — for example, whether previously approved trusted data is still relevant or unreliable, or if queued data has a newfound role in improving the existing pool of trusted data for specific actions.
5. Ground your expectations
Managing expectations of internal and external stakeholders is crucial to long-term success. To gain consensus and keep focus on a people-oriented AI agenda, organizations should ask and answer such questions as: What is our obligation to society? What are the acknowledged unknowns? What are responsible actions or proactive things we can accomplish with AI implementations, and what are the proper safeguards?
In the end, it makes sense to approach AI as an experimental learning activity, with ups, downs, and delays. “There will periods of learning, periods of diminished returns, and [times when] the exponential gain actually benefits the organization,” Bray said. “You need to be grounded and say, ‘This is how we’ve chosen to position ourselves.’ It will serve as your North Star as you move towards the final goal.”

Two Cents: Why Artificial Intelligence can’t replace us

        With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, should you be afraid of your job being replaced by a robot? Our writer gives his two cents on whether you should.    


        By: Daniel Teo | January 2, 2020

I would be lying to you if the thought of losing my job to Artificial Intelligence (AI) didn’t cross my mind. And with AI slowly but surely becoming a common sight among us – from businesses to even our homes – it’s hard for it not to.
In fact, there are many jobs (ones that involve manual and repetitive processes) that have already been affected and even replaced by AI and automation. So the threat is real.
But as I write this Two Cents piece, I thought to myself – surely an AI or robot can’t do this. Well, they might be able to churn out a 1,000 or even 1,000,000 words report. But there is one thing that an AI lacks and will always do – creativity. And that is something only a human like you and me are capable of.
There is, however, one thing that puts us at a disadvantage against AI – we make mistakes. That is what make us humans. And that is where AI’s role come into play. Not to replace us, but to help eradicate human error and assist us in doing our job better, faster and at a lower cost by automating routine processes.
One of the advantages AI has is the ability to use machine learning technology to gather data which can be used to predict customer preferences and offer them better and personalised experience.
The hiring process will also be sped up and match jobs more accurately with the data gathered by AI. It will also help make life easier and more efficient as routine tasks such as scheduling of appointments and even transcribing of minutes can be done by an AI assistant. This will free us up to do more strategic work.
So the role of AI is really to replace tasks, not jobs.
In fact according to a study by McKinsey, automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next decade. However it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the type of work they entail.
So let’s face it. There’s no escaping from the inevitable invasion (or should I say collaboration) of AI as the world looks to work smarter and better. And most, if not all of our jobs will be affected by AI in one way or another. More so for jobs that are manual and repetitive in nature, and do not require a whole deal of human creativity and touch such as administration, concierges, banking services, manufacturing, factory work and cashiers.
But will it completely replace all our jobs and put us on permanent gardening leave? The answer is no. Not if your job requires any aspect of creativity and human touch which AI cannot duplicate.
For example, a teacher cannot be replaced by a robot as it does not have the ability to nurture and educate a child like a caring and passionate teacher can. Would you want your child to be taught by a lifeless and emotionless robot teacher?
How about designers, doctors, nurses and counsellors? Can AI and robots design, care for us or understand our problems? And this is just a few of the countless of jobs that are simply not replaceable by a robot.
Lee Kai Fu, dubbed the face of AI in China and a former vice president at Apple, Microsoft and Google, said on CBS’s ’60 Minutes’, “I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don’t understand.”
“I believe there’s a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms.”
In fact, the rise of AI will make us realize even more how important the human touch is in the world we live and work in, thus creating more jobs. More importantly, it challenges us to make use of AI and technology to work smarter and more creatively.
At the end of the day, the real human intelligence will prevail. Not the artificial one.
According to a report from the World Economic Forum (WEF), while 75 million jobs are expected to be displaced by 2022, machines and algorithms in the workplace are expected to create 133 million new roles.
So no, AI is not here to replace our jobs. It’s here to help us do better at what we do.

It is just one of Google’s ventures into medicine. Computers can be trained to recognize patterns and interpret images, and the company has already created algorithms to help detect lung cancers on CT scans, diagnose eye disease in people with diabetes and find cancer on microscope slides.“This paper will help move things along quite a bit,” said Dr. Constance Lehman, director of breast imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “There are challenges to their methods. But having Google at this level is a very good thing.”Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Denise Grady has been a science reporter for The Times since 1998.

Davenport and Steven Miller

The coding of medical diagnosis and treatment has always been a challenging issue. Translating a patient’s complex symptoms, and a clinician’s efforts to address them, into a clear and unambiguous classification code was difficult even in simpler times. Now, however, hospitals and health insurance companies want very detailed information on what was wrong with a patient and the steps taken to treat them— for clinical record-keeping, for hospital operations review and planning, and perhaps most importantly, for financial reimbursement purposes.


More Codes, More Complexity

The current international standard for medical coding is ICD-10 (the tenth version of International Classification of Disease codes), from the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD‑10 has over 14,000 codes for diagnoses. The next update to this international standard, ICD-11, has already been formally adopted by WHO member states in May 2019. WHO member states, including the US, will begin implementation of ICD-11 as of January 2022. The new ICD-11 has over 55,000 diagnostic codes, four times the number of diagnostic codes contained in the WHO’s ICD-10.  
DENVER, CO - NOVEMBER 25: The ICD-10 code for being burned due to water-skis on fire on the computer ... [+] of Dr. David Opperman at the Colorado Voice Clinic on November 25, 2015 in Denver, Colorado. Opperman like many other doctors are having to deal with the new 69,000 diagnostic codes to describe issues the aliments of their patients including burned while water skiing and injured in spacecraft collision.

PROMOTED
In fact, there are even substantially more codes than the numbers given above, at least in the United States.  An enhanced version of IDC-10 that is specific to usage in the United States has about 140,000 classification codes, about 70,000 for diagnosis, and another 70,000 codes for classifying treatments.  We expect the enhanced version of IDC-11 that will be specific to usage in the US to have at least several times number of codes in the WHO version of IDC-11 given that the US version also includes treatment codes and has previously included a larger number of diagnostic codes as well.  
No human being can remember all the codes for diseases and treatments, especially as the number of codes has climbed over the decades to tens of thousands. For decades, medical coders have relied on “code books” to look up the right code for classifying a disease or treatment. Thumbing through a reference book of codes obviously slowed down the process. And it is not just a matter of finding the right code. There are interpretation issues. With ICD-10 and prior versions of the classification scheme, there is often more than one way to code a diagnosis or treatment, and the medical coder has to decide on the most appropriate choices.

Over the past 20 years, the usage of computer-assisted coding systems has steadily increased across the healthcare industry as a means of coping with the increasing complexity of coding diagnosis and treatments. More recent versions of computer-assisted coding systems have incorporated state-of-the-art machine learning methods and other aspects of  artificial intelligence to enhance the system’s ability to analyze the clinical documentation—charts and notes—and determine which codes are relevant to a particular case. Some medical coders are now working hand-in-hand with AI-enhanced computer-assisted coding systems to identify and validate the correct codes.

Elcilene Moseley and AI-Assisted Coding
Elcilene Moseley lives in Florida and is an 11-year veteran medical coder. She previously worked for a company that owned multiple hospitals, but she now works for a coding services vendor that has a contract for coding in the same hospitals Moseley used to work for. She does her work from home, generally working for eight hours to do a certain number of patient charts per day. She specializes in outpatient therapies, often including outpatient surgeries.

Moseley is acutely aware of the increased complexity of coding and is a big supporter of the AI-enhanced com coding system—developed by her employer—that suggests codes for her to review. “It’s gotten so detailed—right side, left side, fracture displaced or not—there’s no way I can remember everything.” However, she notes, “AI only goes so far.” For example, the system may process the text in a chart document, note that the patient has congestive heart failure, and select that disease as a code for diagnosis and reimbursement. But that particular diagnosis is in the patient’s history, not what he or she is being treated for now. “Sometimes I’m amazed at how accurate the system’s coding is,” she says. “But sometimes it makes no sense.”
When Moseley opens a chart, on the left side of each page there are codes with pointers to where the code came from in the chart report. Some coders don’t bother to read the patient chart from beginning to end, but Moseley believes it’s important to do so. “Maybe I am a little old fashioned,” she admits, “but it’s more accurate when I read it.” She acknowledges that the system makes you faster, “but it can also make you a little lazy.”
Some patient cases are relatively simple to code, others more complex. “If it’s just an appendectomy for a healthy patient,” Moseley says, “I can check all the codes and get through it in five minutes.” This is despite multiple sections on a chart for even a simple surgery, including patient physical examination, anesthesiology, pathology, etc. On the other hand, she notes,If it’s a surgery on a 75-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer, I have to code their medical history, what meds they are taking—it takes much longer. And the medical history codes are important because if the patient has multiple diagnoses, it means the physician is spending more time. Those ‘evaluation and management’ codes are important for correctly reimbursing the physician and the hospital.

Moseley and other coders are held to a 95% coding quality standard, and their work is audited every three months to ensure they meet it.
When Moseley first began to use AI-enhanced coding a couple of years ago, she was suspicious of it because she thought it might put her out of a job. Now, however, she believes that will never happen and human coders will always be necessary. She notes that medical coding is so complex and there are so many variables, and so many specific circumstances. Due to this complexity, she believes that coding will never be fully automated. She has effectively become a code supervisor and auditor—checking the codes the system assigns and verifying if system recommendations are appropriate for the specific case. In her view,  all coders will eventually transition to roles of auditor and supervisor of the AI-enabled coding system. The AI system simply makes coders too productive to not use it.
Educating Coders
Moseley has a two-year “Associate of Science in Medical Billing and Coding” degree. In addition, she holds several different coding certifications—for general coding and in her specialty fields like emergency medicine. Keeping the certifications active requires regular continuing education units and tests.
Not all coders, however, have this much training. Moseley says that there are lots of “sketchy” schools that offer online training in medical coding. They often overpromise about the prospects of a  lucrative job—with an up to $100,000 annual salary—if a student takes a coding course for six months. Working from home is another appealing aspect of these jobs.
The problem is that hospitals and coding services firms want experienced coders, not entry-level hires with inadequate training. The more straightforward and simpler coding decisions are made by AI; more complex coding decisions and audits require experts. The “newbies” may be certified, Moseley says, but without prior experience they have a difficult time getting jobs. It would require too much on-the-job training by their employers to make them effective. The two professional associations for medical coding, AAPC (originally the American Academy of Professional Coders) and AHIMA (American Health Information Management Association), both have Facebook pages for their members to discuss issues in the coding field. Moseley says they are replete with complaints about the inability to find the entry-level jobs promised by the coding schools.
For Elcilene Moseley, however, coding—especially with the help of AI—is a good job. She finds it interesting and relatively well-paid. Her work at home—at any hour of the day or night—provides her with a high level of flexibility. If she didn’t like her current position, she is constantly approached by headhunters about other coding jobs. Moseley argues that the only medical coders who are suffering from the use of AI are those at the entry level and those who refuse to learn the new skills to work with a smart machine.

The release of the film “Dolittle” has landed with a thud. During its first week, the box office receipts came to a disappointing $29.5 million. Keep in mind that the film–which stars Robert Downey Jr.–cost Universal Pictures $175 million to produce. 


Of course, Hollywood film-making is a boom-bust business. But might fast evolving technologies like AI improve the odds?

Perhaps so.

Just look at Warner Bros. The company recently struck a deal with Cinelytic, which has built an AI-infused project management system. It is focused on the green-lighting process, such as by helping to predict the potential profits on new films. 

PROMOTED
Now this is not to imply that Cinelytic has essentially cloned the genius of Steven Spielberg or James Cameron. Rather, the technology helps with the myriad of smaller tasks, such as analyzing the impact on territories, the bidding process for talent and so on. This should free up time for filmmakers to work on more important tasks. 
There are other startups gunning for this market opportunity, like Pex. The company has an AI-driven platform that analyzes movie trailers to determine the potential revenue generation. This is done by crunching data like views, shares, likes and other forms of online engagement. As a result, a studio can change a trailer to make it more impactful.

Richard Boyd, who is the co-founder and CEO of Tanjo: “AI is absolutely an effective solution to the question of content development. Netflix, Amazon and Google all know that if you want to understand people, you don’t ask them questions, you monitor what they do with their time, money, and attention.”
Bret Greenstein, who is the Global Vice President and Head of AI at Cognizant: “AI can absolutely help Hollywood reduce risk, in the same way it is reducing risk in other industries. This has nothing to do with computer generated imagery (CGI). Rather, it is about quantifying and analyzing content, understanding and predicting audience preferences, and creating models that allow more experimentation with color, images, costumes, cgi, and dialog to predict the best outcomes for a film. With AI, it may be possible to quickly edit content based on sudden societal changes that would impact the audience. Understanding, for example, recent news and events might cause a director to decide to rapidly adjust dialog or even visuals to avoid backlash.” 
Ganesh Sankaralingam, the Director of Data Science and Machine Learning at Latent View Analytics: “Today there's a wealth of actionable data available that movie studios and streaming entertainment companies can use to manage risk. Using AI and advanced analytics can not only help mitigate against box office flops, but also identify potential hits. After all, every Hollywood studio except Paramount turned down ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and there are countless other examples. So by keeping close tabs on what audiences watch and categorizing that data, studios can develop ‘taste communities.’ These communities can highlight overlaps between actors, directors and genres that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.”

The Nagging Issues
There should still be tempering of expectations with AI and Hollywood. Let’s face it, how much do we really know about the creative process? Well, it’s still very sketchy.
And besides, there are so many variables that can determine the success or failure of a film.
“AI might find that certain actors and types of dialogue and plot structures worked well in the 1980s and without any current movies with similar properties there is no reason for an AI to expect that the same recipe that worked in the 1980s won't still work now,” said Noah Giansiracusa, who is an assistant professor of Mathematics and Data Science at Bentley University. “Of course, such a movie may in fact do well for reasons of nostalgia, but whether the AI ‘grasps’ this nostalgia effect really comes down to whether there are enough similar movies produced in recent times to develop an expectation of modern performance. Another serious issue is that AI reflects all the biases and prejudice that have become embedded in data. If women and minorities have not done as well as white men as leads and writers and directors in the box office, then every AI algorithm we currently have will anticipate that trend continues and could potentially trap us in shortsighted thinking rather than recognizing that change is possible.”
In other words, don’t expect AI to put creative people out of work any time soon. But then again, the technology is likely to be a great help in the film-making process. 
“AI is a tool,” said Greenstein. “Judgement of people is essential. Judgement informed by AI will make big money in the box office.”

Job Search 2020: AI Is the New Gatekeeper to Your Dream Career
Not only do we have to worry about robots stealing our jobs, but we also have to worry about a machine not hiring us.

Many companies have turned to artificial intelligence to lead job candidacy searches and cherry pick job applicants… Welcome to the ‘Wild West of Hiring.’ Pixabay

This is the obstacle now faced by college graduates hoping to land their first dream job. Yes, the human resources departments at companies are steering further away from humans and embracing artificial intelligence in their job candidacy searches.
SEE ALSO: Can Artificial Intelligence Determine If You Have a Toxic Workplace?
So now, job seekers, it’s all about winning the algorithm game.
According to CNN, career counselors at bigwig schools, such as Duke University, Purdue University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, are priming students on what companies use AI—and how to outfox the algorithms.
Gone are such job interview preparations as mentioned in this old-timey video from the archaic days of 2010.

Companies looking to fill internships and entry-level positions are steering more toward using platforms, such as HireVue, to help conduct a vast number of interviews via video that are analyzed by AI. HireVue, whose headquarters is in Salt Lake City, is used by over 800 companies including CNN, Hilton and Unilever. (That’s up from 50 companies in 2018.)
CEO Kevin Parker told The Wall Street Journal that the company’s platform removes human biases from the job interview process. And he said that… like it’s a good thing.
And this is becoming the new norm, in terms of job interview preparation: how to make a good job interview video.

“We’ll interview probably a million college kids this year,” Parker told CNN.
You can see the appeal for a company to use the HireVue platform. The candidates simply answer a set of predetermined questions via their laptop or smartphone camera. And then, the videos are run through the algorithm ringer—noting such details as facial expressions (captured by facial analysis software), voice tonality, word usage and grammar. (Sorry, foreign job candidates and those with botox.)
The applicants’ performance is then compared to actual company employees and then a score is given. The analysis is said to determine which candidates would make a good team member (who also happen to have good facial expressions and voice tonality).
The job applicant rejects, on the other hand, will have their videos posted immediately on YouTube for the world to mock. (This part isn’t true, I repeat, not true—but you never know what the future holds.)
Do you foresee any problems with AI breaking down job candidates into a series of ones and zeros? Gone from this equation is personal interactions, a sense of soul and actually looking someone directly in the eye.
Now that companies are turning to AI to be the job hiring gatekeeper, does artificial intelligence have the capacity to determine humor, irony and, in general, the heart and kindness of a person? The same type of questions were asked when we dove into whether or not artificial intelligence could determine if you have a toxic workplace.
Here’s more on the nuts and bolts of how AI cherry picks job applicants, which has been called “the Wild West of hiring.”

So not only do we have to worry about robots stealing our jobs, but we also have to worry about a machine not hiring us.
What’s next in our present job quest dystopia? Will job applicants also have to take the VK test from Blade Runner?

HireVue believes its platform can be helpful for ushering a massive number of people through the interview process quickly and reviewing them in a fair, consistent way. The big fear is that AI has the potential to replace humans doing the same job. (In this case, it’s humans doing human resource manager jobs.) In the medical field, using AI makes sense for things, such as scanning for breast cancer. It’s becoming a tool to assist real-life doctors by giving an analytical second opinion. Therefore, it complements the profession—and saves lives. 
But in this case, in which AI is the job gatekeeper, it simply allows companies to throw as many plates of job seeker spaghetti against the wall with no added effort. All it really does is waste the time of the optimistic job applicants. No time is wasted by the company to allow a million job seeking monkeys to send out a million job seeking application videos—in hopes that one algorithm will produce the entire works of Shakespeare—and be hired.
Basically, these entry-level, intern-seeking graduates are the guinea pigs for an AI-produced workforce of tomorrow. What flaws will we find in this system and what future lawsuits will arise?

Increasingly, artificial intelligence is being used in assessing job applications. It’s you versus the robot. How is a human to prevail? By making key adjustments to how you present yourself to the technology, advises a South Korean careers consultant Park Seong-jung. He is among the growing number of professionals who focus on helping clients successfully deal with A.I.While this eventuality is yet to take off equally everywhere, some countries like South Korea have seen quicker implementation of hiring technology. About a quarter of top 131 corporations already utilize or plan to use AI in making personnel decisions. This trend has spawned the growth of classes like Seong-jung’s.One concrete tip he offers students – if you were to do a video interview involving facial recognition software that can analyze character, you have to think about how your face appears. “Don’t force a smile with your lips,” suggests the consultant, according to a profile in Reuters. Instead “Smile with your eyes,” he says.In one example of an AI-conducted interview, taken by Reuters reporters, the technology asked interviewees to introduce themselves while examining facial expressions and processing word choices. The AI was also not averse to asking unexpectedly difficult questions like the scenario “You are on a business trip with your boss and you spot him using the company (credit) card to buy himself a gift. What will you say?”Another aspect to be aware of – AI often utilizes “gamification” tests to analyze your personality and how adaptable you are. It can get as specific as figuring out 37 capabilities of the interviewee and their likelihood in fitting into the position for which they are being considered, explained Chris Jung, a chief manager of software firm Midas IT. What’s more – some games have no right or wrong answers. They are used to understand the problem-solving approach of the candidate.


Conscious machines: How will we test artificial intelligence for feeling?
Conscious machines: How will we test artificial intelligence for feeling?If AI is like a shrink in the machine, how do you convince it you’re the best person for the job? It’s important to study your competition and to understand the culture of the company you are trying to work at. Nathan Mondragon, the head psychologist at HireVue, which creates hiring software for such clients as Goldman Sachs and Unilever, described just how pervasive the AI analysis can really get in an interview with the Guardian.“We break the answers people give down into many thousands of data points, into verbal and non-verbal cues,” said Mondragon. “If you’re answering a question about how you would spend a million dollars, your eyes would tend to shift upward, your verbal cues would go silent. Your head would tilt slightly upward with your eyes.”All the data Mondragon’s software gathers becomes a score that can be compared to the scores of the company’s best employees. It makes sense to hire the kind of people who have already been successful for you.Another way AI can weed you out before your resume even gets to a human’s eyes is through Applicant Tracking Systems (APS), which increasingly rely on artificial intelligence. These are intelligent software scanners that can go through massive pools of data to identify candidates based on certain keywords and assigned data factors. According to a list from the millennial job recruitment site Muse, key ways you can right away improve your presentation to the APS is through streamlining your resume and cover letter. In particular, they recommend keeping the formatting of any documents you send in simple and using the right keywords (checking them with services like Wordle and TagCrowd). More pointers – don’t overdo acronyms, and get rid of career objectives.Last bit of wisdom that bears repeating – run a spell-check.

Artificial Intelligence and the Era of Autonomous Shipping

The world is interconnected through global trade on the
basis of a transportation industry. And, it will continue to grow, with a
predicted rise of nearly a third in seaborne-trade towards 2030, and with
increases in tonne-mileage up to 74,000 billion over the forecast period.  
In other words, the ocean will experience substantial
increases in traffic, pressure will get much higher and risk of marine
accidents and incidents at sea will persist. It is estimated that roughly 90%
of marine casualties and incidents caused by human mistakes, costing over
EUR1.4 billion in marine liability insurance claims. 
This in fact has urged businesses to invest in automation
underpinned by transformational technologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and machine learning, as the ultimate solution to improve productivity,
efficiency and safety by eliminating human errors.
Statistics have shown that AI has the capability to boost
the transportation and logistics industry performance by almost 90%,
potentially increase the industry’s annual revenue up to EUR0.45 trillion.
“Autonomous shipping is the future of the maritime industry.
As disruptive as the smartphone, the smart ship will revolutionise the
landscape of ship design and operations”
Mikael Mäkinen, President, Marine at Rolls-Royce Plc. 
Definition of
Autonomous Shipping
By definition, the term ‘autonomous shipping’ is mainly used to describe a self-sailing crewless vessel, but there are actually various autonomy levels. According to Lloyd’s Register, autonomy levels (AL) ranges from ‘AL0’ meaning traditional manned ship to ‘AL6’ referring to a fully autonomous ship with the operating system being able to calculate all the consequences and risks, and make decisions by itself, without any human interference. 

This means that, an autonomous ship does not have to be
unmanned, while the remote control of an unmanned ship means, it is not, in
fact autonomous. 
Benefits of
Autonomous Shipping
Attractive benefits of autonomous and unmanned ships is
increasingly being identified and discussed among maritime businesses.
According to research, while cheaper labour cut cost by 60%, automation could
cut labour costs by 90%. 
As stated by Rolls-Royce “Many facilities and systems on
board are only there to ensure that the crew is kept fed, safe, and
comfortable. Eliminate or reduce the need for people, and vessels could be
radically simplified.”
According to studies, the removal of the accommodation structure can result in a 6% reduction of fuel and another 5% reduction in construction costs, while opens up for more cargo space and thus higher freight income.

MUNIN project predicted a saving of more than EUR6 million
per ship over a 25-year period in fuel consumption and crew expenditures — the
most critical expense in vessel operating cost. 

It is no doubt that these kinds of ships will give
possibilities for headcount savings, eliminate human tragedy, and allow for
more efficient use of space in ship design. Autonomous ships would also
optimise maintenance activities and maximise fuel utilisation, consequently
leave a smaller carbon footprint. 
The advantages of autonomous ships are plentiful, and
autonomous shipping is not just a fanciful idea that could happen in the
future, or at least not anymore. It is being developed now by a number of
initiatives set up worldwide. 
The autonomous ships market size is predicted to grow from EUR5.5 billion in 2018 to EUR12.5 billion by 2030, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.00% during the forecast period.

How Many Challenges
This Digital Disruption Would Pose?
But despite the potential benefits especially the
operational savings, first, there will be a large capital expenditure in
initially investing in the technology, especially in the early stages of its development.

According to statistics, at least EUR23 million has been
spent for projects from Sea Machines Robotics, 
EU’s MUNIN, SINTEF’s Seatonomy, and Rolls-Royce’s Advanced Autonomous
Waterborne Applications Initiative.  
There will also be investments in setting-up of onshore
operations to monitor fleet movements, especially when there are
incompatibilities between the current marine infrastructure and an unmanned
vessel. 
However, if the estimates are correct, there won’t be any results until 2025, when the first remote controlled, unmanned coastal vessels is launched and, by 2035 we might see fully autonomous, unmanned ocean–going ships.

In addition to construction cost, fuel cost can increase as
autonomous vessels must run on higher-grade fuel such as Marine Diesel Oil
(MDO) or Marine Gas Oil (MGO) to ensure smooth operation of engines.
Estimations show that MDO/MGO would have to decrease about 12% in price to
justify an investment in an autonomous bulker in the current market.
Secondly, there are unanswered legal questions — companies
don’t yet know how international laws will apply to vessels that have no humans
on them, as implementation of unmanned ship is illegal according to the minimum
crew requirements regulation. Also, who is liable if an accident takes place?
Considering shipping is an international practice, such
modification would have to consider a complex political, societal and economic
matrix. As stated by World Maritime University, it is unlikely that there will
be any agreed international guidelines and regulations regarding autonomous
ships within the next decade. And what if governments and authorities can not
make an agreement and all the efforts go back to zero? 
Furthermore, it is believed that these remote controlled vessels will lack the skills, knowledge and experience which professional seafarers provide, according to the International Transport Worker’s Federation (ITF). What would happen if there are problems requiring immediate attention — such as cyber-attack, machinery maintenance or breakdown, or sudden changes in routes due to unforeseen events, natural or man-made?

Digital Disruption Is
a People Problem
Many in the industry, though, point out that most of these
concerns are being addressed. However, there seems to be a bigger and most
pressing challenge is to gain public acceptance, especially concerns about
technologies eating up jobs. 
The industry employs an estimated 1.6 million people on ships and on land, who currently are the protagonists of 90 per cent of world trade.  According to a study published by the International Transport Federation (ITF) and the International Federation of Shipmasters’ Associations (IFSMA), more than 80 per cent of seafarers voiced their anxiety about possible job losses with the advent of automation and AI, as the new technology has already surpassed certain human capabilities.

In fact, this industrial revolution could replace up to 35%
of UK workers and 47% of American jobs over the next 20 years, as researched by
Oxford University. The technology is expected to eliminate not just low-skilled
jobs but also high-skilled groups — such as traders, financial advisors, legal
assistants — as the technology possesses cognitive technology that can think
like a human, enabling it to analyze and interpret all of your data, including
unstructured text, images, audio and video. 
In other words, no one is safe from the increasing use of
technology. Many seafarers will have troubles to get work ashore after their
jobs disappearing with automation and AI. According to World Maritime
University, the introduction of autonomous ships will potentially decrease the
demand for seafarers, leading to a reduction of 22 per cent by 2040. 
The International Chamber of Shipping also expresses their
concerns on seafarer mental issues as the number of people on ships decreases,
as well as their functions are taken by machines. This will result in less
social interactions, leading to loneliness and potentially depression. 
Automation and AI will become so ubiquitous that displaced
workers will have nowhere to go with their current knowledge and competences.
As a result, it will pose a serious threat on many economic and social issues.
Society cannot afford to presume that this digital revolution will create jobs
as quick as eliminating them. 
”It’s one of the dirty secrets of economics: technological progress does grow the economy and create wealth, but there is no economic law that says everyone will benefit”

What should be
happening?
Automation and AI  is
the future that we can not avoid, but would unmanned ships become one, we are
not so certain. However, the industry still need to act now in order to prepare
our current and future workforce — such as reforming education, boosting
training programs that support seafarers to work with AI and automation. 
So, instead of removing human factors and replacing completely with technology, shipping businesses should elevate human potential through technology by using available AI-powered tools to predict operational risks, navigation solution, voyage optimisation, and the like to reduce maritime accidents.

SDG 8.7 is a commitment to end modern slavery, with the ambition to reduce that number by 10,000 people every day. James Cockayne, Director, Centre for Policy Research, United Nations University, is confident that we are “nowhere near” that target. The reasons for this systemic and enduring failure are the result of the “mispricing” of labour, where true social costs are not quantified. Worse still, companies are rewarded for driving down their labour costs. It is a market failure of massive proportions, present in just about every country on earth, generating an estimated $150 billion of profit globally and is the third-largest global crime, after drug trafficking and counterfeit goods smuggling. Forced migration and natural disasters increase the risks of human exploitation, so the looming spectre of climate change puts the spotlight on this issue. The price of modern slaveryModern slavery is at the heart of efforts to transform markets and to create a cohesive and sustainable world. As Cockayne says, “We must price modern slavery risk into our market practices.”Like so many global challenges, the success of any response relies on data: Where are the world’s modern slaves, which global supply chains are they a part of and how can we predict increased risks for human exploitation?The University of Nottingham, UK has applied artificial intelligence to satellite imaging to map forced labour patterns and predictions. An example is mapping brick kilns in South Asia, which have proven in the past to be hotspots for forced labour and debt bondage. This analysis is one example of innovation included in the presentation on Modern Slavery developed by United Nations University and Carnegie Mellon University at the Annual Meeting 2020 in Davos. Government Response (2018) – Walk Free Foundation conducted assessments of 181 governments’ actions towards the achievement of five milestones: survivor support, criminal justice, coordination, addressing risk, and supply chains. Image: earthtime.orgThe technology is visually arresting. It can highlight the nuances of modern slavery – showing regional patterns, involuntary work for adults versus children, and even industry-specific statistics. There is further work to be done, however, to develop a more granular picture of localized differences, showing more variation within countries and regions. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also recently published a report tracking a sector-by-sector evaluation, which charts whether foreign or local supply chains are driving the slave trade. Certain industries – construction, fishing and the palm sector – tend to generate labour rights violations. Conditions for workers in these sectors can be isolated and/or dangerous. Using the data to take action on modern slaveryArmed with this data, there are powerful examples of successful action against modern slavery. These tend to take shape as trade embargoes, such as restrictions on access to European markets for a group of the 25 worst-offending countries. Similarly, US Customs can impound goods for import that have an illegal supply-chain history. In the last few months alone, there have been 17 such cases. Another case involved the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund divesting in 33 palm oil companies discovered to rely on illegal labour supply chains. The knock-on effects were profound. A number of leading US banks followed suit. When Australian financial services company, Westpac, was linked to financing child trafficking, top jobs were lost and the bank was hard hit. Multilateral action is also gaining momentum. Two years ago, 85 countries endorsed a collective pledge to work with companies that are transparent about supply-chain risk – a pledge backed by the G20. The EU is moving towards the adoption of mandatory human rights practices. The Liechtenstein Initiative is a collective-action framework that seeks to use finance as a lever to address the market failure of modern slavery.These examples provide some hope that the 10,000 people-a-day target is achievable, but ultimately the technology needs more development, more investment and a holistic approach at a policy level, where survivors are at the heart of efforts to reduce risk. An approach that is limited to trade embargoes risks shifting the burden as companies go out of business and labourers become even more vulnerable. The key, then, is to ensure that importers act responsibly so that ethical and legal supply chains become the norm and slavery is no longer “modern”.Don't miss any update on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and CommunitiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Jobs and the Future of WorkSustainable DevelopmentShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

But the latest wave of advancements in artificial intelligence may be bring the prospect of machine replacement beyond blue collar work. Developers are creating algorithms that promise to take over vast amounts of work in white collar fields like law and medicine, potentially upending traditionally high-status fields. For people in those once-secure positions, the questions are whose jobs may be changed, how soon, and what new opportunities may arise to take their place.Knowledge work that involves repetitive tasks or large amounts of data, such as lawyers’ often arduous document discovery process, is particularly ripe for disruption from AI, experts say. Tasks that require human-to-human interaction or some element of creativity are likely to be safer. “Pattern recognition in general is something that these technologies seem good at,” says Mark Muro, one of the authors of a recent Brookings Institution report that suggests high-paid, educated workers will be highly exposed to new AI technology. “That is a contribution to a lot of white collar activities.”MIT economics professor David Autor says middle management positions are particularly susceptible to this new wave of automation, particularly in fields like finance and inventory management, where humans are in charge of translating data into concrete business decisions. But he also argues that displacement from machine learning is likely to create new opportunities. “Historically, tons of new work comes into existence as a result of automation,” Autor says. “The whole industrial revolution came about as a result of the automation of artisanal tasks, but it would have been impossible for anyone at the dawn of that period to foresee where that would go.”That optimism may come as cold comfort for the artisans of 2020: the millions of paralegals, human resource managers, IT professionals and other knowledge industry workers whose positions are prime targets for a new wave of automation. McKinsey predicts across-the-board cuts in such fields over the next decade. Some fields, like office financial support personnel, are likely to lose more than one in four positions.Some economists predict even more dramatic changes in the coming years, including a radical shift in top-tier white collar work. Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva argues that AI, coupled with outsourcing enabled by new advances in telecommunications, will sharply reduce white collar employment. He believes those twin drivers could displace professionals in elite sectors from media and finance to architecture and law, at least until people find new ways to put themselves to work. “What we have is displacement being driven at the pace of digital technology, but job creation being driven at the pace of human ingenuity,” Baldwin says. “What I’m worried about is that job displacement driven by digital will outstrip job creation driven by ingenuity.” Recent advancements illustrate the extent of possible change in some of society’s most illustrious professions. This month, a team of researchers announced they had created an AI algorithm that outperformed radiologists in detecting breast cancer in mammograms. Trained on tens of thousands of mammogram images, the algorithm measurably reduced both false positives and false negatives compared to human doctors. Of course, radiology involves a lot more than classifying images. With demand for radiologists surging, it’s not likely the field will die off any time soon. “AI will not replace radiologists,” says Kevin Lyman, CEO of AI radiology startup Enlitic. “But radiologists using AI will replace those who do not.” Of course, there are winners in any mass economic reorientation. The explosion in AI development has already created thousands of high-paying jobs for those with the skill sets to design, test, and sell such systems. Hiring growth for “AI Specialists” grew by 74% annually over the past four years, according to LinkedIn data. Carnegie Mellon University, a premier school for computer science, reports a recent explosion of interest in hiring their graduates, with three times as many tech companies recruiting in 2019 compared to just three years earlier. Over the same period, the number of data analytics, information technology, and software engineering jobs posted to CMU’s recruitment portal also tripled. Even within the tech campuses of Silicon Valley, machine learning automation may be making inroads. San Francisco-based startup Kite has developed a plugin that uses AI to offer auto-complete suggestions for coders. CEO and Founder Adam Smith predicts the technology will eventually do much more. “Instead of Kite predicting the line of code you’re currently typing, the human will just tell us what they want the piece of code to do and we’ll synthesize that code for them,” says Smith. But while coders may be working faster, he maintains that the obsolescence of software engineers is a long way off.Even as some high-status professions face possible AI disruption, economists are generally optimistic about the future of employment. Few are predicting anything like the end of work as we know it in coming decades. The challenge, says Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor of management science and information technology at MIT, is finding ways to transition people away from work where machines are outpacing humans and into jobs where they will be most needed. “In healthcare, in childcare, cleaning the environment, in creative work, science, entrepreneurship, the arts — these are all areas where machines can’t hold a candle to humans,” he says. “We’ve got plenty of work for people to do.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First OpinionHealth care needs AI. It also needs the human touch

As friends who work as pediatricians, we’ve had several conversations recently about artificial intelligence and its growing role in medicine. Machine learning and computer algorithms, it seems, are on the cusp of changing the medical profession forever.
Prestigious medical journals publish a steady stream of studies demonstrating the potential of deep learning to replace tasks that are currently the bread and butter of highly trained physicians, like reading CT scans of the head.advertisement

We are attuned to artificial intelligence in part because our city, Montreal, has become an international AI hub. One of the city’s biggest teaching hospitals, the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, just launched an AI school for health professionals. And to the south of Canada, U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang has built a political campaign around planning for a future disrupted by AI.
We see the writing on the wall, yet it’s hard for us in our day-to-day clinical work to imagine a time when artificial intelligence will have a real impact on what we do.

It might be that, as physicians who work in a public health care system that relies on fax machines, carbon copies, and actual rubber stamps, a system run by AI seems like science fiction. But the prospect of a purely technological health care system also irks us and strikes us as undesirable.advertisement

We aren’t alone in feeling this way. According to a recent Harvard Business Review report, “patients believe that their medical needs are unique and cannot be adequately addressed by algorithms.”
So is an AI-driven health care future one that patients will want and accept?
There is no question that machine-learning algorithms are increasingly rapid and accurate in analyzing medical data. Diagnostic medical specialties like radiology, which deal more with the interpretation of data than with direct patient interactions, are the first to see artificial intelligence integrated into their practice. But no clinical discipline will be unaffected: Tools such as counseling chat bots and machine-learning algorithms that use data from patient monitors are being developed for more hands-on work, such as mental health and intensive care.
Artificial intelligence clearly has the potential to pitch in where physician judgment falters. When doctors are tired or behind schedule, they are more likely to prescribe opioids and unnecessary antibiotics. They also achieve lower vaccination and cancer screening rates. The reason? Decision fatigue, by which doctors who make countless decisions each day lose steam as the day unfolds and increasingly rely on suboptimal default options. Algorithms that never get tired or hungry do not experience decision fatigue.
Still, techno-utopianism does not appear to be what patients want. In the Harvard Business Review report, people preferred receiving health advice from a human, even when a computer was more accurate. This makes intuitive (and self-serving) sense to us as clinicians. Seeking care is built around receiving the undivided attention of real human beings, flawed as they may be. Patients, it seems, see doctors’ humanity less as a bug and more as a feature.

As a medical student, one of us (O.D.) saw an 83-year-old man in a surgical oncology clinic who was recovering from prostate cancer. After being greeted and asked the simplest of questions, “How are you doing today?” the man began to cry. He confessed feeling that, even though his cancer was cured, his life would never be the same. He felt he had been forever scarred by his illness. Who knows if Siri or Alexa would have triggered such a response?
An algorithm could have calculated the man’s life expectancy and determined exactly how frequently he needed follow-up imaging and blood tests to detect a recurrence of his cancer. But would that have been health care?
It probably depends on who you ask. In our experience, feeling properly cared for means more than just receiving scripted advice and prescriptions for tests and medications, something a smart, Watson-like AI physician could conceivably do.
We have both experienced moments as clinicians when an apparently cursory or incomplete encounter left patients dissatisfied, even if it was rational and evidence-based. For instance, patients expect doctors to perform elements of the physical exam that are not strictly speaking necessary and will have no impact on the final treatment plan. Once you’ve diagnosed an ear infection in a child with fever, you usually don’t need to look for strep throat as well, but many parents feel good only once everything has been checked.
The truth is that every medical encounter contains an element of ritual and performance that is therapeutic. Patients want us to ask, look, and touch in response to their concerns, their bodies, and their unique circumstances. Few people appreciate a physician who seems to be working from a script, in the room but not truly present or connected. Who is, in other words, behaving like a machine.

							The rise of artificial intelligence means doctors must redefine what they do						




It’s worth asking where high-performing AI “clinicians” would ultimately lead us. Potentially to a less expensive and more accurate health care system that leaves human carers in the dust, relegated in their imperfection to simpler, lower-stakes tasks they can’t mess up. Perhaps, in an act of self-preservation, doctors would demand to be repurposed as medical bureaucrats, rubber stamping the machines’ indefatigably consistent and unimpeachable work.
Although it can be exciting to think about the outcomes that a minimally flawed and maximally accurate artificial intelligence system would yield, such as a 100% detection rate for potentially deadly skin cancers like melanoma, it’s still worth considering whether that’s the health care we really want.
How much of health care is about outcomes, and how much is about humans’ deeply social nature? Is healing someone a purely technical endeavor, or is it part of human culture, something we have done since we decided we were better off banding together than simply killing one another to get the next meal and sleep in the better cave?
These questions echo broader anxieties about the impending shocks that artificial intelligence will visit upon society in the form of massive disruptions to major industries and fundamental transformations to how people make their living and spend their time. In the face of these changes, Andrew Yang speaks of the importance of promoting a “human-centered capitalism” in which the basic unit of value is each person, not each dollar. His message is that we must remain focused on what the human project is supposed to be about: taking care of each other.
We aren’t arguing for a dismissal of AI in medicine. Missing this opportunity to harness powerful tools to improve patient care and outcomes would be foolish. But we are arguing to keep artificial intelligence in its place, and to stake a claim to ours.
Physicians should embrace technology that will help us make better decisions and give us more time to focus on what we do best. Whether it is delivering babies, accompanying individuals through their dying days, or announcing a new diagnosis of leukemia to the parents of a 4-year-old, physicians’ greatest contribution resides in informing, guiding, and supporting patients.
Human doctors still have a monopoly on what people want most: human care.

OK, computer: Let's bring text-generating artificial intelligence into the classroom

										 by Grant Jun Otsuki, 										 										 The Conversation

Artificial intelligence-based (AI) programs are quickly improving at writing convincingly on many topics, for virtually no cost. It's likely in a few years they'll be churning out C-grade worthy essays for students.





We could try to ban them, but this software is highly accessible. It would be a losing battle.
Long-form writing, especially essay writing, remains one of the best ways to teach critical analysis. Teachers rely on this mode of assessment to gauge students' understanding of a topic.
Thus, we need to find ways to help students of all disciplines thrive alongside advanced automation and smart systems, rather than resist them. This involves training students to work with AI tools, rather than banning them.
What are AI-powered text generators?
In February 2019, GPT-2, an AI-powered text generating system was released by OpenAI. Those interested can try the system themselves by following these instructions, or experiment with Talk to Transformer, an online tool made using GPT-2.
The idea behind GPT-2 is similar to the predictive text function on a smartphone. A machine learning system was given 8 million web pages, and told to look at blocks of text to predict what word would come next.
The system compared its guess with the actual text to ""learn"". This was repeated billions of times, resulting in the GPT-2 software.






Often within minutes, GPT-2 can generate texts that look like they were written by a human. They're grammatically correct, thematically coherent, engaging and even informative.
I gave GPT-2 this prompt: ""The global system of university ranking has recently…"". Here are some sentences it generated: ""The global system of university ranking has recently been the subject of heated debate, with many arguing that it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. In a report published in May, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the system has become increasingly irrelevant, with the gap between the best and the worst universities in the world narrowing in recent years. The OECD found that in the past decade, the average quality of a university's research output has fallen to its lowest level since the late 1970s"".
There are several signs of a non-human hand at work, notably the repetition of ""increasingly irrelevant"". There's also the matter that no such OECD report exists. It was dreamt up by the machine.
That said, with a few revisions, the text could probably pass as being authored by a human.
There are a number of systems similar to GPT-2, including Google's BERT, ERNIE2.0, XLNet and Facebook's RoBERTa. But GPT-2 has caught on with tinkerers across the web—lauded for its power and ease of use in generating new texts.
Available now near you
GPT-2 comes in forms that let anyone use it easily, even without a powerful computer. Such tools are a looming problem for schools and universities.
In an experiment, I fed the system 188 student papers on Keith Basso's book Wisdom Sits in Places, written for an anthropology course I teach. GPT-2 ""learned"" for about thirty minutes, after which it generated some paragraphs.
One begins: ""In this essay, I will show how conceptions of wisdom connect with place-names in Wisdom Sits in Places, by explaining how place-names serve as moral compass. I will also cover the cultural sphere of 'notions of morality,' which is explained by the stories behind the place-names.""
The text reads like an essay. It's divided into four paragraphs and describes what appears to be examples from the book.
I would have failed the text as is. The writing isn't perfect, and in places the writer seems to lose their train of thought. However, with slight human revision, an essay worthy of a C would be within reach.
Adapt, don't resist
People are already experimenting with GPT-2 for poetry, text-based role-playing games, and plays written in a Shakespearean style. Worryingly, it can also produce endless streams of fake news.






What can institutions do about such ""plagiarized"" work flooding their classrooms?
One response would be to ban AI tools. Leaders of 40 universities in the UK have taken this approach against essay mills, pushing to make them illegal. Essay mills are run by people who charge students a fee in exchange for completing their work.
But it's unclear how such a ban could be enforced once AI software is as easy to access as Candy Crush. Institutions could look to existing rules against academic misconduct, but accurate detection becomes a problem. As AI-generated texts get better, how will we prove (without watching them) that a student did or didn't write a text themselves?
We can't, so we should take a page from cyborg chess play, where players embrace chess-playing computers to become better themselves.
Rather than pretending AI doesn't exist, it might be time to train people to write with AI.
Most good writers don't write in isolation; they talk and revise their work with others. Also, 90% of writing is revision, which means the ideas and arguments in a text change and develop as a writer reads and edits their own work.
Thus, systems such as GPT-2 could be used as a first-draft machine, taking a student's raw research notes and turning them into a text they can expand on and revise.
In this model, teachers would evaluate a work, not just on the basis of the final product, but on a student's ability to use text-generating tools.
Powerful AI tools could help us analyze and communicate complex ideas.
What should we judge our students on?
All of the above prompts a question we need to consider if we're to live in an AI-friendly world: why do we teach students to write at all?
One major reason is many jobs rely on being able to write. So, when teaching writing, we need to think about the social and economic implications of a type of text.
Much of today's media landscape, for instance, runs on the continuous production and circulation of blog posts, tweets, listicles, marketing reports, slide presentations, and e-mails.
While computer writing might never be as original, provocative, or insightful as the work of a skilled human, it will quickly become good enough for such writing jobs, and AIs won't need health insurance or holidays.
If we teach students to write things a computer can, then we're training them for jobs a computer can do, for cheaper.
Educators need to think creatively about the skills we give our students. In this context, we can treat AI as an enemy, or we can embrace it as a partner that helps us learn more, work smarter, and faster.

Susan Schneider, associate professor of philosophy and cognitive science and director of the AI, Mind and Society (AIMS) Group at UConn, has gained a national and international reputation for her writing on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence (AI). She writes about the nature of the self and mind, AI, cognitive science, and astrobiology in publications including the New York Times, Scientific American, and The Financial Times and her work has been widely discussed in the media, such as Science, Big Think, Nautilus, Discover, and Smithsonian. She was named NASA-Baruch Blumberg Chair for the Library of Congress and NASA and also holds the Distinguished Scholar Chair at the Library of Congress. In her new book, Artificial You: AI and the Future of Your Mind (Princeton University Press, 2019), she examines the implications of advances in artificial intelligence technology for the future of the human mind.
Q: What is the focus of your newest book?
A: This book is about the future of the mind. It explores the nature of the self and consciousness in a not so distant future, using today’s work in artificial intelligence and brain enhancement technologies. Consciousness is the felt quality to experience—what it feels like to be you. When you smell the aroma of your morning coffee, hear the sound of a Bach concerto, or feel pain, you are having conscious experience. Indeed, every moment of your waking life, and even when you dream, it feels like something from the inside to be you. This book asks: assuming we build highly sophisticated artificial intelligences at some point in the future, would they be conscious beings? Further, how would we detect consciousness in machines? These questions are addressed in the first half the book. The second half of the book is on the nature of the self. I illustrate that AI isn’t just going to change the world around us. It’s going to go inside the head, changing the human mind itself, but I’m concerned about the potential uses of invasive AI components inside of our heads. I urge that we need to understand deep philosophical questions about the self, consciousness, and the mind before we start playing with fire and start replacing parts of our brains with artificial components. When it comes to the self and mind, we are faced with vexing philosophical questions that have no easy solution.
Q: You report about such experimentation with neural implants for things like Alzheimer’s disease but return to the question of, if there’s an artificial intelligence when does it become aware of itself?
A: There are all kinds of impressive medical technologies underway, and I’m very supportive of the use of invasive brain chips to help individuals with radical memory loss or locked in syndrome, in which individuals entirely lose their ability to move. I think innovations to help these people are important and exciting. What I get worried about, though, is the idea that humans should engage in widespread and invasive AI-based enhancement of their brains. For instance, Elon Musk has recently declared that we will eventually need to keep up with super-intelligent AI – a hypothetical form of AI that vastly outsmarts us — and we need to do that by enhancing our brains. He also thinks doing so will help us keep up with technological unemployment that many economists claim will happen because AI will outmode us in the workforce. Musk and others talk about “merging with AI and I” through gradually augmenting intelligence with AI technology until, in the end of the day, we are essentially AIs ourselves. Musk has recently founded a company to do this, and Facebook and Kernal are also working on this. But I argue in the book and in op-eds for the New York Times and the Financial Times that the idea we could truly merge with artificial intelligence in the ways that a lot of tech gurus and transhumanists advocate is actually not philosophically well-founded. We have to think things through more carefully
Q: You use examples of AI from science fiction, including one with the Star Trek: Next Generation character Lt. Commander Data, who is under attack on a planet and he uploads his brain’s memories to a computer on the Enterprise. You ask: Will he still be the same Data that he was before being destroyed? Will he really survive?
A: I think people assume that AIs will have the capacity to be immortal because they can just keep uploading and downloading copies of themselves whenever they are in a jam. By this they mean the android be practically immortal, living until the end of the universe. This makes them almost God-like. I am skeptical. In the book I use the Data example to illustrate that if Data found out that he was on a planet that was about to be destroyed, he couldn’t upload and genuinely survive. I think the idea that you could transfer your thoughts to a different format and still be you, surviving impending death, is conceptually flawed. It is flawed in both the human case and the case of androids. Believe it or not, there are advocates of uploading the human brain to survive death at places like the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute. I am skeptical.
Q: One of the points that you make in the book is that we have come far technologically but haven’t heard anything yet from an alien culture. You suggest we should prepare for alien contact by including the involvement of sociologists and anthropologists and philosophers.
As the NASA chair at NASA and the Library of Congress, I love to think about the Fermi paradox, which is the question: Given the vast size of the universe, where is all the intelligent life? Where is everybody? Nowadays, the question can be framed in terms of all of the intriguing exoplanet research that identifies habitable planets throughout the universe, but are these exoplanets actually inhabited (not just inhabitable), and if they are inhabited, does life survive into technological majority? Or are we alone? Why haven’t we heard anything? To the extent that we even do find life out there, my guess is that we will first find microbial life. There’s dozens of gloriously fun answers to the Fermi paradox.
Q: In the work that you’re doing with Congress, what kinds of questions are you being asked and what we should be thinking about going forward with all this technology?
There’s been a lot of concern over the last few years about deep fake videos. Nobody likes it; your career could be ruined by a deep fake video that has you saying something really rotten that you never said. Algorithmic discrimination is a big issue, the fact that algorithms that are based on deep learning technologies will be data-driven, so if the data itself has implicit bias, hidden biases in it, it can actually lead to a bad result which discriminates against certain groups. There are many members of Congress who’ve been concerned about that. That’s why we really need AI regulations. AI regulation could do tremendous work. And so I do hope we move forward on all of these issues.

An artificial intelligence tool—trained on roughly a million screening mammography images—can identify breast cancer with approximately 90% accuracy when combined with radiologist analysis, a new study finds.
The study examined the ability of a type of artificial intelligence (AI), a machine learning computer program, to add value to the diagnoses a group of 14 radiologists reached as they reviewed 720 mammogram images.
“The ultimate goal of our work is to augment, not replace, human radiologists.”
“Our study found that AI identified cancer-related patterns in the data that radiologists could not, and vice versa,” says senior study author Krzysztof Geras, assistant professor in the radiology department at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
“AI detected pixel-level changes in tissue invisible to the human eye, while humans used forms of reasoning not available to AI,” adds Geras, also an affiliated faculty member at the Center for Data Science. “The ultimate goal of our work is to augment, not replace, human radiologists.”
In 2014, women (without symptoms) in the United States got more than 39 million mammography exams to screen for breast cancer and determine the need for closer follow-up. Women whose test results yield abnormal mammography findings are referred for biopsy, a procedure that removes a small sample of breast tissue for laboratory testing.

In the new study, the research team designed statistical techniques that let their program “learn” how to get better at a task without being told exactly how. Such programs build mathematical models that enable decision-making based on data examples fed into them, with the program getting “smarter” as it reviews more and more data.
Modern AI approaches, which take inspiration from the human brain, use complex circuits to process information in layers, with each step feeding information into the next, and assigning more or less importance to each piece of information along the way.
The authors of the current study trained their AI tool on many images matched with the results of biopsies performed in the past. Their goal was to enable the tool to help radiologists reduce the number of biopsies needed moving forward. This can only be achieved, says Geras, by increasing the confidence that physicians have in the accuracy of assessments made for screening exams (for example, reducing false-positive and false-negative results).
For the current study, the research team analyzed images collected as part of routine clinical care over seven years, sifting through the collected data and connecting the images with biopsy results. This effort created an extraordinarily large dataset for their AI tool to train on, the authors say, consisting of 229,426 digital screening mammography exams and 1,001,093 images. Most databases the researchers used in studies to date have been limited to 10,000 images or fewer.
Thus, the researchers trained their neural network by programming it to analyze images from the database for which cancer diagnoses had already been determined. This meant that researchers knew the “truth” for each mammography image (cancer or not) as they tested the tool’s accuracy, while the tool had to guess. The researchers measured accuracy in the frequency of correct predictions.
In addition, the researchers designed the study AI model to first consider very small patches of the full resolution image separately to create a heat map, a statistical picture of disease likelihood. Then the program considers the entire breast for structural features linked to cancer, paying closer attention to the areas flagged in the pixel-level heat map.
Rather than have the researchers identify image features for their AI to search for, the tool is discovering on its own which image features increase prediction accuracy. Moving forward, the team plans to further increase this accuracy by training the AI program on more data, perhaps even identifying changes in breast tissue that are not yet cancerous but have the potential to be.
“The transition to AI support in diagnostic radiology should proceed like the adoption of self-driving cars—slowly and carefully, building trust, and improving systems along the way with a focus on safety,” says first author Nan Wu, a doctoral candidate at the Center for Data Science.
The study appears in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.
Additional coauthors are from NYU, SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, the University of Cambridge, and Jagiellonian University.
Support for the work came, in part, from the National Institutes of Health. The model used in this study has been made available to the field to drive innovation.

This is especially an important factor for rural schools.

Ohio State futurist visits Air Force Research Lab












Published Jan. 22, 2020

Air Force Research Laboratory


WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio — An unusual guest speaker recently challenged researchers and administrators at the Air Force Research Lab to think about artificial intelligence and machine learning and how they will change the home and workplace as well as institutions of higher learning.
Speaker Dr. David Staley, an Ohio State University history professor, advised his audience that, as a futurist, he was not in the prediction business. He was just interested in what is going to happen next. And one of the biggest—and perhaps surest—things that will happen next is the ever-expanding role of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is a topic of special interest at AFRL, where a lot of work is being done on machine learning. Staley saw some of this work firsthand as he visited two of several labs on site. In one, the chemistry foundry, researcher Dr. Luke Baldwin led a briefing about recent efforts to bring synthetic chemistry into the digital age of the 21st century.
Baldwin provided a perspective on how chemistry has historically been done and how established practices often make chemists resistant to change. He then focused on recent progress in automation and machine-assisted chemistry and how AFRL is supporting this concept in the chemistry foundry. Baldwin’s presentation also included another AFRL field of research, synthetic biology, a revolutionary concept that redesigns organisms to perform new reactions.
Continuous flow chemistry, a lab-scale method for synthesizing molecules in an accelerated process, was also discussed as well as demonstrated. One of the points raised during Baldwin’s presentation was the need to train the next generation of computer and physical scientists to work together from an early educational age, thereby ensuring continued progress in materials research using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Staley’s tour also included a visit to an additive manufacturing lab, where Dr. Andrew Gillman introduced the concept and history of topology optimization. Topology optimization is a mathematical process for deciding where material can be removed from a part or a structure to make it lighter while limiting the effect on its strength. Often the resulting complex redesign is impossible to fabricate using such traditional means as metal stamping, casting and welding. However, additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing, has the potential to actually produce these complex parts, which are designed by a computer using topology optimization algorithms.
Gillman also explained that “machine learning” comes into play as both the number of simulations and additive manufacturing experiments can become incredibly large, making it challenging for humans to learn from and understand any underlying patterns, and then decide upon future design changes. Machine learning techniques are being explored to automatically detect these patterns and trends, while improving human intuition about complex manufacturing processes, and automatically making decisions for redesign. This cycle of testing, redesigning and re-producing can happen very quickly without any human involvement once the process begins. Doing the same kind of research and analysis without artificial intelligence and machine learning would take months or years, if it could be accomplished at all.
Also part of this tour stop, researchers Matt Jacobsen and Dr. Dan Berrigan described how the way we store and represent data is critical toward moving from data simply as information to collectively representing knowledge and intelligence. They also explained how we are developing smart manufacturing systems that make these tools intelligent teammates, resulting in humans and machines making decisions and performing complex tasks together.
Looking at current trends, Staley expects that dependence on artificial intelligence as an essential tool will continually increase. Instead of feeling threatened or intimidated, however, humanity needs to teach this tool to be a teammate rather than a master or a slave. Such a relationship is already taking root as people commonly accept AI’s assistance in their everyday lives, consulting Google or querying Alexa, for example.
But what about the danger of AI replacing humanity? Staley assured his audience that, in the near term at least, technology will replace jobs, not humanity. And even then, AI does not willfully take anyone’s job. The decision to use a “robot” instead of a human being is made by another human being. “If a machine is as good as or better than a human, and cheaper,” Staley said, “technology replaces human labor every time.” He then referred to economist Carl Benedikt Frey, saying that 47 percent of all jobs have the potential of being automated in the next 10 to 15 years. Most of those jobs will be “high-end” jobs that currently require technical college degrees. One example Staley gave was that of accountant.
So, where does this leave higher education? If earning a degree in a discipline such as accounting likely guarantees that the graduate will be unemployable, then what should universities teach and how should they teach it? Even today, employers claim they are facing a shortage of employees with important “soft” skills like innovation, creativity, time management and the ability to prioritize. Such skills will become even more valuable in the workplace of the future. According to Staley, higher education is not ready for the changes that will be taking place in the workforce over the next 10 to 15 years. “Citizens have little confidence in higher education’s ability to prepare someone for working in a new autonomous world,” said Staley.
The change in needed skills has already been happening. While touring one of AFRL’s labs where machine learning is used, Staley asked the researchers if they had had formal training or education in that field. Their response was that they had learned by doing, on-the-job, mainly because no such coursework existed when they were earning their degrees.
One solution that Staley sees being applied even now is for companies to teach their own coursework or to even have their own learning institutions. An example already in use is McDonald’s Hamburger University, where employees can earn 23 college credits in areas such as restaurant management.
Employees also may find their college degree increasingly irrelevant and themselves subject to losing a job because of “downsizing” that results from increased automation. To avoid this problem, companies can use another form of employee education Staley called “upskilling.” This does not mean retraining someone to do a different job. It means continually building upon and adding to employees’ skills to make them more relevant in a continually changing workplace.
Staley spoke of yet another solution in what he called “Interface University.” While machines are good at crunching data, they do not have human cognition. Therefore, humans and computers working together are more productive than either working alone. At Interface University, humans will be taught to “think with computers.”
This would not be the first time that humans have paired cognition with technology. Staley pointed out that the invention of writing was a technology, and not simply a tool. With writing, humans could “engage in a level of cognition not possible with the human brain alone.”
Finally, to make this pairing of humans with artificial intelligence work, the human half of the team must be proficient in certain beneficial human attributes. Those attributes, which can and must be taught at the university level, include imagining, creating, inductive and deductive reasoning and critical thinking. This means that universities need to reconsider their current strategy, which is to focus nearly exclusively on teaching STEM. Staley suggests that students need to be taught how to interpret literature, to fathom meaning from a book, for example, instead of simply reading to acquire information. This is one of those complex cognitive skills that can never be learned by an algorithm. And according to Staley, this is not “just a nice thing to do; it’s a survival strategy.”
Staley is the director of the Humanities Institute and an associate professor in the departments of History, Design and Educational Studies at the Ohio State University. One of his research interests is the history and future of higher education. He recently authored Alternative Universities: Speculative Design for Innovation in Higher Education.

How the Application of Neuroscience in Design Can Separate Us from Artificial Intelligence
Intuitively, most people can see a well-designed space and say, “Yes, that looks nice.” But what is it that makes us respond this way? Why do some spaces appeal to our senses better than others? And in an era of artificial intelligence, how can designers tap into those sciences to design spaces that help us continue to develop our humanistic traits and skills?
Frederick Marks, president of the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture, shares that “neuroscience is a multidisciplinary branch of biology that deals with the structure or function of the nervous system and the brain. This includes psychology, physiology, anatomy, molecular and developmental biology, neurochemistry, cytology, and mathematical modeling.”

Understanding how we learn helps us create environments that are conducive for continued growth. Photography courtesy of Herman Miller.

According to Marks, “Neuroscience is an emerging field whose focus is primarily, because of need and available funding, on the prevention of disease and treatment. But what is being learned has potential secondary applications for design and architecture. The environments we live, work, and play in are changing our brains and our behavior all the time. As explained by one neuroscientist, while the brain controls our behavior and genes control the blueprint of our brain, our environment can modulate the function of genes and, ultimately, the structure of our brain.”
Because this research shows that design plays such an active role in the continuous formation of our brain, the science behind how we respond to and interact with different environments is coming to the forefront. And its applications are fascinating. Let’s take a look.

The importance of designing spaces that cater to our continued desire to learn
According to architecture, design, and planning firm Gensler, one of the keys to scientifically backed design is an understanding of how our built environment can best support cognitive development. Separate from the research conducted by the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture, research led by Amrita Kulkarni and Vincenzo Centinaro of Gensler Chicago suggests that “‘creative’ behaviors like critical thinking, problem-solving, empathy, and emotional intelligence are foundational skills of tomorrow’s workforce and are traits that make us intrinsically human.”

These researchers have deducted that, contrary to popular belief, learning is not a fourth work mode beyond focus, collaboration, and socialization, but instead it is a continuous path that occurs every moment during our workday. And Kulkarni and Centinaro suggest there are four distinct kinds of learning dimensions we transition to throughout the day: training-based, mentorship-based, chance-based, and platform-based.

Designing for each learning environment
Training-based learning traditionally takes place in formal or structured learning environments such as classroom settings designed for CEUs or certification. According to Kulkarni and Centinaro, designers focusing on training-based learning need to adapt their designs to prioritize cross-training and forge connections among learners. These types of learning scenarios should offer an open-concept feel, with the ability to have breakout sessions, as seen with activity-based workstations.
Contrarily, mentorship-based learning happens in more informal ways, in environments like management offices or even in cafeterias or common places. Organizations have an opportunity to amplify learning by demonstrating commitment, offering protected time, coaching on critique styles, facilitating dialogue among unexpected groups, and encouraging opinion sharing openly throughout the workplace. To facilitate this, we often see designs that prioritize water cooler conversations or spontaneous touchdowns, complete, of course, with amenities and technology like smart boards, teleconferencing capabilities to loop in remote workers, and adjustable workstations for groups to congregate as they see fit.
In chance-based learning, people learn in unplanned and unstructured ways by creatively thinking about problems they face. These creative learners often request environments filled with visualization and co-creation tools so they can problem solve wherever the creativity strikes. Again, a popular method here is activity-based workstations and unassigned seating, allowing learners to position themselves where they can collaborate best.
And lastly, in platform-based learning, curators need to boost participation through seamlessness, friendliness, persistence, and diversity in available platforms. This type of learning occurs in formal settings such as fireside chats, town halls, or even in online forums, resulting in the need for a variety of workstations, from conference rooms to even less formal settings like café workstations or even outdoor work spaces.
Deloitte’s 2018  Future of Work study suggests that 65 percent of our future jobs—those that today’s primary school children will grow into—don’t exist yet. Because of this, Kulkarni and Centinaro suggest that skills that separate us from artificial intelligence—things like critical thinking, creative problem-solving, empathy and emotional intelligence, systemic understanding, interdisciplinary collaboration, camaraderie and fellowship, comfort with ambiguity, and iterating contexts—are all foundational skills of tomorrow’s workforce. By fostering these skill sets through design elements that encourage learning, we can continue to nurture the very elements that make us human.
In this spirit, Marks leaves us with this prediction for the future of neuroscience and design: “As knowledge grows in neuroscience and provides insight into how and why neurons fire in response to certain conditions, data also will increase relevant to the built environment. The hope is that a branch of neuroscience will emerge that is dedicated to understanding how humans interact with space and place. Designers are ultimately in the business of creating experience. The more they may know about pattern statistics and visual perception, how sound waves enter the ear, how the skin reacts to various textures and temperatures, what smells initiate pleasure, and what is retained in our collective memory, the more they will be proficient at their craft.”
