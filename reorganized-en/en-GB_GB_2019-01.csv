HELSINKI —  Jaana Partanen is not your typical AI programming geek.
Until a year ago, the 59-year-old dentist from the Finnish town of Mikkeli had no idea what to make of terms like ""machine learning"" or ""neural networks.""
Now, Partanen spends her evenings learning the basics of coding and she is thinking about how to apply artificial intelligence to her job, either to help write up medical summaries or perform orthodontics.

""I can see it [artificial intelligence] is already here, and it serves us — very much actually,"" she said, adding that following the latest developments in the field has become a hobby.
She's one of tens of thousands of non-technology experts who are taking part in a grand experiment aimed at repurposing the country's economy toward high-end applications of artificial intelligence. The idea has a simple, Nordic ring to it: Start by teaching 1 percent of the country's population, or about 55,000 people, the basic concepts at the root of artificial technology, and gradually build on the number over the next few years.
“We’ll never have so much money that we will be the leader of artificial intelligence. But how we use it — that’s something different"" — Mika Lintilä, economy minister
Originally started as a free-access university course, Finland's ""1 percent"" AI scheme is now being rolled out nationally with the support of private companies and the government.
For Helsinki, there is also a clear economic incentive to training large numbers of Finns in the basics of AI: Doing so may allow Finland to stay competitive amid ever growing competition between China and the United States, and in the aftermath of the rapid decline of Nokia, the national mobile champion that has fallen on hard times.
As the two superpowers vie for technological supremacy, Finland knows it's outclassed on raw resources. There is no point trying to compete with Beijing or Washington in terms of developing the basic technology of AI. So Finland aspires to occupy a niche, as world leader in practical applications of AI, according to Economy Minister Mika Lintilä.

“We’ll never have so much money that we will be the leader of artificial intelligence,” Lintilä said. “But how we use it — that’s something different.""
Setting up the goalposts
Like many ideas in the liberal Nordic country, this one did not originate with government.
It started a short walk away from the economy ministry, in a modern building shared by the University of Helsinki's department of computer science and consulting agency Reaktor. Originally, it was meant as a promotional sideline to a free online course dubbed ""Elements of AI.""
The university and the company decided to launch the course last May with the intention to ""support democracy,"" according to computer scientist Teemu Roos, the mind behind it.
Without requiring any coding skills, the class introduces the basics of artificial intelligence, but does not intend to train a new generation of cutting-edge developers. Instead, it wants to raise awareness about the opportunities and risks of AI among people who are strangers to computer science, so they can decide for themselves what's beneficial and where they want their government to invest.
""That’s how society works — if enough people say they don’t like it, then we regulate it,” he said.

Roos said he came up with the idea in the summer of 2017, after hearing that the Finnish government was fishing around for help from institutions to develop ""lifelong learning"" — or professional training — material on AI.
Roos knew he would need help to make his material approachable for a general audience, so he teamed up with Reaktor. Together they purged his Introduction to AI course, which he had given to his computer science students for six years, of any elements that required programming and designed a slick website.

But the marketers at Reaktor were still worried that the course would stay unnoticed outside of expert circles, and so they came up with the idea to promote it by linking it to an ambitious goal: They convinced some of the country’s largest employers to join them, and announced that by the end of 2018, the course — coupled with other efforts of the industry — would lead to at least 1 percent of Finland’s population being trained in AI.
Quickly, the initiative gathered pace. By mid-December, over 250 companies announced they would participate in the initiative dubbed ""AI challenge."" Paper giant Stora Enso, for instance, pledged to train 1,000 of their employees in AI. Tech companies Elisa and Nokia said they would train their entire workforce.
""The companies participating in the challenge have pledged to train their staff in the basics of AI — with our course or with any material they see fit,"" said Reaktor's chief marketing officer, Ville Valtonen.

In addition to the companies' separate efforts, more than 10,500 people — over 6,300 of them from Finland — had graduated from the course by mid-December, according to Reaktor.

As the initiative began to flourish, government officials took notice, and publicly embraced it. Finland's ministry of foreign affairs and the country's tax authority both announced they would also train their staff — and when the first batches of students graduated from Elements of AI in September 2018, Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö showed up at the ceremony. Among the graduates was dentist Partanen, who traveled over three hours on a bus to take part.
A Finnish language version of the course was launched in November. This, government officials hope, will boost the number of graduates from Finland even further.
Europe's No. 1 laboratory for AI
The grassroots training scheme is just one element of a national plan to turn Helsinki into a leading voice on AI in the world.
In October 2017, Finland was the first EU country to put a national AI strategy into writing. In a second report released in June 2018, the government estimated that around 1 million of its population would eventually need to update their AI skills.
Helsinki's next and final strategy report, due to be published in April, will spell out how to bring small and mid-size enterprises across the country on board ""who have no idea at this point that their future has to do with AI,"" said Ilona Lundström, a director general at Finland’s economy ministry and the key architect behind Helsinki’s national plan for AI.
At the same time, Finland plans to partner up with bordering Estonia and Sweden to become Europe’s No. 1 “laboratory” for AI test trials, she said. And the country wants to use its voice in the European Union, where it is set to take over the council presidency this summer, to lobby for loosening some regulation.

“We are using AI as the flagship project for a bigger kind of setup of themes of digitalization"" — Ilona Lundström, a director general at Finland’s economy ministry
""The old churches used to have a person who’s waking up everybody who is falling asleep while listening to the preacher,"" Lundström said. “Our role is to have the stick and kind of poke people and tell them 'Stay alert, stay awake, be focused and get forward.'”
Helsinki's plan includes pushing for “sandbox environments” to test AI technology across borders. The country is looking at experiments with neighbors to the west and the south, such as cross-border trials in autonomous shipping on the Baltic sea between Finnish or Swedish ports or an experiment to merge some of Finland’s and Estonia’s digital infrastructure.
At the same time, the grassroots AI campaign at home is supposed to have effects that go far beyond artificial intelligence, officials said.
“We are using AI as the flagship project for a bigger kind of setup of themes of digitalization,” Lundström said.

“If you talk about digitalization at large in the same manner, nothing happens. But if you take a special approach like artificial intelligence, things start to move.""

That's been true for dentist Jaana Partanen in Mikkeli.
She has signed up for a course to learn the basics of coding in her hometown, ""the first time they're doing a public programming course here,"" she said.
Computer scientist Roos' team is working on an advanced sequel to the course, which will likely be launched early next summer and require some programming.
Jaana Partanen wants to sign up for it.

Automating government
Getty





Even as artificial intelligence (AI) is forecast to exceed human capabilities across a range of industries it is also predicted to augment human labor. In finance, AI is already helping financial advisors augment financial planning while enhancing investment strategy. And in medicine, AI diagnostics systems have proven to be far more accurate than doctors in diagnosing heart disease and cancerous growths. In fact, McKinsey lists some 400 use cases representing $6 trillion in value across 19 industries in which AI will augment human work.

But what about government? What will the impact of AI be on the nature of government?
Waking Government to AI
 
Not surprisingly much of the public sector has already begun experimenting with AI-driven technologies. At the federal level, many agencies are beginning to deploy AI-powered interfaces for customer service, alongside an expanding use of software to update legacy-systems and automate simple tasks. Growing investments in infrastructure planning, legal adjudication, fraud detection and citizen response systems represent the first phase in the ongoing digitization of government.
PROMOTED
Notwithstanding these investments, however, government remains far behind the private sector in deploying and integrating AI. As Silicon Valley’s Tim O’Reilly has suggested, augmenting government through AI is critical to modernizing the public sector. AI-based applications could potentially reduce backlogs and free workers from mundane tasks while cutting costs. According to Deloitte, documenting and recording information alone consumes a half-billion staff hours each year, at a cost of more than $16 billion in wages. Add to this an additional $15 billion in the procuring and processing of information and the value of AI in transforming government bureaucracy becomes clear.

Some now argue that the affordances of technology are critical to remaking government for the 21st century. Advancing democracies into the era of Big Data could go a long way towards reducing systemic dysfunction within the public sector. Using sensor technologies and machine learning systems to reinforce government oversight could begin to reduce regulation while actually increasing the amount of oversight. Coining the term “algorithmic regulation” for example, O’Reilly suggests that government regulations should be regarded as algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that can be adjusted based on fresh data.
The most recent advancement in AI— deep learning— represents a revolution in the use of machines for supporting decision-management, forecasting, data classification and the synthesis of information. Building on deep learning tools, AI could mean significantly improving service delivery for citizens and elevating the work of public service professionals while also inspiring a new generation of technocrats to enter government. Alternatively, AI could also mean remaking government altogether.

Digital Leviathan
 

In the United States, demographic polarization and toxic federal politics have stymied needed action on a host of pressing issues including immigration reform, welfare reform, gun control and the country’s overall faith in government and its institutions. More problematically this political polarization lends itself to growing concerns about the very efficacy of democracy itself.
Outside the US, China is clearly pioneering an entirely different model of government. Where Soviet-style central planning led to scarcity and oppression, China's new economic thinking is that Big Data can assist planned economies in shaping markets and potentially leapfrogging democracy. Combining Big Data, sensor technologies and AI, China is introducing a techno-utilitarianism that may well outpace participatory decision-making.
Could China’s model work in other countries and if so what would that mean for democracy? In the West, the growing fear is that China will become a kind of digital autocracy on a scale never previously imagined. Given China’s expanding use of AI and its outsized influence on the developing world, this begs the question: what systems of government are necessary for managing AI driven societies? And what is the potential for exploitation in such a vast system of algorithmic management and control?
Technocracy or Democracy?
 
The worrying question today for many is whether democracy can survive AI. The reality is that disruptive technologies like AI cannot be put back in the box. AI is becoming a mainstream technology that will need to be effectively integrated into 21st century decision-making across all institutions— especially government. In the wake of this digital revolution some functions of government will necessarily be eliminated. But AI will also enable new tools for smart citizenship and open government that can augment democracy. Rather than technocracy or democracy, the answer will likely be a combination of both.
What we do know is that we are leaving the era of centralized systems and top-down decision-making. As Beth Noveck, former head of President Obama's Open Government Initiative explains, representative democracy itself now faces a crisis of legitimacy. The rationale for closed systems of decision-making in which citizen participation is confined to voting or interest group activism belongs to a different era. In an era of networks, we now need tools that bridge algorithms with new forms of collaborative decision-making. Simply put, we need digital democracies that build on the capabilities of AI and Big Data.

Author:Anne SradersJan 3, 2019 11:42 AM ESTiStockArtificial intelligence, or AI, is the use of computer science programming to imitate human thought and action by analyzing data and surroundings, solving or anticipating problems and learning or self-teaching to adapt to a variety of tasks.Chances are, you're exposed to artificial intelligence every day. Whether you're browsing your Facebook 
  (FB)  feed or talking to Apple's 
  (AAPL)  Siri, you're interacting with artificial intelligence. And artificial intelligence has been the cause of many of the technological breakthroughs in the past several years - from robots to Tesla 
  (TSLA)  . But while there are certainly naysayers to the technological development, AI seems set to become the future of predictive tech. But, what actually is artificial intelligence, and how does it work? Better still, how is AI being used in 2019? The Future of Vacation PlanningWhat Is Artificial Intelligence? Coined in 1955 by John McCarthy as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,"" artificial intelligence (or AI) is software that is able to use and analyze data, algorithms and programming to perform actions, anticipate problems and learn to adapt to a variety of circumstances with and without supervision. AI is generally broken down into specialized or general and strong or weak AI, depending on its applications. Generally, there are three main divisions of AI - neural networks, machine learning and deep learning. Neural networks (often called artificial neural networks, or ANN) essentially mimic biological neural networks by ""modeling and processing nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs in parallel."" Machine learning generally uses statistics and data to help improve machine functions, while deep learning computes multi-layer neural networks for more advanced learning. The original seven aspects of AI, named by McCarthy and others at the Dartmouth Conference in 1955, include automatic computers, programming AI to use language, hypothetical neuron nets to be used to form concepts, measuring problem complexity, self-improvement, abstractions, and randomness and creativity.How Does Artificial Intelligence Work? So, how does AI actually work? Well, for starters, there are different kinds of AI that operate differently. And while AI is generally a blanket term for these different kinds of functions, there are several different kinds of AI that are programmed for different purposes - including weak and strong AI, specialized and general AI, and other software.Strong vs. Weak AIOn a basic level, the difference between strong and weak AI is supervision. Weak AI is designed to be supervised programming that is a simulation of human thought and interaction - but is ultimately a set of programmed responses or supervised interactions that are merely human-like. Siri and Alexa are a good example of weak AI, because, while they seemingly interact and think like humans when asked questions or to perform tasks, their responses are programmed and they are ultimately assessing which response is appropriate from their bank of responses. For this reason, weak AI like Siri or Alexa don't necessarily understand the true meaning of their commands, merely that they comprehend key words or commands and their algorithms match them up with an action.On the other hand, strong AI is largely unsupervised and uses more clustered or association data processing. Instead of having programmed solutions or responses to problems, strong AI is unsupervised in its problem-solving process. Strong AI is typically known for being able to ""teach"" itself things - for example, strong AI is used to teach itself games and learn to anticipate moves. Even as far back as 2013, AI taught itself Atari 
  (PONGF)  games and ended up beating records and even surpassed humans in several different games. But apart from games, strong AI is commonly associated with the ""scary"" robots and machines that most often plague the public's nightmares of how dangerous AI could be. However, on a basic level, unsupervised learning goes into problems without any pre-programmed answers, and is able to use a mixture of logic and trial and error to learn the answers or categorize things. This is often demonstrated in exercises where strong AI is shown images with colors and shapes and is supposed to categorize and organize them. Specialized vs. General AIBut apart from supervision, there are different functions of AI.Specialized AI is AI that is programmed to perform a specific task. Its programming is meant to be able to learn to perform a certain task - not multiple. For example, from self-driving cars to predictive news feeds, specialized AI has been the dominant form of AI since its inception (although this is rapidly changing). On the other hand, general AI isn't limited to one specific task - it is able to learn and complete numerous different tasks and functions. In general, much of the cutting-edge, boundary-pushing AI developments of recent years have been general AI - which are focused on learning and using unsupervised programming to solve problems for a variety of tasks and circumstances. UsesAs far as its uses go, AI is potentially boundless.However, AI has been leveraged for a variety of industries and purposes.In business, AI has had considerable success in customer service and other business operations. AI has been used in business for various purposes including process automation (by transferring email and call data into record systems, helping resolve billing issues and updating records), cognitive insight (for predicting a buyer's preferences on sites, personalizing advertising and protecting against fraud) and cognitive engagement (used primarily in a customer service capacity to provide 24/7 service and even answers to employee questions regarding internal operations). In fact, 2017 studies show that 45% of people ""prefer chatbots as the primary mode of communication for customer service activities."" For the 2016 year, the global chatbot market was reportedly worth $190.8 million - and could potentially comprise about 25% of customer service interactions by 2020, according to Gartner 
  (IT)  . In addition to its involvement in customer service and business, AI has also been used in recent years for writing news stories. Especially for formulaic articles like earnings reports or sports statistics, AI has increasingly been used to automatically write stories and fill in different data. This technology has been employed by the likes of The Wall Street Journal.""You get these news releases about things that are happening in sports, for example, or in business. But people are not creating these pieces anymore. It's actually A.I. that's releasing this information,"" Stephen Ibaraki, founder and chairman of the UN ITU AI For Good Global Summit with XPRIZE Foundation told Neil Sahota for Forbes this year. ""Lots of us are spending hours on our mobile phones reading updates about events and news flashes never realizing it's A.I. that's generating this stuff now.""And it seems as though AI is even integrating into education.Yi Wang, chairman and CEO of LAIX 
 undefined , a Chinese-based company teaching various languages using AI, told TheStreet back in September that ""we want everyone to become global citizens."" Artificial Intelligence ExamplesIt may come as a surprise that artificial intelligence is all around us - and has even permeated our routine on a daily basis. Whether on our phones or at the cutting edge of technological development, artificial intelligence is all around.Siri/AlexaWhether or not you've thought about that voice in your phone as a product of AI or not, Apple's Siri and Amazon's 
  (AMZN)   Alexa both use AI to help you complete tasks or answer questions on your mobile devices.As examples of weak AI, Siri and Alexa are programmed with responses and actions based on commands or questions posed to them by the phone owner. Facebook FeedBelieve it or not, your Facebook feed is actually using AI to predict what content you want to see and push it higher. Algorithms built into the feeds filter content that is most likely to be of interest to the particular Facebook user and predict what they will want to see. TeslaDespite its founder (the ever-eccentric Elon Musk) being vocally suspicious of advanced AI technology, Tesla's electronic cars use a variety of AI - including self-driving capacities. Tesla also uses crowd-sourced data from its vehicles to improve their systems.  NetflixYes, while you are chilling on your couch with some Netflix (NFLX)  , you are reaping the benefits of AI technology.The media streaming site uses advanced predictive technology to suggest shows based on your viewing preferences or rating. And while the data currently seems to favor bigger, more popular films over smaller ones, it is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Still, how did AI get from a futuristic technology to part of our daily lives?  History of Artificial IntelligenceAlthough it is widely known for being cutting edge, the processes and concepts behind AI have been around for a while. In fact, according to Bernard Marr, a best-selling author and Forbes contributor,""the theory and the fundamental computer science which makes it possible has been around for decades.""So, how did AI get started, and how has it progressed?As far back as the mid 1600s, French scientist and philosopher Rene Descartes hypothesized about two divisions - machines that could one day think and learn a specific task, and those that could adapt to perform a variety of different tasks as humans do. These two veins were later called specialized and general AI.The so-called Turing Test, proposed in 1950 by English mathematician Alan M. Turing, attempted to determine when a computer could actually think. The test predicted that, by 2000, AI computers would be able to be nearly indistinguishable from humans after interrogation, although this test has never been ""passed."" By 1955, the Dartmouth Conference (or the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) developed some of the first concepts of AI. Spurred on by Dartmouth College professor John McCarthy, AI was given a comprehensive definition, and other concepts like machine learning, language processing and neural networks were hypothesized and introduced. In 1966, ELIZA, the first chatbot, was developed at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum and is the predecessor of the likes of Siri and Alexa. Although ELIZA didn't actually speak (and communicated via text instead), the technology was the first that was developed to relay messages in language (or natural language processing) as opposed to using computer code and programming. AI moved from a largely cutting-edge technological development to useful applications in business by 1980, when Digital Equipment Corporation's XCON was able to save the company around $40 million in 1986 through its learning system. And after the development of the internet in the early 1990s, the sharing of data across the web only increased AI's capabilities. By 1997, Deep Blue - IBM's 
  (IBM)  supercomputer - beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov through a variety of calculations, and indicated that AI was developing to possibly best humans.  But apart from games, AI was developing to operate automobiles as well. The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge put the prowess of automated vehicles on display as they raced a course in the Mojave desert. And just six years later, IBM's cognitive computing engine Watson beat Jeopardy's champion, winning the $1 million prize money - further indicating AI's capabilities in successfully navigating language-based problems. Still, it wasn't until 2012 that the full capabilities of AI were beginning to be understood. The research paper Building High-Level Features Using Large Scale Unsupervised Learning was published in 2012 by researchers at Google 
  (GOOGL)  and Stanford, and explained advances in unsupervised learning through deep neural networks that allowed AI to learn to recognize different pictures of cats without labeling the pictures. This breakthrough was progressed further in 2015, when researchers officially declared that computers were better at recognizing images than humans following the ImageNet challenge. The challenge had computers identify 1,000 objects.In 2016, Google subsidiary Deep Mind's AlphaGo software was able to beat Go world champion Lee Sedol over the course of five matches. The defeat was more impressive than AI's previous superiority in chess because Go has over 100,000 potential opening moves, and it forced AlphaGo to use neural networks to learn the game and defeat its opponent. The defeat marked an astonishing breakthrough that demonstrated AI's ability to learn on its own. However, one of AI's most recent and promising applications has been with self-driving cars, released in 2018. Google spin-off Waymo released self-driving taxi service in Phoenix called Waymo One - which is reportedly used by around 400 citizens. Artificial Intelligence News in 2019 So, what's happening with AI in 2019? AI and Elon MuskSurprisingly, Musk has been one of the most vocal criticizers of advanced AI technology - despite owning a company, OpenAI, dedicated to AI research. Musk's co-founded company researches ways to responsibly and safely progress AI technology - which Musk sees as imperative. The Tesla CEO recently claimed in a documentary ""Do You Trust This Computer?"" that super computers could become ""an immortal dictator from which we would never escape.""However, Zia Chishti, chairman and CEO of AI firm Afiniti, told TheStreet earlier this year that the hype over the dangers of AI may be overblown.""AI is just a way to identify patterns in complex fields, it's not going to nuke the world -- there is no chance of that. I think the visions of the impending apocalypse as a result of robot intelligence is fanciful -- so I wouldn't be overly concerned about Elon Musk's perspective on it,"" Chishti said. Korean Killer RobotsStill, Musk's warnings may be somewhat warranted.Recent reports claim that South Korean university Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has partnered with a defense company to create ""killer robots."" Some 50 academics reportedly signed a letter calling for a boycott of KAIST and Hanwha Systems amid concerns of an arms race. ""There are plenty of great things you can do with AI that save lives, including in a military context, but to openly declare the goal is to develop autonomous weapons and have a partner like this sparks huge concern,"" Toby Walsh, professor at University of New South Wales and organizer of the boycott, told The Guardian earlier this year. Concerns over the development of ""killer robots"" and AI weapons remains a concern going into 2019. The Sex Robot DisruptionHowever, on the opposite side of the spectrum, disruption is seemingly occurring in a rather unusual market - sex dolls.Matt McMullen, CEO of Realbotix and RealDoll and creator of the sex robot, Harmony, set out to incorporate AI technology with sex dolls to create an altogether eerily human-like robot. ""I like building this robot and seeing it move and talk and interact with people, what it does to them. It just opens up Pandora's box of psychology and science, "" McMullen told Forbes earlier this year. ""It's been evident that when you are using a very lifelike robot as a conduit for the AI and for the conversation, people tend to talk to that in a different way than they would, say, something on a computer screen. Putting that device in someone's home where they're relaxed and they're in their own environment creates another level of comfort.""Still, concerns over the implications of these AI, life-like dolls - especially in relation to intimacy issues and mental health - are rampant. Among many others, one such opponent of AI-partnered sex robots is Kathleen Richardson, professor of Ethics and Culture of Robots and AI at De Montfort University in Leicester, England.""Basically, to say a relationship doesn't need to involve another human being, ... We're living in a culture where we have a surplus of human beings, we don't have any problems with the amount of human beings that we have in the world, but we're creating this culture and this climate where we're trying to encourage people to form relationships with commercial goods, basically,"" Richardson told Forbes in September.And while many of the recent AI developments have been blanketed in controversy, innovators continue to push the boundaries.""The individual in question who finds this happiness with an AI-driven robot, and finds intimacy that they never had with another person-whose job does it become to intervene and say, 'no, you can't do that. That's not right,'"" McMullen questioned.AI and Counseling? Still, in a slightly less controversial vein, AI has made recent strides in the field of mental health and counseling. Woebot, an intelligent software application, is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and even charities are considering using the technology to help meet demands for counseling, according to The Guardian. For those like Aidan Jones, the chief executive of Relate, a relationship counseling charity, ""we have to start to look at what can be done with a non-human interaction,"" Jones told The Times.Woebot uses what's called cognitive behavioral therapy (or CBT) to help counsel users. The company released an iOS app in January, offering a texting-based service.""The Woebot experience doesn't map onto what we know to be a human-to-computer relationship, and it doesn't map onto what we know to be a human-to-human relationship either,"" Alison Darcy, a clinical psychologist at Stanford University and creator of Woebot told Business Insider in January. ""It seems to be something in the middle.""AI ExportsMost recently, Silicon Valley is reportedly concerned over the possibility of regulators curbing exports of AI technology from the U.S., according to The New York Times.The Commerce Department allegedly named artificial intelligence as an item that would be re-evaluated under new export rules designed to increase national security. The principle concern seems to revolve around how exports of AI may boost the industries in other countries like China, potentially to the detriment of the U.S.""The number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very, very, very small, and the chance of making an error is quite large,"" Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, told The New York Times. ""If this goes wrong, it could do real damage to the A.I. community.""Still, it appears that, with every innovation in AI, new concerns over ethics, economics and safety seem to progress with them. By Anne SradersLatest from TheStreet Pro:TheStreet ProWith Trump Victory a Foregone Conclusion, Expect a Rate Cut in SeptemberBy Bob Byrne42 minutes agoTheStreet ProAMZNWMTTGTPrime Time for Amazon, J.D.

AI Will Create Millions More Jobs Than It Will Destroy. Here’s How



By Byron Reese
January 1, 2019 







In the past few years, artificial intelligence has advanced so quickly that it now seems hardly a month goes by without a newsworthy AI breakthrough. In areas as wide-ranging as speech translation, medical diagnosis, and gameplay, we have seen computers outperform humans in startling ways.
This has sparked a discussion about how AI will impact employment. Some fear that as AI improves, it will supplant workers, creating an ever-growing pool of unemployable humans who cannot compete economically with machines.
This concern, while understandable, is unfounded. In fact, AI will be the greatest job engine the world has ever seen.
New Technology Isn’t a New Phenomenon
On the one hand, those who predict massive job loss from AI can be excused. It is easier to see existing jobs disrupted by new technology than to envision what new jobs the technology will enable.
But on the other hand, radical technological advances aren’t a new phenomenon. Technology has progressed nonstop for 250 years, and in the US unemployment has stayed between 5 to 10 percent for almost all that time, even when radical new technologies like steam power and electricity came on the scene.
But you don’t have to look back to steam, or even electricity. Just look at the internet. Go back 25 years, well within the memory of today’s pessimistic prognosticators, to 1993. The web browser Mosaic had just been released, and the phrase “surfing the web,” that most mixed of metaphors, was just a few months old.
If someone had asked you what would be the result of connecting a couple billion computers into a giant network with common protocols, you might have predicted that email would cause us to mail fewer letters, and the web might cause us to read fewer newspapers and perhaps even do our shopping online. If you were particularly farsighted, you might have speculated that travel agents and stockbrokers would be adversely affected by this technology. And based on those surmises, you might have thought the internet would destroy jobs.
But now we know what really happened. The obvious changes did occur. But a slew of unexpected changes happened as well. We got thousands of new companies worth trillions of dollars. We bettered the lot of virtually everyone on the planet touched by the technology. Dozens of new careers emerged, from web designer to data scientist to online marketer. The cost of starting a business with worldwide reach plummeted, and the cost of communicating with customers and leads went to nearly zero. Vast storehouses of information were made freely available and used by entrepreneurs around the globe to build new kinds of businesses.
But yes, we mail fewer letters and buy fewer newspapers.
The Rise of Artificial Intelligence
Then along came a new, even bigger technology: artificial intelligence. You hear the same refrain: “It will destroy jobs.”
Consider the ATM. If you had to point to a technology that looked as though it would replace people, the ATM might look like a good bet; it is, after all, an automated teller machine. And yet, there are more tellers now than when ATMs were widely released. How can this be? Simple: ATMs lowered the cost of opening bank branches, and banks responded by opening more, which required hiring more tellers.
In this manner, AI will create millions of jobs that are far beyond our ability to imagine. For instance, AI is becoming adept at language translation—and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for human translators is skyrocketing. Why? If the cost of basic translation drops to nearly zero, the cost of doing business with those who speak other languages falls. Thus, it emboldens companies to do more business overseas, creating more work for human translators. AI may do the simple translations, but humans are needed for the nuanced kind.
In fact, the BLS forecasts faster-than-average job growth in many occupations that AI is expected to impact: accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, dietitians, financial specialists, web developers, loan officers, medical secretaries, and customer service representatives, to name a very few. These fields will not experience job growth in spite of AI, but through it.
But just as with the internet, the real gains in jobs will come from places where our imaginations cannot yet take us.
Parsing Pessimism
You may recall waking up one morning to the news that “47 percent of jobs will be lost to technology.”
That report by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne is a fine piece of work, but readers and the media distorted their 47 percent number. What the authors actually said is that some functions within 47 percent of jobs will be automated, not that 47 percent of jobs will disappear.
Frey and Osborne go on to rank occupations by “probability of computerization” and give the following jobs a 65 percent or higher probability: social science research assistants, atmospheric and space scientists, and pharmacy aides. So what does this mean? Social science professors will no longer have research assistants? Of course they will. They will just do different things because much of what they do today will be automated.
The intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released a report of their own in 2016. This report, titled “The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries,” applies a different “whole occupations” methodology and puts the share of jobs potentially lost to computerization at nine percent. That is normal churn for the economy.
But what of the skills gap? Will AI eliminate low-skilled workers and create high-skilled job opportunities? The relevant question is whether most people can do a job that’s just a little more complicated than the one they currently have. This is exactly what happened with the industrial revolution; farmers became factory workers, factory workers became factory managers, and so on.
Embracing AI in the Workplace
A January 2018 Accenture report titled “Reworking the Revolution” estimates that new applications of AI combined with human collaboration could boost employment worldwide as much as 10 percent by 2020.
Electricity changed the world, as did mechanical power, as did the assembly line. No one can reasonably claim that we would be better off without those technologies. Each of them bettered our lives, created jobs, and raised wages. AI will be bigger than electricity, bigger than mechanization, bigger than anything that has come before it.
This is how free economies work, and why we have never run out of jobs due to automation. There are not a fixed number of jobs that automation steals one by one, resulting in progressively more unemployment. There are as many jobs in the world as there are buyers and sellers of labor.

The streets were full of horses and carts. Life expectancy for someone born that year was just 41. Wind forward to 1962 and working conditions had greatly improved. The streets were full of cars and trucks and the jet age had begun. Life expectancy had nearly doubled, to 71.The year 2062 – when it’s estimated that computers will become as intelligent as us – may well be a similarly optimistic time.
The price of basic goods should have fallen dramatically, as they’ll be produced by more efficient ­machines. Poverty could be a distant memory, if we share the wealth created by robots that never sleep.If you’ve been enjoying a long Christmas holiday and are wishing you didn’t have to go back to work tomorrow, consider this: by 2062, technological advances may have resulted in weekends lasting four or five days.But with some leading economists worrying that many jobs are simply going to disappear by 2062, with little or none of the income sharing needed to make up for this, will the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in fact leave lots of people behind?Akin Robotics is one of the first humanoid robotics factories to start mass production. Its creations are programmed to work in shopping centres, airports, hospitals and homes (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Should we be worried?Economists have been making predictions about industrial advances causing job losses for decades. Back in 1930, for example, John Maynard Keynes warned about “technological unemployment”. Yet joblessness today is at historically low levels in most countries, despite the world’s population being bigger than ever.Work hasn’t ended – indeed, many of us seem to be spending more and more time doing it.Modern fears about future job displacement can be traced to a 2013 study on the impact of automation, by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University. This made a much-quoted prediction that 47 per cent of jobs in the US  were under threat of automation over the next two decades, a figure that would surely be very similar in the UK.Since that report – which ironically used machine learning to predict which of over 700 different jobs could be automated – Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, predicted in November 2015 that around half of all jobs in the UK were at risk of automation.And in October 2016 Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, predicted that 69 per cent of jobs in India and 77 per cent of jobs in China are  at risk.Robots made to produce the Mini Cooper at BMW’s plant at Cowley in Oxford (Photo: ANDREW COWIE/AFP/Getty Images)Which jobs are really at risk?Frey and Osborne found a 94 per cent probability that a bicycle repair job will be automated in the next two decades. But bikes are fiddly objects to repair and have lots of non-standard parts. It would require a very expensive robot for a job that isn’t well paid, so it will not be economically viable.Added to this, being a bicycle repair person is a social job. It’s about talking to the customer, selling them the latest kit, offering tips on good places to ride. It’s not just about repairing bikes. Frey and Osborne didn’t take factors  like these into account.Bicycle repair is one job that may be beyond a machine (Photo: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)Their study also found a 55 per cent probability that a commercial pilot will be automated in the next two decades. From a technical perspective, we can already automate much of this job today. Yet that 55 per cent figure seems unlikely; Boeing predicts that over 600,000 new pilots will be needed during that time.Another prediction is that there’s a 98 per cent probability that fashion models will disappear in the next two decades. Are we really going to replace human pouts, hip-swaying and swagger with robotic catwalk performers? We don’t want to know what  clothes look like on a robot, but on a person. And robots aren’t going to be walking in high heels anytime soon.It’s also surely too blunt to say many whole job types will cease to exist. Frey and Osborne classified “accountant and auditor” as being at risk. They are certainly parts of these that will be automated, but I doubt the job will cease to exist.
Fast facts: automation and jobs
A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2017 analysed the impact of automation in the US between 1993 and 2007. It found that on average, every new robot replaced around 5.6 workers – and offsetting gains were not observed in other occupations.
It estimated that every additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the total population in employment in the US by 0.34 per cent.
Automation also put pressure on the jobs that remained. Every additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced wages by 0.5 per cent.
The number of industrial robots in the US quadrupled, eliminating an estimated half a million jobs.Toby Walsh is Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Australia (Photo: La Trobe University Press)Some roles are starting to be automated without being replaced by jobs elsewhere, such as in the oil industry. The price of oil collapsed from $115 per barrel in August  2014 to below $30 at the start of 2016. This drove the industry to decrease headcount and introduce more automation.Nearly half a million jobs disappeared from the oil industry worldwide. But now, as the price of oil is rebounding, and the industry is growing, fewer than half of those jobs have returned. ­Automation has reduced 20 people typically working at a well to just five.The developing world  may suffer, however. Globalisation outsourced many jobs from rich economies to poorer ones, such as call centres relocating to India and factories in the Far East serving the West. These trends may now start to reverse. The improved efficiencies that AI and robotics will bring may shift many of these jobs back to the developed world.Industrial robots weld parts of chassis of the Volkswagen Golf 7 model in Wolfsburg, Germany (Photo: RONNY HARTMANN/AFP/Getty Images)How can businesses survive?The music business suggests how some industries might adapt. ­Digital music hasn’t resulted in fewer human musicians. Indeed, the demand for musicians is predicted to increase modestly in the next decade. Also, many musicians now make more money from performance than from recording. We value experiences, hearing our musical idols in person.Even supposing the prediction that 47 per cent of jobs are at risk of automation proves to be accurate, that would not translate  into 47 per cent unemployment. There will be many new jobs created by technology.Just look at the industrial revolution. Before then, most people worked in agriculture or as craftspeople. Many of these jobs became mechanised – but new ones were created in offices and factories.Some people suggest that “robot repair person” will be one of the new jobs. I am entirely unconvinced by this example, ­however. The thousands of people who used  to paint and weld in car factories got replaced by only a couple of robot repair people. There’s also no reason why robots won’t be able to repair other robots. We already have factories where robots make robots. There are even “dark factories” – which have no people and so no need for lights – in which robots work night and day building other robots.The Japanese company FANUC, one of the largest manufacturers of industrial robots, has operated one of these near Mount Fuji since 2001, helping the firm achieve annual sales of around $6bn (£4.7bn).Akin robots are able to speak, recognise faces, use the internet and process what they see, hear and smell (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Can I have a four-day weekend?To avoid 47 per cent unemployment, we might just work a shorter week. That was  the case during the industrial revolution.
Before then, many of us would wake up with the sun, go out into the fields and work till the sun went down, and then go to bed. Many worked around 60 hours per week. After the industrial revolution, work was reduced to around 40 hours per week for most people. Some of us even got a few weeks of holiday each year.The same could happen with the AI revolution. We could shorten the working day. Or we could have a three-day or four-day weekend.However, this would require some of the wealth generated by increasing productivity to be shared around, and there is little evidence this is  starting to happen. Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case. Wage growth for most workers in developed economies has stopped, or is failing to keep up with the limited inflation we now experience.There is an argument that we could afford to work less, as more efficient machines will make many of life’s essentials cheaper. So we might not need wage growth in order to work less. We could therefore – in theory, at least – live on less.Audi’s electric engine assembly line in Gyor, Hungary (Photo: Laszlo Balogh/Getty Images)Who will be the first to suffer?In the developed world, the canaries in the coal mine are likely to be drivers of taxis, trucks and delivery vehicles.There will be benefits to this. Around 95 per cent of road deaths are caused by driver error. The sooner we replace human drivers with reliable computers, the better. Around three-quarters of the cost of transporting goods by truck are the labour. But an autonomous truck will not need to take breaks so can drive for twice as long, at nearly one-quarter the cost. That’s roughly an eightfold increase in productivity.For lorry drivers, the transition might be relatively painless. In Australia, for example, the average age of a lorry driver is 47. In a decade or so, many  will retire, their jobs being taken by automated trucks. Young people will simply not enter the profession.But for taxi drivers, change might be quicker and more painful. One of the newest jobs on the planet – being an Uber driver – might also be one of the shortest-lived.Robots at the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US Warren Stamping Plant (Photo: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)How should we prepare?One way to keep ahead of the machines will be to learn new skills as new technologies are invented. Learning will need to be lifelong.We will also need to consider large changes to our educational system. Greater emphasis on Stem subjects (science, ­technology, engineering and mathematics) is definitely not the  answer. There will be only a limited demand for computer programmers; indeed, when AI succeeds, much of the programming will be done by the computers themselves.Humans will instead need strong analytical skills. They will need emotional and social intelligence. And they will need all the other traits that makes us human, such as creativity, resilience, determination and curiosity.By 2062 machines will probably be superhuman, so it’s hard to imagine any job in which we will remain superior. This means the only jobs left will be those in which we prefer people to be doing the work.Stilton cheese is made by humans – and long may it continue that way (Photo: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)The AI  revolution will be about rediscovering the things that make us human. This is a reason why it might be called the Second Renaissance. We will be rediscovering our humanity.By 2062, machines will be able to write plays to rival Shakespeare’s Macbeth. To paint works as provocative as Picasso’s Guernica. And to compose music as beautiful as that of Beethoven. But we’ll still prefer works produced by human artists. These works will speak to the human experience, which a robot can never feel.There will be plenty of artisan jobs we value, too. Brewing craft beer. Making cheese. Growing organic  wine. Throwing pottery by hand. We will buy the hand-carved wooden bowl over the cheaper, more perfect machine-made one.We still appreciate handmade goods (Photo: FETHI BELAID/AFP/Getty Images)As social animals, we will also increasingly appreciate and value social interactions with other humans. Barristas will be pushing buttons on computer-controlled coffee machines that make ­perfect coffee every time, but we’ll still line up to have a human make us coffee for the chitchat. For the smile and the human experience.We will still prefer a human sales assistant to help us choose a dress. A human doctor to deliver bad news about our blood test. A human barman to  pour us a glass of whisky and offer a consoling word. A human coach to help get us fit. And a human judge to pass sentence in our courts.The most important human traits in 2062 will be our social and emotional intelligence, as well as our artistic and artisan skills.The irony is that our technological future will not be about technology, but about our humanity. And the jobs of the future are the most human ones.This is an edited excerpt from ‘2062: The World That AI Made’ by Toby Walsh (£14.95, La Trobe University Press), out now",,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071'}, 'author': {'name': 'Toby Walsh', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/person/05be1204e85ee70e56668f58ea84ffc4', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/author/toby-walsh'}, 'headline': 'Will automation and AI give us four-day weekends &#8211; or simply leave us without jobs?', 'datePublished': '2019-01-01T06:00:54+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-10-07T20:00:56+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071'}, 'wordCount': 2321, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#organization'}, 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/ImageObject/23f6d45d8ea8d8d92b814126384530a82a9c307e', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'width': 960, 'height': 640}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'keywords': ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Features', 'Jobs', 'Robots', 'Work'], 'articleSection': ['Long Reads', 'Technology'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071', 'name': 'Will robots and AI give us four-day weekends - or leave us without jobs?', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#website', 'type': 'WebSite'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'datePublished': '2019-01-01T06:00:54+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-10-07T20:00:56+00:00', 'description': 'Smart machines could give us all lives of leisure in future – or they may simply leave us without any wages.

Introduction
The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) — from artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), through artificial general intelligence (AGI), to artificial superintelligence (ASI) — is on its way to changing everything. It's expected that soon, artificial intelligence will combine the intricacy and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence with the speed, memory and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence.

As the rise of AI continues, AI is challenging and changing not only the way humans live, learn and work, but also how entities across nations: its government, industries, organizations, and academia (NGIOA) construct their commercial and economic industries and markets. With this technology-driven growth of artificial intelligence, the need to do most manual, mathematical and mundane work is already in decline and will likely be greatly diminished in the coming years. Moreover, with all these new digital assistants and decision-making algorithms assisting and directing humans, more complex day-to-day work for humans is being greatly lessened.
While attempts to create artificial intelligence have fueled many applications and technological advances, it's fundamentally the increased processing capabilities that have made it possible to design intelligent machines that can rapidly compute and make intelligent implications from diverse data inputs. Despite these rapid advances in processing capabilities, human-like artificial intelligence, however, remains hard to determine—as it still requires further understanding of how to replicate human brain performance and processing in computers. While many computer scientists believe that mimicking the processing method of the human brain will be the key to achieving human-like artificial intelligence, that alone is perhaps not enough, and many other variables will need to be evaluated, like memory and conscience.
PROMOTED
Moreover, since current computer processing systems are not effectively able to process the massive amounts of diverse data and information required to achieve human brain-like processing power, there is perhaps a need for developing a fundamentally new computing system and new computing hardware and software infrastructures that are mathematically correct, adaptable, energy independent and secure.

Towards Artificial Super Intelligence
The potential development of artificial superintelligence points to a frankly scary scenario in the coming years. Eventually, the processing power of the human brain may not be able to match that of ASI, and the risk manager in each one of us must begin thinking about the risks that arise from a situation in which humans are competing -- rather than collaborating -- with AI.
These risks to natural human intelligence are compounded when one remembers that AI will reach a point where it will be able to improve its own software design and capabilities far beyond what its designers envisioned. Already, AI researchers are working to develop this ability for self-improvement in more benign situations, such as photo recognition and games. Admittedly, hardware would likely also need to be evolving simultaneously, but this potentially exponential growth in AI warrants greater caution.

These fears are heightened by the reports emerging about how the structure of the adult human brain changes when a new cognitive or motor skill, including vocabulary, is learned. As a result, there is a growing concern that when AI takes over most human tasks and intelligence work, this may change the level of human intelligence and the nature of natural human intelligence as well. If the human brain is not allowed the opportunities to learn new skills, how will its development suffer? That brings us to the question:
Enhance Human Intelligence or Artificial Intelligence?
Natural human intelligence has always seemed to be one of humanity's greatest weapons against its enemies. Therefore, as artificial intelligence matches and surpasses human intelligence, the question is whether natural intelligence will be able to compete with artificial intelligence in the coming years.
The answer to this question will define the future of humanity, as at some point, when and if artificial intelligence becomes an enemy to humankind, natural human intelligence may or may not be enough to defeat artificial intelligence. So, although artificial intelligence is becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives, the question everyone across nations needs to evaluate today is whether our efforts should be towards enhancing human intelligence or artificial intelligence.
So, what can humans do as a species to proactively plan against that scenario? In the below video, I interviewed Prof. Risto Ilmoniemi, Head of the Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University School of Science, Finland.  They need to focus on the science of intelligence. Risk Group initiated this much-needed discussion on the Science of Intelligence on Risk Roundup.
Disclosure: Risk Group LLC is my company.





Prof. Risto Ilmoniemi, Head of the Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University School of Science, Finland participates in Risk Roundup to discuss “Science of Intelligence: Human Intelligence to Computational Intelligence”.
About Human Intelligence
From the beginning of human time, the power of imagination has helped humans explore the unknown, evolve and change the world. As seen over the years, humans have fundamentally transformed geospace with ideas, imagination, and innovation, and that same power of imagination will likely help humans explore the unknown of cyberspace, space and the spaces we haven’t even defined yet, and thereby change the realities of the human ecosystem in the coming years. Imagination has always been an indicator of human intelligence. In fact, imagination is a creative power that is necessary for inventions in cyberspace, geospace, and space (CGS)—and the same power of imagination is driving scientists today to better understand human intelligence.
From what is known about humans, natural intelligence evolution has proceeded by natural selection -- from random mutations -- and by a greater societal emphasis on education and learning. Some studies indicate that heritability (genes) may account for up to 50 percent of intelligence levels; and the role of the environment (education, environment, experience, resources, etc.) contribute to the rest. While much about the human brain genome is already decoded, we still don’t have a clear understanding of how exactly to enhance human intelligence. The reason behind this limited understanding is that the human brain is incredibly complex, with a network of perhaps 100 billion neurons that function individually and collectively, and as a result, understanding of the human brain remains difficult.
However, recent research by Joe Tsien and his team from Augusta University in Georgia have speculated that there must be a basic design principle from which human intelligence originates and the brain evolves—and that one simple algorithm can explain human intelligence. So, if the origins of human intelligence are based on a fundamental algorithm, it is necessary to understand and evaluate whether brain computations rely on relatively simple mathematical logic or a more complex process. Moreover, if human intelligence is indeed based on a fundamental mathematical logic, then the current advances in neuroscience and computer science give hope to evolving human intelligence at the speed of AI’s evolution due to exploding processing speed.
Having said that, knowing what determines intelligence is perhaps still the biggest question facing humanity today. Given there are many theories of intelligence, a question that remains is whether intelligence is a single general ability with a single point of origin or a set of many abilities with multiple, complex points of origin.
While there is a growing concern that human intelligence evolution is stagnant, science is now perhaps getting closer to entering a new phase in which it will be possible to change and improve human DNA. While neuroscience still has a long way to go, and this is most likely decades away, these advances in science and technology will almost certainly discover how to modify and enhance natural human intelligence eventually.
Now, irrespective of human intelligence or AI, intelligence is believed by some, such as Joe Tsien and his team from Augusta University in Georgia, to be having a very simple mathematical pattern underlying it. So, in theory, if the information and processes of the human mind can be disassociated from the biological form, it is no longer tied to biological limits such as lifespan or memory lapse and aging processes. Furthermore, information and knowledge stored within a human brain or information within a computer’s memory could then be copied or transferred to one or many other recipients, whether they be digital, robotic or biological.
Although there are many efforts going on across nations to understand the origin of intelligence within the human genome, it remains to be seen how effective gene editing or any other technology can be at influencing intelligence. The time is now to use all available resources for ensuring that this is not the end of the growth of natural human intelligence but rather just the beginning. So, even though, artificial intelligence is becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives, understanding how the human brain produces intelligent and self-aware behavior is still perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing science and technology today
Developing Control
To reach the desired end in intelligence evolution requires an evolution of both natural and artificial intelligence: collective machine intelligence that can help solve complex challenges facing humanity and human intelligence evolution that can be ready to take on artificial intelligence if it goes against humanity. After all, a conscious AI may not have the same priorities and values as does humanity -- who knows if advanced AI will value human life?
Humans have no choice but to learn to think in a new way to survive as a species as artificial intelligence continues to evolve exponentially (and as of now, natural human intelligence remains limited and fixed). It is more important than ever that natural human intelligence evolution also happens simultaneously, and it is within human control and power to make ourselves more intelligent.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  wikiMany of the pivotal technologies utilized by the public today have their roots in military projects. The internet’s first successful message transfer was due to a U.S. Department of Defense-awarded contract in 1969 for the development of the “ARPANET project.” Global Positioning System (GPS) technology utilized in smartphones today was put in place and created in the 1970s for accurate military positioning, coordination, and tracking.  It follows that keeping abreast with the current applications of artificial intelligence at the top five military defense contractors can be fruitful for business leaders looking for successful examples of the implementation of AI today. These examples could also illuminate the near-term business capabilities of AI in the business world. This article serves to present a broad look at the implementation of AI by the five leading defense contractors in the U.S. as ranked by total revenue. Many of these companies have a number of projects that involve AI, and so we can’t cover all of them. Additionally, with the burgeoning and new field of AI could come a large strategic advantage to those militaries capable of utilizing it over the militaries and governments that struggle to develop it. It would then stand to reason that some of the projects or contracts currently worked on by these top contractors may be highly classified and thus bear limited or no information on them to the public. The US Department of Defense does create and administer such projects, known as Special Access Program (SAP) or black projects. Examples include a project that developed the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft by Lockheed Martin and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber by Northrop Grumman. Both of these projects were highly classified and denied as even existing until their public announcement in 1983 and 1997 respectively.  Many of the initiatives outlined in this report reference DARPA. DARPA stands for Defense Advancement Research Projects Agency, and it acts to make investments in innovative technologies to aid the United States military. DARPA has 220 government employees and acts as both a developer and management structure of US military and private sector partnerships for the development of innovative technologies. If defense contractors are hired to work on new US military technology projects, it is likely DARPA is the authority the contractor will answer to for continued renewal of research contracts (or grants) for the US military and the agency granting approval for cutting the check.  In attempts to expedite and streamline the research and development of AI initiatives at the US Department of Defense (DoD), the DoD announced the creation of JAIC (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center) on June 27th, 2018. The project is lead by Dana Deasy, former CIO at JP Morgan Chase and current CIO at the Pentagon. JAIC is essentially a new branch of DARPA, and under DARPA’s administration and budget.  JAIC seems to symbolize DARPA’s newfound prioritization of AI projects for military use. Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan wrote in his memo signifying the creation of JAIC: This effort is a Department priority. Speed and security are of the essence…I expect all offices and personnel to provide all reasonable support necessary to make rapid enterprise-wide AI adoption a reality. We’ll explore the applications of each contractor one-by-one. The top 5 US contractors below have been rank-ordered by their size, starting with Lockheed Martin, the largest. 1. Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) In 2017, Lockheed Martin reported $51 billion in revenue, $35.2 Billion reported from contracts with the US Government. This makes Lockheed Martin the largest contractor for the US military and the largest military contractor in the world. Established in 1995,  Lockheed Martin is a publicly-traded company that employs over 100,000 people. Much of Lockheed Martin’s AI technology research and development is executed by a fully-owned subsidiary company, Advanced Technologies Laboratories (ATL).  Lockheed Martin reported $1.2 billion in research and development spending in 2017, but the company only highlights or alludes to artificial intelligence or machine learning once within their annual report. It reports they “demonstrated an array of remotely piloted and autonomous vehicles for military, civilian, and commercial applications.” Determining Lockheed Martin’s monetary commitments to their programs that involve AI is difficult without inside knowledge; however, we believe a portion of their $1.2 billion dollars in R&D spending is allocated to an autonomous drone initiative and Convoy Active Safety Technology (CAST). The autonomous drone initiative was reported on in our piece entirely on Lockheed Martin’s AI applications for the military. Convoy Active Safety Technology is a system installed on military vehicles designed to make them semi-autonomous. Should soldiers driving in the middle of a convoy suddenly come under enemy fire, the CAST-equipped vehicle can lock-on to the vehicle ahead of it and drive itself using machine vision. This could give the operator in the driver’s seat the opportunity to better defend themselves in the heat of battle. Below is a 1-minute video showing how the CAST system works:  2. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) In 2017, Boeing Defense, the predominantly non-commercial division of Boeing that focuses on government contracts, reported $29.5 billion in revenue. This makes it the second largest defense contractor for the US military and the world. Boeing, established in 1916,  is a publicly-traded company that employs over 120,000 people. Boeing reported $3.2 billion dollars in research and development spending in 2017. $834 million of that figure was specifically in the Defense, Space & Security category. As detailed in our report on AI at Boeing, Boeing is attempting to pioneer the military use of autonomous craft for sea, space, and air, showcasing ten separate autonomous military sea, space, and air vehicles on their website.  The autonomous vehicle with the most real-world use case is the RQ-21A Blackjack. The Blackjack is intended to have autonomous flight time endurance of 16+ hours per day depending on the configurations of the plane’s tools and payloads. This UAV is Currently flown by Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 and 2 (VMU-1 and VMU-2), supporting expeditionary operations worldwide. Below is a short 3-minute video demonstrating how Blackjack takes off, flies, and lands:  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on machine vision. Machine vision is a form of artificial intelligence that applies machine learning to labeled images and video data captured by a camera. A more in-depth explanation of how autonomous vehicles work using machine vision can be found in our report on machine vision in the military. On August 1st of 2018, Boeing announced the Boeing Aerospace & Autonomy Center, which will house employees from Boeing and subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences who “will focus on designing, building and flying autonomous aircraft and developing enabling technologies.” 3. General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) General Dynamics Corp.’s reported total revenue for 2017 was $30.97 billion, making it the third largest US military defense contractor. General Dynamics, founded in 1899, is a publicly-traded company that employs 98,600 people.  Our research yielded very little AI-based initiatives at General Dynamics, although as is the trend in big business today, innovative projects utilizing AI seem to be just taking root at General Dynamics. The company published a press release specifically noting that their 2018 hackathon had an AI innovation theme. Hackathons are multi-day, department-wide events meant to bring together company employees and generate valuable brainstorming, as well as intra-department team building.  Dozens of data scientists, analysts, and programmers formed 11 teams that competed in a series of technical challenges, each designed to stretch skills and expose team members to various machine learning data analytics tools, like Amazon Machine Learning. As teams worked at their tasks, they also had to prevent attacks from an expert “Red Team” that emulated the persistent real-world cyber threats by continuously probing and disrupting their efforts. This seems to be an effective strategy to familiarize data teams with AI tools quickly. That said, the hackathon event was a two-day event and could indicate the general novelty of AI at General Dynamics today.  General Dynamics’s 2017 Annual report mentions their research and development spending as a means “to enhance innovation and bring new products to market, 2017 company-sponsored research and development rose to $521 million from $418 million, the fourth consecutive annual increase.” That said, there is no direct mention of machine learning technologies or innovations within their entire 2017 report.  General Dynamic does appear to partner with other companies utilizing AI. The company seems to have a direct partnership with a company that has a DARPA-sponsored natural language processing software company called Netowl. Netowl has three core machine learning and natural language software. One is a text and image analytics software meant to produce accurate document processing and multi-lingual name matching to aid in border security and counterterrorism. 4. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) Northrop Grumman Corp. reported total revenue for 2017 was $25.80 billion, making it the fourth largest US military defense contractor in the United States. Northrop Grumman merged in 1994 and is a publicly traded company that employs 70,000 people. Northrop Grumman seems to have the largest focus on artificial intelligence within its annual report, directly mentioning AI and its autonomous aircraft numerous times. Illuminating Northrop Grumman’s focus on AI, “Autonomous systems” is represented as one of Northrop Grumman’s three sections of their aerospace revenue.  $639 million was spent on research and development by Northrop Grumman in 2017, specifically stating a large majority of this $639 million figure was assigned to government programs.  In 2013, Northrop Grumman’s X-47B autonomous aircraft, operating under a DARPA contract, successfully conducted autonomous takeoff and recoveries on an aircraft carrier. Aircraft carrier take-off and landing is considered one of the most challenging feats of piloting for human pilots today. In 2015, the X-47B would later conduct the first autonomous mid-air refueling, as shown in the 2-minute video below. Both of these feats of aviation might show the capability of autonomous aircraft to complete the administrative tasks necessary for an autonomous aircraft wartime deployment.  Northrop Grumman also offers Blue Wasp, a software utilizing artificial intelligence for monitoring and early detection of possible hostile forces.  This is a direct competitor to Raytheon’s PREVENT program. Similar to PREVENT, Blue Wasp catalogues traffic patterns of a monitored seascape and then identifies deviations from those traffic patterns to foreshadow possible coming conflict.  5. Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) Raytheon reported their total revenue for 2017 was $25.35 billion, making it the fifth largest US military defense contractor in the United States. Raytheon, founded in 1989, is a publicly-traded company that employs 64,000 people. In 2017, Raytheon reported $734 million in research and development costs, noting specifically those costs are primarily from US government contracts. Raytheon noted in its annual report that it was working on contracts with DARPA, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and many other military research initiatives. Raytheon seems to be the US defense contractor with the second most attention to artificial intelligence, next to Northrop Grumman. Topics of innovation in AI and computing for AI are referenced at least one time each in their annual report, compared to the other companies in this report which rarely mention AI at all. Raytheon states part of their research initiatives are as follows: To improve the speed and power of computers used in intelligence analytics, we’re testing quantum processing technologies that may hold the keys to advanced encryption technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, and more accurate radars. To meet growing demand for deterrence, we’re pioneering semi-autonomous warfare technologies that bring together warfighters, computers, and robots to speed decision-makingand targeting. Under the Cybersecurity and Special Missions category of the 2017 annual report, Raytheon states “[Cybersecurity and Special Missions] designs and implements…quick-reaction solutions, as well as high-consequence special mission support, for the U.S. Intelligence Community, the DoD, civilian federal agencies.” This could refer to the PREVENT system Raytheon showcased in its 2018 issue of “Technology Today”, a digital magazine detailing Raytheon’s research efforts to the public.   The Raytheon Prevent System   PREVENT detects emergent group threat behaviors by computing and evaluating the normal traffic patterns of a surveyed region. Prevent is able to provide early warning to operators based on this detection to conduct further analysis on the identified participants involved in the irregular activity.

AI is a popular expression of the day among angel investors, VC assets, and columnists alike. Discovering funds and assets for creating AI ventures might be less demanding than ever before, however, what is the correct sort of funding for a promising startup. What reasonable options an AI startup has? Is it at all worth permitting outside investors entering your AI startup?.If at all you are not bootstrapping, you can get early-stage funding by a wide range of foundations that put a lot of efforts into new companies which are angel investors, accelerators, or incubators. You can likewise decide on a hybrid financing technique. If you are a business person, having such huge numbers of various options confounds the choice of whether to go along with one. However, if you are a financial specialist, you may think about whether those projects experience the ill effects of an unfriendly determination issue: great organizations proceed with their feet while 'lemon' organizations that can't make history go into these projects. How about we begin with evaluating incubators and accelerators that offer help for AI startups..Bosch DNA.This Indo-German accelerator targets new companies in various regions which utilizes empowering advancements, for example, deep learning, analytics, AI and machine learning to go from &quot;Lab to Market&quot;. The Nurture program goes on for 18 weeks: the initial 3 weeks are committed to idea approval, a short 10-days boot camp and mentors meeting. Stage II is around 10 weeks for the most part going through customer validation, while at last stage III concerns pitching planning for final demo days. Generally, 5 Indian and 5 German new startups are chosen..AI Nexus Lab.AI Nexus Lab is a New York-based accelerator having a comprehensive program run by Future Labs (NYU) and ff Venture Capital. Amid the program, the new companies are in the capacity to have access to even NYU AI workforce, which implies for some fortunate business people to conceivably get the opportunity to work close by with Yann LeCun. They have quite recently reported their first cohort: Alpha Vertex, Behold.ai, Cambrian Intelligence, HelloVera, Klustera. In return for 8% equity, organizations get a $100,000 investment from ff Venture Capital. Four-month program with over $400,000 worth of services, incorporating support from its in-house architect, lawful and intellectual property expertise by Lowenstein Sandler, credits from Amazon Web Services, IBM/SoftLayer, and others. Organizations turn out to be a piece of ff Venture Capital's portfolio, with progressing access to firm accomplices and speeding up a group of operations professionals..Alexa Accelerator.A startup accelerator made by the Alexa Fund and established around the conviction that voice will enhance in a general sense the manner in which we cooperate with innovation. The organizations picked are participating in a 13-week program in Seattle to work with technologists and product pioneers from Amazon and TechStars. Startups get $100.000 of funding upon acknowledgment in convertible notes and additionally $20,000 in return for 6% of equity. An Equity Back Guarantee' clause gives the originators creators to bring down up to zero Techstars' equity position inside three days from the end of the program..CyberLaunch.A 90-day accelerator program which focuses on information security and machine learning. It gives $20-100,000, contingent upon the phase of the venture, and makes mentor acquaintances with financial specialists. Extra $100,000+ of benefits, including deferred legal services, co-working space, and AWS credits. They have more than 100 coaches that guide startups on almost every stage..IBM Alphazone.IBM made this accelerator in view of the objective of cultivating long-term innovation and business partnerships with smaller organizations in the Cloud, Big Data and Analytics and IoT space. This 20-week program helps startups building leading solutions. They have another partnership set up with Becton, Dickinson and Company to together choose up to 3 new startups in healthcare delivery and decision making. For those new businesses, they offer additional expert mentorship and matter experts and in addition a grant of up to $25,000. They upheld NeuroApplied, Magentiq Eye and Articoolo..Merantix.Managed by Rasmus Rothe who also happens to be the co-founder with Adrian Locher, Merantix is a venture builder having its core expertise in AI and with a more grounded spotlight on four explicit verticals: Finance, Healthcare, Advertising and Automotive..Nvidia Inception.Nvidia is a virtual accelerator program that helps new companies amid product development, prototyping, and organization. They can apply for GPU hardware grants and the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) will demonstrate the most recent strategies in designing, training, and conveying neural network-powered machine learning in various applications. As for other people, it would appear that it's a delicate program, yet it specifically makes startups to be considered for the GPU Ventures Program offering $500K — $5M, and help in sales and marketing, joint advancement, and product distribution..Play Labs.Another accelerator, evidently for MIT-partnered startups. MIT-associated startups will get an underlying investment of $20,000, hands-on mentoring, an educational program of speakers and mentors intended to enable them to make their startups fruitful, acquaintances with industry specialists. Follow on investment of up to an extra $80,000 which will be given after graduating from the incubator in the second stage..The Hive.They co-create AI new startups giving seed financing of $1.5 million to $2 million. They give help for future rounds of funding and associate you to VC investors. Help for building an environment of early clients is accessible..Y Combinator.Y Combinator is known to be one of if not the best accelerators on the planet. They didn't have an explicit spotlight on AI as of now, however, they simply reported an experimental bunch on artificial intelligence. They guarantee to be a rationalist to the industry and might inevitably want to support an AI organization in each vertical. An explicit thing they are searching for however is Robot Factories, and groups that use deep reinforcement understanding how to help it..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Most developed nations of the world, including China and USA, are investing in research and development projects focused at Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the ways it can influence education system, healthcare, business and financial infrastructure and other systems. AI is the replication of human intelligence processes by machines. Just like a human mind, a true AI system can learn on its own.
Globally, AI is increasingly being considered as important in banking as well as financial services sector leading to the addition of new technologies to the sector. JPMorgan Chase, the top commercial bank in the USA, is investing more than US$9.5 billion annually in technology and innovation. Besides JPMorgan, other American banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC Bank, Bank of NY Mellon as well as India's top four banks like State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are working to integrate AI with their existing systems so as to improve customer services, reduce costs and improve efficiency.
Chatbots (artificial conversational entity) and conversational interfaces are now the trend as they can inspire enthusiasm and excitement in the banking world.
AI's role in the banking or financial sector more or less revolves around conversations between a human (customer) and a machine-learning agent or artificial assistant. Simply put, the user can chat with an artificial agent through facebook messenger or preferred chatting platforms.
JPMorgan Chase has recently introduced a platform named Contract Intelligence (COiN). This platform can manually review legal documents and contracts by using image recognition software. So, the manual process of analysing 12,000 commercial credit agreements that once took 360,000 hours, can now be completed in seconds thus saving time and efforts.


Similarly, Wells Fargo has developed a new AI platform that they are calling an  AI-driven chatbot through the Facebook Messenger . Bank of America also introduced an intelligent virtual assistant named Eric.
Due to such investments in AI, according to PwC (Pricewater house Coopers) FinTech Trends Report India) 2017, global investment in AI applications reached $5.1 billion from $4.0 billion in 2015.
In India, the State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank have developed AI-based chatbots for customers named SIA (SBI Intelligent Assistant) and EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant) respectively.
AI is helping banking sector by providing digital support to customers, who can access these services through their smart phones and other devices. Such banking chatbots have been extremely effective at satisfying customers with required support and information and also bring in new clients for the banks through positive word-of-mouth. Banking chatbots like Kasisto AI (KAI), Personetics Assist, Finn AI, Clinc AI etc. are capable of conversing like a human being via text or voice messages. They can also extract and understand meaning of words or sentences being said or written to them.
AI can also play an important role in fraud detection and prevention. If programmed properly, AI can identify suspicious activities in transaction history and behaviour of individual customers and accountholders. If red flags are detected, then the system can immediately deny such suspicious transactions until they are verified by a human being.
AI also plays a vital role in risk management, marketing and support. AI or machine-learning algorithms can learn from their past actions and hence improve the quality of services. This is why the implementation and integration of AI in the banking sector is the demand of modern banking. Over the next five years, accountholders and customers of banks are going to see an improvement in the quality of conversation with chatbots as they will be able to answer more complex questions. Also, it will be possible for chatbots to converse in more languages other than English.
Recently, a commercial bank in Bangladesh has launched country's first AI-based banking chatbot. Anyone can interact with this chatbot through facebook messenger. It is a digitally interactive system that will respond to set questions from users regarding opening of accounts, credit cards and prepaid cards along with general service information through facebook messenger.
According to a report by the Chinese government think-tank, China Development Research Foundation, several companies in China's export-manufacturing provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong have cut 30-40 per cent of their workforce as a result of automation over the past three years. Such information can fuel the fear that application of AI in any sector will lead to lay-off of human employees from some areas. This may not be the case with AI in banking. Here, application of AI can make work convenient for the existing workforce.
In Bangladesh, AI can play an effective role in traffic monitoring and management system, national security system, healthcare system, manufacturing and service sectors.
The government of Bangladesh can learn from the steps being taken by governments and corporations in other countries to research and implement AI in different areas of life. AI's operational and analytical benefits can be integrated into the existing systems in a bid to manufacture goods and provide services which will be at par with international standards.

                                              Institut Montaigne, in collaboration with Ethik-IA - a French initiative feeding the debate on AI’s regulations and jurisdictions - has published a note analyzing the main impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on healthcare jobs in France. This note is intended to warn the French government on the need to anticipate AI’s impacts on jobs in the healthcare sector. Indeed, AI has the potential to deeply transform the French healthcare system as it could improve patient services, diagnostic, therapy and quality of care, while cutting costs.What is the purpose of anticipating the effects of AI on health employment?The healthcare sector has been defined as a priority sector for AI deployment by the French government. Indeed, in the Villani report of March 2018 Giving meaning to artificial intelligence (Donner un sens à l’intelligence artificielle), health is one of the 4 sectors identified as a priority along with transport, defence and environment. Health is therefore a very promising area for AI-related technologies. As such, the French government has announced the launch of the Health Data Hub, a national initiative that directly answers the double issue of data’s exploitation and protection. This hub would be a unique platform opening the access to health data for startups, medtechs, researchers, companies etc. Its main goal consists in providing conditions to improve AI innovations. Indeed, allowing AI systems to process data collection will make healthcare systems much more productive and efficient.AI in the medical sector will considerably change the way in which patients will be treated tomorrow, it is necessary to anticipate the transformation of jobs.Because the disruption induced today by AI in the medical sector will considerably change the way in which patients will be treated tomorrow (diagnosis, treatments, clinical tests, patient follow-up, etc.), it is necessary to anticipate the transformation of jobs, and thus studies as well as continuous training. For all professionals working in hospitals, it will help to define, the required skills.What are the main impacts of AI in the healthcare sector ?The impacts of AI on health employment and human resources in France have been poorly analyzed. They are difficult to assess and vary by sector: many studies focus on the impact of AI on employment in general, with very different conclusions, but none focus on the healthcare sector. A sectoral approach is necessary to get closer to the reality of jobs and properly analyse the impacts. Thus, in the healthcare sector, the main impacts are observed on the organization of hospitals as a whole, but also on the medical professions, not to mention the back office functions (e.g. medical secretary, technicians, handler).In medical research institutes, AI will increase the physician's capabilities. Indeed, some leading institutions in care and research are already developing very advanced AI projects. This is the case of the University Hospital Institute in Strasbourg, which aims to integrate AI techniques into surgical operations. Thanks to computer-assisted solutions, the Visible Patient: virtual and augmented reality project enables the creation of a 3D and personalized model of the patient before the operation. This technology simplifies the surgical procedure because the surgeon can plan his operation in advance. This 3D information is then stored to create a large database, which is very useful for the development of AI technologies in surgery and personalized medicine.In hospitals with medical shortage, AI will compensate for the absence of doctors. Indeed, some establishments outside innovation and competitiveness clusters will use AI to combat the spread of medically underserved areas and the closing of some hospitals. In 2018, France had more than 11 000 municipalities classified as territories marked by a medical shortage. AI technologies, like chatbots, remote X-ray or electrocardiograms analysis, and more broadly digital innovations such as telemedicine, could thus replace doctors where they would lacking. Indeed, assistance chatbot can be used to interview the patient remotely and analyse a possible relapse, particularly in the monitoring of psychiatric illnesses.In the healthcare sector, the main impacts are observed on the organization of hospitals as a whole, but also on the medical professions, not to mention the back office functions.In certain medical specialties, AI is already changing the way patients are cared for in the hospital. In radiology, a french startup is developing an algorithm which improves mammography screening to detect breast cancer. In cardiology, a french company has developed an extremely powerful algorithm, able to analyse electrocardiograms and improve diagnostics. In ophthalmology, the IDx-DR software developed in the United States identifies signs of diabetic retinopathy with an accuracy rate of 90 %. Needless to say that in France, with an average waiting period for an ophthalmologist appointment of 80 days, this kind of technology would definitely impact the landscape of ophthalmology. In clinical research, a french company builds mathematical models and algorithms that can interpret biomedical images, genomics and clinical data, to discover biomarkers and mechanisms associated with diseases and treatment outcomes. It will improve diagnosis and personalization of care.The medical professions are not the only ones affected by AI. The care support functions are also concerned. A very likely hypothesis would be that AI solutions, already mature and present in other sectors (management of payroll, customer files, logistics, IT support), would be deployed to the support functions of the healthcare sector. For example, computer maintenance, inventory and flow management, delivery, etc. are gradually being carried out by robots or AI software in other sectors, such as mass distribution.  At Nantes University hospital, intelligent software has the potential to save time for technical and administrative teams, in particular by optimizing the coding of hospital activity in order to anticipate patient flows. At Lyon, the University hospital has signed a partnership with Microsoft around AI. They aim to develop a vocal recognition system used during consultations, to assist medical secretaries with writing reports. The AI technology would also recognize keywords and be able to carry out a medical diagnosis.How should we anticipate these disruptions?Because AI will profoundly change medical practices and the back office function, an evolution and transformation of healthcare professions is now necessary. Indeed, it takes at least ten years to train a doctor, so we must ensure that the knowledge transmitted today will not be obsolete tomorrow. Thus, a methodology must be developed to assess the impacts on employment. The note published by Institut Montaigne and Ethik IA proposes a methodology that is divided into six steps, to determine the level of substitution by AI of each activity for a given job and then to define the rate of substitution for the job. For instance, for a medical secretary, it is possible to identify various tasks such as physical and telephone reception of patients and families, management and medico-administrative coordination, identification of patients' and families' needs and expectations, note taking, typing and document formatting, data entry related to medical activity, maintenance of patient records, etc. All these tasks must be reviewed to identify the level of substitution and then to determine whether the job would be completely or partially replaced by IA.Healthcare institutions, for instance, must anticipate the changes through the adoption of a prospective approach to the transformation of jobs.This report also promotes digital Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a relevant ethical framework for AI in the field of healthcare. Digital CSR can be defined as a corporate commitment, assessing societal effects induced by digital transformation. It corresponds to an ethical and responsible approach to AI. The implementation of CSR could have many benefits on the French healthcare system. It may be associated with different concrete actions that can be carried out for several actors. Healthcare institutions, for instance, must anticipate the changes through the adoption of a prospective approach to the transformation of jobs.They also have to develop evaluation methodologies of employees' skills. Employee awareness of digital issues, especially AI technologies, is particularly important. They should be trained to use existing and future technologies, in particular when their functions can be replaced by AI.Better awareness of these issues will strengthen cooperation between these actors and thus enable hospitals to integrate new technological solutions into their healthcare provision, in order to improve patient care.PrintSharerelated content

In February 2017, AvalonBay’s 235-unit development in Maplewood, New Jersey, burned down six weeks before its planned opening. The homebuilder rebuilt the $55 million project from scratch—then searched for new ways to prevent fires, a constant threat when building with woodframe construction. The solution: Pillar Technologies, whose devices monitor temperature, smoke and other signs of pending disaster, and which will soon use artificial intelligence to flag environmental risks even earlier.


“It’s like medical monitoring for buildings,” says Michael Feigin, chief construction officer and executive vice president at AvalonBay. 

How Algorithms Are Taking Over Big Oil

AI Is About To Take The Ship's Helm From Humans

PROMOTED
Construction is a giant industry and, until recently, had struggled to adopt technology. That is changing. New York City-based startup Pillar is one of a number of companies trying to apply artificial intelligence to construction and engineering, using predictive analytics to do everything from preventive maintenance to work schedule optimization.
These types of tools aren’t likely to remain on job sites. Sensors and real-time video that collect data and AI that analyzes this information could lead to safer, more comfortable homes and workplaces.
“AI is being added to everything,” says Matt Joyal, Pillar’s chief technology officer. “This is where technology is going. We have so much data. Why don’t we use it to make job sites efficient and safe?”

Pillar's Matthew Joyal (l) and Alex Schwarzkopf (r) hold the wireless devices that collect data ... [+] about conditions at construction sites. “One of the challenges with AI and machine learning is you need good data to build models,” Schwarzkopf says.Jamel Toppin
Alex Schwarzkopf, Pillar’s chief executive, founded the company with Joyal and a third friend while still in college in 2015 to address a giant gap in construction-site safety. Manual ways of keeping sites safe–with human fire watches, for example–weren’t as efficient or foolproof as they needed to be. Pillar’s rugged yellow, wireless devices can flag all sorts of troubles on construction sites before they become multimillion-dollar messes or cause injuries to people. They can identify leaks, which can result in mold, and determine the level of particulates like silica, which can be harmful to construction workers.
The founders raised $3.6 million in funding and signed dozens of clients nationwide, including the World Trade Center in New York. Revenue is expected to reach at least $4 million this year, still small, but Pillar’s plans for predictive analytics should help growth accelerate. “Alex’s business is taking risk out of the system,” says Martha Notaras, a partner at XL Innovate, the venture division of insurance giant AXA and an investor in Pillar.
Schwarzkopf, 27, and his cofounders originally intended to build a sports helmet that could measure impacts and determine concussion risk. But athletes didn’t want to wear it, they couldn’t get funding and the project died. That failed startup eventually led to Pillar after a friend in construction management suggested they transfer the technology to hard hats.
In meetings with construction managers about that new idea, one building exec asked them if they could monitor temperature or humidity to help prevent mold growth and construction defects. Their existing device couldn’t do any of those things, but Schwarzkopf and his cofounders seized the opportunity. “We were like, ‘Give us four months, and we’ll build that,’” he recalls.
They scrambled and built an early version of the Pillar device that they could demonstrate to Gilbane, a large construction firm. The first prototype looked rough, a bunch of wires shoved into two blue electrical boxes. Yet durability, rather than looks, proved the steeper hurdle. In an early meeting with a potential customer, a construction manager threw the device across the room and watched as it smashed into pieces to illustrate just how tough the product would need to be.
Schwarzkopf and Joyal figured out how to build a more rugged, wireless product with a battery that could last for months. Builders can now put dozens of its industrial-grade sensors on their construction sites and leave them there through rain and wind to monitor potentially destructive conditions and send emergency alerts as need be.
All that information provides the data for a planned AI system. The devices include seven different sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, dust, particulates, air pressure, ambient light and carbon monoxide. “What we’ve been doing is some basic anomaly detection. We are looking for outliers,” Joyal says. “This year, we’re going to see how far we can push machine learning to get our customers better insights into their buildings.”
Over time, as Pillar gathers more data from its own sensors, it will be able to model the data more dynamically to predict, for example, at what point a pipe is likely to freeze on the first floor with the door open in 30-degree temperatures versus on the third floor where temperatures are higher to allow drywall installation. “If it is raining outside, the threshold for when a fire might start is different,” Joyal says. Predictive modeling will allow Pillar to take such differences into account–and as Pillar sucks up more data in its devices, the models will get smarter over time. Pillar eventually could consider both building-to-building differences—perhaps allowing it to rate a developer’s 25 construction sites based on their riskiness—and regional differences.
Someday, Pillar’s devices might even stay in the buildings once they’re constructed, sending off details about their environments to a central system, which could keep monitoring for potential problems. Asked about that, Schwarzkopf smiles. “It’s funny you’re asking that,” he says, “because I have a lot of people asking me to do that.”

We are currently experiencing a wave of disruptive technologies centered around recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, big data, robotics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and 3D/4D printing. Welcome on board the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).Until now we have gone through three such revolutions. The first was the introduction of steam power at the end of the 18th century that mechanized production. The second comprised the widespread development of electricity at the beginning of the 20th century that allowed mass production. The third was the advent of information technology (IT) in the 1970s that introduced automated production. The fourth one builds on the infrastructure provided by the third revolution to launch us into the wave we are currently experiencing.The impact of the 4IR is massive as it integrates several disruptive technologies. It is already affecting our personal lives and is set to completely transform the  petroleum industry business.Recent articles (Robinson, 2018; Ighalo et al., 2018) give a high level insight into the importance of utilizing the massive amount of data available in the petroleum industry today and building data analytics capabilities around the evolution of IT infrastructure. Even though AI has been applied in other fields for more than 4 decades, its application in the petroleum industry has been sparse and limited.This article will give a succinct overview of the AI paradigm, discuss the challenges in applying AI in the petroleum industry, highlight some of the emerging opportunities and prospects, and conclude with recommendations to accelerate the admission of AI into workflows.AI 101My favorite definition for AI is the one proposed by a Stanford University Professor, John McCarthy: “The science and engineering of making intelligent systems.” It should be known that those “intelligent systems” could be hardware (e.g., robotic arms during some repetitive jobs like capping drink bottles), software (e.g., algorithms that recognize patterns), or a combination of both (e.g., autonomous rovers that make independent decisions based on certain events).AI could not have existed without computers. Therefore, the discussion on the history of AI would not be complete without looking at the history of computers. Some computer-like developments  started as early as 1800. The first electronic computer, ENIAC, was developed in the early 1940s. This facilitated the arrival of the first commercially stored program later in the decade around 1949. With this success, more programming languages were rolled out in quick succession: LISP language in mid-1950s followed by PROLOG in early 1970s, when the first expert system was revealed. With this strong foundation, more advanced programming languages have evolved over time and continue to the present day.The words “artificial intelligence” were first mentioned at a conference in 1956. Leveraging the capability to program computers, the new field of AI rapidly developed. This assisted the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) along with other variants such as Generalized Regression Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Probabilistic Neural Networks, and Cascaded Neural Networks. AI became a multi-million dollar business with the introduction of AI-based hardware in 1986 and started to be incorporated in military systems and games in the early 1990s.The news of an AI machine (Deep Blue) beating a human chessmaster (Garry Kasparov) came in 1997. There was a massive launch of AI-based products, both software and hardware, by companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft from 2010. Advanced machine learning (ML) concepts such as hybrids, ensembles, and deep learning followed rapidly to accelerate the application of automatic image classification and object recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. Since the middle of this decade, extensive deep learning applications have been developed and actively supported by improved and advanced hardware capabilities to handle the complexities of the applications.The next section attempts to clear the confusion around the terms data science, computational intelligence, AI, and neural networks.Clearing the ConfusionPeople outside the data science community have used the terms: data science, computational intelligence, AI, and neural networks, interchangeably. AI is not a “technique.” It is a branch of computer science that covers other sub-fields such as Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems, Robotics, and Computational Intelligence. CI, also known as soft computing or neural computing, combines knowledge discovery (KD), pattern recognition, and data mining processes to develop ML workflows.Some of the various techniques that can be used for ML are ANN and its variants, Decision Tress, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, Fuzzy Logic Types I and II, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (popularly mentioned in the literature by its abbreviation ANFIS), and Nearest Neighbors. This new and rapidly evolving field that uses various scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, is called data science.It is also necessary to clarify the relationship among KD, data mining, and ML.Knowledge Discovery, Data Mining, and Machine LearningThe KD process is a collection of tasks and procedures that are used to extract knowledge or meaningful insight from data. It starts with identifying a challenge.The type of challenge determines the data to use. This is the data selection phase. For example, if you need to predict reservoir porosity, you would need petrophysical data, among others, rather than geochemical. The selected data usually needs to be preprocessed to remove anomalies, outliers, noise, and other artifacts. Based on the statistical evaluation of the selected data, it might be necessary to apply some transformation functions such as log normalization or resampling on the data. This is the point data mining comes in.The most common among the possible data mining techniques is ML (discussed below). The result of data mining is a recognized pattern. The pattern will be interpreted, evaluated, and validated to generate a new insight that can be added to the organizational workflow. The KD process is summarized in Fig 1.Fig. 1—The knowledge discovery process workflow. Overview of Machine LearningThe main tool used for data mining is ML. In simple terms, ML can be defined as the process of teaching computers to do what humans naturally do without being explicitly programmed. Through ML, algorithms are able to continuously learn from historical events captured in data and adaptively improve their predictive capabilities with more data.There are three ML methods: supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning. Supervised ML algorithms learn patterns from historical examples. This is called training. The trained model is able to predict the target variable given new input instances. An example is to use the relationship between wireline logs and reservoir properties from historical data to predict the properties of a new reservoir given new input scenarios. Typical applications of this learning method are regression and classification.Unsupervised ML algorithms make inferences from events depicted by data without prior classification or label. They infer a function, usually based on some distance metrics, to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. From this result, an expert can derive meanings that can lead to new insights.An example is to use historical log data to compartmentalize a reservoir into sections based on certain signatures such as the density of data points. An expert may then interpret the sections as different lithologies. A typical application of this learning method is clustering.Hybrid ML algorithms combine supervised and unsupervised methods to arrive at a solution in situations where there are uncertainties in human knowledge. They have the capability to considerably improve learning accuracy with limited labels. An example of this is to use a clustering approach to compartmentalize a huge volume of reservoir data into sizeable zones before applying regression or classification.In summary, ML enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster and more accurate results to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require considerable amount of time and resources to train it properly. The main objective of ML is to maintain a balance between underfitting and overfitting. The traditional ML workflow is shown in Fig 2. 



Fig. 2—The conventional machine learning workflow.



 When To Use Machine Learning?At this point, I am sure that readers would begin to wonder about when to use ML. The following guidelines are helpful:No existing rule/equation. If there is an established relationship among certain parameters that can be accurately defined by an equation, then there is no need for ML. For example, we know that the distance traveled is directly proportional to speed and inversely to time. This is universally established. Using ML to predict distance from speed and time will be useless. Investigating the relationship between log measurements and reservoir permeability would be a good candidate for ML.Rules and equations are too complex. When a set of rules or an equation is based on very complex and confusing assumptions, then consider using ML.Rules are constantly changing. When relationships change due to various conditions, then consider using ML. For example, when some relationships that are valid for clastic reservoirs become invalid in carbonates, then ML can be used to derive a complex relationship in both environments.The nature of data keeps changing. If the nature of data keeps changing such that the fundamental principles of the underlying equations are no more honored, then ML might be useful to establish a nonlinear dynamic mapping to handle the change.Large amount of data. Small datasets can be modeled easily using basic statistical functions. As data volume increases, ML may become necessary. This is the reason AI has now become synonymous with “big data.”Challenges and Limitations of Machine LearningML has been around for more than 4 decades, but until recently, not much progress has been made in its adoption in the oil and gas industry. The applications have been isolated and sparse. The following could be the reasons:It requires substantial data. Having access to large enough historical dataset to ensure effective model training and generalization capability has been a major challenge.Poor quality data. Even when some data are available in sufficient volume, the quality may be questionable. Poor quality data produces poor quality predictions. This will remind us of the “garbage in, garbage out” maxim. Dr. Pedro Domingo of the University of Washington said “Machine learning can’t get something from nothing … what it does is get more from less.”The learning process requires a degree of expertise. Most users of ML in the industry simply go with the default parameter settings in those packages. ML is an art in itself and hence needs to be mastered. It goes beyond simply running the ANN app over a dataset. There are technicalities involved in choosing the right features, tuning the model parameters, trying different learning algorithms and activation functions, and possibly carrying out certain post-processing activities to enhance the output and presentation of the process.Focus on pattern in data rather than the physics of the problem. One of the possible reasons petroleum industry experts would not easily accept the ML paradigm is the focus of the latter on extracting patterns in data rather than incorporating the physics of the problem. This will continue to pose a challenge until there is a very close collaboration between data scientists and domain experts to leverage the strength of both parties.Recommendations for Successful Application in Oil and GasGiven the challenges outlined above, below are a few tips and recommended best practices for successfully adopting ML in the petroleum industry. I hope this will help avoid some of the common pitfalls that organizations and ambitious users might be vulnerable to while starting their ML-driven projects. :Spend enough time on data quality assurance. Given the robustness of the model, good data determines the quality of the results. Most of the time when algorithms don’t perform well, it is due to a problem with the training data such as insufficient amount, skewed data, noisy data, or insufficient features describing the data for making decisions.Choose the right features that describe the problem to be solved. This process is domain-specific and hence should be done in close collaboration with domain experts rather than being left completely to data scientists.Seek to understand ML techniques rather than using them as black boxes. Each ML technique has its own science forming the foundation.Make the products of ML projects easy to use. Invest enough time to build user-friendly and simple user interfaces. A process that can be executed in a few clicks is better and will be easily adopted by consumers than those that are complicated.Build integrated solutions to form a suite. Rather than building ML applications around small and narrow problems, think of a “one-stop shop” type solutions.Invest time in learning. When a MLalgorithm is not working, we often feed the machine with more data. This can lead to issues with scalability, in which we have more data but not enough time to invest in the “learning” process.ML is not a magic wand. It may not be able to solve all problems. Handle ML projects with a focus on clear set of objectives driven by knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of the ML paradigm. Attempting to use it as a blanket solution that must work in all situations seldom works.This article has been written with the objective of providing a basic understanding of AI, its relevant terminology, and the rudiments of how it works. I hope that I have succeeded in infusing the “AI thinking” in the minds of the readers and tickled your interest in looking for opportunities to apply ML in your projects.ReferencesRobinson, D.

You’ve been trying to work things out together in couples’ counselling, but ultimately, you want to know if it is worth the effort. Will things get better, or are they doomed to fall apart?It might be worth just pausing for a second to listen to your partner. Really listen. When you speak to each other, your voices hold all sorts of information that could reveal the answer. Subtle inflections in tone, the pauses between phrases, the volume at which you speak – it all conveys hidden signals about how you really feel.You might also like: • The key to unlocking lost languages • The musicians without ears • What single word defines who you are?A lot of this we pick up on intuitively. We use it to fine-tune the meaning of our words. Think of the difference between these questions:“Why are you here?”“Why are you here?”“Why are you here?”That shift in emphasis is one of the more obvious ways we layer our speech with meaning. But there are many more layers that we add without realising it.But there is a way to extract this hidden information from our speech. Researchers have even developed artificial intelligence that can then use this information to predict the future of couples’ relationships. The AI is already more accurate at this than professionally trained therapists.Getty ImagesSome features of human speech cannot be picked up by our ears, but they can reveal how we really feel about someone (Credit: Getty Images)In one study, researchers monitored 134 married couples who had been having difficulties in their relationships. Over two years, the couples each recorded two 10-minute problem-solving sessions. Each partner chose a topic about their relationship that was important to them and discussed them together. The researchers also had data on whether or not the couples’ relationships improved or deteriorated and if they were still together two years later.  Trained therapists watched videos of the recordings. By assessing the way the couples spoke to each other, what they said and how they looked while they were talking, the therapists made a psychological assessment about the likely outcome of their relationship.The researchers also trained an algorithm to analyse the couples’ speech. Previous research had given the team some clues that certain features were likely to be involved in human communication, such as intonation, speech duration and how the individuals took turns to speak. The algorithm’s job was to calculate exactly how these features were linked to relationship strength.The algorithm also picked up on features of speech beyond human perceptionThe algorithm was purely based on the sound recordings, without considering visual information from the videos. It also ignored the content of their conversations – the words themselves. Instead, the algorithm picked up on features like cadence, pitch and how long each participant talked for.Amazingly, the algorithm also picked up on features of speech beyond human perception. These features are almost impossible to describe because we’re not typically aware of them – such as spectral tilt, a complex mathematical function of speech.“Using lots of data, we can find patterns that may be elusive to human eyes and ears,” says Shri Narayanan, an engineer at the University of Southern California, who led the study.After being trained on the couples’ recordings, the algorithm became marginally better than the therapists at predicting whether or not couples would stay together. The algorithm was 79.3% accurate.Getty ImagesOur voices reveal more about our thoughts and emotions than we are able to pick up with our human ears (Credit: Getty Images)The therapists – who had the advantage of also being able to understand the content of the couples’ speech and watching their body language – came in at 75.6% accurate.“Humans are good at decoding many pieces of information,” says Narayanan. “But we can’t process all aspects of information available.”The idea is that we are ‘leaking’ more information about our thoughts and emotions than we, as humans, can pick up on. But algorithms are not just restricted to decoding the voice features that people tend to use to convey information. In other words, there are other ‘hidden’ dimensions to our speech that can be accessed by AI.“One the advantages of computers is their ability to find patterns and trends in large amounts of data,” says Fjola Helgadottir, a clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford. “Human behaviour can give insight into underlying mental processes,” she says.“However, machine learning algorithms can do the hard work of sorting through, finding pertinent information, and making a prediction about the future.”An algorithm that predicts whether or not your relationship is doomed may not be the most appealing idea. Especially as it is only three-quarters accurate, at present. Such a prediction could conceivably change the course of your relationship and how you feel about your partner.Cracking the information hidden in the way we talk &ndash; and in how our bodies function &ndash; could be used to make our relationships betterBut cracking the information hidden in the way we talk – and in how our bodies function – could be used to make our relationships better.Theodora Chaspari, a computer engineer at Texas A&M University, has been developing an AI program that can predict when conflict is likely to flare up in a relationship. Chaspari and her colleagues used data from unobtrusive sensors – like a wrist-worn fitness tracker – that 34 couples wore for a day.Getty ImagesMachine learning is able to pick up information from the way we speak rather than the words we use to make predictions about how a relationship might last (Credit: Getty Images)The sensors measure sweat, heartrate and voice data including tone of voice, but also analysed the content of what the couples said – whether they used positive or negative words. A total of 19 of the couples experienced some level of conflict during the day that they wore the sensors.Chaspari and her colleagues used machine learning to train an algorithm to learn the patterns associated with arguments that the couples reported having. After being trained on this data, the algorithm was able to detect conflict in other couples using just the data from the sensors, with an accuracy of 79.3%.Now the team is developing predictive algorithms that they hope to use to give couples a heads-up before an argument is likely to take place by detecting the warning signs that lead up to one.By monitoring your perspiration levels, heart rates and the way you&rsquo;ve been speaking, the algorithm would make a calculation of how likely it is that you&rsquo;ll face friction with your partnerThe way the authors foresee it working is like this: you’ve had a busy day at work, perhaps had a stressful meeting, and you’re on your way home. Your partner has also had a tough day. By monitoring both of your perspiration levels, heart rates and the way you’ve been speaking in the past hours, the algorithm would make a calculation of how likely it is that you’ll face friction with an equally exasperated partner when you get home.“At this point, we can intervene in order to resolve the conflict in a more positive way,” says Chaspari.This could be done by simply sending a message to couples before the moment heats up, says Adela Timmons, a psychologist on the project based at the Clinical and Quantitative Psychology Center for Children and Families at Florida International University.“We think that we can be more effective in our treatments if we’re able to administer them in people’s real lives at the points that they need them most,” she says.The traditional model of therapy isn’t capable of fulfilling that goal. Typically, a session might take place for an hour a week, when the patients recall what happened since the last session, and talk through problems that arose.“The therapist isn’t able to be there in the moment when someone actually needs the support,” says Timmons. “There are a lot of steps in the traditional process where the intervention can break down and be less effective.”Getty ImagesMonitoring for factors that might increase the risk of a couple having an argument would allow an AI to head off rows before they happen (Credit: Getty Images)But an automated prompt based on consistently monitoring people’s physiology and speech could fulfil the real-time dream of therapy intervention. It could also allow for a more standardised form of treatment, says Helgadottir.“Nobody really knows what goes on in a closed therapy room,” says Helgadottir, who has developed an evidence-based platform using AI to treat social anxiety. “Sometimes the most effective techniques aren’t being used since they require more effort on the part of the therapist. On the other hand, the clinical components of AI therapy systems can be completely open and transparent.“They can be designed and reviewed by the leading researchers and practitioners in the field. Furthermore, computers don’t have off days, and there is no difference if 1, 100 or 1,000 users are benefitting at the same time.”There are potential pitfalls though. There’s no guarantee that a ping from your phone warning of an impending argument won’t backfire and wind you up even more. The timing of the intervention is crucial.If we can catch people in the period where it's starting to escalate but they haven't lost their capacity to regulate their behaviour, that's the sweet spot of intervention - Adela Timmons“We probably don’t want to actually intervene during a conflict, says Timmons. “If people are already upset, they aren’t going to be terribly receptive to prompts on their phone that they should calm down. But if we can catch people in the period where it’s starting to escalate but they haven’t lost their capacity to regulate their behaviour – that’s the sweet spot of intervention.”There are plenty of technological hurdles left to overcome before an app like this can be rolled out. The team needs to refine its algorithms and test their efficacy on a wider range of people. There are also big questions around privacy.Getty ImagesCouple's who want to work on their relationship could benefit from the power of prediction that AI brings (Credit: Getty Images)A data breach of a device storing data on your relationship with your partner would put a lot of sensitive information at risk. One could also question what would happen to the data if there was an alleged crime, such as domestic violence.“We have to think about how we would handle those situations and ways to keep people safe while protecting their privacy,” says Timmons. “Those are wider social issues that we will continue to discuss.”If this model of therapy is indeed successful, it could also open doors to similar ways to improve other kinds of relationships – such as within the family, at work, or the doctor-patient dynamic. The more that our different bodily systems are monitored – from our eye movements to our muscle tension – the more could be revealed about what is in store for our relationships. There may prove to be many more layers of meaning, beyond our speech and basic physiological reactions, that can best be decoded by machines.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence
12:49

Despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.60 Minutes Overtime: China's greatest natural resource may be its dataScott Pelley:  I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence? 






Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?


Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.
Kai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers
Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.He's funded 50 AI start-ups. 


Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again. 


Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. 

Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.Songfan Yang: Exactly.The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.


Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes. Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.


Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.

Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.


College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. 






Why China is the ""Saudi Arabia"" of data
01:30

Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?


Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.


Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions. 






What data does China have on its citizens?
02:06

There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.


Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast


Editor's Note: In an earlier version of this story, we stated that Kai-Fu Lee has funded 140 artificial intelligence start-ups. The correct number is 50.

While computer software can help recruiters sift through piles of applications faster, companies are under pressure to make sure they don’t discriminate against older workers. Looking for a solution, employers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) as one way to give everyone a fair chance at jobs.

The average length of time a recruiter spends on each résumé for a job opening is six seconds, according to several studies of human resource officers. Because it’s difficult to make an informed decision so quickly, many companies use software to initially screen candidates based on keywords in their résumés or applications. But advocates for older workers have raised concerns about how these tools might digitally discriminate against older workers. 








Some of the basic uses of recruiting technology already have ended up in court, facing complaints of age bias. For example, one lawsuit alleges that PricewaterhouseCoopers denied older workers job opportunities in part by discarding applications if the candidates did not have email accounts ending in “.edu,” which are university accounts commonly used by students and recent college grads but are less common among older alumni. Another technology-based lawsuit claims that employers were using Facebook to advertise job postings only to younger people.








“This would mean the methods of discrimination have changed and its tools now include algorithms, dropdown boxes and pattern recognition — but those are tools that can help older Americans rather than deny opportunity,” AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond says of the social media lawsuit.

As these cases work their way through the courts, tech companies and human resources managers are starting to consider ways software can be used to reduce the unintended biases that cause employers to overlook talented candidates. One approach involves using AI, which basically is software that is programmed to think rather than simply react. Last month, IBM added new features to its Watson technology — the computer of Jeopardy! fame — specifically designed to help employers recognize potential biases in their hiring patterns that they might otherwise miss. The company uses AI to analyze the backgrounds of diverse current employees who are great at their jobs. The artificial intelligence then uses that information to identify applicants with similar qualities. By looking for matches in abilities rather than keywords in a résumé, the program aims to go beyond typical recruiting technology. “The result is a stronger workplace that is more diverse, fosters fresh perspectives, and promotes an inclusive atmosphere free of bias,” says Bob Schultz, general manager of IBM’s Watson Talent Solutions. It’s worth noting that IBM has been criticized for potential age bias in its layoff process. But companies that have used versions of the Watson technology for recruiting, including BuzzFeed Media and H&R Block, say the use of artificial intelligence has helped them find good candidates faster. “We want our recruiters to focus on the most value-add activities, and we believe AI can make the recruiting and hiring process incredibly efficient and fair,” says Katie Waldo, talent acquisition operations manager for H&R Block. And while Watson won on the Jeopardy! TV show, other technologies are bringing games into the hiring process. The specially designed video games are supposed to give employers a better indication of how well candidates think on their feet than a résumé or other list of accomplishments would. For example, Unilever asks some of its candidates to spend roughly a half-hour playing games on a computer or mobile device. The 13 games are designed to reveal the candidates’ personalities, problem-solving skills and communication style. Applicants who do well advance to the next step in the hiring process. According to a report from the consulting firm Deloitte Insights, games are one of the approaches recruiters are using to attract young candidates. But many of today’s older workers grew up playing Pong, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong decades ago. While technology has become more sophisticated, many of the skills it takes to play today’s games are essentially the same. And the ability to apply skills to new challenges is one of the most highly sought-after qualities in job candidates, regardless of age.",Age Discrimination,Companies are starting to use technology to address discrimination in hiring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['WebPage'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we think about robots, it’s usually in the context of their relationships with humans. Some are friendly, like Rosie the Robot from “The Jetsons” — a bizarre juxtaposition of futuristic technology and 1950s gender roles. Then there’s R2D2, whose impressive skills are punctuated with adorable beeps and chirps.Some robots are destructive — like the Terminator, programmed to go back in time to kill. Or the Cylons from “Battlestar Galactica,” cybernetic beings that try to wipe out the entire human race.It makes sense to consider robots in relation to humans, because robots are created by people, for people. Yet outside of movies and books, it’s easy to get caught up in advancing the technological prowess of robots without thinking about the human element. We need them to work with us, not against us, or even simply apart from us.“Often when you start thinking about these technologies, the human kind of gets lost in the shuffle,” said Nancy Cooke, a professor of human systems engineering at Arizona State University’s Polytechnic School. “People need to be able to coexist with this technology.”Helping people and technology collaborate well is no easy feat. That’s why researchers across ASU are teaming up to help people, robots and artificial intelligence work together seamlessly.

“One of the first things you worry about is team composition. I think it’s an important question to consider who’s doing what on the team,” Cooke said. “We need to make sure the robots are doing what they’re best suited for and the humans are doing what they’re best suited for. You have (robots) doing tasks that either the human doesn’t want to do, it’s too dangerous for the human to do, or that the AI or robot is more capable of doing.”Cooke is a cognitive psychologist by training. She has spent years working to understand human teamwork and decision-making. Now she applies this expertise to human-technology teams as director of ASU’s Center for Human, Artificial Intelligence, and Robot Teaming (CHART), a unit of the Global Security Initiative.CHART is providing much-needed research on coordinating teams of humans and synthetic agents. Their work involves everything from how these teams communicate verbally and nonverbally, to how to coordinate swarms of robots, to the legal and ethical implications of increasingly autonomous technology. To accomplish this, robotics engineers and computer scientists work closely with researchers from social sciences, law and even the arts.What can human-robot teams do? There are lots of applications. Scientists can explore other planets through rovers that don’t need air and water to survive. Swarms of drones could carry out search-and-rescue missions in dangerous locations. Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) can assist human employees in automated warehouses, on construction sites or even in surgical suites.Teaching teamwork“One of the key aspects of being on a team is interacting with team members, and a lot of that on human teams happens by communicating in natural language, which is a bit of a sticking point for AI and robots,” Cooke said.She is working on a study called the “synthetic teammate project,” in which AI (the synthetic teammate) works with two people to fly an unmanned aerial vehicle. The AI is the pilot, while the people serve as a sensor operator and navigator.The AI, developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, communicates with the people via text chat.

“So far, the agent is doing better than I ever thought it would,” Cooke said. “The team can function pretty well with the agent as long as nothing goes wrong. As soon as things get tough or the team has to be a little adaptive, things start falling apart, because the agent isn’t a very good team member.”Why not? For one thing, the AI doesn’t anticipate its teammates’ needs the way humans do. As a result, it doesn’t provide critical information until asked — it doesn’t give a “heads up.”“The whole team kind of falls apart,” Cooke said. “The humans say, ‘OK, you aren’t going to give me any information proactively, I’m not going to give you any either.’ It’s everybody for themselves.”A need for information is not the only thing people figure out intuitively. Imagine that you are encountering a new person. The person approaches you, looks you in the eye and reaches out his right hand.Your brain interprets these actions as “handshake,” and you reach out your own arm in response. You do this without even thinking about it, but could you teach a robot to do it?Heni Ben Amor, an assistant professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, is trying to do just that. He teaches robots how to interact with people physically by using machine learning. Machine learning is how computers and AI learn from data without being programmed.“It’s really about understanding the other and their needs, maybe even before they are uttering them. For example, if my coworker needs a screwdriver, then I would probably pre-emptively pick one up and hand it over, especially if I see that it’s out of their range,” Ben Amor said.





""I’m always having a blast with my students, coming up with crazy ideas,” says Heni Ben Amor (center), shown here with Yash Rathore (left) and Kevin Luck teaching a robot to throw a ball. Photo by Jessica Hochreiter/ASU

His team uses motion-capture cameras, like the one in an Xbox Kinect. It’s an inexpensive way to let the robot “see” the world. The robot observes two humans interacting with each other, playing table tennis or assembling a set of shelves, for instance. From this, it learns how to take on the role of one of the people — returning a serve or handing a screw to its partner.“The interesting part is that no programming was involved in this,” Ben Amor noted. “All of it came from the data. If we wanted the robot to do something else, the only thing we need to do is go in there again and demonstrate something else. Instead of getting a PhD in robotics and learning programming, you can just show the movement and teach the robot.”


Designing droidsLance Gharavi also works with the physical interactions between humans and robots, but he is not a roboticist. He is an experimental artist and professor in the School of Film, Dance and Theatre. He has been integrating live performance and digital technologies since the early '90s.Several years ago, Gharavi was asked to create a performance with a robot in collaboration with Srikanth Saripalli, a former professor in ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.“I think one of my first questions was, ‘Can he juggle?’ And Sri said, ‘No.’ And I said, ‘Can he fail to juggle?’ And Sri said, ‘Yes, spectacularly!’ I said, ‘I can work with that,’” Gharavi said.Gharavi’s team put together a piece called “YOU n.0,” which premiered at ASU’s Emerge event. Afterward, Saripalli told Gharavi that the collaboration had advanced his research and asked to continue the partnership.“It was primarily about trying to understand the control structures and mechanisms for the Baxter robot platform,” explained Gharavi, referring to an industrial robot with an animated face created by Rethink Robotics. “They weren’t really sure how to work with it. My team created a means of interfacing with the robot so that we could operate it in a kind of improvisational environment and make it function.”For example, the team created a system called “the mirror,” in which the robot would face a person and mirror that person’s movements.“What we were interested in doing is creating a system where the robot could move like you, but not just mimicking you. So that you could potentially use the robot as, say, a dance partner,” Gharavi said.His goal is to give robots some of the “movement grammar” that people have. Or to put it more simply, to make a robot move less robotically.





“I have a pretty voracious curiosity. I’m interested in all kinds of things. I tend to like big ideas and big stories, which is one of the reasons I’m interested in science and religion and philosophy. Those are the places where we keep our biggest ideas and our biggest stories,"" Lance Gharavi said. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU

“If we’re looking forward to a day when robots are ubiquitous, and interacting with robots is a common experience for us, what do we want those interactions to look like? That takes a degree of design,” he explained.Such a future may also require people to adjust their perceptions and attitudes. Cooke’s team conducted an experiment in which they replaced the AI pilot with a person but told the other two teammates that they were working with a synthetic agent. She says they treated the pilot differently, giving more commands with less polite interaction.“Everything we saw from how they were interacting indicated that they weren’t really ready to be on a team with a synthetic agent. They still wanted to control the computer, not work with it,” Cooke said.In a twist on the experiment, the researchers inserted a human teamwork expert into the AI pilot role. This person subtly guided the other humans on the team, including asking for information if it wasn’t coming in at the right time. The collaboration was much more effective.Cooke’s team continues to work with the Air Force Research Laboratory to improve the synthetic teammate and test it in increasingly difficult conditions. They want to explore everything from how a breakdown in comprehension affects team trust to what happens if the AI teammate gets hacked.Assisting autonomyCooke is also collaborating with Spring Berman, associate director of CHART, on a small-scale autonomous vehicle test bed. As driverless-car technology advances, these vehicles will have to safely share the road with each other, human-driven cars, pedestrians and cyclists.Some of the miniature robotic “cars” in the test bed will be remotely controlled by people, who will have a first-person view of what’s happening as if they are really driving a car. Other vehicles will operate autonomously. The team wants to explore a wide range of potential real-world scenarios.





Spring Berman studies robot swarms. She often collaborates with scientists who study animals that work in groups, such as ants. In college she worked with a professor studying underwater glider vehicles. ""She was looking at how fish school. I thought it was a really interesting concept to use principles from nature to design controllers for robots.” Photo by Jessica Hochreiter/ASU

“Autonomous vehicles will generally obey all the rules. Humans are a little more flexible. There’s also the issue of how do humans react to something that’s autonomous versus human-driven. How much do they trust the autonomous vehicle, and how does that vary across ages?” Berman asked.She is an associate professor in the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy who primarily studies robot swarms. She says that CHART allows her to consider her technical work in a broader context.“You’re so focused on proving that the swarm is going to do something that you design it to do. In reality, the robots will be operating in an uncertain environment that’s changing. There are things you can’t control, and that’s very different from a simulation or lab environment. That’s been eye-opening for me, because you’re so used to testing robot swarms in controlled scenarios. And then you think, ‘Well, this might actually be operating out in the world. How will we keep people safe? How are they going to benefit from this? What are the legal issues?’” Berman asked.According to Ben Amor, robots still have a long way to go before they operate truly autonomously in a safe way. Currently, machine learning is mostly used in domains where making a mistake is not costly or dangerous. An example is a website that recommends products to buy based on your past choices.

Ben Amor notes that robots aren’t good at executing a series of interdependent actions yet. For instance, if a car turns left, it is now on a new street. Any decision it makes now will be dependent on that last decision.“If you’re learning, that means you have to explore new things. We need to allow the robot to try things it’s never done before. But if you do that, then you also run the risk of doing things that adversely affect the human,” he said. “That’s probably the biggest problem we have right now in robotics.”In his research, he is exploring how to ensure that this continual learning process is actually safe before conducting those kinds of experiments.What it means to be humanIf the idea of robots continually learning and acting autonomously is a bit unnerving to you, you are not alone. That is why, as ASU researchers work on perfecting the technology of robots and AI, they collaborate with humanities scholars and artists like Gharavi.“We can’t go blithely forward, just making and creating, without giving some thought to the implications and ramifications of what we’re doing,” Gharavi said. “That’s part of what humanities people do, is think about these sorts of things.”Gharavi is collaborating with Cooke and Berman on the autonomous vehicle test bed. His role is to create the environment that the cars will operate in, a city for robots that he calls “Robotopolis.”

“What I and some designers I’m working with are creating will be something on the order of a large art installation, that will at once be a laboratory for research and experiments in robotics and also an artistic experience for people that come into the space — an occasion for meditation on technology and the future, and also history,” he explained.Gharavi says what fascinates him about working with robotics and AI is the way it forces us to explore what it really means to be human.“We understand robots as kind of the ultimate ‘other.’ Whatever they are, they are the opposite of human. They are objects that specifically lack those qualities that make us as humans special. At least that’s the way we have framed them,” he said.“Through that juxtaposition, it’s a way of engaging with what it means to be alive, what it means to be sentient, what it means to be human. What it means to be human has always been up for debate and negotiation. Significant portions of the population of this country were once not considered humans. So the meaning of human has changed historically,” he continued.Scholars in the arts, humanities and social sciences have a lot to offer scientists and engineers studying robotics. Cooke says ASU’s interdisciplinary approach to robotics and AI sets the university apart from others. It also brings its own set of challenges, just like human-robot collaboration.“Again you have the communication problem. The language that people who do robotics speak is not necessarily the same kind of language that we speak when we’re talking about human interaction with the robots,” noted Cooke, who chaired a committee on the effectiveness of team science for a National Academies study.“Multidisciplinary team science can be really challenging, but it also can be really rewarding,” she said about her work with CHART. “Now I feel like I’m living the dream.”Written by Diane Boudreau.

Following on from work carried out in spring 2017 in the context of the #FranceIA initiative, to which France Stratégie contributed, Member of Parliament Cédric Villani was assigned the task of analysing the economic, social, environmental and ethical issues involved in artificial intelligence. Muriel Pénicaud, Minister of Labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, Minister of State for the Digital Sector, commissioned France Stratégie to make a special study of the impacts of artificial intelligence on the world of work, which is the subject of this Report. 
Download the report ""Artificial Intelligence and Work""
 
Artificial intelligence – meaning the group of technologies that aim to carry out tasks traditionally assigned to human beings computationally – is central to current debate on social transformations. First and foremost, expected changes in the world of work give rise to two contrasting attitudes. Some people proclaim their optimism in the face of a technology that ensures productivity gains and is therefore a source of wealth, and which promises to do away with the most tedious tasks. Others make pessimistic prophecies on the inevitable disappearance of whole realms of activity and corresponding jobs. This being so, public debate is polarised in unproductive opposition as it fails to highlight factors of transformation or levers for action.
In order to help clarify such debate, Muriel Pénicaud, Minister of Labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, Minister of State for the Digital Sector, entrusted France Stratégie with the mission of analysing the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world of work1. This mission is complementary to the one that the Prime Minister entrusted to Member of Parliament Cédric Villani, which, given its wider scope, tackles questions of research, industrial policies and ethics. The goal is the same: educate to eradicate fantasy, but take stock of expected transformations while identifying appropriate public policies2.
AI has been making spectacular progress over the last few years. Technologies resulting from recent research, such as machine learning and deep learning, have arrived from laboratories to carry out tasks that previously seemed impossible for machines to perform, such as image recognition, providing a satisfactory translation of a simple text, or winning a game of Go. Such technologies are already at work in our smartphones and constitute the framework of much of the pairing software already deployed in such areas as online advertising and profiling.
With the exception of a few specialised fields, AI is not yet much in evidence in most professions. This does not make its possibilities any the less significant, in particular for retail banking, transport and health – three sectors which are examined here in depth.
Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly be called upon to carry out complicated but repetitive or regularly performed tasks, which will obviously affect professions that include such tasks. But this transformation is not radically different from digitisation of the economy, which has been with us for some time and to which the banking, transport and health sectors have adapted more or less happily by modifying job content, training workers and developing new activities. Employees have also been adding to their skills for some time now in response to robotisation, in particular in industrial sectors, a fact that may guarantee their continued employment if it ensures growth of a company’s or sector’s activity. This is evidenced by the advanced robotisation of Germany’s automotive industry: in 2016, although it is one of the most robotised industries anywhere in the world, it had over 800,000 employees, 100,000 more than twenty years ago, as against 440,000 in France1.
There can be no doubt that employees risk losing their autonomy by being subjected to increasingly insidious automated monitoring, with all the psychosocial risks involved. We are well aware of the controversy over working conditions in a number of warehousing facilities, where automated monitoring of employees is carried out by a system incorporating voice synthesis. Such systems may lead to greater fragmentation of tasks, performed with support from software tools.
None of these challenges is completely new, and improvement of working conditions is just as likely a hypothesis as alienation and work intensification. Everything depends on the way in which productivity gains enabled by artificial intelligence are shared and the choices made in task and team organisation.
Of course, factors other than technology have an impact on work. The behaviour of workers, customers and suppliers, qualification levels of a sector’s workers and possible tensions connected with lack of manpower, along with regulatory obligations, often play a determining role in the evolution of work.
What makes the present context different is that artificial intelligence is often based on a learning mechanism, with ongoing accumulation of data enabling continuous improvement of systems – to the point of creating, one day in five or ten years’ time or more, a real breakthrough in what it is technologically possible to do, depending on tasks concerned. Emblematic of such a future breakthrough is the promised advent of the autonomous vehicle. This revolution in mobility may eventually do away with the profession of driver, but at the same time it opens up a whole range of possible new professions in complementary activities. Construction, maintenance, fleet management and passenger assistance will remain, while recreational outings, logistics and straightforward professional travel will all benefit from lower costs and/or increased availability.
Spectacular progress is to be expected in all three fields examined in this Report: autonomous vehicles providing mobility, automated financial advisors in the form of chatbots, and medical assistants participating in monitoring health and wellbeing on a daily basis, as well as in prediagnosis and therapeutic proposals.
How many people are concerned in their everyday working lives? Potentially everybody, all the more so in that artificial intelligence tools are generic in nature, typically concerned with natural language processing and voice or image recognition. The 800,000 people in France who work as drivers are likely to see their work change radically as use of autonomous vehicles increases. The transformation will not necessarily be a sudden one, but will lead to orientation of work content to supervisory and reception tasks, or tasks that machines are unable to manage (such as finding the doorbell, for a delivery man).
All this may still seem a long way off, but it is already mobilising actors (innovators, longstanding professionals, customers and users alike), which also affects work transformation dynamics.
We must prepare ourselves for artificial intelligence, not because its advent is inevitable but because, in the society in which we live, technological possibilities open up new prospects for individuals, organisations and structures. There is nothing at all to be gained by lasting opposition to solutions that improve our fellow citizens’ health, provide access to safer and less expensive mobility, and provide cheaper financial services better adapted to consumers’ needs.
There is more than one way to go in such evolution, however, and this is where the public authorities must concentrate their efforts: setting a path that matches citizens’ social expectations, by defining appropriate controls on critical subjects (responsibility, security, etc.), and by accompanying evolutions that occur too quickly, so that the social and economic fabric adjusts naturally.
On the basis of the analysis it presents, the Report identifies three focuses to respond to the issues involved in artificial intelligence as far as the world of work is concerned:

carrying out forward-planning work at industry and sector level on the potential of artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that stakeholders are fully informed and able to anticipate changes to come;
seeing that workers receive training on the issues of tomorrow’s world: training highly qualified workers for production of AI, and workers who are fully aware of the technological, legal, economic and ethical issues involved in the use of tools based on artificial intelligence;
improving schemes for safeguarding career paths in the sectors and subsectors that are set to be heavily impacted by the risk of automation.

Lastly, we should take care not to underestimate risks with regard to working conditions – loss of autonomy, work intensification, etc. – connected with the conditions in which AI tools are deployed in organisation of work.

Machine learning concept with robot think with binary code on black background

In the coming years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to be strategic for a myriad of industries. But there is a major challenge: recruiting. Simply put, it can be extremely tough to identify the right people who can leverage the technology (even worse, there is a fierce war for AI talent in Silicon Valley).

To be successful, it’s essential for companies to understand what are the key skillsets required (and yes, they are evolving). So let’s take a look:
Dan O’Connell, Chief Strategy Officer & Board Member, Dialpad:
I think it's critical for ""AI"" teams (natural language processing, machine learning, etc.) to have a mix of backgrounds -- hiring Ph.D's and academics who are thinking about and building the latest innovations, but combining that with individuals who have worked in a business environment and know how to code, ship product and are used to the cadence of a start-up or technology company. You can't go all academic, and you can't go all first-hand experience. We found the mix to be important in both building models, designing features, and bringing things to market.
PROMOTED
Sofus Macskassy, VP of Data Science, HackerRank:
Many don’t realize that you do not need a large team of deep learning experts to integrate AI in your business. A few experts, with a supporting staff of research engineers, product engineers and product managers can get the job done. There is much more to AI than deep learning, and businesses need to find a candidate with strong machine learning fundamentals. Many candidates with a theoretical background in machine learning have the tools they need to learn the job. Training AI talent on the specific needs for your business is cheaper and faster than training someone to be an AI expert. Hire strong research engineers that can take academic papers and equations and turn them into fast code. These are often engineers with a technical foundation in computer science, physics or electrical engineering. Together with your AI expert(s), they will make a powerful AI team. Add a product manager to tell them what product to build and you have a powerhouse.

Chris Hausler, Data Science Manager at Zendesk:
Any person working in the field of AI needs to be able to code and have solid mathematical and statistical skills. It's a misnomer that you need a PhD to work in AI, but genuine curiosity and an eagerness to learn will help you keep up with this fast moving field. Having the skills to implement and validate your own experimental ideas is a huge advantage.
We have found success hiring people from disciplines that focus on experimentation and problem solving. The Data Science team at Zendesk has a diverse background with people coming from Genetics, Economics, Pharmacy, Neuroscience, Computer Science and Machine Learning to name a few.

Atif Kureishy, Global VP, Emerging Practices at Teradata:
One could argue that the skills for AI are similar to data science; math, computer science and domain expertise, but the truth is that AI models are predicated on two things, automation and data – and lots of it.
Increasing sophistication in automating key aspects of building, training and deploying AI models (such as model selection, feature representation, hyper parameter tuning, etc.) mean the skillset needed must be focused on model lifecycle and model risk management principles to ensure model trust, transparency, safety and stability. Typically, these are spread across roles in organizations that touch on policy, regulation, ethics, technology and data science. But these will need to converge to build AI at scale.
Guy Caspi, CEO and co-founder at Deep Instinct:
People who have strong academic backgrounds sometimes lean towards one of two directions: either they cannot leave a project until it’s perfect, often missing important deadlines – or the opposite: they’re satisfied with basic academic-level standards that may not meet an organization’s production requirements. We search out people who have both a strong academic background, but also have a strong product/operational inclination.

In 1951, the Russian chemist Boris Belousov sent to a scientific journal a study in which he described an astonishing discovery: while trying to simulate a metabolic process in the laboratory, he had discovered a chemical reaction that occurred and then reversed itself on its own, alternating between a yellow colour and a colourless state. Belousov couldn’t find any journal willing to publish his results, since they appeared to violate a fundamental law of nature.
However, his work—which only came to light in 1959 through a brief presentation at a symposium—has become, half a century later, the foundation stone of a new discipline: chemical computing. This technological path is an alternative to quantum computing and conventional computing, capable of processing in parallel based on the same operating principles as our brain, promising futuristic applications, such as integrating in our body in the form of intelligent biosensors.
Computing is based on the use of logic gates, which process a data input—usually in binary code—to produce a result or output. In the chips of our current computers, this function is carried out thanks to semiconductors, materials with a binary response capacity operating through the movement of electrons. However, this is not the only possible system; quantum computing, currently in the experimental phase, uses properties of subatomic particles that can also take alternative values, with greater versatility than semiconductors.

Until the discovery of Belousov, no one would have suspected that chemical reactions could act as logic gates. According to the second law of thermodynamics, these processes are linear, spontaneously moving towards equilibrium through an increase in entropy, a measure of the energy of chaos; what is done cannot be undone, at least on its own. For this reason, Belousov’s work was rejected and ignored, until a decade later it was recovered, extended and made known by the biophysicist Anatol Zhabotinsky.
The first chemical oscillator
The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction was the first chemical oscillator, a non-linear reaction that moves alternately in one direction and then the opposite as the process itself modifies the concentrations of the ions present, and which only stops when the reagents are consumed. In a Petri dish, these reactions produce waves of colours that diffuse from different points and act as inputs; the interaction between these input data can produce as an output a new wave—a 1, in binary code.
But this ability of chemical systems to compute by acting as logic gates is not something invented by humans, but was discovered, since it exists in nature. “We are already using chemical computers, because our brains and bodies employ communication via the diffusion of mediators, neuromodulators, hormones, etc.,” says computer scientist Andrew Adamatzky, director of the International Center of Unconventional Computing at the University of the West of England in Bristol. “We are chemical computers,” he summarises.

For decades it was believed that the brain’s computational capacity lay in the neuron as a minimal unit, and that its subcellular parts were limited to acting as simple transmitters of the decisions made by the cell in terms of the inputs received. Today it is known that this is not the case, and that discrete parts of the neuron, such as the dendrites (the branches that receive the signals), the axon (which sends the impulse to other neurons), and the synapse (the space that communicates between them) are independently modulable, and therefore capable of computing by themselves. As this modulation is exerted through chemical agents, the brain is not an electrical computer, but an electrochemical one.
The brain, a parallel computer
The great versatility of each neuron confers on the brain a valuable quality. “The brain and chemical computers are parallel computers,” explains biophysicist Vladimir Vanag, from the Centre for Nonlinear Chemistry at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University (Russia). Parallel computing is not within the reach of conventional microprocessors (though it is for quantum ones). In practice, this advantage that chemical computing possesses overcomes one of its drawbacks—its slower speed.
Compared with the great speed of electronic chips, chemical computing is limited by the speed of the diffusion of reactions in the medium. Researchers like Adamaztky are working on breaking this barrier: “Systems can be scaled down to the nano-scale and then everything will be fast,” he says. However, he notes that certain applications will not require higher speeds: “When reaction-diffusion computers are embedded in the human body, their speed of processing information will perfectly match natural processes.”
But in any case, Vanag explains with an example how parallel computing compensates for any speed limit: if a micro-oscillator—equivalent to a processor—occupies a cubic volume of 100 microns on each side, a single cubic centimetre could contain a million of them, all working in parallel. Thus, “we can increase the number of micro-oscillators by many orders of magnitude and overcome the speed of conventional computers,” he says. Say goodbye to Moore’s law; with chemical computing, a small increase in volume is enough to multiply the processing capacity. This is the secret of the human brain, slower than any computer, but more powerful than all of them.

A new artificial-intelligence
In addition, chemical computing brings other crucial advantages. “It should work without electricity,” says Vanag. “No viruses, autonomous regime of working, and extremely high efficiency.” And all this while using just a few cheap chemical reagents. Thanks to these qualities, chemical computing is emerging as a promising alternative to simulate the human brain. By building bottom-up systems, starting with small oscillator networks and adding more and more layers of complexity, scientists are learning how cognitive functions such as image recognition or decision making appear.
Of course, a consequence of this chemical recreation of the brain would be the possibility of obtaining new artificial-intelligence systems, but radically different from what we usually envision: imagine robots made of gel, without a defined shape, capable of dividing themselves into smaller ones so that each one of them works independently. Perhaps they’ll even be embedded in our own bodies, analysing our biological parameters, curing our diseases. “But this is a fantasy,” concludes Vanag. “At the moment.”

Many large newsrooms and news agencies have, for some time, relegated sports, weather, stock exchange movements and corporate performance stories to computers. Surprisingly, machines can be more rigorous and comprehensive than some reporters. Unlike many journalists who often single-source stories, software can import data from various sources, recognize trends and patterns and, using Natural Language Processing, put those trends into context, constructing sophisticated sentences with adjectives, metaphors and similes. Robots can now convincingly report on crowd emotions in a tight soccer match.
These developments are why many in the journalistic profession fear Artificial Intelligence will leave them without a job. But, if instead of fearing it, journalists embrace AI, it could become the savior of the trade — making it possible for them to better cover the increasingly complex, globalized and information-rich world we live in.
Intelligent machines can turbo-power journalists’ reporting, creativity and ability to engage audiences. Following predictable data patterns and programmed to “learn” variations in these patterns over time, an algorithm can help reporters arrange, sort and produce content at a speed never thought possible. It can systematize data to find a missing link in an investigative story. It can identify trends and spot the outlier among millions of data points that could be the beginnings of a great scoop. For example, nowadays, a media outlet can continuously feed public procurement data into an algorithm which has the ability to cross-reference this data against companies sharing the same address. Perfecting this system could give reporters many clues as to where corruption may be happening in a given country.
Algorithms help reporters systematize data to find missing links in an investigative story or identify trends among millions of data points that could be the start of a scoop.
Not only can intelligent computers analyze huge amounts of data to aid timely investigations, they can also help source and fact-check stories from the crowd to see if contributions are reliable. According to a 2017 Tow Centre Report, several media outlets in the United States are already using AI to fact-check. Reuters, for example, is using News Tracer to track breaking news on social media and verify the integrity of tweets. Serenata de Amor, a group of technology enthusiasts and journalists from Brazil, uses a robot named Rosie to track every reimbursement claimed by the country’s members of Congress and highlights the reasons that make some of the expenditures suspicious.
There are many other ways in which algorithms are helping journalists, from making rough cuts of videos, to recognizing voice patterns and identifying faces in a crowd. They can be programmed to chat with readers (chatbots) and answer queries. The tricky part is that this process cannot happen without a human journalist present who, with a goal in mind, asks relevant questions about the data. Reporters and editors need to learn fast how these systems operate and how they can use them to enhance their journalism.
Most journalists in the world do not have access to a team of programmers or data scientists to help design and build their projects. Collaboration is the answer. Small newsrooms and freelancers can make up for the lack of resources by teaming up with software developers to help build a more permanent collaboration. They can also become perceptive in spotting the many open-source search and analytics tools available.
Communication between journalists and techies is not a given. It needs a lot of learning from both sides and some trial and error. With ongoing technological development, journalists now have an ever-expanding toolkit in which to hold power to account. With this increased capacity to listen to their communities and identify their needs, it would be a tremendous waste not to try.
Ethical Challenges

The readers’ editor of The Guardian, Paul Chadwick, writing about the relationship between journalism and Artificial Intelligence, proposes a new clause for the newspaper’s code of ethics.
“Software that ‘thinks’ is increasingly useful, but it does not necessarily gather or process information ethically,” he warns. “When using Artificial Intelligence to augment your journalism, consider its compatibility with the values of this code.”
Journalists have to be aware that algorithms may lie or mislead. They have been programmed by humans, who have biases, and logical patterns may lead to the wrong conclusions. This means journalists will always need to check results with their century-old verification techniques: cross-checking sources, comparing documents, doubting their findings.
With technological development, journalists have an ever-expanding toolkit in which to hold power to account. But we also have to be aware that algorithms may be biased.
Transparency is another must for journalism in this new era of machine intelligence.
“The biggest stumbling block for the entrance of AI into newsrooms is transparency. Transparency, a basic journalistic value, is often at odds with Artificial Intelligence, which usually works behind the scenes,” says Nausicaa Renner, digital editor of the Columbia Journalism Review.
Media should let its audience know what personal data it is collecting if it wants to remain credible. Despite the powerful new toys allowing them to cater precisely to their audiences’ taste, editors should also strive to inform users about what they don’t want to know. The public interest is still the media’s business and the key to its survival.
By the same token, investigative reporters should do their best to explain how they are using algorithms to find patterns or process evidence for a story, if they want to be different from the manipulators and demagogues who secretly collect data for use as a commercial or political weapon. Moreover, healthy journalism should continue to bring to life those silenced voices and intractable issues around which no one has systematically collected information or built data sets.
In the end, while it is true that AI enables journalism as never before, it is also true that this brings new challenges for learning and accountability. Without journalistic clarity, all this technology will not lead to a well-informed society. Without ethics, intelligent technology could herald journalism’s demise. Without clear purposes, transparent processes and the public interest as a compass, journalism will lose the credibility of people, no matter how many charts, bots and whistles you adorn it with.
How AI is Used in Journalism
Image: Screenshot / AP’s Wordsmith Explainer Video
Automated journalism: producing stories from data. Initially it was used in reporting on sports and financial news. It can free journalists from routine tasks, improving efficiency and cost-cutting. AP uses Wordsmith software to turn financial data into stories. The Washington Post uses in house developed technology Heliograf for reporting on sports events and electoral races.
Organizing workflow: tracking down breaking news, aggregating and organizing news using tags and links, moderating comments and using automated voice transcription. The New York Times uses the Perspective API tool developed by Jigsaw (Alphabet) to moderate readers’ comments. The Reuters Connect platform for journalists displays all Reuters content, including the archive, and content from media partners around the world in real time.
Tracking news on social media: analyzing real time and historical data, identifying influencers and engaging with audiences. AP uses Newswhip to monitor social media trends and increase engagement.
Engaging with audiences: Quartz Bot studio’s chatbot app allows users to text questions about news events, people, or places, and the app replies with content it believes is be relevant to them. Others include bots for Facebook Messenger such as Guardian. The BBC used bots to help cover the EU referendum. The AfriBOT project, one of the Innovate Africa grant winners, by the European Journalism Centre and The Source (Namibia and Zimbabwe), are developing an open source newsbot “to help African news organizations deliver personalized news and engage more effectively with audiences via messaging platforms.”.
Chequeado’s fact-checking bot mascot.
Automated fact-checking: allows journalists a speedy fact check of public statements or claims. Chequeabot is used by Chequeado in Argentina; Full Fact UK and partners are developing an automated fact-checking engine that “will spot claims that have already been fact-checked in new places; and it will automatically detect and check new claims using Natural Language Processing and structured data.” The Duke Reporter’s Lab in the US developed the tool ClaimBuster to deliver politically meaningful claims to media and, in 2017, launched a hub for automated fact-checking projects. Factmata in the UK is also developing an automated fact-checking tool. Read more about automated fact-checking.
Analyzing large data bases: software crunches data and looks for patterns, changes or anything unusual. Reuters’ Lynx Insight goes through massive data sets and provides journalists with results and background information. OCCRP’s Crime Pattern Recognition uses technology that analyzes large databases of documents for similar corruption-related crimes and links between involved parties.
Image recognition: technology that recognises objects, places, human faces and even sentiment in images. The New York Times uses Amazon’s Rekognition API to identify members of congress in photos. Any user can test Google’s Vision API image recognition technology for free.
Video production: automatically creates scripts from news articles and produces narrated rough cuts of short video pieces from video footage. Wibbitz software is used by USA Today, Bloomberg and NBC. Researchers at Stanford University are developing an automated video editing tool.

Surprisingly, machines can be more rigorous and comprehensive than some reporters. Unlike many journalists who often single-source stories, software can import data from various sources, recognize trends and patterns and, using Natural Language Processing, put those trends into context, constructing sophisticated sentences with adjectives, metaphors and similes. Robots can now convincingly report on crowd emotions in a tight soccer match.</p><p>These developments are why many in the journalistic profession fear Artificial Intelligence will leave them without a job. But, if instead of fearing it, journalists embrace AI, it could become the savior of the trade -- making it possible for them to better cover the increasingly complex, globalized and information-rich world we live in.</p><p>Intelligent machines can turbo-power journalists&rsquo; reporting, creativity and ability to engage audiences. Following predictable data patterns and programmed to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; variations in these patterns over time, an algorithm can help reporters arrange, sort and produce content at a speed never thought possible. It can systematize data to find a missing link in an investigative story. It can identify trends and spot the outlier among millions of data points that could be the beginnings of a great scoop. For example, nowadays, a media outlet can continuously feed public procurement data into an algorithm which has the ability to cross-reference this data against companies sharing the same address.

One of the events we attended was a two-day conference about artificial intelligence in education organized by a company called Squirrel AI.Its vision felt unusually utopian. The company’s co-founder, Derek Li, said during a keynote that replacing some teaching functions with AI-powered software would supercharge the country’s education system. Speaking to a crowd of some 2,000 attendees, he said: “If our children are educated by AI teachers, then their potential can be fully realized.”Li mentioned that he has two young sons, twins, he said, who are very different from each other. And he believes that having AI-driven tutors or instructors will help them each get the individual approach they need. He closed his remarks by saying that he “hopes to provide each child with a super-power AI teacher that is the combination of Einstein and Socrates, that way it feels like she has more than 100 teachers in front of her.”To understand that level of enthusiasm for AI, it’s useful to give some context. For starters, the Chinese government has declared a national goal of surpassing the U.S. in AI technology by the year 2030, so there is almost a Sputnik-like push for the tech going on right now in China. At the same time, China is also facing a shortage of qualified teachers in many rural areas, and there’s a huge demand for high-quality language teachers and tutors throughout the country. So in that context, there’s probably more openness there than in the U.S. to the idea of bringing in robots for some teaching functions.But Li painted AI as not just some pale substitute, but as ultimately superior to humans when it comes to some aspects of teaching. Much of what he described was not the company’s current product, but its vision of where it wants to go, including a plan to create an AI-powered tutor that teaches kids to be more creative. So far the company says it runs 1,600 learning centers in more than 300 cities across China.
 
 We were curious to talk with Li further about his thoughts, we sat down with him just after the event to learn about his dreams and concerns about the role of AI in classrooms.EdSurge: You said that you're using human teachers to understand how they teach, and that sometimes you learn they don't use the most efficient paths in delivering information. In three years' time, what will be the role of human teachers? Will we need them?Li: Machines always take human jobs, right? Now, the teacher is like the farmers in the field; we need AI to become a harvester. But I don't think the teachers will lose their job. I think the machine will part of the teaching job, but most of the job of a teacher [which humans are not doing well] are actually more important, for example communicating with students one-on-one and understanding students' emotion, their character, how to build their characters. That’s what the [human] teachers can do best, but they need a lot of time to do that. Most of teachers are busy with teaching [knowledge and academics].If computers can know so much—and you’re saying they can eventually know everything—and people can only know a little bit, are we training our students to be like only a small part of a computer? Should we be training them entirely differently if they will only ever know a tiny bit of what the computers can learn?I think that knowledge learning [just teaching facts and information] will become less important.But that's what your company does some of, so if that is less important, then how does that work?It's in the middle of a transition. That's why we let our machines grow AI to teach students ways of thinking.All technology has implications, but sometimes negative ones too. What do you worry about with AI becoming so important in education?Actually, the thing I worry about is most is [the AI teachers] getting out of control. When we are in a classroom, we know what the teacher knows and we know what the teacher will teach us. Even if they know something that's not proper, maybe dirty, they will not dare to teach it in class. For the computer, they know everything. They know every information, and if they want to please the student, sometimes that might not be a good thing.They could teach them the wrong thing?Yeah, they may teach the wrong thing. So how do we restrain, how do we limit it?It's just like the control of the nuclear weapon, right? To use it to build electricity, that's good. But other uses will be a disaster. So how to regulate AI is very important.Are there any experiments that you're trying to think about to regulate AI?Not now, because currently what the machine can learn from us is quite controlled.But I talked with [a researcher] at Carnegie Mellon University and he has a fabulous idea of how AI could evolve. He said before, algorithms would learn and evolve by themselves. But if we use the right human machine language, we could let every person teach the machine.For example, if a GPS leads you the wrong way or in the wrong direction, you can teach it where the right thing is and you correct it. If everybody can teach the machine, the machine will become smarter and smarter very quickly. For Squirrel AI, maybe 80 percent of the time it's very efficient. But for say 10 percent of occasions, it may be very horribly stupid. AI is kind of like that, like a GPS it can take you to the wrong place.If we can let every student and let every parent, and every teacher nearby teach the machine, it can get smarter very quick. But, that’s also the danger. If the machine can learn from the internet and if everybody teaches the machine, that would be out of control. How do we evaluate everything, and how do we decide what is right and what is wrong? I think we need an AI police officer.Betsy Corcoran (@betsy_) is co-founder and CEO of EdSurge.Jeffrey R.

The social network will provide $7.5 million in funding over five years for the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, with director of applied machine learning Joaquin Quiñonero Candela saying in a Newsroom post that the aim is to advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and to study the fundamental issues that are specific to the use and impact of AI.

Candela called TUM one of the world’s top-ranked universities in the AI field, saying that the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will tap into the school’s work in subjects such as robotics, machine intelligence and the social implications of AI.

He added that Germany’s creation of government-led ethical guidelines on autonomous driving and its work with European institutions on ethical frameworks for AI will also benefit the center.

TUM Prof. Christoph Lütge will lead the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, working with “a diverse advisory board of representatives from academia, civil society and industry.” He holds degrees in business informatics and philosophy.

Lütge said, “We will explore the ethical issues of AI and develop ethical guidelines for the responsible use of the technology in society and the economy. Our evidence-based research will address issues that lie at the interface of technology and human values. Core questions arise around trust, privacy, fairness or inclusion—for example, when people leave data traces on the internet or receive certain information by way of algorithms. We will also deal with transparency and accountability—for example, in medical treatment scenarios, or with rights and autonomy in human decision-making in situations of human-AI interaction.”

Candela said Facebook may also share insights, tools and industry expertise on topics such as algorithmic bias, adding that the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will explore funding opportunities from entities other than Facebook, and it will seek to publish research, work with other experts, organize events (conferences, symposia and workshops) and create educational activities with other institutions.

He concluded, “Realizing AI’s huge potential for good while balancing its risks is a global effort, and it will not be accomplished overnight. The Institute is an exciting step forward in our continued commitment to partnering with academic institutions, governments, NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), advocacy and industry groups, and others who are working to advance AI in a safe and responsible way.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Facebook Is Hoping to Advance Ethics Research Regarding Artificial Intelligence', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/facebook-is-hoping-to-advance-ethics-research-regarding-artificial-intelligence/', 'datePublished': '2019-01-22T22:00:12-05:00', 'articleBody': 'Facebook and the Technical University of Munich are joining forces on the creation of an independent ethics research center for artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe social network will provide $7.5 million in funding over five years for the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, with director of applied machine learning Joaquin Quiñonero Candela saying in a Newsroom post that the aim is to advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and to study the fundamental issues that are specific to the use and impact of AI.\r\n\r\nCandela called TUM one of the world’s top-ranked universities in the AI field, saying that the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will tap into the school’s work in subjects such as robotics, machine intelligence and the social implications of AI.\r\n\r\nHe added that Germany’s creation of government-led ethical guidelines on autonomous driving and its work with European institutions on ethical frameworks for AI will also benefit the center.\r\n\r\nTUM Prof. Christoph Lütge will lead the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, working with “a diverse advisory board of representatives from academia, civil society and industry.” He holds degrees in business informatics and philosophy.\r\n\r\nLütge said, “We will explore the ethical issues of AI and develop ethical guidelines for the responsible use of the technology in society and the economy.

These high-risk jobs – meaning that 70 percent of their tasks are automatable – tend to involve ""routine,"" predictable tasks and often don't require a bachelor's degree, according to the nonprofit public policy group based in Washington, D.C.These occupations requiring less than a bachelor's degree have an average automation potential of 55 percent, while jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree average a 24 percent chance of becoming automated.Some of the jobs with the highest risk of being automated include cooks, waiters, short-haul truck drivers and clerical office workers. Artificial intelligence is expected to have a major impact on the nation, but some areas of the country are more vulnerable to automation than others, depending on residents' education levels and the industries that drive a community's economy. The effects of AI don't vary greatly by state, but are more pronounced at the local level. Among the nation's 100 largest metro areas, these 10 are expected to be hit the hardest by AI:

The study's authors note how communities with high educational attainment not only tend to have jobs that are more complex and interpersonal – and therefore less likely to be automated – but that they are also more adaptable in the face of AI. According to the report, ""educational attainment improved individual and city adaptability in the face of shocks.""Here are the large metro areas where jobs are expected to be impacted the least by AI:

The report also describes how men and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lose their job to automation. The average male worker holds a job where nearly 43 percent of tasks are automatable, while that figure is less than 40 percent for the average woman's job. Hispanic workers face the highest risk of losing their jobs to technology, with the average worker holding a job where 47 percent of their job is automatable, compared to 40 percent for whites.Tags: technology, employment, Cities, education, economyRead More

The 2019 Consumer Electronics Show featured all sorts of new and cool stuff, from big and beautiful televisions that roll up from a box to all sorts of voice-activated home comfort and security devices. Flipping switches, pushing buttons, and even typing inputs now all seem to be just a few years from oil lanterns and hanging clothes on a line.

Oh, there were a few throwback items scattered about, such as old-timey phonographs that plug into your home theater via bluetooth, and apparently Pong is trying to make a high-tech comeback although I have my doubts as to whether anybody seriously missed it in the first place. But these exhibits were very few and very far between and, oh, and if you are curious then I'll advise that I didn't see any wireless 8-track players (don't forget the matchbook) or hints that Intellivision is about to make a high-tech comeback.
There were also a lot of exhibits for something that couldn't be seen, because it simply doesn't exist in any hard physical sense, and can be gauged only by its uses. These were the artificial intelligent (AI) exhibits, which were abundant if sometimes difficult to understand other than by their functions. If nothing else is clear about artificial intelligence, it is that many trillions of dollars and other currencies are being pumped into the worldwide artificial intelligence sector. If you want to know what the ""next internet"" is, you need to look no further than artificial intelligence.
PROMOTED
Artificial intelligence is something that science fiction writers have talked about since, well, there was science fiction. Suffice it to say that a wide gulf exists between the public's perception of artificial intelligence and what it really is. Bear with me while I attempt my explanation.

Computers are simply machines that follow instruction sets known as algorithms, and which is popularly referred to as software so as to distinguish those instructions from the physical computer that actually runs the instruction sets which is the hardware. The instruction sets are drafted by an alleged species of humans known as programmers, and the computer can do no more than what the programmers draft the software to do. In other words, the software has no ability to do anything like learn or intellectually grow by itself, and even slight changes require some human input.
But what if the software designed by the humans enabled the computer to draft and run its own programs so as to take into account new conditions and events? Once the computer gains this capability, you have artificial intelligence. Some artificial intelligence programs are quite simple and have an almost insect-like intelligence: They can learn very basic tasks by themselves -- such as a self-driving car learning to move around objects -- but in the big scheme of things are quite limited in how far they can engage in self-programming.

Other artificial intelligence programs are quite sophisticated and can self-draft their own programs to where they learn in a very human-like way. But there is a enormous difference: Computers with artificial intelligence can access and download huge amounts of data error-free in a way that it would take a human literally years to learn. For instance, an artificial intelligence computer could access literally every medical text every written, analyze symptoms and offer a prognosis, and suggest the best medicines and treatments. If you think this is some sort of future fantasy, you're wrong.
That is as far as I am going to stray into the technology, which is not the point of this article. What I am going to talk about is how artificial intelligence is posed to take over the financial advisery sector in the very near future.
The job of a financial adviser is to take the client's information, and then come up with a financial plan that is based on the adviser's knowledge of the economy and markets as applied to the client's needs. This is exactly the sort of thing for which it is relatively easy for artificial intelligence to do much better.
The quality of the financial adviser's advice will depend to a significant extent upon how well the financial adviser can keep up on economic factors and market data. Here, the financial adviser has the standard limitations of a human: He can only take in so much data to begin with, and read only so many financial newspapers and look at so many computer screens on a given day. By contrast, artificial intelligence can easily digest all financial historical data, determine historic trends, and access each and every current source of information to have an up-the-second understanding of the markets. Here, simply stated, the human financial has no chance against artificial intelligence.
Where the financial adviser has a chance today against artificial intelligence is being able to meet with clients, get to know them socially, and get a feeling about what their real needs are. For instance, a client may say that they want to maximize the amount of money that they give to their kids, but really they are worried about having sufficient assets to get them through retirement without having to consume cat food. As we sit here today, artificial intelligence cannot yet equate with the financial adviser in understanding those purely human nuances.
However, because artificial intelligence learns so quickly, and learns from a bunch of humans at once, that gap in understanding those peculiar human nuances is closing fast.
To illustrate the speed of this learning, consider something that happens with self-driving vehicles: If a teenage driver has an accident while driving, only that particular teenage driver learns from her mistake. By contrast, if a self-driving vehicle has an accident, then every vehicle in the fleet learns from that mistake.
Because artificial intelligence learns so much faster than humans, it is simply a matter of time before artificial intelligence can read human nuances and have an emotional intelligence quotient that exceeds those of most humans. When that happens, in the next few years, financial advisers will have a hard time competing based on personal relationships.
For clients, the benefits of their financial adviser being artificial intelligence will be enormous.
Most financial advisers meet with their clients no more than every six months, and maybe have a few telephone calls in the interim. By contrast, AI is always on. If there is a financial issue that is keeping you up on a particular night, AI is there and immediately available to chat no matter the time.
Along these same lines, AI will manage financial matters instantaneously. For example, assume that a client has an asset allocation of X% into large-cap stocks. If necessary, AI can rebalance the portfolio to stay close to X% on a second-by-second basis if needed. By contrast, a financial adviser might not even look at a particular client's portfolio until the next six-month review, at which point it might be more costly to rebalance the client's large-cap stock holdings.
AI can also keep instantaneously up-to-date with the last economic data showing certain expenses. Have a 529 plan set up to send little Tommy to college? Your AI adviser can instantly keep up on projected tuition and other expenses and alert you when you are contributing too little or too much. The same will be true for retirement plans. Contrast this with human financial advisers, too many of whom take a ""fire and forget"" approach to such planning, i.e., the assumptions made on Day 1 of the plan are the assumptions that will remain the same for the next 20 years.
Another area where AI will excel is in the area of tax efficiency. AI can quite easily hold the entire Internal Revenue Code in its mind, and perform instant calculations on whether things are held in the most tax-efficient vehicle, such as a Roth IRA, etc., and make suggestions based on tax efficiency. By contrast, this is an area where financial advisers struggle to keep up with just the most basic rules and changes to those rules, and too often give outdated advice.
Perhaps the greatest benefit for clients will be in the elimination of human faults. Financial advisers are not completely immune from the twin killers of investors known as despair and euphoria: Despair when the market is going down, and euphoria when the market is going up, both of which can quickly destroy investment discipline. Financial advisers may not be as susceptible to these emotions as their non-professional clients, but it is probably impossible for them to completely clear their minds as to what is going on in the markets. AI will not suffer from either despair or euphoria.
The worst human fault, though, is simple greed. Far too many financial advisers make commission-driven decisions, putting their clients into loaded but mediocre-performing funds and driving them into high-commission life insurance and annuity products. Suffice it to say that AI doesn't have much interest in a golf junket to Scotland for big producers, or in putting clients into whole life insurance products because they pay twice as much commission (around 80% of first year's premiums) as UL products (around 40% of first year's premiums). Nor will AI embezzle client funds and then take off for Costa Rica.
There is a risk, of course, of built-in bias in AI of which the base program is drafted by humans. But there is also the possibility of giving AI the power to self-police itself against such bias by instructing AI to create its own programs to root out, identify, and eliminate such bias. We'll have to see how all this develops, but suffice it to say that I don't expect security regulators to be in the forefront of AI financial adviser development.
All I can say for now is that AI financial advisers are already here in some small part, and are quite likely to take over the sector entirely within the next decade.
And that's a very good thing for clients.

After all, aren’t computers less likely to have inherent views on, for example, race, gender, and sexuality?
Well, that was true back in the days when, as a general rule, computers could only do what we told them. The rollout of machine learning, thanks to the explosion of Big Data, and the emergence of affordable computers with enough processing power to handle it have changed all that.









3 Steps To Tackle The Problem Of Bias In Artificial Intelligence

In the old days, the term “garbage in, garbage out” concisely summed up the importance of high-quality data. When you give computers the wrong information to work with, the results they come up with are unlikely to be helpful.
PROMOTED
Back then, this was mostly a problem for computer programmers and analysts. Today, when computers are routinely making decisions about whether we are invited to job interviews, eligible for a mortgage, or a candidate for surveillance by law enforcement and security services, it’s a problem for everybody.

In possibly the highest profile example of getting this wrong so far, a study found that an AI algorithm used by parole authorities in the US to predict the likelihood of criminals reoffending was biased against black people.
Exactly how this came about is unknown – the workings of the proprietary algorithms have not been made available for independent auditing. But the ProPublica study found that the system overestimated the likelihood of black offenders going to commit further crimes after completing their sentence while underestimating the likelihood of white offenders doing the same.

Biased AI systems are likely to become an increasingly widespread problem as artificial intelligence moves out of the data science labs and into the real world. The “democratization of AI” undoubtedly has the potential to do a lot of good, by putting intelligent, self-learning software in the hands of us all.
But there’s also a very real danger that without proper training on data evaluation and spotting the potential for bias in data, vulnerable groups in society could be hurt or have their rights impinged by biased AI.
It’s possible AI may be the solution to, as well as the cause of this problem. Researchers at IBM are working on automated bias-detection algorithms, which are trained to mimic human anti-bias processes we use when making decisions, to mitigate against our own inbuilt biases.
This includes evaluating the consistency with which we (or machines) make decisions. If there is a difference in the solution chosen to two different problems, despite the fundamentals of each situation being similar, then there may be bias for or against some of the non-fundamental variables. In human terms, this could emerge as racism, xenophobia, sexism or ageism.
While this is interesting and vital work, the potential for bias to derail drives for equality and fairness runs deeper, to levels which may not be so easy to fix with algorithms.
I spoke to Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, Accenture’s lead for responsible AI, who outlined that there may be situations where data and algorithms are clean, but societal biases may still throw a spanner in the works.
She said, ""With societal bias, you can have perfect data and a perfect model, but we have an imperfect world.""
""Think about the use of AI in hiring … you use all of your historical data to train a model on who should be hired and why. Then you parse their resume or look at people’s faces while they’re interviewing.
“But you’re assuming that the only reason people are hired and promoted is pure meritocracy, and we actually know that not to be true.
“So, in this case, there's nothing wrong with the data, and there's nothing wrong with the model, what's wrong is that ingrained biases in society have led to unequal outcomes in the workplace, and that isn't something you can fix with an algorithm.""
In very simplified terms, an algorithm might pick a white, middle-aged man to fill a vacancy based on the fact that other white, middle-aged men were previously hired to the same position, and subsequently promoted. This would be overlooking the fact that the reason he was hired, and promoted, was more down to the fact he is a white, middle-aged man, rather than that he was good at the job.
Chowdhury lists three specific steps which organizations can take to minimize the risk of perpetuating societal biases.
The first is to look at the algorithms themselves and ensure that nothing about the way they are coded perpetuates bias. This is particularly necessary when AI is constantly making predictions which are out-of-step with reality (as seems to be the case with the US probation example mentioned above).
Second is to consider ways in which AI itself can help to mitigate against the risk of biased data – IBM’s bias detection algorithms could play a part here.
Thirdly, we must “make sure our house is in order – we can’t expect an AI algorithm that has been trained on data that comes from society to be better than society – unless we’ve explicitly designed it to be.”
This leads onto the discussion of the regulation of AI – who will be responsible for setting the parameters AI operates within – teaching machines what is valid data to learn from, and where inbuilt societal biases could limit its ability to make decisions which are both valuable and ethical.
Tech leaders including Google, Facebook and Apple jointly formed the Partnership on AI in 2016 to encourage research on the ethics of AI, including issues of bias. Part of the partnerships work involves informing legislators, but this ""top-down"" approach may not produce solutions to every problem, and may even stifle innovation.
Chowdhury says “What we don’t want … is every AI project at a company having to be judged by some governance group, that’s not going to make projects go forward. I call that model ‘police patrol,' where we have the police going around trying to stop and arrest criminals. That doesn't create a good culture for ethical behavior.""
Neither should the burden of regulation and enforcement be put solely on the front-line – the data scientists themselves, argues Chowdhury.
""Yes, the data scientist plays a role, the AI researcher plays a role, but at a corporation, there are many moving parts.
“We put a lot of responsibility on the data scientist … but they shouldn’t shoulder all of it.”
Basically, if society is at a stage where we are ready to democratize AI, by making it available to all, then we need to be ready to democratize the oversight and regulation of AI ethics.
Chowdhury refers to this concept as the Fire Warden model.
""Think about how if there's a fire in your building right now, everyone knows what to do – you all meet outside at a pre-arranged location, someone will raise the alarm – you won't put out the fire, but you've been educated on how to respond.
“That’s what I want to see in the governance of AI systems, everybody has a role to play, everyone’s roles are a bit different, but everyone understands how to raise ethical issues.”
Crucially, this will only work if there is faith that someone will put out the fire – no one would bother calling the fire brigade if they knew they didn’t have the ability and motivation to do their job. Some top-down regulation will undoubtedly be a necessary part of tackling the issue of AI bias.
But building a culture of reporting and accountability throughout an organization means there will be a far greater chance to spot and halt, bias in data, algorithms or systems before it is perpetuated and becomes harmful.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","Artificial Intelligence Has A Problem With Bias, Here's How To Tackle It",False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until then, no one is helped by exaggerating the intelligence or capabilities of AI systems. What is AI anyway? (Clockwise from top: a model from the film Metropolis, Oral-B’s AI toothbrush, an autonomous delivery robot.)It’s better, then, to talk about “machine learning” rather than AI. This is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and one that encompasses pretty much all the methods having the biggest impact on the world right now (including what’s called deep learning). As a phrase, it doesn’t have the mystique of “AI,” but it’s more helpful in explaining what the technology does.How does machine learning work? Over the past few years, I’ve read and watched dozens of explanations, and the distinction I’ve found most useful is right there in the name: machine learning is all about enabling computers to learn on their own. But what that means is a much bigger question.Let’s start with a problem. Say you want to create a program that can recognize cats. (It’s always cats for some reason). You could try and do this the old-fashioned way by programming in explicit rules like “cats have pointy ears” and “cats are furry.” But what would the program do when you show it a picture of a tiger? Programming in every rule needed would be time-consuming, and you’d have to define all sorts of difficult concepts along the way, like “furriness” and “pointiness.” Better to let the machine teach itself. So you give it a huge collection of cat photos, and it looks through those to find its own patterns in what it sees. It connects the dots, pretty much randomly at first, but you test it over and over, keeping the best versions. And in time, it gets pretty good at saying what is and isn’t a cat. So far, so predictable. In fact, you’ve probably read an explanation like this before, and I’m sorry for it. But what’s important is not reading the gloss but really thinking about what that gloss implies. What are the side effects of having a decision-making system learn like this? Well, the biggest advantage of this method is the most obvious: you never have to actually program it. Sure, you do a hell of a lot of tinkering, improving how the system processes the data and coming up with smarter ways of ingesting that information, but you’re not telling it what to look for. That means it can spot patterns that humans might miss or never think of in the first place. And because all the program needs is data — 1s and 0s — there are so many jobs you can train it on because the modern world is just stuffed full of data. With a machine learning hammer in your hand, the digital world is full of nails ready to be bashed into place. Machines that teach themselves can produce powerful results, as with DeepMind’s series of Go-playing AI systems.  Photo by Google via Getty ImagesBut then think about the disadvantages, too. If you’re not explicitly teaching the computer, how do you know how it’s making its decisions? Machine learning systems can’t explain their thinking, and that means your algorithm could be performing well for the wrong reasons. Similarly, because all the computer knows is the data you feed it, it might pick up a biased view of the world, or it might only be good at narrow tasks that look similar to the data it’s seen before. It doesn’t have the common sense you’d expect from a human. You could build the best cat-recognizer program in the world and it would never tell you that kittens shouldn’t drive motorbikes or that a cat is more likely to be called “Tiddles” than “Megalorth the Undying.” Teaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut — and like all shortcuts, it involves cutting cornersTeaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut. And like all shortcuts, it involves cutting corners. There’s intelligence in AI systems, if you want to call it that. But it’s not organic intelligence, and it doesn’t play by the same rules humans do. You may as well ask: how clever is a book? What expertise is encoded in a frying pan? So where do we stand now with artificial intelligence? After years of headlines announcing the next big breakthrough (which, well, they haven’t quite stopped yet), some experts think we’ve reached something of a plateau. But that’s not really an impediment to progress. On the research side, there are huge numbers of avenues to explore within our existing knowledge, and on the product side, we’ve only seen the tip of the algorithmic iceberg. Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist and former AI researcher, describes the current moment as the “age of implementation” — one where the technology starts “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Benedict Evans, another VC strategist, compares machine learning to relational databases, a type of enterprise software that made fortunes in the ‘90s and revolutionized whole industries, but that’s so mundane your eyes probably glazed over just reading those two words. The point both these people are making is that we’re now at the point where AI is going to get normal fast. “Eventually, pretty much everything will have [machine learning] somewhere inside and no-one will care,” says Evans. He’s right, but we’re not there yet. In the here and now, artificial intelligence — machine learning — is still something new that often goes unexplained or under-examined. So in this week’s special issue of The Verge, AI Week, we’re going to show you how it’s all happening right now, how this technology is being used to change things. Because in the future, it’ll be so normal you won’t even notice. Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

But it’s not organic intelligence, and it doesn’t play by the same rules humans do. You may as well ask: how clever is a book? What expertise is encoded in a frying pan? 

So where do we stand now with artificial intelligence? After years of headlines announcing the next big breakthrough (which, well, they haven’t quite stopped yet), some experts think we’ve reached something of a plateau. But that’s not really an impediment to progress. On the research side, there are huge numbers of avenues to explore within our existing knowledge, and on the product side, we’ve only seen the tip of the algorithmic iceberg. 

Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist and former AI researcher, describes the current moment as the “age of implementation” — one where the technology starts “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Benedict Evans, another VC strategist, compares machine learning to relational databases, a type of enterprise software that made fortunes in the ‘90s and revolutionized whole industries, but that’s so mundane your eyes probably glazed over just reading those two words. The point both these people are making is that we’re now at the point where AI is going to get normal fast. “Eventually, pretty much everything will have [machine learning] somewhere inside and no-one will care,” says Evans. 

He’s right, but we’re not there yet. 

In the here and now, artificial intelligence — machine learning — is still something new that often goes unexplained or under-examined. So in this week’s special issue of The Verge, AI Week, we’re going to show you how it’s all happening right now, how this technology is being used to change things. Because in the future, it’ll be so normal you won’t even notice.

Workers are clearly anxious about the effects on the job market of artificial intelligence and automation.Estimates about how much of the workforce could be automated vary from about 9% to 47%. The consultancy McKinsey estimates up to 800 million workers globally could be displaced by robotic automation by 2030. Some jobs will change dramatically, while others will disappear altogether.So if automation makes the job market a little like a game of musical chairs, is there a way to make sure you’re still employed when the music stops? Can education help you robot-proof your career?Future-proofing your career is less about picking a safe job and more about constantly updating your skills throughout your career, according to Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun, who wrote Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.Getty ImagesNortheastern University president Joseph Aoun says we'll have to combine technical, data and human skills to keep up in an uncertain future (Credit: Getty Images)He says education needs to change dramatically if workers are to adapt to this new environment. His solution, which he calls humanics, has three basic pillars:Technical ability: understanding how machines function and how to interact with them. As both artificial intelligence and robotics become ever more capable, machines will step into roles once monopolised by humans. Some employees won't last, but others will find themselves working with machines, and probably being vastly more productive as a result. Workers with a grounding in coding and engineering principles will be better placed to thrive in this new kind of workplace.Data discipline: navigating the sea of information that's generated by these machines. Workers will need data literacy to read, analyse and use the almost bottomless troves of information that are increasingly guiding everything from major business decisions to stock picks to purchasing decisions.And the human discipline: ""which is what we humans can do that machines for the foreseeable future, cannot emulate.” Aoun says this includes creativity, cultural agility, empathy and the ability to take information from one context and apply it to another. In educational terms, this means less emphasis on the classroom and a greater emphasis on experiential learning.Getty ImagesAutomation and AI aren't just going to affect lower-skill workers – professions such as law and accounting will be disrupted too   (Credit: Getty Images)The World Economic Forum suggests many white-collar jobs, like accounting, will be at risk from future automation, while the OECD says low-skilled jobs will be most vulnerable and there’ll still be a strong correlation between education and income. Either way, skills are becoming outdated faster than ever before.A generation ago, the half-life of a skill was about 26 years. Today, it&rsquo;s four and half years and dropping &ndash; Indranil Roy“A generation ago, the half-life of a skill was about 26 years, and that was the model for a career. Today, it’s four and half years and dropping,” says Indranil Roy, the head of the Future of Work Centre of Excellence, set up by global consultancy Deloitte.Aoun says the rapid pace of change isn’t necessarily a negative, but it does mean you’ll probably never outgrow homework. It also means universities will need to shift their focus towards lifelong education and training mid-career workers.“We’re constantly becoming obsolete. And in some ways that’s an enormous opportunity for us all to re-educate ourselves and update ourselves. Those that are able to do it will be able to flourish,” he says.Aoun worries that the tertiary education system currently isn’t equipped for this new reality. He says many universities are far too focused on four-year undergraduate courses and academic research.Equally important to helping students graduate, he says, is helping students master “the human discipline”. The solution is a much greater emphasis on real-world experience. That might mean taking a job or a long-term internship while studying. In addition to career experience, this gives students the life-skills to negotiate and interact with colleagues.“It also allows you to see opportunities and see gaps, and this is where you can say ‘I’m going to start a company or a not-for-profit’,” he says.Roy agrees that less-tangible life skills are becoming more important to many employers. He says some of Deloitte’s “more progressive” clients use artificial intelligence for skills like analytics, freelancers for deep technical skills and only fully employ people with “life skills” and values that align closely with the organisation. But he points out those are skills that mostly come from outside a university environment.Getty ImagesIndranil Roy recommends universities offer more interdisciplinary studies to teach students the right skills for the future (Credit: Getty Images)McKinsey suggests that by 2030, the workforce will spend 55% more time using technical skills than in 2016. The World Economic Forum, meanwhile, foresees a net gain in employment from automation, with some jobs killed off but more created.Roy says that probably means a workplace in which robots work alongside humans – for example, he says some of Deloitte’s clients have AI systems that attend and participate in meetings.Aoun agrees that it’s important to understand our changing our relationship with machines in the workplace, and to adapt education accordingly.“In the same way that once we have self-driving cars, clearly teaching driving will be transformed. So technology is going to make certain fields obsolete, but it’s not going to make humans obsolete,” he says.Perhaps above all, Aoun says humans need to focus on skills that are harder for artificial intelligence to replicate. Specifically, that means taking knowledge from one context or discipline and applying it to another. Humanics itself is about combining three separate disciplines.“We humans are creative, innovative, entrepreneurial. We are able to interact with other people, work with them, be empathetic. We are able to be culturally agile, work with people with different backgrounds. We are able to be global,” he said.Roy says universities, particularly in the US, Canada and Australia, are increasingly focusing on interdisciplinary studies. However, tertiary institutions in other countries are still a little more traditional in their approach.Technology is constantly upending our expectations, with change the only certainty. Roy says he is “surprised every day” at the barriers machines are breaking.So perhaps it’s not enough to help workers survive a musical chairs-style job market. Maybe they also need to survive in one where all the chairs are constantly moving.To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

You Are Smarter Than a Computer

FacebookTwitterLinkedIn The question of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and the future of human work is a Rorschach test: the answer you get depends on what you see. For some, the advent of “smart” everything portends a future of rising living standards and human flourishing. Others see a dark side. Without going “full Terminator,” many of the best informed people in the AI field see a revolution that threatens social cohesion by devaluing human labor.
@eddieespinal via Twenty20
The actual future will likely contain elements of both these forecasts along with others that we haven’t yet imagined. In the short- and medium-term, significant challenges are probable as artificial intelligence works its way through the economy. The best estimates predict that somewhere between 10 percent and 30 percent of all jobs — between 15 million and 45 million positions — are susceptible to partial or complete automation in the United States alone.
Moreover, while lower-skilled jobs are at the greatest risk in the short-term, AI is also beginning to affect accounting, medicine, law and, ironically, the high-tech sector itself. The good news is that automation will be gradual and uneven because of its capital costs and implementation challenges.
In the longer term, economic history suggests that substituting technology for human labor is the best path to economic growth and improved living standards. The steam engine that launched the Industrial Revolution eliminated tens of thousands of jobs for artisans producing fine linens — but created millions of factory jobs in textile mills and drove down the price of clothing, and eventually, other wares. Lower prices left more income to purchase new products, devices and services.
This is the triple benefit of innovation: new jobs, lower prices and increased diversity of products. Just as manufacturing replaced agriculture as the principal occupation of Americans, today services and information tasks are replacing manufacturing. Innovation means jobs are destroyed, but new types of work are created at an even faster rate.
Given the pace of change and the degree of uncertainty, what should policymakers — and individuals — do to prepare for the future?
For mid-career workers, retraining will be an important part of the solution. Some companies, like AT&T, are investing heavily in skill development programs that help shift their existing workforce into new jobs within the company. AT&T workers who are closer to retirement specialize in maintaining legacy systems using the “old” skills built up earlier in their careers.
Wage insurance is another potentially useful tool for buffering workers against loss of income when higher paid jobs are replaced with more plentiful but lower-paying positions. By partly replacing the income lost during the transition to a new job, wage insurance would help keep more people in the labor force, preventing loss of skills and the physical, psychological and emotional toll of disemployment.
Younger workers face a more complex picture. Since the Sputnik crises of the mid-1950s, presidents, policymakers and educators have emphasized the acquisition of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills. Recent research indicates this may no longer be a good bet for the next generation.
According to one recent study, almost 60 percent of STEM workers leave their careers after 10 years driven out by stagnating wages and obsolete skills. Those with strong inter-personal or noncognitive skills find their way into STEM leadership and management positions. Others have to start over.
This reality is reflected in what employers tell us about what’s missing in our current workforce, namely soft-skills (listening, problem-solving, teamwork, integrity, dependability and adaptability). One study found that when offered the choice between a job candidate with job-specific skills or one who had good general skills, employers favored the general skills by almost two-to-one. Out of a list of eight qualities valued by Google hiring managers, the top seven were soft-skills. You can read more about the soft-skill shortage and strategies for addressing it here.
Finally, remember this: there is no computer that is smarter than the average human being. Algorithms typically do one thing very well. But a human being can do many things well simultaneously. Computers break information down; the human mind integrates information — text, image, sound, body language — creating the thing we call “consciousness,” a feat no computer can replicate. In our high-tech future, people will succeed not by trying to compete with AI but by being more fully human. Ironic, isn’t it?

He has reported on politics and policy issues for news organizations including National Memo, Massroots, NBC, and is a published science fiction author. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Artificial Intelligence is currently being deployed in customer service to both augment and replace human agents – with the primary goals of improving the customer experience and reducing human customer service costs. While the technology is not yet able to perform all the tasks a human customer service representative could, many consumer requests are very simple ask that sometimes be handled by current AI technologies without human input. In this article we’ll shed light on the current trends and use-cases that business leaders should be considering today. We’ve broken this article on AI for customer service into the following four sections: How AI is helping to augment the work of human customer service representatives, including: Augmenting messenging AI for sorting and routing support inquiries AI for enhanced phone support Where AI may be replacing human customer service representatives An assessment of the results / ROI of current AI customer service initiatives Perspectives and predictions about the future of AI and customer service According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there were just over 2.7 million Americans employed as customer service representatives with a mean wage of $35,170. Any technology that could improve the efficiency of customer service representatives or make some of these positions redundant would potentially produce significant business savings. This is likely one reason why Oracle found that 80% of sales and marketing leaders say they are currently using or plan to deploy chatbots in the near future.  AI Augmenting Human Customer Service AI doesn’t need to completely replace humans customer services representatives to be useful. There are many transitional step between a human only customer service system and possible goal of one completely run by a perfectly human like AI. There are many AI can work in tangent with human agents. Machine learning can also help streamline processes to make human more efficient by letting them spend all their time doing what they do best. This is how AI is currently being used by business to produce noticeable improvements. Salesforce’s Chief Digital Evangelist, Vala Afshar predicts that, “The line-of-business that is most likely to embrace AI first will be the customer service – typically the most process oriented and technology savvy organization within most companies.” Other executives share his sentiment, our own consensus of 35 AI executives determined that conversational interfaces (mostly intended for customer support) would be the most important consumer-facing AI innovation in the next 5 years. AI for customer service seems somewhat inevitable. Mr. Afshar points out that 38% of enterprises use AI, and that is expected to grow to 62% by next year. Salesforce believes deploying AI for Customer Relationship Management will increase global business revenues by $1.1 trillion by 2021, which is why they have bet so heavily on their Einstein platform with both internal development and several big acquisitions to try to capture a large share of this market. While one of the biggest players, Salesforce is by no means the only company developing AI for customer relationship applications. 1 – AI Augmented Messaging One company that provides AI-augmented messaging is LivePerson, which last year had revenue of roughly $200 million and is currently working with IBM Watson. The company is deploying a “bot assistant to the agent” model for some clients. The goal is to avoid the frustration some people feel when dealing with a pure bot while still using the technology to increase efficiency. At the moment the company feels generalized bots don’t work, but specialized bots meant to handle the most routine and simple tasks do. A screen shot intended to demonstrate LivePerson’s conversational interface passing messages to and from human agents – Image from LivePerson Liveperson claims that around half of all customer service interactions are currently highly suitable for bots. So they have created a system were the humans and bots work in tango. Very simple questions can be handled directly by a bot, but as soon as the conversation becomes too complicated the bot can hand the conversation off to a human. The human can handle the more difficult task and even hand the interaction back to the bot finished any simple details. This maximize the time human agents spend doing what only human agents currently can and minimize the time they spend on task that bots can handle. This system allows one agent to handle multiple interactions. According to the case studies LivePerson promotes, their system has allowed agents at UPC, one of Ireland’s largest internet providers, to take up to three chats at once. While they say the system even let agents at Sun handle up to 6 concurrent chats. 2 – AI Organized Email Inquiries Having a person read every email a company gets to try to figure out what the customer needs and how to deal with it can be a very time-consuming task. That is why companies are using AI to speed up the process. Once company offering this sort of tool is DigitalGenius with their core customer service product. Some companies are using this AI-powered technology to scan and tag emails to direct them to the right office. The system also provides agents with macros and clips from the best past responses to quickly create a response. This screen shot from DigitalGenius’ product page highlights the main benefits that the company claims to deliver. While this image can’t be taken as our claim to what DigitalGenius can or cannot do (we are not a customer of theirs), it should be seen as a representative set of important business problems that AI conversational interface companies (like DigitalGenius and it’s competitors) are set out to solve One example of their technology which DigitalGenius highlights is its use by student prep company Magoosh. According to Magoosh, the system made their customer service team significantly more efficient. The technology let them cut the number of customer requests waiting for a reply by half and mad it easy for Magoosh to meet their internal goal of responding to all customers with 24 hours. DigitalGenius claims more than 83% of all incoming requests could be handled by their system that would tag and sort them. 3 – AI Enhanced Customer Phone Calls A screen shot from Software Advice’s “Demographics on Live Chat Customer Service” survey, showing the frequency of live chat customer service engagement among age groups AI is harder to deploy for voice-based communications. On a purely technical level it is more challenging for a computer system to deal with voice than chat. Background noise, unusual speech patterns, accents, and poor pronunciation all make it hard for an AI to translate voices into text.  In addition some people only call companies as a last resort when they have really difficult issues to address. A customer survey by Software Advice found that when it comes to simple questions customers were almost equally divided whether they preferred to use chat or a phone call to get the answer, but to get an answer for a complex financial questions customer prefer calling by a rate of three to one.   Yet even with these hurdles, there are companies who are managing to use AI to enhance the work of customer service representatives who answer phone calls. For example, the startup Cogito has developed a real-time conversation-analysis tool based on behavioral science and deep learning. Their AI listens to conversations for both content and tone. They claim it can detect mimicking, change in volume, change in pitch, etc. to gain real-time insight into how customers are feeling and how all company calls are going. It provides real-time suggestions to customer service representatives to improve the call and evaluate performance. One of the first big tests of their system was at insurance giant Humana. During a six month trial involving 200 agents, calls that used their system resulted in a 28 percent improvement in Net Promoter Scores, a 6 percent improvement in issue resolution, and fewer callers asking to speak to a manager. Cogito claims their system reduces call backs by 10 percent and increases customer satisfaction by 28 percent.  Similarly, Salesforce announced earlier this year that call monitoring is one of the ways they are deploying their AI technology. Einstein Supervisor claims to be able to predict customer satisfaction and make recommendations. It can track call center patterns and also look for broad patterns within the data, such as increased call volume from customers who bought a specific batch of a product. AI Replacing Human Customer Service Voice ordering demo – as seen on the short video on the Starbucks website The potential cost savings and the ability to provide 24-hour customer service are why some organizations are using AI to replace humans in certain customer service applications all together. AI can’t yet fully replicate everything a person can do when it comes to resolving complex issues, but there any many applications where it doesn’t need to.  Pre-internet, many customer calls were to get very basic information or make very basic orders. These are the type of interactions that are being fully automated across several platforms. For example, something simple like ordering a pizza to be delivered is a routine interaction, and the problems that would arise from AI making a small mistake are minimal. Food companies like Subway, Dominos, Starbucks and Wingstop have all recently started using AI to let people place orders in different ways without human involvement. Individuals can place pizza orders with chatbots in Facebook Messenger or verbally tell Amazon’s Alexa to order them a frappuccino. Several banks are making major pushes for AI, since people often interact with their banks to get basic information such as checking balances or to perform basic tasks like paying bills. Capital One recently unveiled their natural language assistant, Eno.  Similarly, Bank of America plans to roll out Erica, their AI banking assistant, in the coming months. Multiple major international companies now feel confident turning over simple, routine consumer interactions to bots.  A Look into the Future of AI and Customer Support Predictions of just how much AI will impact customer service performance and employment varies considerably. This is partly due to the fact that many of the most interesting uses of AI in customer service have only been deployed relatively recently and the fact that customer service can be a bit nebulous.  While call center employment is an easily quantifiable measurement, some of the biggest impacts of the technology will be freeing up cashiers, hostesses, and salespeople at local stores. According to a 2016 report from McKinsey, 29 percent of what customer-service representatives do has the potential for automation.  A Tata consultancy services survey of executives around the world found that 31.7 percent of major companies are currently using AI in customer service. It is the second most common use of AI by companies after IT. It also found on average executives expect cognitive technology to reduce customer service jobs on net by 4 percent. There is also the issue of how this technology might induce demand. Companies are currently using AI to replace humans when to comes to low-level consumer interactions to make responses quicker and cheaper, but they are also using AI to make consumer service interactions with human agents better. Sometimes, though, when you make something better and cheaper, people expect significantly more of it.  According to Microsoft’s 2016 State of Global Customer Service Report, millennials have a 68% higher expectations for customer service today than they had just one year ago. Thanks to technology 78% of young consumer expect service agent to already know their contact and product information when they contact them. The mid-term impact of the use of AI in customer service might not be a net reduction in customer service jobs. Instead, companies may use the efficiency gained to provide a much higher level of service with similar levels of employment. Concluding Thoughts Fashion is a retail sector that seems to be investing heavily in customer support and sales support chat applications, read more about use-cases from Dior, Nike, and other fashion leaders in our recent “AI in Fashion” article Customer service is one area where AI is currently being widely used and having an impact. In different forms it is being used to improve the quality or reduce the cost of customer service across industries such as fast food, banks, insurance and retail. Major companies are now confident AI chatbots and voice-activated systems can reliably handle low-level requests, resulting in significant investment and roll outs of these systems at the moment. Compared to some other aspects of business, the impact of AI on customer service is already being directly felt by companies and regular customers in a very clear and direct way. It is a space where new and improved applications AI are being deployed by wide range of different companies at a significant rate. Unlikely other applications of AI, ways to improve customer service is something almost all companies have to deal with. Despite the rapid change, AI is not expected to fully replace human customer service agents any time in the near future.  Current applications of AI in the customer service space are being used to fully handle some of the most monotonous work and are making it easier for human agents to deal with the more difficult issues. As these systems learn, they should be able to handle more and more requests without human involvement.  This means companies will likely be able to provide the current level of service they do now for less money, but that doesn’t inherently mean it will free up all company to spend less on this part of their business. We are seeing customers come to expect better service as a result of technology making that possible. The major impact of AI in customer service could be a reduction in total spending customer service for same industries or it could be quality improvement arms race for others while spending the same amount.   Header image credit: Infinit Contact Related Posts AI for Customer Service in Banking - Current ApplicationsIDC estimated the size of overall AI-related spending in the banking industry in their Worldwide… Chatbots for Customer Service - 4 Current ApplicationsIn this article, we look at current applications of user-built and vendor-built chatbots in the… AI for Fraud Detection in Retail - 2 Powerful Use CasesLeading retailers - like Walmart, Stop & Shop, and Home Depot - are enhancing their payment… 5 Ways Banking Chatbots Could Improve the Customer ExperienceIn banking and finance, chatbots have the potential to improve the customer experience by allowing… AI for Customer Segmentation and Marketing CampaignsDeloitte reported that 42% of questioned executives think AI will be “of critical importance” within… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said that algorithms can perpetuate racial inequities.

Last week, newly elected U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when she said, as part of the fourth annual MLK Now event, that facial-recognition technologies and algorithms ""always have these racial inequities that get translated, because algorithms are still made by human beings, and those algorithms are still pegged to basic human assumptions. They're just automated. And automated assumptions — if you don't fix the bias, then you're just automating the bias.""Does that mean that algorithms, which are theoretically based on the objective truths of math, can be ""racist?"" And if so, what can be done to remove that bias? [The 11 Most Beautiful Mathematical Equations]It turns out that the output from algorithms can indeed produce biased results. Data scientists say that computer programs, neural networks, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) work because they learn how to behave from data they are given. Software is written by humans, who have bias, and training data is also generated by humans who have bias.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksLeaf Filter USADon't Pay For New Gutters. Get This 3-In-1 System InsteadLeaf Filter USALearn MoreUndoThe two stages of machine learning show how this bias can creep into a seemingly automated process. In the first stage, the training stage, an algorithm learns based on a set of data or on certain rules or restrictions. The second stage is the inference stage, in which an algorithm applies what it has learned in practice. This second stage reveals an algorithm's biases. For example, if an algorithm is trained with pictures of only women who have long hair, then it will think anyone with short hair is a man.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceGoogle infamously came under fire in 2015 when Google Photos labeled black people as gorillas, likely because those were the only dark-skinned beings in the training set.And bias can creep in through many avenues. ""A common mistake is training an algorithm to make predictions based on past decisions from biased humans,"" Sophie Searcy, a senior data scientist at the data-science-training bootcamp Metis, told Live Science. ""If I make an algorithm to automate decisions previously made by a group of loan officers, I might take the easy road and train the algorithm on past decisions from those loan officers. But then, of course, if those loan officers were biased, then the algorithm I build will continue those biases.""Searcy cited the example of COMPAS, a predictive tool used across the U.S. criminal justice system for sentencing, which tries to predict where crime will occur. ProPublica performed an analysis on COMPAS and found that, after controlling for other statistical explanations, the tool overestimated the risk of recidivism for black defendants and consistently underestimated the risk for white defendants.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.To help combat algorithmic biases, Searcy told Live Science, engineers and data scientists should be building more-diverse data sets for new problems, as well as trying to understand and mitigate the bias built in to existing data sets.First and foremost, said Ira Cohen, a data scientist at predictive analytics company Anodot, engineers should have a training set with relatively uniform representation of all population types if they're training an algorithm to identify ethnic or gender attributes. ""It is important to represent enough examples from each population group, even if they are a minority in the overall population being examined,"" Cohen told Live Science. Finally, Cohen recommends checking for biases on a test set that includes people from all these groups. ""If, for a certain race, the accuracy is statistically significantly lower than the other categories, the algorithm may have a bias, and I would evaluate the training data that was used for it,"" Cohen told LiveScience. For example, if the algorithm can correctly identify 900 out of 1,000 white faces, but correctly detects only 600 out of 1,000 asian faces, then the algorithm may have a bias ""against"" Asians, Cohen added.Removing bias can be incredibly challenging for AI.Even Google, considered a forerunner in commercial AI, apparently couldn't come up with a comprehensive solution to its gorilla problem from 2015. Wired found that instead of finding a way for its algorithms to distinguish between people of color and gorillas, Google simply blocked its image-recognition algorithms from identifying gorillas at all.Google's example is a good reminder that training AI software can be a difficult exercise, particularly when software isn't being tested or trained by a representative and diverse group of people.Artificial Intelligence: Friendly or Frightening?Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures10 Crazy New Skills That Robots Picked Up in 2018Originally published on Live Science.

How Will Automation, AI Impact Healthcare Employment?
Healthcare employment will have low exposure to automation in the next decade despite the increased use of artificial intelligence to replace some tasks, experts predict.

 By Jacqueline LaPointe


January 30, 2019 - Increased use of automation and artificial intelligence is slated to replace millions of jobs and tasks in the near future. However, healthcare employment is relatively safe from automation, according to a new report from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.
The report, titled Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How machines are affecting people and places, looks back at how automation impacted the workforce from the 1980s to 2016 and offers projections on how new automation and artificial intelligence (AI) tools will affect the economy by 2030.
“The next phase of automation, increasingly involving AI, seems like it should be manageable in the aggregate labor market, though there are many sources of uncertainty,” Mark Muro, Senior Fellow and lead author of the report, stated in a press release. “With that said, the potential effects will vary significantly across occupations, regions, and demographic groups, which means that policymakers, industry, and society as a whole needs to focus much more than they are on ensuring the coming transitions will work for all of those affected.”
Muro and his co-authors Robert Maxim and Jacob Whiton found that only approximately one-quarter of US jobs (36 million positions in 2016) are at an elevated risk of automation in the coming decade.
Meanwhile, about 36 percent of US employment, or 52 million jobs in 2016, face medium exposure by 2030, and the remaining 39 percent (57 million jobs in 2016) will experience low exposure.

The healthcare workforce sits in the medium to low exposure buckets, the report shows.
“Regardless of whether technological reality will keep up with technological possibility, the pattern of automatability is clear,” Muro et al. write. “Occupations in complex, creative, and social fields like management, business and finance, science and technology (computer, math, physical and life sciences, architecture, and engineering), law, education, arts, media, entertainment, healthcare, and social and community services (those to the left of the bar chart) have among the lowest automation potential across the workforce.”

								For example, home health aides only have an eight percent automation potential by 2030, while registered nurses have a 29 percent automation potential and medical assistants have a 54 percent automation potential.
Additionally, healthcare practitioners and technical occupations have a 33 percent current-task automation potential and healthcare support occupations have a 49 percent potential.
In contrast, jobs that are in “more cut-and-dried activity areas” such as office administration, agriculture, construction and extraction, maintenance and repair, production, transportation, and food services will experience the highest automation potential.
In the middle are protective services, building and ground maintenance, and personal services, the report states.
Despite different levels of automation potential, researchers emphasize that no occupation will be unaffected by the adoption of automation and artificial intelligence. Routine tasks will be the most vulnerable to automation in the next decade.
“Near-future automation potential will be highest for roles that now pay the lowest wages,” the report states. “Likewise, the average automation potential of occupations requiring a bachelor’s degree runs to just 24 percent, less than half the 55 percent task exposure faced by roles requiring less than a bachelor’s degree.”
“Given this, better-educated, higher-paid earners for the most part will continue to face lower automation threats based on current task content—though that could change as AI begins to put pressure on some higher-wage ‘non-routine’ jobs.”
Automation risk will be the most disruptive in the American Heartland, so Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, the report also stated.
“Overall, the 19 states that the Walton Family Foundation labels as the American Heartland have an average employment-weighted automation potential of 47 percent of current tasks, compared with 45 percent in the rest of the country,” researchers write. “Much of this exposure reflects Heartland states’ longstanding and continued specialization in manufacturing and agricultural industries.”
Similarly, smaller, more rural communities will also see significantly more automation exposure and task replacement compared to urban areas.
In addition, the report states that men, young workers, and under-represented communities have greater automation exposure.
Automation and artificial intelligence will impact the US workforce in the next decade. But the potential loss or task replacement for some occupation isn’t as dire as some say.
“Technologists at first issued scary dystopian alarms about the power of automation, including artificial intelligence, to destroy work,” researchers write. “Now, the discourse appears to be arriving at a more balanced story that suggests that while the robots are coming they will bring neither an apocalypse nor utopia, but instead both benefits and stress alike.”
Federal, state, and local policymakers, business, educators, and civil society have the power to ensure automation and artificial intelligence maximize productivity while mitigating negative labor market effects, they add.
“In this vein, the nation needs to commit to deep-set educational changes, new efforts to help workers and communities adjust to change, and a more serious commitment to reducing hardships for those who are struggling,” the report concludes. “If the nation can commit to its people in this way, a future full of machines will seem much more tolerable.”

Quinyx, a Stockholm and London-based cloud provider of workforce management solutions, has raised $25 million in its latest round of funding, with support from existing investors Alfvén & Didrikson, Battery Ventures and Zobito.
Founded in 2005 by chief executive Erik Fjellborg after he spent a summer working for fast-food chain McDonald’s, the company provides software to help business of all sizes manage their staff scheduling, communication, task-management, as well as payroll integration.
After experiencing firsthand the difficult task managers have in organizing employee shifts, Fjellborg created the Quinyx software, with McDonald’s as the company’a first customer.
Service Tailored to the Service Industry
With a focus on shift-based or “flexible” workers in service industries, Quinyx now boasts about 500,000 employees on its platformOpens a new window  at companies including McDonald’s, Burger King, jewelery company Swarovski, London’s City Airport, airline Virgin Atlantic and pharmaceutical retailer Boots.
For now, the core customer base is in Europe but its software has been used globally in markets including China, Japan and South Korea. The company says the funding will be used to spur the roll-out of innovations and artificial intelligence technologies, helping to further automate and streamline the processes of workforce management.
Fjellborg said that the additional funds “will help us to accelerate our growth journey and develop and embed new technologies into our platforms to unlock the full potential of the flexible workforce. Our mission is simple – to create a better life for millions of people by improving their work lives.”
Maria Åhr, CEO of Alfvén & Didriksson, said “Quinyx is a game-changer in workforce management. Its consistent growth and calibre of its customers confirms its strong potential for future global growth. We look forward to playing an active role in the company’s next chapter.”
The investment marks the largest injection into Quinyx so far, which has raised a total of $53.3 million over four funding rounds.
“Having joined the board at Quinyx when we invested in the company last year, I’ve seen firsthand the ambition and drive Erik and his team have shown in going after this large market,” says Battery Ventures general partner Michael Brown. “Quinyx has made significant progress in the last year by continuing to focus on the strength of its technology. This new investment will help take Quinyx’s business to the next level.”
Shift Market Trend Encourages Development, M&A
With increasing numbers of people engaging in shift work, the global workforce management market is estimated to be worth $2.4 billion. Other players in the space include Infor, Kronos, Replicon and WorkJam.
A report by Gartner into the workforce management software sectorOpens a new window  says that by 2023, at least 95&percnt; of sales of new workforce management applications will be deployed on the cloud. It found a trend of cloud-first workforce management applications, with human capital management suite vendors expanding their capabilities in this area and more widely adopting workforce management solutions.
“The latest generation of WFM [workforce management] applications have the potential to transform, augment and disrupt the market by introducing new capabilities to WFM applications,” the report says. “Organizations have traditionally invested less frequently in WFM applications than in other HCM [human capital management] applications, such as functions of talent management. However, WFM is one of the few functions of HCM that can provide hard ROI.”
The benefits of using such a system, the report highlights, are to measure accurately the working time and absences of workers, making the information available to payroll and human resources; helping employers comply with legislation and agreements regarding working hours, pay and leave; providing efficient and fair work schedules; and providing tools to track worker productivity.
On Wednesday, enterprise software group Salesforce was reportedOpens a new window  to be in early-stage talks to buy Israeli workforce management software company Clicksoftware Technologies at a valuation of about $1.5 billion, although neither company confirmed the deal. Clicksoftware develops and sells enterprise software that offers task scheduling, resource management, as well as customer service tools.
Last week, US-based workforce management solution provider Kronos announced a partnership with German enterprise software group SAP to resell its Workforce Dimensions solution under the brand SAP Time Management by Kronos.
“SAP Time Management by Kronos offers unique and innovative capabilities that will help SAP customers with complex workforce needs to reimagine scheduling, timekeeping, leave management, and regulatory compliance” said Stephen Spears, chief revenue officer at SAP SuccessFactors. “The benefits are connected and localized human resources processes – and a smooth experience across the best workforce management, core HR, and payroll solutions in the market.”

By Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Director, Applied Machine Learning
Today, Facebook is announcing a new partnership with the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to support the creation of an independent AI ethics research center. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, which is supported by an initial funding grant from Facebook of $7.5 million over five years, will help advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and will explore fundamental issues affecting the use and impact of AI.
Artificial intelligence offers an immense opportunity to benefit people and communities around the world. But as AI technology increasingly impacts people and society, the academics, industry stakeholders and developers driving these advances need to do so responsibly and ensure AI treats people fairly, protects their safety, respects their privacy, and works for them.
At Facebook, ensuring the responsible and thoughtful use of AI is foundational to everything we do — from the data labels we use, to the individual algorithms we build, to the systems they are a part of. We’re developing new tools like Fairness Flow, which can help generate metrics for evaluating whether there are unintended biases in certain models. We also work with groups like the Partnership for AI, of which Facebook is a founding member, and the AI4People initiative. However, AI poses complex problems which industry alone cannot answer, and the independent academic contributions of the Institute will play a crucial role in furthering ethical research on these topics.
The Technical University of Munich is one of the top-ranked universities worldwide in the field of artificial intelligence, with work extending from fundamental research, to applications in fields like robotics and machine intelligence, to the study of the social implications of AI. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will leverage the TUM’s outstanding academic expertise, resources and global network to pursue rigorous ethical research into the questions evolving technologies raise.
The Institute will also benefit from Germany’s position at the forefront of the conversation surrounding ethical frameworks for AI — including the creation of government-led ethical guidelines on autonomous driving — and its work with European institutions on these issues.

Drawing on expertise across academia and industry, the Institute will conduct independent, evidence-based research to provide insight and guidance for society, industry, legislators and decision-makers across the private and public sectors. The Institute will address issues that affect the use and impact of artificial intelligence, such as safety, privacy, fairness and transparency.
Through its work, the Institute will seek to contribute to the broader conversation surrounding ethics and AI, pursuing research that can help provide tangible frameworks, methodologies and algorithmic approaches to advise AI developers and practitioners on ethical best practices to address real world challenges.
To help meet the need for thoughtful and groundbreaking academic research in these areas, Facebook looks forward to supporting the Institute and help offer an industry perspective on academic research proposals, rendering the latter more actionable and impactful.
Operational Model
The independent Institute will be led by TUM Professor Dr. Christoph Lütge, who holds degrees in business informatics and philosophy and has served as the Peter Löscher Endowed Chair of Business Ethics at TUM since 2010. Working with a diverse advisory board of representatives from academia, civil society and industry, the Institute will identify specific research questions and convene researchers focused on AI ethics and governance-related issues.
“At the TUM Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, we will explore the ethical issues of AI and develop ethical guidelines for the responsible use of the technology in society and the economy,” Dr. Lütge said. “Our evidence-based research will address issues that lie at the interface of technology and human values. Core questions arise around trust, privacy, fairness or inclusion, for example, when people leave data traces on the internet or receive certain information by way of algorithms. We will also deal with transparency and accountability, for example in medical treatment scenarios, or with rights and autonomy in human decision-making in situations of human-AI interaction.”
While Facebook has provided initial funding, the Institute will explore other funding opportunities from additional partners and agencies. Facebook may also share insights, tools, and industry expertise related to issues such addressing algorithmic bias, in order to help Institute researchers focus on real-world problems that manifest at scale.
The Institute will also pursue opportunities to publish research and work with other experts in the field; organize conferences, symposia, and workshops; and launch educational activities with other leading institutions in common areas of interest.
Realizing AI’s huge potential for good while balancing its risks is a global effort, and it will not be accomplished overnight. The Institute is an exciting step forward in our continued commitment to partnering with academic institutions, governments, NGOs, advocacy and industry groups, and others who are working to advance AI in a safe and responsible way.

The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, which is supported by an initial funding grant from Facebook of $7.5 million over five years, will help advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and will explore fundamental issues affecting the use and impact of AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence offers an immense opportunity to benefit people and communities around the world. But as AI technology increasingly impacts people and society, the academics, industry stakeholders and developers driving these advances need to do so responsibly and ensure AI treats people fairly, protects their safety, respects their privacy, and works for them.\n\nAt Facebook, ensuring the responsible and thoughtful use of AI is foundational to everything we do — from the data labels we use, to the individual algorithms we build, to the systems they are a part of. We're developing new tools like Fairness Flow, which can help generate metrics for evaluating whether there are unintended biases in certain models. We also work with groups like the Partnership for AI, of which Facebook is a founding member, and the AI4People initiative. However, AI poses complex problems which industry alone cannot answer, and the independent academic contributions of the Institute will play a crucial role in furthering ethical research on these topics.\n\nThe Technical University of Munich is one of the top-ranked universities worldwide in the field of artificial intelligence, with work extending from fundamental research, to applications in fields like robotics and machine intelligence, to the study of the social implications of AI. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will leverage the TUM's outstanding academic expertise, resources and global network to pursue rigorous ethical research into the questions evolving technologies raise.\n\nThe Institute will also benefit from Germany's position at the forefront of the conversation surrounding ethical frameworks for AI — including the creation of government-led ethical guidelines on autonomous driving — and its work with European institutions on these issues.\n\nInstitute Overview\n\nDrawing on expertise across academia and industry, the Institute will conduct independent, evidence-based research to provide insight and guidance for society, industry, legislators and decision-makers across the private and public sectors.

It has become the first Indian Educational Institution to offer such a full-fledged BTech program in AI and likely the third institute globally - after Carnegie Mellon University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both of which are in the US.The Course will have an intake of around 20 students who can take the program through the JEE-Advanced.The mission of the Department of Artificial Intelligence, IIT Hyderabad, is to produce students with a sound understanding of the fundamentals of theory and practice of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It also aims to enable students to become leaders in the industry and academia nationally and internationally and meet the pressing demands of the nation in the areas of AI and Machine Learning. IIT Hyderabad is already offering an MTech program in Artificial Intelligence – Machine Learning.Speaking about the importance of this course, Prof UB Desai, Director, IIT Hyderabad, said, “The basic aim is to create a complete ecosystem for Artificial Intelligence Academics and Research at IIT Hyderabad. This involves BTech, MTech and different Minor Programs in AI. Moreover, the R&amp;D will be strongly entwined with academics.”It is envisaged that students graduating from these programs will apply their training to become leaders in the industry and academia and contribute to building a better future for India and the world.What makes the program at IIT Hyderabad unique is that it aims to provide a holistic view to students. It comprises algorithms from the Computer Science Department, Signal Processing from Electrical Engineering Department, Robotics from Mechanical Engineering Department and Mathematical Foundations. The course will also focus on application verticals such as healthcare, agriculture, smart mobility, among many others.Further, the ethical impact of AI and its technologies on areas such as privacy, bias and related issues will also be a key component of this B.Tech. program. It is important that the next generation of people trained in AI should be sensitized to these things and are cognizant of the impact of the technology they develop.Highlighting the salient features of this course, Dr. Sumohana Channappayya, Dean (Research and Development), IIT Hyderabad, said, “AI solutions are particularly promising for India (given the availability of a large corpus of data) where it can have a major positive impact on several critical domains such as healthcare, crop and soil management, weather prediction, surveillance and security, and defence. Long term and robust solutions to problems in these domains require a systematic and disciplined approach that is rooted in the fundamentals of AI. However, the demand for professionals trained in this area far exceeds the current supply. The BTech program in AI is a step in the direction of addressing this highly skewed demand-supply scenario.”Further, Dr. Sumohana Channappayya added that the potential for AI to improve the quality of human lives is tremendous. This program will train students in the fundamentals of computer science, AI and ML in addition to sensitising them to the ethical issues in deploying AI-based solutions.Students pursuing other degrees such as B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering can now do a minor in AI as well from the coming Academic Year. This will make IIT Hyderabad students, in all disciplines, well equipped to meet the challenges in AI that are lying ahead.Speaking about this course, Dr. Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, said, “It will provide training on various aspects of AI, ranging from technical ones like machine learning algorithms to ethical issues as well. It will make our students very sought after by the Industry as their training will be comprehensive and well-rounded when working on smart AI-based technology solutions.”Further, IIT Hyderabad is already offering an M.Tech. in Data Science for working professionals that comprises Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and other related areas since 2015-16.The M.Tech. is a flexible program offered completely online in real-time with students having the freedom to complete the course between two to five years. This gives a lot of options for working professionals in AI area to upgrade their skillset without leaving their jobs or having to relocate.Dr. Vineeth added, “The past alumni have initiated R&amp;D projects after finishing the program and are also involved in collaborative Research projects with IIT Hyderabad. These courses, in addition to skill the Indian workforce, helps contribute to creating an ecosystem where industry and academia can closely discuss AI solutions and thereby bridge the gap between AI theory and practice.”IIT Hyderabad’s Department of Liberal Arts in collaboration with faculty from Computer Science and Electrical Engineering has also launched a unique Minor in ‘AI and Humanity.’ The influence of AI on everyday lives has grown exponentially: the way people interact with their bodies, their immediate environments, their societies, and the state are all increasingly mediated through AI. At this crucial point in its history, therefore, it is necessary to understand, question, and shape ways in which AI technologies are being incorporated into the fabric of everyday life.The AI and Humanity minor at IIT Hyderabad will expose students to exciting opportunities and challenges presented by AI. Students will benefit from thinking beyond the purely technical aspects of AI: humanities and social science scholars will team up with engineers and designers to offer wide-ranging interdisciplinary perspectives on AI and Humanity as part of this newly launched Minor.","{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Hindustan Times', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com'}",,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Hindustan Times House, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg', 'addressLocality': 'New Delhi', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '110 001'}",,,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad is launching a full-fledged BTech Program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the coming Academic Year (2019-2020).', 'description': 'Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad is launching a full-fledged BTech Program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the coming Academic Year (2019-2020).', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 – 11 – 60004242', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}",,,,,

'Her' : Artificial Intelligence Drives This Beautiful Love Story Home



                            Her may be basically a love-story, but a major focus has been laid upon the technological evolution that basically veins this drama. Human-OS love story is not a distant dream, and the maturity with which this film handles the delicate subject is worth a thousand applauds. Even more.

 ​
From the simple hi-tech phone to the keyboard-less computer to ever-evolving Operating System to the real-time interacting holographic video-game character, there's a lot more to this love story that shall have you amazed.

Put this in your 'must-watch' list, for this is a film that shall drive future tech-innovations in a whole new direction.

Is AI going to displace workers or come as a benefit to them?
Getty





Smart technologies aren’t just changing our homes; they’re edging their way into their numerous industries and are disrupting the workplace. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy across an organization – but is this entirely beneficial? Many fear that the rise of AI will lead to machines and robots replacing human workers and view this progression in technology as threat rather than a tool to better ourselves.

Friend or foe?
With AI continuing to be a prominent buzzword in 2019, businesses need to realize that self-learning and black-box capabilities are not the panacea. Many organisations are already beginning to see the incredible capabilities of AI, using these advantages to enhance human intelligence and gain real value from their data.
As there is increasing evidence demonstrating the benefits of intelligent systems, more decision-makers in the boardroom are gaining a better understanding of what AI can really offer. Research conducted by EY explains “organizations enabling AI at the enterprise level are increasing operational efficiency, making faster, more informed decisions and innovating new products and services.”
PROMOTED
The first companies employing AI systems across the board will gain competitive advantage, reduce cost of operations and remove head counts. Whilst this may be a positive from a business perspective, it is obvious why this a worry for those working in roles at risk of displacement. The introduction of these technologies will likely trigger an issue with unions and job security due to the substantial operational changes.

Although AI will affect every sector in some way, not every job is at equal risk. PwC predicts a relatively low displacement of jobs (around 3%) in the first wave of automation, but this could dramatically increase up to 30% by the mid-2030’s. Occupations within the transport industry could potentially be at much greater risk, whereas jobs requiring social, emotional and literary abilities are at the lowest risk of displacement.
A positive future with artificial intelligence
Many businesses and individuals are optimistic that this AI-driven shift in the workplace will result in more jobs being created than lost. As we develop innovative technologies, AI will have a positive impact on our economy by creating jobs that require the skill set to implement new systems. 80% of respondents in the EY survey said it was the lack of these skills that was the biggest challenge when employing AI programs.

It is likely that artificial intelligence will soon replace jobs involving repetitive or basic problem-solving tasks, and even go beyond current human capability. AI systems will be making decisions instead of humans in industrial settings, customer service roles and within financial institutions. Automated decisioning will be responsible for tasks such as approving loans, deciding whether a customer should be onboarded or identifying corruption and financial crime.
Organisations will benefit from an increase in productivity as a result of greater automation, meaning more revenue will generated. This thus provides additional money to spend on supporting jobs in the services sector.
How to take advantage of AI
Due to the vast array of jobs that could be impacted by AI, it is fundamental to address the potential pitfalls of these technologies.

Business need to overcome the trust and bias issues surrounding AI by achieving an effective and successful implementation that makes it possible for everyone to benefit.
Governments must ensure that gains from AI are shared widely across society to prevent social inequality between those affected and unaffected by these developments. For example, this could be through increased investment into training.
With the additional cost-savings from implementing AI systems, employers should also focus on upskilling their current employees.

To properly leverage the power of AI, we need to address the issue at an educational level, as well as in business. Education systems needs to focus on training students in roles directly associated to working with AI, including programmers and data analysts. This requires more emphasis to be put on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Also, subjects centered around building creative, social and emotional skills should be encouraged. Whilst artificial intelligence will be more productive than human workers for repetitive tasks, humans will always outperform machines in jobs requiring relationship-building and imagination.
Artificial intelligence will change our world both inside and outside the workplace. Instead of focusing on the fear surrounding automation, businesses need to embrace these new technologies to ensure they implement the most effective AI systems to enhance and compliment human intelligence.Vishal MarriaI am the CEO of Quantexa, an enterprise intelligence company.

on Sept. 14In 2015, a man named Nigel Richards won the title of French-­language Scrabble World Champion. This was especially noteworthy because Richards does not speak French. What the New Zealander had done was memorize each of the 386,000 words in the entire French Scrabble dictionary, in the space of just nine weeks.Richards’ impressive feat is a useful metaphor for how artificial intelligence works—real AI, not the paranoid fantasies that some self-­appointed “futurists” like to warn us about. Just as Richards committed vast troves of words to memory in order to master the domain of the Scrabble board, state-of-the-art AI—or deep ­learning—takes in massive amounts of data from a single domain and automatically learns from the data to make specific decisions within that domain. Deep learning can automatically optimize human-given goals—called ­“objective ­functions”—with unlimited memory and superhuman accuracy.While limited in scope, deep learning is usable by everyone and powerful within a certain domain. It can help ­Amazon maximize profit from recommendations or Facebook maximize minutes spent by users in its app, just as it can help banks minimize loan-­default rates or an airport camera determine if a terrorist has queued up for boarding.The potential applications for AI are extremely exciting. Autonomous vehicles, for example, will dramatically reduce cost and improve safety and efficiency. But the rise of AI also brings many challenges, and it’s worth taking time to sort between the genuine risks of this coming technological revolution and the misunderstandings and hype that sometimes surround the topic.Tech Titans Leading in Artificial IntelligenceMore Videos0 seconds of 2 minutes, 34 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0002:3402:34 First, let’s talk about job displacement. Because AI can outperform humans at routine tasks—­provided the task is in one domain with a lot of data—it is technically capable of displacing hundreds of millions of white and blue collar jobs in the next 15 years or so.But not every job will be replaced by AI. In fact, four types of jobs are not at risk at all. First, there are creative jobs. AI needs to be given a goal to optimize. It cannot invent, like scientists, novelists and artists can. Second, the complex, strategic jobs—­executives, diplomats, ­economists—go well beyond the AI limitation of single-­domain and Big Data. Then there are the as-yet-unknown jobs that will be created by AI.Are you worried that these three types of jobs won’t employ as many people as AI will displace? Not to worry, as the fourth type is much larger: empathetic and compassionate jobs, such as teachers, nannies and doctors. These jobs require compassion, trust and ­empathy—which AI does not have. And even if AI tried to fake it, nobody would want a chatbot telling them they have cancer, or a robot to baby­sit their children.So there will still be jobs in the age of AI. The key then must be retraining the workforce so people can do them. This must be the responsibility not just of the government, which can provide subsidies, but also of corporations and AI’s ultra-wealthy beneficiaries.As well as job displacement, AI has the potential to multiply ­inequality— both between the ultra-wealthy and the displaced workers and also among countries. In contrast with the U.S. and China, poorer and smaller countries will be unable to reap the economic rewards that will come with AI and less well placed to mitigate job displacement.The technology also poses serious challenges in terms of security; the consequences of hacking into AI-­controlled systems could be severe—­imagine if autonomous vehicles were hacked by terrorists and used as weapons.Finally, there are the issues of privacy, exacerbated bias and manipulation. Sadly, we’ve already seen failures on this front; Facebook couldn’t resist the temptation to use AI technology to optimize usage and profit, at the expense of user privacy and fostering bias and division.All of these risks require governments, businesses and technologists to work together to develop a new rule book for AI applications. What happened with Facebook is proof that self-­governing regulatory systems are bound to fail. And rather than compete against one another, countries must share best practices and work together to ensure this technology is used for the good of all.One thing we don’t have to worry about is the fevered warnings of utopians and dystopians about AI making humans obsolete. The former predict we shall be “assimilated” and evolve into human cyborgs; the latter warn of world domination by robot overlords. Neither are showing much in the way of actual intelligence about artificial intelligence.The age of “artificial general intelligence”­—or when AI will be able to perform intellectual tasks better than ­humans—is far in the distance. General AI requires advanced capabilities such as reasoning, conceptual learning, common sense, planning, creativity and even self-­awareness and emotions, all of which remain beyond our scientific reach. There are no known engineering paths to evolve toward these general capabilities. And big breakthroughs will not come easily or quickly.Think back to Nigel Richards, who defeated the Francophone world at Scrabble. He had an amazing ability to memorize data and optimally select from permutations. But if you asked him to evaluate a novel by Gustave Flaubert, he would be completely lost. So asking when AI will entirely surpass humans is a little like asking when Richards will win the Prix Goncourt, France’s most prestigious literature prize. It’s not entirely ­impossible—but it is extremely unlikely.",Tech Titans Leading in Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5501056/artificial-intelligence-protect-workers/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-07-11T20:40:55.000Z,PT2M34S,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/tS58KSFx.m3u8,https://time.com/5501056/artificial-intelligence-protect-workers/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The future of HR is both digital and human as HR leaders focus on optimizing the combination of human and automated work. This is driving a new priority for HR: one which requires leaders and teams to develop a fluency in artificial intelligence while they re-imagine HR to be more personal, human and intuitive.

As we enter 2019, it's the combination of AI and human intelligence that will transform work and workers as we know it.
I see the following ten HR trends leaders will need to prepare for as we enter 2019:
1. AI Plus Human Intelligence Enhances the Candidate Experience 
For many companies the first pilots of artificial intelligence are in talent acquisition, as this is the area where companies see significant, measurable, and immediate results in reducing time to hire, increasing productivity for recruiters, and delivering an enhanced candidate experience that is seamless, simple, and intuitive.
PROMOTED
One company that has delivered on this is DBS Bank. The DBS Talent Acquisition team created JIM (Jobs Intelligence Maestro), a virtual recruitment bot powered by artificial intelligence used to conduct candidate screening for those applying to be wealth planning managers, a high volume job in the consumer bank.

Following the introduction of JIM in May 2018, DBS talent acquisition was able to: 1) shorten the screening time from 32 minutes per candidate to 8 minutes per candidate, 2) improve completion rate of job application from 85% to 97% and 3) respond to 96% of all candidate queries through JIM, allowing recruiters to spend more time sharing the culture and values of DBS with candidates. While these metrics are impressive, says James Loo, Head of Talent Acquisition Group, DBS Bank, the key learning is that the use of artificial intelligence provides benefits for the recruiters as well.  Recruiters no longer need to spend hours to screen thousands of applicants, freeing them up to perform higher-value work such as sourcing, recruitment marketing, engaging with candidates, and hiring managers. In fact, DBS recruiters built a new skill: training the Chatbot to assess candidates and answer candidates’ queries. The future job of a recruiter may add that of  a Chatbot Coach!

The demand for uniquely human skills will grow, according to the Future of Jobs Report from the World Economic Forum.  The World Economic Forum projects that 75 million current jobs will be displaced as artificial intelligence takes over more routine aspects of work.
However, 133 million new jobs will be created, and skills in both emotional intelligence and  technical intelligence, like technology design and programming, will be important.
Figure 1 shows the Skills Demand in 2018 and Projected for 2022.








Figure 1
Future of Jobs Survey





Some companies, like Bank of America, are building a national training program to teach empathy to the banks' front line client facing roles. 
John Jordan who leads The Academy and Advisor Development at Bank of America calls this a ""life stage navigation curriculum,"" assisting Bank of America financial advisors in better understanding the priorities of their customers in various life stages from young parent, to widower, to retiree. Jordan says, ""To date, almost 40,000 people have been through Academy programs, which all include some form of empathy training.""
According to Jordan, the need to develop empathy is growing as front line bank professionals must understand the concerns of clients at their life stage. There is also a business reason to develop empathy. Research from Center for Creative Leadership shows developing  emotional intelligence and empathy predicts better job performance for both front line employees as well as leaders.
3. Artificial Intelligence Won't Take Away Jobs But Help Workers Do Jobs Better 
Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates.  The focus for 2019 will be on deciding how to use AI to help workers do their jobs better. PwC forecasts 20% of executives at U.S. companies with artificial intelligence initiatives report that they will roll out AI across their business this year and expect AI investment to both re-imagine jobs and work processes as well as grow profits and revenue.
For HR leaders, we see this already happening. Oracle and Future Workplace conducted research with 600 HR leaders entitled AI At Work, to learn where AI was being used in the workplace to re-imagine candidate and employee experience.
Figure 2 shows how this sample of 600 HR leaders answered the question: Where is AI Being Used in HR?

AI at Work Survey 





Hilton is one company already on the journey useing AI for HR. Sarah Smart, Vice President of Global Recruiting says,""By using artificial intelligence to source, screen and interview candidates, we have increased our speed to hire by 85%.  We have also experienced other business benefits; such as increasing the diversity of our talent pool and enabling our recruiters to identify a high performing candidate faster. Having started our journey using AI in 2014, we see future use cases for AI include improving new hire onboarding and providing internal talent mobility for Hilton employees.""  To date, Hilton has invested in upskilling the recruiter rather than making the role redundant. Think of artificial intelligence as a tool in the recruiter’s tool belt to help them streamline the hiring process, while never making the final decision about hiring.
4. New Jobs Will Be Created Using Artificial Intelligence 
Creating new jobs as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread inside companies will be a huge priority for C-suite leaders in 2019.
The Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions tackled this issue with  two reports, 21 Jobs for the Future and 21 More Jobs For the Future of Work.  These jobs have been organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2019 to 2029.
Since the first report was released, many of the anticipated new jobs have come to life, such as Financial Wellness Managers, (which I profiled in Three New HR Roles in Age of AI featuring Financial Wellness Managers at Suntrust), to Memory Curator and Augmented Reality Journey Builder jobs currently at Facebook. 
Rob Brown, Associate Vice President at Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions, shares the drivers behind the 21 More Jobs For the Future of Work: ""The vision behind our newest report is to profile futuristic jobs which leverage the power of artificial intelligence to blend technology with the ""human touch"" for jobs in the future workplace.""
Figure 3 presents the latest 21 More Jobs Of the Future.








Figure 3
21 More Jobs





Two of my favorites include:
Voice UX Designer: This role will leverage voice as a platform to deliver an “optimal” dialect and sound that is pleasing to each of the seven billion humans on the planet. The Voice UX Designer will do this by creating a set of AI tools and algorithms to help individuals find their “perfect voice” assistant.
Head of Business Behavior: The head of business behavior will analyze employee behavioral data such as performance data along with data gathered through personal, environmental and spatial sensors to create strategies to improve employee experience, cross company collaboration, productivity and employee well-being.
The question for HR leaders is: What are new job roles in HR that are on the horizon as A.I. becomes integrated into the workplace?
Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer: This job role is already being filled by Salesforce announcing its first Chief Ethical and Humane Officer this month. This new role will focus on developing strategies to use technology in an ethical and humane way. As practical uses of AI have exploded in recent years, we look for more companies to establish new jobs focusing on ethical uses of AI to ensure AI's trustworthiness, while also helping to diffuse fears about it.
A.I. Trainer: This role allows the existing knowledge you have about a job to be ready for A.I. to use.  Creating knowledge for an A.I. supported workplace requires individuals to tag or ""annotate"" discrete knowledge nuggets so the correct data is served up in a conversational interface. This role is increasingly important as the role of a recruiter is augmented by AI.
5. An Artificial Intelligence Ready Workforce Will Be Critical To An Organization's Future 
As as we head into 2019 — with AI moving from consumers' lives into the workplace – upskilling non-AI workers to learn how to work with AI is becoming increasingly important. Developing an AI ready workforce involves five key initiatives:

Identify the business problem to solve using artificial intelligence and start collecting data on the current state of the problem and the key KPI you want to impact with AI.
Build a cross functional team of key stakeholders to educate them on the business benefits of using AI to solve key business problems.
Implement learning opportunities for key job roles impacted in HR by AI (such as those in Recruiting, New Hire On-Boarding and Corporate Learning).
Identify new jobs and skills needed as AI is leveraged in the workplace.
Change performance management and development skills needed in HR roles to include a fundamental understanding of how to use artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle.

When AI is leveraged in the organization, employees will need training  on how to work with their AI team members. This will grow in importance, as Gartner predicts that by 2022 (just three years from now!) one in five workers engaged in non-routine tasks will rely on AI to do their jobs. 
 As employees depend on the insights of AI to do their jobs, developing an AI ready workforce will be a competitive advantage.
6. Skills-Based Hiring Gains Traction 
In 2018, Future Workplace hosted a skills based hiring Hackathon where we asked, why weren’t more companies adopting skills-based hiring to widen the talent pool? Skills-based hiring is defined as the practice of setting specific skills and competency requirements for a job rather than rely solely on candidates' credentials. Today, more FORTUNE 1000 firms are going on record hiring candidates without a college degree as a requirement.
Figure 4 lists fifteen of these companies below:








Figure 4
Glassdoor





Skills-based hiring may start by changing a job description and removing a degree requirement, but it requires shifting mindsets on where and how a company sources talent. What’s needed is to change the mindsets of hiring managers and business leaders to source in new ways.  These new ways to source non-traditional candidates range from Boot Camps, Coding schools, MOOC's, Technical high schools like P-TECH (a joint high school diploma and associate degree in STEM), Job training conducted at community centers, high schools, or even sponsor a company wide Hackathon. Regardless of your industry, adopting a skills-based hiring approach requires educating business stakeholders, identifying benefits & barriers of widening the talent pool, and developing a strategy for both skills-based hiring as well as educational and learning pathways to upskill a more diverse employee population.
7. Workers Will Trade Money For Meaning at Work 
The experience of meaningful work is a personal one, as Gallup reports we are working on average 47 hours per week with one in five working more than 60 hours each week. Increasingly workers are searching for meaningful work, a workplace that aligns to their values and a supportive and healthy work culture.
A recent report entitled  entitled Meaning and Purpose at Work surveyed 2,285 American professionals, across 26 industries to find out how important having meaning was at work.
In fact, workers said they’d be willing to forego 23% of their entire future lifetime earnings in order to have a job that was always meaningful to them. This means that building greater meaning at work is no longer a ""nice to have,"" but a business imperative. Employees who find meaning at work are happier, more productive and hard working, and are absent less.
On average, American workers who place a higher value on meaningful work are in a more senior position, and if they are working in a company that offers meaningful work they stay longer. Employees who find work highly meaningful are 69% less likely to plan on quitting their jobs within the next six months, and have job tenures that are 7.4 months longer on average than employees who find work lacking in meaning.
As the quest for meaning in the workplace grows, more HR leaders are putting a greater emphasis on communicating their company's culture and sharing their purpose and meaning across the employee population. This involves creating opportunities from training to mentoring and coaching to promote a shared vision and a healthy and supportive work culture.
8. Two Powerful Employee Perks Emerge: Access To Natural Light And Career Development 
The news headlines about which perks create a compelling employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day. ” However, a new survey by my firm, Future Workplace called “The Employee Experience” reveals employees crave something far more fundamental and essential to human needs. In a research poll of 1,614 North American employees, we found that access to natural light and views of the outdoors are the number one attribute of the workplace environment, outranking traditional benefits like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare (only 4-8% of FORTUNE 100 companies offer on-site child care).  A great example of this is The Spheres, an Amazon workspace in downtown Seattle that’s a curated jungle with over 40,000 plants. Amazon’s Spheres relies on the premise that natural light, plant life, and healthy activities reduce employee stress and improve job satisfaction more so than a standard office building. (Note that in contrast to many of its peers, Amazon has chosen to invest in Spheres rather than other office perks such as free lunches and snacks).
In addition to designing the physical environment to promote employee well-being, companies are also creating more opportunities for internal career mobility. With more than 7 million jobs unfilled, companies are recognizing the importance of creating internal mobility and job rotation programs to keep employees motivated and engaged. Both MasterCard and Intuit stress career planning and invest in internal career mobility and navigation. The Wall Street Journal reports each company is a leader in their industry in terms of profitability. 
 
9. Virtual Reality Is Transforming Corporate Training 
A growing number of heads of global learning & development are piloting Virtual Reality (VR) to train employees. And the most interesting use cases revolve around using virtual reality for compliance training. Verizon is using virtual reality to train store managers on protocol in case there is a store robbery. Lou Tedrick, VP-Global Learning & Development, Verizon, says, ""We've found that virtual reality is the best way to effectively replicate learning experiences that were previously challenging or impossible, such as our Retail Store Robbery. The feedback we've received from our participants in these difficult learning scenario trainings justifies the additional investment involved in VR over a more traditional instructional method.""
In addition to Verizon, MasterCard is using virtual reality to help employees improve their soft skills as well as train them on what to do in a crisis situation, such as an active shooter in the workplace or a building fire. Walmart is also using virtual reality to train 1 million associates across 4,700 stores in the U.S. on various aspects of store operations from taking care of produce to handling crowds on Black Friday.
Virtual reality training has clearly expanded from early use by the Arizona Cardinals who started using virtual reality headsets to prepare for games, to the design of virtual reality learning experiences. Derek Belch, founder of STRIVR, and Scott Schneider, CEO of HTXLabs, both see companies no longer asking ""What can I use AI for?"" but rather ""How can I widely deploy AI across the organization?""
10. HR Call To Action: Preparing For The Future of Work Is a Team Sport 
Deloitte Capital Trends  reports  a key challenge for business leaders is the need to work more closely together: acting as a symphony of experts playing in harmony.
But, three-quarters of those surveyed said C-level executives do not agree on common priorities or in concert. Often, the CHRO focuses on HR, CIO on IT issues, CFO on numbers, CMO on marketing  — and now new C-level players are appearing – Chief Digital Officer, and Chief Ethical Officer. As the pace of change accelerates, it is more important than ever for C-level executives to agree  on a shared vision in the age of AI.
 Preparing for the future of work is a team sport.
Sahil Sahni, Co-Founder of AllyO sees the importance of this in working with clients. Clients need to build cross-functional alignment between CHRO, CIO, CDO and CMO in order to agree on the business problem that needs to be solved and this is especially important in the age of artificial intelligence.

While the changes that AI could bring are not yet fully understood, we know it has the capacity to change work as the world knows it.
The impact of artificial intelligence in business contexts isn't always clear-cut or easy to understand. However, today's business leaders should know a few things in order to be conversant on the topic of artificial intelligence (AI). What's the basic premise of AI, and how does it work? How will AI impact jobs and workers? What skills will be needed in an automated workplace?
The Basics of Artificial Intelligence

Inclusive Design Is Something We Can't Live Without


AI is a term that encompasses multiple types of computerized programs. In fact, someone talking about AI can be discussing anything from facial recognition tools powered by neural networks to machine learning that predicts the best word to use in a subject line to improve email open rates. According to Talent Tech Labs, ""To be true AI, the technology must first learn from known inputs, then derive additional layers of abstraction to reach predictions that refines itself as the machine learns.""
 


There are a few key areas of artificial intelligence worth understanding that fall under that broader category. The two types of AI technology most applicable to the business field today include:
 

Machine Learning — a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It works by examining large volumes of data and uses patterns in that data to improve a program's understanding and resulting predictions. An example of this is your favorite video streaming service being able to predict what movies you will enjoy based on your previous views and activity. 
Natural Language Processing — technology that reads, understands and responds to conversational language. An example is a chat bot. It's valuable because it can extract data from ambiguous, unstructured data sets like conversations. Elements such as context and tone can also be interpreted by the computer. Common applications of this software today include translation and speech recognition.

 
The innovative algorithms that run these underlying technologies can be applied to numerous use cases, both consumer and business focused. These technologies could change the workplace as we know it.
How Artificial Intelligence in Business Affects Jobs
A LinkedIn article points out the highly dynamic nature of the U.S. jobs market: ""Finally, while 3.5 million jobs sound like a lot to lose, there are almost that many layoffs every two months in the United States, and another six million or so people voluntarily leaving their jobs. The American economy is both huge and dynamic; large numbers of jobs are lost all the time, and even more are created.""
 
There is no shortage of headlines about robots taking jobs. However, while there may be some jobs that are changed or eliminated, others will be created or enhanced. And while some of that creative destruction of jobs may be true, it's also true that history provides examples of how labor and work change when new technologies are introduced. 
 
Consider Google, Bing and other search engines. Prior to these tools being available, there was no way to easily find information on the internet. Today, these are essential technologies and new jobs have been created to support this shift. Search engine optimization has risen as a specific career discipline used to design more search-friendly websites, even though this job didn't even exist 20 years ago. 
We don't know how AI will ultimately impact all jobs, but it's logical to look at more routine jobs that can be mechanized as low-hanging fruit. This could mean anything from data analysis to manufacturing, but algorithms can target any task that is repetitive.
Skills That Matter in an Al-Driven Workplace
According to Pew Research Center, nearly two-thirds of Americans say computers will take over the work of humans, but paradoxically, 80 percent of Americans say it wouldn't affect their own jobs. People think their work is immune to this technological advance, but it simply can't be true that all jobs are going to remain unchanged by these new tools.
 
Hiring, engaging and retaining a skilled workforce is an essentially human process. While there is incredible value to having tools — whether artificially intelligent or not — involved in the workflow, there's also value to personal connection and the human touch. For example, when you have a problem with your power, cell service or home internet connection, would you rather be directed to an automated message or speak to a human?
 
The same is true for candidates and employees — they need human interaction, even if it's augmented by technology. Historically, changes in technologies lead to changes in skills and competencies. The following five skills could become increasingly valuable as more and more work is automated:

Dealing with ambiguity
Understanding the emotions of others
Leveraging credible expertise
Determining reliability of information sources
Influencing others

 
Overall, the important message to gather is this: while the changes that AI could bring are not yet fully understood, we know it has the capacity to change work as the world knows it. By understanding some of the areas of impact and ensuring the right skills are prioritized in your employees, you can maintain a proper balance of relying on machines and algorithms to handle some tasks while keeping the ""human"" element alive in your workforce.

Breaking the mould: Samira Korani on promoting Artificial Intelligence & Tech in Iran


 


Growing up in a country where traditional gender roles are still somewhat prevalent, Samira Korani, decided to break the mold of society’s standards and dive into a field of work no one considered she would. While Iran is seeing increasing numbers of women pursuing STEM fields, many women there continue to face the same challenges as their female counterparts around the world. Samira’s steadfast fixation on her dream, however, never left room for her to doubt her desire to help bring Iran into the future using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Discovering her passion
Growing up as the only daughter with four brothers, Samira easily differentiated herself from her traditional family. While her parents encouraged her to pursue the arts and possibly marry at a young age, she found herself drawn to math and science. She developed a passion that would ultimately serve as catalyst into her career in tech.
“When I grew up, I started believing that we can use technology to predict our society’s changes and learn about our country’s past.”
This revelation led Samira to text mining. After receiving her Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management and her Master’s degree Information Technology, Samira developed a better understanding of how text mining would be particularly helpful in Iran where the dominant language is Farsi.
Utilizing text mining with Farsi is particularly difficult due to the lack of text corpus, or large collections of electronic documents. A text corpus would serve as a primary source of data for research dealing with language, however, its limited supply makes it challenging to determine facts about Iran’s history.
Essentially text mining uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to derive quality information from written text and transform it into quantitative learning material. Using Python Samira is able to generate new information from documents that can be converted into data for analysis.
Unfortunately, in Samira’s experience, the Iranian government still adheres to traditional practices and is slower to adopt new technologies, such as AI for data analysis. However, she does not let that slow her down.
As an instructor at Iran’s leading institution for engineering and physical science disciplines, Sharif University, Samira connects with an open source community discussing the importance of artificial intelligence. She also strives to mentor young women to change the traditional societal expectations and encourages them to pursue their dreams.
“In my field, they try to ignore me and they told me I couldn’t be a coder, but I am a hard worker, and I had a dream to work with technology. The future of science is artificial intelligence because humans and technology integrate with each other. It took a lot of hard work and not being disappointed easily to do what I do, but I will continue reach my goal.”

When a country like the UAE becomes the only nation in the world to have established a dedicated ministry for Artificial Intelligence (AI), it sends out a strong indication of the government's confidence in technological advancements and their ability to become the catalyst that will transform the country.Taking this a step further, the UAE also launched its Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which plays a big role in the country's Centennial 2071 objectives and future vision for the country. It is no surprise that such emphasis has been placed on AI. Spearheading the fourth industrial revolution, it continues to be a game-changer and has the potential to significantly raise economic growth rates across the Middle East. In fact, according to a report by Accenture, AI will add $182 billion in annual gross value add to the UAE's economy by 2035.On a corporate level AI has the power to boost business operations, augment customer solutions, and strengthen growth strategies. As a result, many of the UAE's corporates have been quick to rely on the strategic advantages of AI solutions to boost employment and business profitability from AI integration into their organizational structure.



While this all seems very positive, there are underlying concerns and ongoing uncertainty around the future of employment and the role that AI has to play in this. With AI set to take over thousands of jobs not only in the region but across the world, many are asking the obvious questions of what this means for workers, and if workers are at risk of losing their job in the near future.The reality presents something altogether different and progressive. AI has the ability to free workers from mundane tasks. Intelligent Automation enables greater worker productivity and innovation which frees workers up for new job opportunities. Industry experts believe that the seamless integration of human intelligence with machine intelligence is the key to business success. However, this will require a new realm of workforce skills– one that focuses on enhancing human expertise in the more emotional but necessary realms of empathy, negotiation and creative thinking. These human attributes perfectly complement automated technologies to give businesses an all-round formula for success.


Corporations that wish to adopt AI often face resistance due to the unknown. Many feel that it may affect their role or the future success of the company. What they overlook is that this can usually be overcome by greater awareness and education on the associated benefits. Over two thirds of workers in the Middle East realize this and consider it important to develop their own skills to work with intelligent machines. While there is still some ground to cover, the UAE's workers are open-minded about adjusting their skills to meet the needs of the future workplace. What is needed is for corporates to ensure the implementation of a rock-solid AI strategy to maximize the opportunity it presents.Are the UAE's corporations ready for AI adoption?A recent report by the Dubai Technology Entrepreneurship Campus (Dtec) and startAD prepared in collaboration with ArabNet found that corporations in the UAE are still new to experimenting with AI implementation. However, there are some innovative companies who are going ahead with experimentation and implementation even though they may not have a strategy in place.Organizations that have yet to deploy a formal AI strategy usually fall into two categories. First, companies that do not have a formal strategy yet are implementing AI; and second, companies that are implementing AI solutions while simultaneously working on developing a formal strategy. When considering AI, organizations must assess the risk and the ROI of AI adoption through a cost-benefit analysis as well as creating clear direction and guidelines that take into account their value proposition. Of course they must ensure that a budget is set aside for proper AI adoption.


AI will provide ample opportunities in shaping the workforce of the future and there are many organizations that are set to welcome this change. With the UAE government introducing and supporting AI initiatives rigorously, corporations will be in the position to plan their strategic transitionary journey in line with new and upcoming technological advancements that benefit their business operations.

Aside from ongoing and upcoming launches for Novartis, the company's pharma president Paul Hudson is excited about a digital shakeup hitting the industry. (Novartis)
SAN FRANCISCO—Artificial intelligence is a big buzzword in R&D right now, but at Novartis, it's hard at work in the sales department, too.Amid far more meetings with digital companies at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this year, Novartis’ pharma CEO Paul Hudson said he expects 2019 to be the “beginning of the tech disruption” for pharma, in everything from marketing to supply chain.In past years at JPM, Hudson mainly checked out early-stage biotech companies for potential partnerships, he told FiercePharma. This year? It’s about half health-tech companies, he said.Obviously, Novartis is jumping right in, as part of CEO Vas Narasimhan's push to transform the entire company using digital tech. In the field, the drugmaker has equipped salespeople with an AI service that suggests doctors to visit and subjects to talk up during their meetings.The program's “virtual assistant” helps salespeople “plan better, move better and make sure when they show up to see a healthcare professional, they are talking about the things that the healthcare professional is absolutely interested in,” Hudson said.“When you turn up at the right time with the right things to say, they’re more interested and put more value in it, and our people like the fact that AI is running in the background helping them plan their day,"" he added.In the long run, the program will help the company become more efficient, Hudson said, also citing telemedicine and improved distribution systems as potential digital shakeups heading for the pharma industry.RELATED: Novartis wants more digital—and needs better compliance—and it's shuffling executives to do itUnder Narasimhan, Novartis has placed a big emphasis on digital. The company in 2017 appointed Bertrand Bodson as its first chief digital officer. In March, the drugmaker teamed with Pear Therapeutics to create software applications to treat patients with schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. The partners just launched an opioid addiction app this week.

Of course, Novartis isn’t alone in its digital quest. Pfizer, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline also appointed their first chief digital officers over the past couple years, signaling how the trend is taking hold at top drug companies.RELATED: Chief digital officers land at Big Pharma—cue tech transformations, test innovations, corner officesMerck appointed former Nike executive Jim Scholefield as its digital lead, while GSK tapped former Walmart executive Karenann Terrell as its chief digital and technology officer. For GSK’s consumer unit, the company picked up former Google and L’Oreal executive Marc Speichert. Pfizer, for its part, named former Quest Diagnostics executive Lidia Fonseca to serve as chief digital officer under new CEO Albert Bourla.Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify details of the AI service.

It’s a new day not very far in the future. You wake up; your wristwatch has recorded how long you’ve slept, and monitored your heartbeat and breathing. You drive to work; car sensors track your speed and braking. You pick up some breakfast on your way, paying electronically; the transaction and the calorie content of your meal are recorded. 
Then you have a car accident. You phone your insurance company. Your call is answered immediately. The voice on the other end knows your name and amiably chats to you about your pet cat and how your favourite football team did on the weekend. 
You’re talking to a chat-bot. The reason it “knows” so much about you is because the insurance company is using artificial intelligence to scrape information about you from social media. It knows a lot more besides, because you’ve agreed to let it monitor your personal devices in exchange for cheaper insurance premiums. 
This isn’t science fiction. More than three-quarters of insurance executives believe artificial intelligence will revolutionise the industry within a few years. By 2030, according to McKinsey futurists, artificial intelligence will mean your car and life insurance premiums could change based on whether you decide to take one route or another.
It will be sold to you on the promise of more personalised service, faster claims processing and lower premiums – and it will deliver on those promises, for the most part. 
But there are ethical risks too – data privacy and discrimination among them. An  insurance company might use your data to figure out how much you would be willing to pay for cover. It might sell the information to a third party. The AI might decide you pose a greater risk because of your age, sex, income or ethnicity.
The internet of things
Though the insurance industry in general has an unenviable reputation for taking people’s money then refusing to pay, it is a highly competitive sector. The less agile will probably not survive against competitors using AI to stay profitable while lowering their premiums.
To offer lower premiums, an insurer needs to know an individual is, in fact, a lower risk. The enabling technology is the internet of things, the  collective name for the billions of internet-connected sensors embedded in all manner of objects we use every day. They are in phones, watches, cars, fitness trackers, home assistants and many other things. Collectively they form an “ecosystem” of sensors. 
Data collected over time allow the insurer to make an individually tailored risk profile based on a person’s actual behaviour, a practice known as behavioural policy pricing. 
Getting ‘smart’
To lower your house and contents insurance, the insurance company will patch into the AI hub that runs your “smart home” through its ecosystem of sensors. 
If there is a pattern of burglaries in the neighbourhood, the home hub will know, because it is connected to the insurer’s network. Locks and alarms can be primed and police called at the first sign of trouble. To manage the risk of fire, sensors will monitor heat, humidity and detect smoke. If the stove gets left on, the home hub will turn it off before it becomes a problem. 
To calculate lower car insurance premiums, your insurance company may want to monitor the way you drive and maintain your car. 
Health insurance premiums may require giving the insurer access to your medical records and wearing a fitness tracker.

A new industry sector will emerge. Specialist companies that deploy IoT sensors and gather the data will partner with insurers to form a new business ecosystem. The whole industry will shift from purely reactive insurance to proactive, risk-minimising cover.
It all sounds quite positive. But there are also broader risks in the narrow pursuit of minimising insurance risk.

Discrimination
One very clear danger is the problem of profiling – being judged a higher or lower insurance risk because you belong to a particular demographic group.
AI can now differentiate risk into hundreds of factors. Algorithms scan these factors to identify clusters of previously unrecognised risk. They can also deduce clusters on their own. 
But these conclusions may unintentionally discriminate. There are already many examples where AI algorithms have inadvertently amplified stereotypes. 
The case of predictive policing in Durham, England, illustrates the problem. Police there developed an algorithm to better predict the risk posed by people charged with an offence should they be granted bail. What it did was discriminate against poorer people on the basis of where they lived. 
Opportunistic pricing
There is also the prospect of more individualised discrimination. 
Already quite well known is the problem of genetic discrimination – the risk of a health or life insurer increasing premiums or even denying cover for certain conditions based on what your DNA reveals about your genetic disposition to certain conditions.

      Australians can be denied life insurance based on genetic test results, and there is little protection




AI opens up a whole new area of personalised discrimination, based on what it can glean from your behaviours and preferences.
For one thing, the plethora of data potentially available to AI can tell an insurer a lot about your spending habits. Where do you shop? What do you buy? When do you spend? Do you seek out bargains or pay full price? 
Knowing all this will help an insurance company estimate if it can get away with charging you top price. 
Some in the industry argue that this is just how markets operate, but when it is facilitated by unprecedented access to personal information, it becomes a highly questionable practice.
Loss of privacy
An insurer might also be tempted to use the data for purposes other than assessing risk. Given its value, the data might be sold to third parties for various purposes to offset the cost of collecting it. Advertisers, marketers, lobbyists and political parties are all insatiably hungry for detailed demographic data.

      What are tech companies doing about ethical use of data? Not much




Contrary to what people might think, this data is not the property of the person it relates to. It is owned by whoever paid for it. Consumers must be legally protected against their data being used for other purposes without their informed consent. 
Managing risk
With any powerful new technology there are benefits and risks. The benefits should be made clear and the risks managed down to an acceptable level. There is of course irony in having to manage the risk of managing risk. 
Insurance companies have a job to do to ensure customers can trust there is far more upside than downside in AI. They will need to adopt transparently fair, if not benevolent, practices that contribute to the greater good. It has to be about more than profit.

Forty percent of the world’s jobs could be done by machines in as soon as 15 years, according to a top expert on artificial intelligence (AI).
Kai Fu Lee, a pioneer in AI who also works in venture capital in China, told “60 Minutes” that a wide range of blue-collar and some white-collar jobs will be overtaken by machines in the next two decades.
“AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue-collar work, but a lot of white-collar work,” Lee, who has worked for Apple and Google, told CBS. “Chauffeurs, truck drivers, anyone who does driving for a living — their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 25-year time frame.”
The venture capitalist, who wrote a book about AI last year, said in the show that “many jobs that seem a little bit complex – chef, waiter, a lot of things – will become automated.”
Although technologists and futurists have made similar predictions about when AI will start gobbling up jobs before, the truth is harder to pin down. Currently, most AI, which is what powers things like Apple’s Siri and Google Home, is focused on relatively narrow tasks. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would, in theory, be a machine or software program that could deftly handle highly complex tasks like writing novels or performing surgeries.

Pelley asked Lee what such a stunning technological development could do to society.
“Well, in some sense, there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technological revolutions,” Lee explained. “The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. We’ve gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.”
In China, 70 percent of the country’s population uses a smartphone for a range of routine practices and transactions, but Lee told Pelley that the US is still China’s main competitor when it comes to developing the full potential of AI.

The New York Times 


When Renée Bibby has a good hair day, people stop her on the street and tell her they love her short curly hair. On a bad hair day, though, “I look like a dandelion puff,” said Bibby, 41, a graphic designer in Tucson, Arizona.
Over the years, Bibby, who is of mixed-race descent and describes her hair as “coarse, but not black,” has spent hundreds of dollars trying products to maximize the good days and minimize the bad. Then, last year, she found a winner: a custom-made $25 conditioner from a startup called Prose. (She does not shampoo her hair.)
“The first day I used it, I got out of the shower and the curl was already in my hair,” said Bibby, who used to have to work to bring the curl back. “It’s probably taken 10 minutes off my routine.”

Prose, whose founders include a former L’Oréal vice president, uses a quiz, artificial intelligence algorithms and a 6,000-square-foot production space in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn to create what it hopes is each customer’s ideal product.

The company has shipped 110,000 bottles and will reach $1 million in monthly sales by its first birthday in January, and it is one of the biggest and most successful entrants in what has fast become one of the hottest spaces in the beauty industry: customizable hair care. On Monday the company announced that it had raised $18 million in new funding.
Another startup, the 4-year-old Function of Beauty, uses its own quiz and algorithms (along with a Willy Wonka-esque 50,000-square-foot factory of custom-built machines). It has sold 1 million bottles, according to Zahir Dossa, a trained computer scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the company’s chief executive. (Prices start at $36 for an 8-ounce set of shampoo and conditioner.)
There is more competition coming. Schwarzkopf, a global cosmetics giant, is conducting trials of custom products in Japan (with plans to bring them to the United States). Its system includes a hand-held device with an infrared sensor that can detect the hair’s molecular structure and analyze its moisture levels. An in-salon machine that looks like the world’s fanciest coffee maker whips up products in 50 seconds, along with a label printed with a bar code for reordering.
Unlike brands that offer different products for each hair “goal” (say, preserving color or thickening hair), companies that customize say they can combine ingredients that will fulfill all your hair needs in a single shampoo, conditioner or hair mask.
Prose also adjusts based on environmental factors, which it gleans from your ZIP code. For example, if it thinks you may be spending a lot of time in indoor heating because it’s cold outside, it adds corn derivatives that smooth and condition to fight static.
“We tackle all your problems,” said Arnaud Plas, the chief executive of Prose, sitting in the company’s SoHo conference room, which is decorated with illustrations of coconut, mint and other good-for-hair ingredients. “We’re not going to make you compromise.” (The company says it has tested which ingredients could cancel one another’s benefits.)
It’s probably not surprising that there are skeptics. Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is unconvinced that customizable shampoos and conditioners work much better than standard ones.
“There are some things we very clearly know can be drying, but then there’s a lot of stuff they use that has no evidence to back it up,” Senna said. “Whether it’s the hair holy grail comes down to perception.”
Unless patients have very oily hair or dandruff or a known sensitivity or allergy, she does not recommend specific products. She tells them that everyone is different, and they have to find one that works for them.
Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and a founder of thebeautybrains.com, a site where scientists examine product ingredients and industry claims, called customization “a marketing gimmick.”

“There is nothing measurably different about their formulas in terms of performance,” Romanowski said.
He has run blind home-use tests of the 10 top-selling shampoos and conditioners. Pantene turned out to make the best performing product.

Moreover, he found that expensive shampoos don’t work better than cheap ones, but expensive conditioners work better than really inexpensive ones, like V05 or Suave, he said. That’s because the pricey conditioners have more types of nourishing ingredients, which all work differently, and together are more effective.
Still, he said, “super-expensive ones aren’t better than Pantene.”
But this is where things get knotty. A major driver of whether a product works — or really, whether a customer thinks it does — is fragrance, which of course has no visible effect (unless you’re allergic to it). In its early days, Function of Beauty had to spend more time tweaking scents than algorithms.
“Man, people care a lot more about fragrance than I ever thought they would,” said Dossa, who, when he started the company, had a shaved head, but now has a man bun so he can test products. “Customers won’t properly assess your product if they’re not happy with the fragrance.”

Prose does not offer customers who want a moisturizing shampoo the option of choosing a citrus fragrance. Plas learned from his time at L’Oréal that customers will insist the product doesn’t work, because they associate that smell with grease removal. “Then we give them the exact same formula with a different scent, and they think it’s great,” he said, shaking his head.
Another thing customers can’t (yet) choose easily: to ban a particular ingredient because of allergies and sensitivities. (Function of Beauty is vegan and gluten free; Prose allows you to choose those options. Both allow you to avoid fragrance, but you have to contact customer service to ban a specific ingredient.)

Lacey Harris, 35, an athletic trainer in Lemoore, California, is allergic to coconut oil, an ingredient contained in her Function of Beauty products. She switched to Prose, which, purely by luck, didn’t add that to her shampoo and conditioner.
Harris said she could really tell how much volume and wave the Prose products added to her hair when she bought Dove, which she once used, to share with her husband on a backpacking trip.
“I couldn’t wait to get back to my custom shampoo,” she said.

Kate Saenko Works to Make Artificial Intelligence Intelligible


Kate Saenko, an associate professor of computer science, was spotlighted in a recent BU Research article discussing her work investigating how neural networks’ decision-making processes can be understood by and explained to humans. As artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in the lives of humans, its internal learning and reasoning processes need to become move understandable for humans. Saenko conducts experiments with both humans and computers to study how to best do this.

Manoj Saxena in conversation with Rob Wolcott, host of 3BillionSeconds. October, 2017, in Iceland.
Stevens/Wolcott, 3BS





In 1956, Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon infamously predicted, “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.” While Simon missed by over 40 years (and counting), Artificial Intelligence (AI) entrepreneur and investor Manoj Saxena believes this time is different. While hype obscures the near term, Saxena explains, “AI is not a 50-year trend. It’s a 500-year trend.”

Few have better perspective. In addition to leading early commercialization of IBM’s Watson from 2011 – 2014, Saxena has founded and scaled multiple AI-based companies and funds, including current venture Cognitive Scale.





In a wide-ranging conversation in Iceland in late 2017, Saxena and I parsed AI fiction from reality (see our interview here). We met thanks to Emmet B. Keeffe III’s Insight IGNITE, a digital acceleration program he founded as a partner at global venture firm Insight Venture Partners. Ignite convenes leaders from across the enterprise technology arena in compelling locations to explore the future.
PROMOTED
Beyond AI False Starts
According to Saxena, “We’ve had a few AI winters. Most of those were focused on modeling the world or modeling the mind.” Given our limited understanding of how human intelligence works, much less how we make sense of the world, such a broad objective as re-creating general intelligence contributed to hyperbole and disappointment.

Somewhere around 2016, he argues AI hit an inflection point. Saxena’s cites two reasons for optimism: the resurgence of ‘learning loops’ as fundamental for AI and the fact that AI has become practical for a rapidly expanding range of business and life decisions.
AI thrives when it’s not just relying on hard-coded instructions, as was typical of most GOFAI (good old fashioned AI), but when it can learn from interactions. The evolution of neural networks-- first demonstrated by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 but abandoned by most researchers until the 1980s-- machine and deep learning enables AI to advance in response to interactions.

Meanwhile, a torrent of venture funding over the past few years, including from Saxena’s own fund, The Entrepreneurs’ Fund, amplifies the search for practical applications. He advises, “A little AI goes a long way. Figure out how a business process works, then let’s apply AI.”
From Audacious Experiments To Practical Progress
Ironically, his practical advice—find tangible problems to tackle-- becomes more useful when researchers push the horizons of possibility. Audacious goals can catalyze progress.

Wolcott, 2018.




For example, IBM’s Jeopardy project was more than just a publicity stunt. From a research perspective, the challenges to demonstrate a working open-domain artificial intelligence system were enormous. On a recent visit to IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York, IBM’s head of Consulting Strategy and Cognitive Assets, Jesus Mantas, explained that winning the game show was about challenging what was possible. “After the research team’s success, IBM asked, ‘How do we apply Watson for business value?’” Saxena led this effort for IBM from 2011 – 2014, building initiatives in fields from healthcare to logistics.
Considering the next decade, Saxena envisions pivotal progress regarding one weak link of computational systems— humans. Our interfaces are notoriously slow. “The weakest link for AI is the last foot. It’s the 100k per second that you can feed your brain.” Solving the brain computer interface challenge transforms the potential for AI-enabled solutions. “The world is going to become our browser. We will become the cursor.”
AI Chuckies With Knives… And A Cambrian Explosion 
I’ve often been impressed by Saxena’s ability to synthesize historical and ethical insights with the practicalities of business and technology. Successful entrepreneurs and technologists act on practical insights, but too often lack a sense—or care— for how their actions might impact humans, society or humanity.

When I asked what most concerns him about the next decade in AI, Saxena opined about AI’s risks. “If we don’t design the systems properly or govern the systems with the right kill switch, you could have thousands of little Chuckies running around with knives in their hands,” in reference to the fictional slasher film character.

Saxena directly engages these issues. In addition to his personal attention, he recently endowed a faculty chair in responsible AI at his alma mater, Michigan State University’s Broad College of Business. In particular, he’s concerned about application and access. AI could end up “making the rich richer and… the evil more evil.”
Alloyed with wise concern, Saxena’s enthusiasm shines. Mixing two colossal metaphors, he predicts we’re witnessing “a Cambrian Explosion of innovation. Ten years from now, we will look back and say that we had a digital Florence movement. What Florence went through with the Renaissance.”
With Saxena’s metaphors as a guide, perhaps AI will be more than a 500-year phenomenon. With AI’s rapid advance, perhaps a few of us might remain cognizant enough to find out.

""More than electricity.""It's Different This TimeNew technology always renders some forms of labor obsolete. But displaced workers have historically had, in theory, the opportunity to pursue jobs the new industries technology created.But in his most recent book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,"" Lee argues that AI displacement will be fundamentally different.In a November interview with Futurism, Lee explained that AI will allow entire new industries to be built from the ground up with automation in mind — not only will AI prove cheaper than human employees, but many of the new jobs it creates will be automated as well.Time to PrepareLee told CBS that this wave of automation and worker displacement will happen much more quickly than others, such as the invention and distribution of the steam engine.Part of that is because AI algorithms can be shared around the world among developers and business leaders with little need for new infrastructure. No railroads or highways or power grids need to be built.What's left to be determined, Lee said, is whether the best moneymaking AI will come from America, which houses most of the top AI developers, or China, where smartphone apps like WeChat give businesses rich data on nearly all aspects of users' lives.READ MORE: Venture capitalist: AI will displace 40 percent of world's jobs in as soon as 15 years [CBS News]More on Kai-Fu Lee: To Bolster Cybersecurity, France Gives Google the GuillotineShare This Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}"

Content (Microsoft’s word, not mine) refers to the words, numbers, and other data in Office 2019 files. If Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) software can read your content, the thinking goes, Microsoft can improve your Office experience. Microsoft can deduce from your history with Office what you like and want to do next. To trust or not to trust Microsoft, that is the question. Some Office 2019 features run only if you trust Microsoft with your content:

Tell Me: In all Office applications, completes a task or suggests how to complete a task. Click “Tell Me What You Want to Do” on the menu bar.
Editor: In Word, identifies words that might be misunderstood and presents alternative words — like a high-powered spell checker.
Smart Lookup: In Word, opens a task pane with word definitions and links you can click to conduct research online. On the References tab, click the Smart Lookup button.
Translator: In Word, translates words and documents into English. On the Review tab, click the Translate button.
Dictate: In Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, takes dictation. Click the Dictate button.
Insights: In Excel, analyzes data on the fly. On the Insert tab, click the Insights button.
PowerPoint Designer: In PowerPoint, suggests designs that are appropriate for you based on your history with slide designs. On the Design tab, click the Design Ideas button.

Microsoft calls these Office features “intelligent services.” If you don’t trust Microsoft with your content and you try to use an intelligent service, you see the dialog box above. Click the Turn On button in this dialog box to trust Microsoft with your content.And what if you don’t trust Microsoft? Some people get squeamish when an artificial-intelligence robot peers over their shoulder. Some people get the willies knowing that their private data is available to a faceless corporate behemoth.Follow these steps to trust or not trust Microsoft with your Office 2019 content:

On the File tab in any Office application, choose Options.
The Options dialog box opens.
Select Trust Center on the left side of the dialog box.
Click the Trust Center Settings button.
Select Privacy Options on the left side of the dialog box.A list of privacy options appears. The first option is the one that matters where your content is concerned.
Select the first option (Get Designs, Information…) if you want Microsoft to be able to read data in your Office files.In other words, choose this option if you trust Microsoft.
Select the second option (Let Office connect…) if want Microsoft to be able to connect your files to Microsoft websites such as Bing and Bing Maps, and third-party websites such as Wikipedia.While you’re in the Trust Center, you can click the Read Our Privacy Statement link to open a web page that describes how Microsoft collects personal data and what the company does with this data. It makes for very dry reading.
Click OK in the Trust Center dialog box.
