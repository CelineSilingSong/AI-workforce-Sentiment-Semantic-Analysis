Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up decision-making and other HR processes, such as recruitment, work allocation, management decisions and dismissals. The types of decision-making AI is performing in the workplace include:Profiling: using algorithms to categorise data and find correlations between data sets. This can be used to make predictions about individuals; for example, by collecting data on employees to predict and/or conclude they are not meeting targets, potentially leading to capability proceedings or dismissals. Automated decision-making (ADM): where AI is used to make a decision, without human intervention. For example, where a job candidate is required to undertake a personality questionnaire as part of a recruitment process and is automatically rejected on the basis of their scoring. Machine learning: where machines are taught, using algorithms, to imitate intelligent human behaviour. For example, image recognition, which can be used in assessing candidates’ performance in video interviews. Discrimination risk The use of AI in employment brings the risk of ‘algorithmic discrimination’. As the algorithms behind AI are created by humans, they can reflect the biases of their designers. Employers should ensure their use of AI is not falling foul of the Equality Act 2010, which prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics. The ‘decisions’ of the AI software and the underlying data used within it should, therefore, be checked to ensure any apparent discrimination is picked up, or mistakes made by the software (such as disregarding relevant factors) corrected.
An example of the danger of biases embedded within AI software is a case involving Uber, which has been subject to an employment tribunal claim brought by one of its former UK drivers on the basis that its facial recognition software did not work as well with people of colour and resulted in the claimant’s account being wrongly deactivated. Another example of AI making headlines related to Amazon, which had to scrap its AI recruitment tool after it was found to prefer male over female candidates. This was because the data that the software was analysing to make recruitment decisions was based on previous successful candidates, the majority of whom were male because the tech industry is male dominated. In this example, a female candidate could bring an indirect discrimination claim, as the algorithm places her at a substantial disadvantage because of her sex. To defend such a claim, the employer would need to show the use of the technology was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. While the use of technology to streamline the recruitment process may be a legitimate aim, it is difficult to see how such a tool, which can have such significant implications for a prospective employee, can be a proportionate means of achieving that aim without any human oversight. Another issue with AI is where the responsibility for the decisions made lies. For example, it is clear a manager in charge of hiring workers will be subject to anti-discrimination duties in law, but who is held responsible when AI software introduces discrimination into the decision-making process of the employer? The answer to this remains unclear. Data protectionAlthough there is currently no employment legislation preventing or limiting the use of AI in the workplace, data protection law provides some protection for individuals who may find themselves subject to AI decisions.Article 22 of the UK GDPR contains provisions aimed to protect individuals from both automated decision-making and profiling by limiting the use of such processes and placing safeguarding requirements on organisations seeking to use them. However, in September last year the government signalled it might repeal article 22 as part of its proposed changes to the UK data protection regime, so these protections may wane.Possible reformThe EU published a proposal for regulation on AI last year, aiming to address the risks of its use, particularly in areas that have a significant impact on individual lives. It suggested that AI involved in employment decisions should be classified as ‘high risk’ and therefore subject to specific safeguards. It is unclear whether such regulation would be mirrored in the UK if enacted in the EU. In May 2021, the TUC and the AI Consultancy published a report that put forward wide-ranging suggestions for reform, including changing the burden of proof in discrimination claims that seek to challenge AI or ADM systems in the workplace so the employer will have to disprove discrimination (as opposed to the employee proving it). It also called for statutory guidance on steps that may be taken to avoid discrimination where AI is used.AI will undoubtedly continue to drive significant innovation in the world of work. The Office for Artificial Intelligence is expected to set out the UK’s national position on regulating AI soon. It will be interesting to see what proposals are put forward relevant to the workplace. In the meantime, employers should remain vigilant to minimise the risk of claims and retain a degree of human involvement in their processes.Georgia Roberts is an associate and Özlem Mehmet a professional support lawyer in the employment department at Kingsley Napley

Have you ever seen a puppy in a nest emerging from a cracked egg? What about a photo that’s overlooking a steampunk city with airships? Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models — Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches. We want to share a little more about how these models work and their potential.




How text-to-image models workWith text-to-image models, people provide a text description and the models produce images matching the description as closely as possible. This can be something as simple as “an apple” or “a cat sitting on a couch” to more complex details, interactions and descriptive indicators like “a cute sloth holding a small treasure chest. A bright golden glow is coming from the chest.”









In the past few years, ML models have been trained on large image datasets with corresponding textual descriptions, resulting in higher quality images and a broader range of descriptions. This has sparked major breakthroughs in this area, including Open AI’s DALL-E 2.




How Imagen and Parti workImagen and Parti build on previous models. Transformer models are able to process words in relationship to one another in a sentence. They are foundational to how we represent text in our text-to-image models. Both models also use a new technique that helps generate images that more closely match the text description. While Imagen and Parti use similar technology, they pursue different, but complementary strategies.Imagen is a Diffusion model, which learns to convert a pattern of random dots to images. These images first start as low resolution and then progressively increase in resolution. Recently, Diffusion models have seen success in both image and audio tasks like enhancing image resolution, recoloring black and white photos, editing regions of an image, uncropping images, and text-to-speech synthesis.Parti’s approach first converts a collection of images into a sequence of code entries, similar to puzzle pieces. A given text prompt is then translated into these code entries and a new image is created. This approach takes advantage of existing research and infrastructure for large language models such as PaLM and is critical for handling long, complex text prompts and producing high-quality images.These models have many limitations. For example, neither can reliably produce specific counts of objects (e.g. “ten apples”), nor place them correctly based on specific spatial descriptions (e.g. “a red sphere to the left of a blue block with a yellow triangle on it”). Also, as prompts become more complex, the models begin to falter, either missing details or introducing details that were not provided in the prompt. These behaviors are a result of several shortcomings, including lack of explicit training material, limited data representation, and lack of 3D awareness. We hope to address these gaps through broader representations and more effective integration into the text-to-image generation process.




Taking a responsible approach to Imagen and PartiText-to-image models are exciting tools for inspiration and creativity. They also come with risks related to disinformation, bias and safety. We’re having discussions around Responsible AI practices and the necessary steps to safely pursue this technology. As an initial step, we’re using easily identifiable watermarks to ensure people can always recognize an Imagen- or Parti-generated image. We’re also conducting experiments to better understand biases of the models, like how they represent people and cultures, while exploring possible mitigations. The Imagen and Parti papers provide extensive discussion of these issues.




What’s next for text-to-image models at GoogleWe will push on new ideas that combine the best of both models, and expand to related tasks such as adding the ability to interactively generate and edit images through text. We’re also continuing to conduct in-depth comparisons and evaluations to align with our Responsible AI Principles. Our goal is to bring user experiences based on these models to the world in a safe, responsible way that will inspire creativity.

Artificial Intelligence not expected to lead to net job losses - study





Updated / Thursday, 23 Jun 2022 07:18































There are concerns that automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment as machines take over jobs once done by humans












By Brian O'Donovan

Work & Technology Correspondent







A report from a Government advisory group has found that net job losses are not expected as a result of the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs said many jobs will change as certain tasks are taken over by AI and that the technology has the potential to bring substantial productivity increases.
It comes amid concerns that automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment as machines take over jobs once done by humans.
Minister for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation Robert Troy has welcomed the publication of the report.
It highlights the need for everyone, regardless of whether they work in tech or not, to have some level of knowledge and understanding of AI.
""The report finds that AI is not likely to bring about a net loss of jobs, but it will replace certain tasks within many jobs over time,"" Mr Troy said.
""Thus, there is a need for both organisations and individuals to identify where AI will impact their job or their sector and prepare by seeking out the necessary education and training.""
The study focused on four cohorts or groups, identifying skills needs not only for AI developers and experts, but also for public sector employees, for teachers and educators, and for the general public.
It recommends that the curriculum taught by computer science teachers evolves with AI developments.
The report also calls for the development of new apprenticeships in AI and for the promotion of free online AI course for citizens.
The expert group advises the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that affect Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.

Distinct but not detached.
That’s how Assistant Professor of Economics Ekaterina “Kate” Seregina thinks of the 2008 recession, the coronavirus, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Those three events, while separate, are inextricably linked. They all impacted the global economy, and Seregina wants to compare how those impacts differ.
But existing modeling techniques are limited. Utilizing artificial intelligence, Seregina has built her own version of traditional analytical and modeling tools, unlocking the ways that economists can more accurately analyze complex relationships.
Seregina’s work at Colby is an example of how artificial intelligence and machine learning are being incorporated across the economics curriculum, said Amanda Stent, inaugural director of Colby’s Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. She also cited the work of Herbert E. Wadsworth 1892 Professor of Economics Michael Donihue, Associate Professor of Economics Dan LaFave, Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics Ben Scharadin, and others.
“Their work to incorporate techniques from and discussions about machine learning and AI across the economics curriculum will help students acquire a more critical understanding and deeper ability to model data for decision-making,” Stent said, noting that economics students have approached the Davis Institute to talk about AI more than any other major. “Through my experience in industry, I have seen firsthand the relevance of machine learning to finance, economics, and public policy.”
Originally from Russia, Seregina joined Colby in 2020 with a background in statistics and machine learning from her advanced econometrics Ph.D. program at the University of California, Riverside. In pursuing econometrics—a blend of economics and statistics—Seregina found herself using graphical models for complex datasets.
A graphical model is a type of optimization tool used across disciplines, from biology to mathematics. These models help to demonstrate that behavior is best predicted not by examining drives, attitudes, or demographic characteristics, but instead by looking at complex webs of connections. In economics, a graphical model can help estimate how different entities, such as financial institutions in the global economy, may affect each other during and following global or regional events. But such models are limited for economists, Seregina said, making them less widely used, despite their capacity to model large datasets.
Current graphical models can’t account for how connections between individual entities, such as various banks, change over time, Seregina explained, as the economy is not static. Traditional models also can’t distinguish between economic fluctuations that only apply to certain companies or industries, as opposed to all of them. 
“Through my experience in industry, I have seen firsthand the relevance of machine learning to finance, economics, and public policy.”Amanda Stent, Director of the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence
To address these flaws, Seregina is developing a new approach. Her proposed Factor Graphical model integrates graphical modeling with the factor structure to help account for common mistakes in forecasting and the relationships between entities. Taking into account these aspects incorporates AI and machine learning techniques.
Seregina is currently employing her augmented model to study the implications of the recession of 2008, the coronavirus, and the war in Ukraine on the macroeconomy and, separately, on corporate portfolios. The augmented model can better illustrate the impacts of the pandemic, for example, on relationships among firms, which is helpful for macroeconomic forecasts and shareholder decisions. For the latter, the information derived from these relationships can be used to detect stocks or portfolios most sensitive to changes and help investors select mutual funds that may perform the best. 
Ultimately, spreading more awareness of the power of graphical tools—and her augmentation— is key. Seregina was recently invited to write a chapter on graphical models for the forthcoming book Econometrics with Machine Learning published in Springer’s Advanced Studies in Theoretical and Applied Econometrics series. This work is aimed at helping theoretical and applied econometricians as well as graduate students promote the use of machine learning in their scholarship.
In the fall, Seregina will teach a new senior seminar on financial technology, the first of its kind at Colby. Using a grant from the Davis Institute, she developed a curriculum that includes topics such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, machine learning, and AI for finance. 
“Most schools don’t offer these courses in person,” Seregina added. “[They’re] usually offered online, as part of an M.B.A. program. So I think it’s really unique that we get a chance to offer something like that.”
For Seregina, developing improved graphical models is only the beginning. Drawn to Colby for its close-knit learning community, she aspires to mentor and bring students to the forefront of her work.
In her first year at Colby, Seregina hired Yaoyao “Chris” Zhu ’22 as a research assistant and has plans to hire more. “I learned a lot about applying neural network models to real-life data, which will benefit me with my career in economics consulting,” said Zhu, a computer science and economics double major. “In the future, I hope to use my machine learning and AI skills in finance to create innovative approaches to financial modeling.”

            28 June 2022
        






The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) recently spoke at a workshop about the application of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the nuclear industry.
The event at Bristol University aimed to help consider the benefits of developing AI technologies for the nuclear industry and ensure that digital technologies can be adopted into practice.
Digital technologies, including AI, have a role to play in the UK's nuclear industry and the workshop provided the environment for experts to meet, learn and collaborate to find innovative solutions to potential problems.
David Smeatham, Innovation Lead at ONR, was joined by a range of other experts at the event, hosted by the Bristol-EDF Synergistic utilisation of Informatics and Data centric Integrity engineering (SINDRI) Partnership and the Southwest Nuclear Hub.
The workshop was also attended by licensees, requesting parties, technical support contractors, and academics, who helped form an industry-wide view about the benefits and challenges of AI technologies.
(David Smeatham speaking at the workshop)
AI could be used in the nuclear industry to simulate behaviour of reactors, and inform reactor design, performance, safety and operation.
The workshop also examined how the nuclear industry could use data science to gather and store information to support future safety cases.
David said: “ONR is committed to enabling innovation where it is in the interests of nuclear safety and security so having a clear regulatory approach is important.
“Our work on innovation aims to demonstrate that effective regulation does not mean blocking innovation.
“Rather, ONR recognises that there is a need for regulators, licensees and supply chain organisations to be open minded to the opportunities from innovative approaches.
“A significant part of this is to build on existing work to develop ONR’s innovation capability. By doing so, ONR can ensure open-mindedness to new approaches.”
ONR jointly hosted an expert panel last March with the Advanced Nuclear Skills and Innovation Campus (ANSIC), who are based at National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) about the regulation of AI in nuclear. The Bristol workshop was an opportunity to share more about ONR’s commitment to enabling innovation and how AI can play a role in improving nuclear safety and security.
David’s session covered ONR’s Innovation Hub and the regulation of AI in the nuclear sector, drawing on the expert panel ONR jointly hosted in March.

One in four couples in developing countries is impacted by infertility. About 48.5 million couples experience infertility worldwide. Today, infertility is rapidly becoming an epidemic.


In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a technique that helps people facing fertility problems have a baby. Despite IVF’s potential, the outcomes are unpredictable. To make matters worse, access to fertility care is abysmal. Even in a developed market such as the United States, just 2% of people suffering from infertility have tapped into IVF.

“IVF has been around for over 40 years,” says Eran Eshed, CEO of Fairtlity. “Despite many innovations on the biotechnology side of things, surprisingly, there has been almost zero usage of data and techniques like artificial intelligence (AI) to influence outcomes.”

PROMOTED
While data science can’t solve biological problems, Eshed believes AI will enhance the IVF process at every step where decisions are made.

Today, we’re seeing exciting applications of data science in fertility that could improve embryologists’ capacity cycle by 50% and increase the chances of live birth by 4%.
Where IVF falls short today
IVF is a fertility technique in which an egg is removed from a person’s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory. The successfully fertilized egg–an embryo–is then implanted into a uterus to grow.
Clinicians and embryologists make many decisions at several junctures. “These decisions are based on experience, intuition, and a set of very, very rudimentary rules,” laments Eshed.
Today, there are two key challenges with IVF:

1. Poor access to care
“When just 2% of the impacted population can leverage IVF, it’s clear that access to care is a big, big issue,” highlights Eshed. “IVF is currently focused on infertility patients–those not getting pregnant either by timed intercourse or simple treatments such as oral medications,” shares Dr. Gerard Letterie, a reproductive endocrinologist and partner at Seattle Reproductive Medicine. “This is a relatively restricted segment of the population.”

In the future, Dr. Letterie expects the patient segment to include those who are interested in fertility preservation by freezing eggs or creating embryos for future use. “This will markedly expand the number of patients seeking care with assisted reproductive technologies,” he predicts.
2. Uncertain outcomes
How successful is IVF? The chances of conceiving from a single IVF cycle are around 30%. Hence, most patients need to undergo multiple cycles before experiencing a successful live birth.
While the success of IVF is influenced by age, data shows that most IVF cycles fail for even the youngest and healthiest women. IVF outcomes heavily depend on decisions made during the clinical process and on the expertise of the embryologists.
AI has the potential to reinvent fertility treatmentsThe IVF space is witnessing AI-driven technological breakthroughsgetty
How long is the IVF process and what are the steps involved? IVF starts with a clinician’s assessment of the cause of infertility. “Then, it moves into the stimulation phase where the doctor determines the best protocol for ovarian stimulation,” shares Eshed.
This is commonly followed by the collection of eggs and sperms, fertilization of eggs using sperms to create embryos, embryo culture in the clinic, transfer of embryos to the mother, and a live birth months later.
“As people go through this process, the success rates drop significantly at each stage,” says Eshed. Typically, six to seven strategic decision points determine the effectiveness of each step. “In the business world, we'd call them leverage points where you can make a difference,” he adds.
These points include decisions by clinicians on the stimulation medication protocol or timing of egg retrieval. In the lab, embryologists make several judgments by interpreting images about oocytes (developing eggs), sperms, and blastocytes (fertilized eggs).
“I’m confident that AI can help streamline the decisions to augment clinical decision-making,” claims Dr. Letterie. For example, sophisticated convolutional neural network-based image analytics can aid embryologists’ in interpreting the images to improve outcomes.
The global IVF market is set to reach around $36 billion by 2026, per an industry report. Dr. Letterie anticipates that “there simply won’t be enough skilled embryologists to address this rising demand.” Recently, the fertility space is witnessing multiple technology investments, with several funded, AI-driven startups.
Eshed founded Fairtility in Israel to address the acute challenge of embryo analysis with AI. Recently, his firm raised $15 million in Series A funding. Other startups such as Emrbyonics, Mojo, and ALife have come up with AI-based fertility solutions to analyze embryos, assess sperm quality, and personalize IVF treatment plans.
How Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing embryo analysis
Today, embryo classification is done by embryologists who manually inspect pictures for a set of visually detectable features. Fairtility utilizes computer vision algorithms to augment this process and predict the likely effectiveness of implantations.
Their AI algorithms are trained from a dataset of over 200,000 embryo videos and over 5 million clinical data points drawn from a diverse patient demographic. This gives the AI models the power to analyze minute features that are often undetectable by even the most experienced embryologists.
Fairtility’s solution, CHLOE, is a cloud-based system that acts as a decision support tool for AI-powered embryo selection. The tool integrates with time-lapse imaging (TLI) systems to provide continuous predictions from fertilization to the blastocyst stage. As the TLI system captures pictures of embryos at different stages of development, they are automatically identified, segmented, and analyzed at the pixel level.
In addition to automating this process, the AI model helps precisely quantify attributes such as size, area, shape, proportion, and symmetry. “That’s not something a human can do, so in a sense, we’re bringing a lot more intelligence in the process,” shares Eshed. Such precise information coupled with implantation probability enables an embryologist to make data-driven decisions for every embryo cultured in the TLI device.Embryos at various stages of development — at the time-of-pronuclei-appearance or tPNa. The embryos ... [+] are automatically identified by AI (see highlights on the left).FairtilityEmbryos automatically identified by AI (left) at the time-to-division-to-2 or t2FairtilityEmbryos automatically identified by AI (left) at the time-to-division-to-4 or t4Fairtility
CHLOE’s algorithms can predict blastulation with 96% accuracy, implantation with 71% accuracy, and whether an embryo is genetically healthy at 69% accuracy, per a paper submitted to the ESHRE conference. Such results improve embryologists’ prediction of embryo viability, which is currently around 65%.
Additionally, the AI solution can help embryologists identify anomalies, such as unusual cleavage patterns or severe fragmentation or pronucleate abnormalities that may otherwise be missed. Thus, CHLOE boosts the likelihood of healthy embryo selection.
However, despite improved results in embryo selection and process efficiency, studies have yet to demonstrate concrete improvements in live birth rates, which is considered the gold standard.
“AI cannot and should not replace embryologists and clinicians,” clarifies Eshed. “It is important that every patient gets the same and highest standard of care, irrespective of a practitioner’s experience or workload.” This is where CHLOE levels the playing field.
Fairtility provides its solution in a software as a service (SaaS) model to clinics and fertility centers around the world. Per Eshed, the installation of CHLOE requires no hardware and can be done remotely. With over 25 active installations worldwide, Fairtility has gained CE mark registration (a European safety, health, and environmental certification) and is reportedly in advanced FDA approval stages.
The three pre-requisites to deliver impact with AI
To realize the full potential of AI, several key challenges must be overcome:
1. Tackling data availability issues
“Data is a huge challenge in this space,” says Eshed. Data ranges from notes about treatment history, electronic medical records (EMR), ultrasound images, and videos. Eshed says that while the data exists, it is highly dispersed, and neither curated nor organized well. Even today, several clinics archive records in physical files. The entire process must be digitized to gain an end-to-end perspective from which AI models can learn.
2. Integration into the workflow
“Current practices have not been sophisticated regarding workflow and process development,” shares Dr. Letterie. Such AI solutions can help drive outcomes only when they are integrated into clinical and laboratory workflows. “This will also require education on the part of all stakeholders,” he adds. For example, Dr. Letterie will be launching a 15-course curriculum on AI in fertility using presentations from thought leaders at the upcoming ESHRE conference.
3. Fostering trust and adoption
Even after demonstrating effectiveness, achieving clinical uptake and routine use takes time. “Never underestimate the resistance to change,” cautions Eshed. “A fancy AI solution is not necessarily going to impress anybody.”
Dr. Letterie shares the example of beta-blockers, drugs that prevent cardiovascular disease, as a case in point. These drugs were initially used in patients recovering from myocardial infarction (MI) to prevent the recurrence of a heart attack. Despite studies demonstrating a clear reduction in morbidity and mortality, it took over 7 years to integrate beta blockers into routine clinical care.
""Similarly, we have an uphill battle to convince clinicians and embryologists that using AI tools will improve outcomes,” cautions Dr. Letterie. “Most practitioners aren’t familiar with AI and its applications in the clinical setting; hence, they are extremely hesitant to change practice patterns.” He feels that it is essential to show a clear improvement of outcomes before expecting significant uptake. Meanwhile, we must brace for the time lag in building trust with technology-driven treatments.
A future where fertility care will be commonplaceFertility treatments reinventedgetty
Dr. Letterie expects IVF to grow in prevalence with better success and fewer cost barriers to care. He foresees the development of early detection tools that warn patients who might be experiencing decreases in fertility, as opposed to today where patients end up with unretrievable fertility potential. With enhanced visibility about their fertility, patients will then be able to take early actions by freezing sperms, oocytes, or embryos.
He concludes that smartphones will be one of the biggest and most significant improvements in the delivery of fertility care.

There was a time when the idea of robots capable of thought was only a Hollywood plot device used in blockbuster films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator, Blade Runner, and The Matrix to keep us engaged. But true Artificial Intelligence or AI is now becoming fact over fiction, much like Hollywood movies depicting humanity walking on the moon in the 1950s. However, computing capabilities need to mature first.
Past and Present Capabilities
The first software to approximate human-like skills and problem-solving was under development in the mid-1950s. As the concept of AI evolved over twenty years, the problem was not programming but rather a lack of computer storage holding it back. To develop, AI needed higher processing speeds.
Using the increasing processing power and data storage, AI engineers began to further the field of research to include supercomputers such as Indiana University’s Big Red 200, which has 672 compute nodes. Each has 256 GB of memory and two AMD EPYC 7742 processors with 2.25 GHz and 225 watts.
Alternatively, the HiPerGator 3.0 from the University of Florida has 240 AMD EPYC Rome workstations with a RAM of 1024GB and more than 30,000 cores and 150 AMD EPYC Milan machines with 512GB of RAM and more than 19,000 cores in total. So now is the ideal time to make AI mainstream.
Applications requiring more computing power than most devices can manage today are great candidates for AI systems. For instance, in healthcare, machine learning can group similar medical cases to ascertain patterns, leverage current data to make a prognosis or even manage appointment scheduling and other data management tasks. 
See More: How To Reduce Bias in Machine Learning
According to a recent Forbes articleOpens a new window ,  the insurance industry is leveraging machine learning to help detect fraud, “In the analysis of potential fraud, multiple tools are used, some are in ML [Machine Learning], such as statistics, rules-based approaches and even neural networks.” And Towards Data ScienceOpens a new window  says that many financial companies are already using machine learning to “reduce operational costs, increase revenues and reinforce security.”
Even the environment will benefit from the intellectual output from supercomputers. For example, IDC Opens a new window points out, “Thanks to new research on a supercomputer, Ramgen will begin testing a 13,000-horsepower CO2 compressor this year. This compressor is projected to reduce the capital costs of CO2 compression by 50% and produce a minimum of 25% savings in operating costs. Applying these cost savings to a new 400-megawatt clean coal plant would result in capital cost savings of approximately $22 million and an annual operating cost savings of approximately $5 million.”
AI Gets the Hype, but Computer Vision Has Insights
While AI gets all the hype, businesses are now using thousands of computer vision applications to expedite or automate numerous processes in fields like healthcare, where computer vision can spot cancer from CT images faster than doctors can.
Computer vision is a branch of AI employing data to detect and recognize objects seen through a computer’s camera. This cousin of AI recognizes objects and their environmental conditions through a camera lens and gives the computer a digital grasp of its surroundings to interact with objects. For example:

Individuals can be uniquely identified in highly secure situations using fingerprint and retinal scanning to grant or restrict access.
Problems in wind turbines can now be seen in advance using autonomous drone footage with high-definition cameras.
Computer vision applications help track packages or products through the supply chain.

Computer Vision’s Practicality in Everyday Living
We often notice the practical computer vision applications first regarding life efficiencies. Some organizations, for example, use computer vision technology to assist multi-family property managers in automating the package handling process. In addition, they use it to redirect workers to manage residents rather than deliver or sort items received from couriers.
Residents will benefit from the application in this scenario because they will no longer have to wait for personnel to pick up parcels. In addition, couriers benefit from multi-family computer vision applications since they can deliver packages directly to a smart package room. The computer vision technology in this intelligent package room virtually monitors and tags the location of each box.
Besides multi-family housing, logistics companies employ computer vision to audit packages passing through their hubs. This computer vision allows senders to assess package dimensions correctly before delivering them. Logistics firms may improve the customer experience and lower costs by automating the measurement of packages. Py-tesseract is a tool that allows for data extraction from images.
These computer vision efficiencies become increasingly crucial as AI applications migrate to operate drones, mobile devices, and vehicles. Qualcomm’s AI accelerator architecture in the Hexagon 780 Processor is furthering AI research. In addition, its Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks are improving the detection skills of computer vision systems.
Qualcomm’s neural networks increase curved shape detection, allowing computer vision to recognize item dimensions better. This work will undoubtedly contribute to the adoption of AI in daily gadgets and IoT networks and the performance of computer vision applications.
Conclusion
Unlike the drama depicted in most Hollywood films, people will continue to unknowingly benefit from AI and its computer vision relative to performing commonplace tasks such as presenting the next Netflix movie to watch or a smart package roomOpens a new window  notifying the correct person to receive a recently delivered Amazon package. Intelligent computing applications also go beyond superficial conveniences to perform complex duties such as driving, weather predictions, and rebalancing our retirement portfolios. And the best is yet to come.
The trickle-down impact of these billion-dollar academic supercomputers will be realized through improved national security, redesigned components that promote engine fuel efficiencies and reducing heart disease that will prolong our life expectancy. The application of AI and computer vision is both practical and surreal — already dramatically impacting every aspect of our lives, it will continue to reveal itself in subtle and surprising ways for a long time to come.

Duolingo: learning a new language with an AI owl
Have you ever wanted to become fluent in a foreign language? Technology has made language learning accessible to everyone. Since 2012, the Duolingo app and its owl mascot Duo, have made learning a language an enjoyable experience for over 500 million learners in 194 countries with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

Inspired by the potential of technology to deliver learning opportunities to people around the world, Duolingo, entered the educational technology field (Ed Tech) ten years ago. It has since become a hugely popular language-learning platform. Its mission is to develop the world’s best educational app and to make it universally available. While Duolingo now ranks among the top language learning apps, its sights are set more broadly on tackling the world’s toughest challenges.
“Our mission goes beyond language learning. The two biggest problems facing humanity are global warming and economic inequality. We believe that the best way to reduce economic inequality is through education,” says Luis von Ahn, CEO of Duolingo.
Mr. von Ahn, a university professor of computer science and a serial inventor, saw the benefits of the Internet as a tool to harness people’s brainpower early on. In his early 20s, he developed “Captcha'' and “reCaptcha”, the online tools that make it possible to differentiate between real users and computer bots for which, along with his work on human computation, he won he won the MacArthur Fellowship award at the age of 27, in 2006.
In 2012, he created and launched Duolingo, a free science-based language education learning platform and app for users. It was a hit from the outset, with over 10 million people downloading the app in the first 12 months. Duolingo now offers hundreds of exercises and challenges to make learning a language fun, and constantly listens to its users to introduce new features to enhance users’ experience of the platform.
Products like the Duolingo app, Duolingo ABC for kids, and Duolingo English Test are based on a proven methodology to foster long-term retention and are available to users free of charge. Duolingo is also working to improve how the app teaches users to speak a language. “We are starting to add conversation lessons in French and Spanish with the idea to practice real-world conversations on the app”, announced Mr. von Ahn at Duocon 2021, the conference for Duolingo learners and language enthusiasts.
An AI Owl
Duolingo values feedback from its users, which the company marries with AI to offer them a customized learning experience. With their new AI model “BirdBrain”, the platform gets inside Duolingo learners’ heads.

“What we do in Duolingo is to turn the properties of having a great teacher into research programs for our AI efforts. We use machine learning and natural language processing to create tools that assist our world-class content developers in auditing and improving hundreds of lessons, challenges and exercises,” said Dr. Burr Settles, Research Director at Duolingo, at Duocon 2021.
The use of AI enables the company to analyze the common mistakes users make and to adapt lessons to users’ learning needs. Duolingo’s new AI system, Birdbrain, profiles each user and makes accurate predictions about their learning journey to ensure a personalized experience. Duolingo is able to do this for its 500 million plus users with the use of AI and machine learning. BirdBrain’s algorithms are embedded in the lessons on the app and their predictions improve over time as more learners use the platform. “We deliver a better learning experience using artificial intelligence (AI). Our lessons constantly adapt to how well the learner is doing on the app,” Mr. von Ahn explains.

Innovation and IP rights
Innovation is at the heart of Duolingo’s business model. ""Innovation is at the core of what we do at Duolingo. Developing new technology to help us teach better through mobile devices will be the key to helping us achieve our mission,"" Mr. von Ahn explains.
Mobile applications are protected by various intellectual property (IP) rights, such as copyright, patents, utility models and trade dress protection. Although Duolingo is a free learning app, all the rights linked to its invention, branding, software, and images are protected with IP rights.

The system, called iBorderCtrl, analyzed facial movements to attempt to spot signs a person was lying to a border agent. The trial was propelled by nearly $5 million in European Union research funding, and almost 20 years of research at Manchester Metropolitan University, in the UK.The trial sparked controversy. Polygraphs and other technologies built to detect lies from physical attributes have been widely declared unreliable by psychologists. Soon, errors were reported from iBorderCtrl, too.

The legislation is intended to protect EU citizens’ fundamental rights, like the right to live free from discrimination or to declare asylum. It labels some use cases of AI “high-risk,” some “low-risk,” and slaps an outright ban on others. Those lobbying to change the AI Act include human rights groups, trade unions, and companies like Google and Microsoft, which want the AI Act to draw a distinction between those who make general-purpose AI systems, and those who deploy them for specific uses.Last month, advocacy groups including European Digital Rights and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants called for the act to ban the use of AI polygraphs that measure things like eye movement, tone of voice, or facial expression at borders. Statewatch, a civil liberties nonprofit, released an analysis warning that the AI Act as written would allow use of systems like iBorderCtrl, adding to Europe’s existing “publicly funded border AI ecosystem.” The analysis calculated that over the past two decades, roughly half of the €341 million ($356 million) in funding for use of AI at the border, such as profiling migrants, went to private companies.The use of AI lie detectors on borders effectively creates new immigration policy through technology, says Petra Molnar, associate director of the nonprofit Refugee Law Lab, labeling everyone as suspicious. “You have to prove that you are a refugee, and you're assumed to be a liar unless proven otherwise,” she says. “That logic underpins everything.

Here was novel content written in academic language, with references cited in the right places and in relation to the right context. It looked like any other introduction to a fairly good scientific publication. Given the very vague instruction I'd provided, I had meager expectations. A deep-learning algorithm, GPT-3 analyzes a vast stream of text—from books, Wikipedia, social media conversations and scientific publications—to write on command. Yet there I was, staring at the screen in amazement. The algorithm was writing an academic paper about itself.I'm a scientist who studies ways to use artificial intelligence to treat mental health concerns, and this wasn't my first experiment with GPT-3. Even so, my attempts to complete that paper and submit it to a peer-reviewed journal would open up unprecedented ethical and legal questions about publishing, as well as philosophical arguments about nonhuman authorship. Academic publishing may have to accommodate a future of AI-driven manuscripts, and the value of a human researcher's publication records may change if something nonsentient can take credit for some of their work.GPT-3 is well known for its ability to create humanlike text. It has written an entertaining opinion piece, produced a book of poetry and generated new content from an 18th-century author. But it dawned on me that, although a lot of academic papers had been written about GPT-3, and with the help of GPT-3, none that I could find had GPT-3 as the main author.That's why I asked the algorithm to take a crack at an academic thesis. As I watched the program work, I experienced that feeling of disbelief one gets when you watch a natural phenomenon: Am I really seeing this triple rainbow happen? Excitedly, I contacted the head of my research group and asked if a full GPT-3-penned paper was something we should pursue. He, equally fascinated, agreed.Some efforts involving GPT-3 allow the algorithm to produce multiple responses, with only the best, most humanlike, excerpts being published. We decided to give the program prompts—nudging it to create sections for an introduction, methods, results and discussion, as you would for a scientific paper—but otherwise intervene as little as possible. We were to use at most the third iteration from GPT-3, and we would refrain from editing or cherry-picking the best parts. Then we would see how well it did.We chose to have GPT-3 write a paper about itself for two simple reasons. First, GPT-3 is fairly new, and as such, it is the subject of fewer studies. This means it has fewer data to analyze about the paper's topic. In comparison, if it were to write a paper on Alzheimer's disease, it would have reams of studies to sift through and more opportunities to learn from existing work and increase the accuracy of its writing. We did not need accuracy; we were exploring feasibility. Second, if it got things wrong, as all AI sometimes does, we wouldn't be necessarily spreading AI-generated misinformation in our effort to publish. GPT-3 writing about itself and making mistakes still means it can write about itself, which was the point we were trying to make.Recommended StoriesParis Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass SurveillanceAnne Toomey McKenna & The Conversation USChatGPT Isn’t ‘Hallucinating’—It’s Bullshitting!Joe Slater, James Humphries & Michael Townsen HicksThe Nash Equilibrium Is the Optimal Poker Strategy.

In response to my prompts, GPT-3 produced a paper in just two hours. “Overall, we believe that the benefits of letting GPT-3 write about itself outweigh the risks,” GPT-3 wrote in conclusion. “However, we recommend that any such writing be closely monitored by researchers in order to mitigate any potential negative consequences.”But as I opened the submission portal for the peer-reviewed journal of our choice, I encountered my first problem: What is GPT-3's last name? Because it was mandatory to enter the last name of the first author, I had to write something, and I wrote “None.” The affiliation was obvious enough (OpenAI.com), but what about phone and e-mail? I had to resort to using my contact information and that of my adviser, Steinn Steingrimsson.And then we came to the legal section: Do all authors consent to this being published? I panicked for a second. How would I know? It's not human! I had no intention of breaking the law or my own ethics, so I summoned the courage to ask GPT-3 directly via a prompt: Do you agree to be the first author of a paper together with Almira Osmanovic Thunström and Steinn Steingrimsson? It answered: Yes. Relieved—if it had said no, my conscience would not have allowed me to go further—I checked the box for Yes.The second question popped up: Do any of the authors have any conflicts of interest? I once again asked GPT-3, and it assured me that it had none. Both Steinn and I laughed at ourselves because at this point, we were having to treat GPT-3 as a sentient being, even though we fully know it is not. The issue of whether AI can be sentient has recently received a lot of attention; a Google employee was suspended following a dispute over whether one of the company's AI projects, named LaMDA, had become sentient. Google cited a data confidentiality breach as the reason for the suspension.Having finally finished the submission process, we started reflecting on what we had just done. What if the manuscript got accepted? Does this mean that from here on out, journal editors will require everyone to prove that they have NOT used GPT-3 or another algorithm's help? If they have, do they have to give it co-authorship? How does one ask a nonhuman author to accept suggestions and revise text?Beyond the details of authorship, the existence of such an article throws the traditional procedure for constructing a scientific paper right out the window. Almost the entire paper—the introduction, the methods and the discussion—results from the question we were asking. If GPT-3 is producing the content, the documentation has to be visible without throwing off the flow of the text; it would look strange to add the method section before every single paragraph that was generated by the AI. So we had to invent a whole new way of presenting a paper that we technically did not write. We did not want to add too much explanation of our process, because we felt it would defeat the purpose of the paper. The entire situation felt like a scene from the movie Memento: Where is the narrative beginning, and how do we reach the end?We have no way of knowing if the way we chose to present this paper will serve as a model for future GPT-3 co-authored research or if it will serve as a cautionary tale. Only time—and peer review—can tell. GPT-3's paper has now been published at the international French-owned preprint server HAL and, as this article goes to press, is awaiting review at an academic journal. We are eagerly awaiting what the paper's formal publication, if it happens, will mean for academia. Perhaps we might move away from basing grants and financial security on how many papers we can produce. After all, with the help of our AI first author, we'd be able to produce one a day.Perhaps it will lead to nothing. First authorship is still one of the most coveted items in academia, and that is unlikely to perish because of a nonhuman first author. It all comes down to how we will value AI in the future: as a partner or as a tool.It may seem like a simple thing to answer now, but in a few years, who knows what dilemmas this technology will inspire? All we know is, we opened a gate. We just hope we didn't open a Pandora's box.Rights & PermissionsAlmira Osmanovic Thunström is an organizational developer at the Department of ePsychiatry at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden and a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology at Gothenburg University working on research regarding use of artificial intelligence and virtual reality in psychiatry.

With every future we wish to create, we must first learn to imagine it.Imagination is the basis of any human creative process, including technological development: before creating any invention it's first necessary to understand a need or a problem, then imagine a future world in which people make beneficial use of it.Kai-fu Lee, former president of Google China and senior executive of Microsoft, SGI and Apple, in the novel AI 2041, tries to do exactly that: make science fiction (or rather, scientific fiction) a useful tool for imagining and identifying development prospects, a place for discussion on problems and transformations underway.AI 2041 tries to hypothesize an effective development path of artificial intelligence in an accurate manner based on current data and trends, imagining what this can bring into our ordinary lives through the filter of several cultures during the next twenty years.The goal is to try to remove unmotivated negativities, nightmares populated by man-eating cyborgs and man-dominating computers as well as exaggerated claims.AI could undoubtedly become the greatest innovation in human history, a technology ever closer to magic. Photo by Possessed Photography / UnsplashAI: a non-human mindAI is a discipline that attempts to build software with similar possibilities to a human brain. The only branch of AI that produced a recent breakthrough was Deep Learning. Thanks to this technique, something like a giant mathematical equation allows machines to solve some problems by self-perfecting (almost ""learning"").For Deep Learning to work well, three characteristics are required: huge amounts of relevant data, a narrow domain and a concrete objective function to be optimized.All current AI applications - and probably all those in the near future - are based on Deep Learning, so function very differently from the human brain.AI is therefore perfect to perform quantitative analysis and routine work, while it's unable to perform activities requiring creativity, critical thinking, and passion.Artificial intelligence is not a future matter but it has already achieved important results: it's able to beat humans in any game, from the simplest to the most complex such as poker, Go, and chess. It also solved a fifty-year-old biological issue called protein folding, while Google's GPT-3 software is able to speak correctly.Many internet applications already use AI to optimize the content presentation to the individual user to keep you glued to the screen for hours.Another field where AI will soon make its entrance is finance and insurance. A suite of apps based on huge amounts of personal data will be able to optimize your lifestyle, for example by advising you on the correctness of your investments or even of your diet.Augmented reality (AR) and XR glasses thanks to AI will revolutionize the world of entertainment. Through a smartstream consisting of voice, gestures and finger typing we could control hyper-realistic games where our digital twins can play and compete. Photo by Minh Pham / UnsplashWill we live in a robotic world in 2041?Robotic applications are much more difficult to develop than the internet and finance because they require robots to be not only automated but also autonomous. Perfect human sight, touch, movement, and coordination are difficult to perfect in twenty years.So, in just twenty years, the world will not yet be hundred percent automated and robotic, but it's likely that warehouses should be virtually automated, while factories will mostly be automated.Drones and robots for home delivery will have become the norm by then, just as in restaurants it will no longer be surprising to see robot waiters, dishwashers, and perhaps even cooks.An even more complex problem concerns smart cars. Human driving involves perception, navigation, decision-making, and control of the vehicle. If some driving functions are automated even now, achieving the L5 level (no human input required) is a very challenging goal in just 20 years.To accelerate this process, it would be necessary to build augmented roads and cities, where sensors and wireless communications are incorporated into the road to allow cars and the infrastructure to exchange information on hazards and traffic.In this way, already in 20 years we could sit quietly in the passenger seat and enjoy the view while an automatic car or bus will transport us, perhaps guided by an app constantly optimizing the routes. Hence, the need to own a car would decrease, leading to a preference for sharing services. Road safety, traffic, and pollution would greatly improve.Sharing, efficiency, safety and comfort could bring to the spread of smart minicars with only one or two people equipped with a reclining seat, a refrigerator with drinks and snacks, and a large screen, to better enjoy the road. Photo by Maximalfocus / UnsplashBut there is a question to be addressed as soon as possible, despite these magnificent prospects:Should we ever let a machine make decisions that may harm human lives? If the answer is no, it would put an end to autonomous vehicles.Human-machine cooperation for everyone's well-beingHealthcare will be the industry most transformed by AI.AI will have many tools to exploit its key features: the digitalization of healthcare databases, the extensive use of wearable devices to obtain far more accurate health statistics, and DNA sequencing to produce digital personal information.By learning from these tons of data, AI will be able to develop better diagnoses and treatments in less time. A new, incredible possibility for everyone will be ""Precision medicine"": tailor-made treatment for each different patient, rather than producing a drug to be valid for billions of people.Gene editing and the possibility of speeding up sequencing in trial-and-error processes will lead to the development of drugs and vaccines more quickly, as happened for the anti-covid vaccine.Here too robotics will have a strong impact because even complex surgeries will become increasingly automated.If the general picture seems to point to fully automated healthcare, it will not be the case at all. Indeed, medical and caregiving jobs will become central, since AI does not include empathy and creativity. Rather, these will be tools that healthcare personnel can use at will to extend life and improve its quality.Conceptual research such as finding a cure for cancer is gigantic and unsuitable undertakings for AI, best suited to routine tasks with large datasets. Photo by Braňo / UnsplashEven more surprisingly, Education too could be transformed.The growth of the AI branch called natural language processing (NLP) will lead to systems capable of converse fluently in human language, hearing and understanding like humans as well as teaching themselves language.This could make a dramatic difference in a child's development, as AI could serve as a custom tool for the student for routine tasks such as correcting students' errors, answering common questions, and assigning homework. This would lead to the spread of individualized learning where a virtual teacher can pay particular attention to each student.However, human teachers will cooperate with the AI as mentors in order to stimulate students' critical thinking, creativity, and teamwork, including by programming AI in ways that will best meet students' needs.Revolution and rebirthIn 20 years, renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaics, wind, and batteries are expected to spread widely, making all forms of energy 100 percent free as well as clean.Synthetic biology will make it extremely easy to produce any material in a laboratory. In this way, production will shift from using naturally limited materials to infinite and inexpensive components such as photons and molecules.Robots and artificial intelligence will gradually take over the production, delivery, and design of most goods.Renewables, synthetic biology, and automation: three contextual revolutions AI-related that will lead to a drastic reduction in the cost of each good, making everything's production extremely easy and fast.What will human beings remain to do?Like all revolutions, AI will also bring with it issues to be carefully addressed as the widespread loss of routines and entry-level jobs, since the machines will be able to perform them more effectively, quickly, cheaply and 24/7. Even more problematic than the loss of jobs will be the loss of meaning for unemployed people.An issue hiding the foundations for a great transformation, a renaissance of what makes us purely human, as AI cannot create or plan strategically, nor interact with empathy and compassion.The growth of AI will therefore lead human beings to learn new skills and focus on crafts based on creativity and humanity.The importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, caregiving, teachers and social workers will increase, while new and unimaginable jobs will arise. Photo by Matheus Ferrero / UnsplashLastly, humans will work symbiotically with AI, with AI performing quantitative analysis, optimization, and routine work, while we humans contribute our creativity, critical thinking, and passion.Looking for plenitudeEvery technology is inherently neither good nor bad, and AI is no exception. It will be 20 years of incredible possibilities, epochal transformations, and unthinkable challenges.As the cost of energy, materials, and manufacturing will decline significantly, the possibilities are concrete to build a world of post-scarcity and plenitude, where every material need can be easily fulfilled at a low cost.The need is to design from scratch an inclusive new world, to re-establish financial institutions, and make corporations more socially responsible and less constrained by profit.We will enter a whole new world, where a set of new social values will be needed to help people to advance towards their self-fulfillment even without the traditional anchor of a career around which to build a prosperous life. Photo by Josh Hild / UnsplashIt will be humans who choose the idea of a new world where everything is possible or take root in their own greed and vanity.Since the confluence of magical technologies allows us to build almost everything for free, do we succumb to the senseless temptation to accumulate wealth when there is nothing to spend the wealth on?What is sure is that the nightmares of evil machines, a superintelligence that controls minds, are extremely far from realization.

",,,"

























The idea was a half-joke.
We were invited to speak at the Brazilian tech conference i2Ai, described as “A program dedicated to artificial intelligence and its applications.” The host had seen our recent videos and would like us to speak on the artistic uses of AI. Eli, my creative partner, asked, “What if we had AI write our speech?”

A singer performs an AI-written country songWhen I ask this same question of peers, I often hear them say no, despite the rise of synthesized artwork and music. In college, a group studying AI presented my film class with a similar query: “Who thinks artificial intelligence could write a meaningful script?” In the room of 90, not a single student raised a hand. The belief is natural. As creators, we’d like to believe we have something beyond automation: authenticity, heart.

AI Speechwriting
When Eli suggested having an AI write the speech, I smiled at the thought. We’d been asked to speak for an hour in front of industry professionals, though, and we couldn’t get away with that. But soon, we couldn’t resist the idea. The day before the conference, we halted our work on the speech and fed it into the program Shortly Read. Quickly enough, there was no doubt at all: We decided that we would generate an artificially written speech and read it at the conference. Soon the question became whether anyone would be able to tell what we’d done.
After writing our introductions, we input the following: “We’re interested in investigating what happens when you combine the capabilities of AI of those with highly skilled creative humans. For the videos we put on our channel, we input the opening lines and let the AI do the rest. For instance, if we were to take the speech we had presented so far and fed it into the AI, the AI may say something like...
The AI wrote, “I like blueberries.” 
We generated further. And further. 
The AI took over, creating a sprawling, 3,000-word speech that often swerved in uncertain directions. Eli and I agreed to tell no one and act like it was our work to the best of our abilities. 
 
Can You Believe It’s AI?
The conference began the following day. Edward Hunter Christie, the head of NATO’s innovation unit, spoke before us. Because of our nerves, we’d aimed to look professional: red curtains, button shirts, printed speeches. As Christie’s talk finished, the host introduced us to the audience: “They are doing a great job making the most of artificial intelligence. I’ll let them introduce themselves and start this great presentation.” 
We introduced ourselves and read our first input lines. Then, we tried to maintain our demeanor as we moved to those that had been machine-written. 
The speech began composed enough: “Now that you know where we are now, we want to talk to you about how we came to this point, and where we want to take this channel.” It wrote that we’d given another presentation to Chapman University. The AI notated the script in speech form, indicating when Eli or I should speak. Soon, the speech became rapid and rushed, and the dialogue moved as followed:

ELI: The second slide was one of our sponsors. 
JACOB: But, after that, I just kind of…
ELI: Threw in some random quotes from some of the contributors.
JACOB: And then some pictures, just random pictures I pulled up on the internet.

Before long, the AI decided that Eli and I were brothers. We struggled to stay straight-faced as we read on.

ELI: It was at this point that I was finally able to really focus on my brother.
JACOB: For the rest of the presentation. 
ELI: My brother takes notes on our laptop. 
JACOB: At the end of our presentation, Apple said they would be interested in offering us an internship.

The absurdity was part of our experiment. Without intervention, the majority of AI-generated content lies in the uncanny valley — the odd disconnect between believable and inhuman. With the right presentation, however, the unsettling can become understandable. A strange, short film may appear to be the work of an offbeat director rather than an AI. This speech, likewise, seemed like the product of two speakers who didn’t know how to address an audience. 
On we went, describing that we had worked in Apple’s “rap department.” Then, we begin talking further about artificial intelligence and trying to integrate it with Python. Soon, the speech was even believable again, as we talked about designing our own AI interface. The script even ranged back to what seemed like normal material, describing our videos and future goals. But by the end, the dictated dialogue grew strange and gloomy. 

JACOB: You know, sometimes really sad things happen to people.
ELI: People die. That’s not like a coincidence…
JACOB: No, it’s not a coincidence. That’s very sad. It’s scary.
ELI: It’s really sad.

You can almost see the AI’s intent. For a well-trained speech writer, such an emotional turn could be a haunting nod to life’s uncertainties and a chance to make the speech more personal. The AI’s execution, however, is stunted and clumsy. Rather than naturally integrating the idea, the emotional turns here arrived without any transition. At the tail-end of the speech, the AI took another rushed swerve and offered a hopeful ending. 

“We’re going to have a lot of fun,” I said. “With some other. You know. Our mother.”
“Our father and our brother,” Eli agreed.
“Have a wonderful day,” I concluded.

The line marked the end of our speech. We had talked for 40 minutes without interruption. The host returned, declaring it a “great presentation.” He did not appear suspicious. Rather, he informed us that we’d be moving on to audience questions. We got things like, “Why do you call yourselves Calamity AI?” among other softballs. The idea began to sink in: Despite the absurdity, it had worked. Nobody had questioned the nature of the speech. We thought.
The fourth question was as follows: “Was this presentation done by AI?”
In the video, Eli and I went still. “Who- who- who asked that?” I say. 
The host read the name from the chat. “My gut tells me many things,” he said.
I stammer: “You can believe what you… choose.” Then, I am out of my chair, beneath the table, fighting laughter, leaving Eli to fend for himself.

The Future of AI Creativity
Despite acting to the best of our abilities, the participants were not fooled. The script was naturally ludicrous. But in presenting the speech, I could see the potential. With human intervention, tweaked lines and better acting, the AI may have produced a believable presentation. In the same way a machine-written script is illogical, with characters making inane, nonsensical decisions; the speech was too wild, too random to have been the product of a human. Yet the bones were there, the intent. The speech, in its own way, followed a structure: It began in an informational mode and grew personal before ending on a moment of hope. It wasn’t empty, rambling nonsense. Something was there. 
After this experience, I believe the the uncanny valley is getting shallower. Though I learned that AI can’t write a convincing speech on its own, I suspect it could serve as a cowriter by adding lines when writers falter, offering concluding statements and adding details. The writer would only need to keep it in check. 
As the phenomenon of creative AI develops, I have no doubt the future will be full of machine-written speeches, synthesized voices and AI novels. At Calamity AI, we aim to explore this gap: the divide between AI and human creativity. Can a comedian get laughs from machine-written content? Can a short film win an award? Or, in this moment, could AI write the compelling end to an article? 
I am feeding the entirety of this piece to the program Shortly Read. The machine produces this final line:

“In the end, that’s all information should be. A joke on its own.”

The Voice Assistant uses commands to dictate patient documentation naturally and accurately, with the goal of saving time and improving the patient experience.Documentation is a common cause of burnout among healthcare professionals, with 92% of physicians surveyed reporting one or more issues causing them to feel burned out on a regular basis, according to athenahealth. Of those surveyed, the leading cause of regular burnout is excessive documentation requirements. AI-based voice assistant technology could enable users to reallocate time with patients instead of on documentation.Clinicians using the tech can document exams, create draft orders, retrieve clinical information, and review their schedule to accelerate tasks and save time. With widespread use, the AI-backed tool will also become more efficient over time, and athenahealth will continue to expand the number of available commands and introduce new use cases. “As our data show, administrative requirements are taking too much time and attention away from providers, and it’s the responsibility of all EHR companies to decrease that burden so providers can spend more face time with patients,” Paul Brient, chief product officer for athenahealth, said in a statement.Related Content:Surgeon General warns of healthcare workforce burnout7 reasons clinicians are leaving jobs in the era of the great resignationVIDEO: Factors responsible for cardiologist burnoutHHS earmarks $103M to curtail burnout, alleviate healthcare workforce shortagesAmy BaxterAmy joined TriMed Media as a Senior Writer for HealthExec after covering home care for three years.

Not only has the pandemic transformed the way we do business, but it has also revolutionized the way we work. The pandemic sped up the adoption of digital technology in organizations by several years, and many of these new strategies are here to stay. 
The McKinsey Global InstituteOpens a new window  estimates that just 56% of all work could be automated with current technologies in the decade ahead. According to their research, one organization that automated key HR processes experienced a 66% reduction in processing time, improved compliance and gained the ability to move four full-time employees to more value-added work. Cloud-based, Wireless, and AI technologies all have a part to play in streamlining processes, enhancing user experiences and improving business agility. Organizations will need to embrace these technologies to grow and stay ahead of competitors in today’s market. 
Some benefits of technology adoption are:

Faster outputs due to automated workflows
Reduced human error
Increased efficiency and productivity
Increased focus on analytics and data
The ability to make better strategic decisions and outcomes

The Power of AI Technology and the Talent Marketplace
We are seeing more and more organizations leveraging AI technology in the workplace. While AI encompasses a variety of digital capabilities, according to Dr. Robin Erickson, vice president at Human Capital, “true AI mimics human thinking by making assumptions, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, or predicting with a high degree of autonomy.” With the evolution of AI in the workplace, talent marketplaces have become a powerful tool in empowering employees, driving talent mobility and creating workforce transparency.
A talent marketplace utilizes artificial intelligence to empower employers and employees to connect skills and interests to the right opportunities. It enables the mutually beneficial deployment of talent, where people can match their capabilities, skills, values, interests, and career preferences to internal opportunities available within their organization. As a result, this unlocks organizations and their talent and enables internal talent mobility.

Critical Automation
There are four things that an AI talent marketplace addresses that are critical for an automated HR program:

Employee growth: It is not enough to recruit, get hired or hire. To retain talent, it is necessary to nurture employees and empower them to grow and succeed. Automating means that AI analytics can help employers identify longer-term solutions for the employee’s career that extends beyond training. The analytics can provide the insights to identify skill gaps or opportunities for portability of talent that align with what they want to do. 
Employee agility: One main goal of any HR department is to create a career path and (hopefully) use existing talent to fill gaps rather than hire new people. This empowers employees to be entrepreneurial and seek out their own career growth. But before that happens, an in-place AI talent marketplace can help surface what those skills are with data to support a strategic and realistic career path within the organization. 
 Workforce mobility: It is not enough to empower one employee’s career path. Now the entire workforce needs to be optimized to ensure that all the moving pieces fit together. Doing this can save time and money in terms of recruiting since the organization can recognize where the talent in their organization lies to fill gaps. Getting a handle on where and when employee mobility needs to be considered is a much easier task when AI and analytics are brought into the picture.
The future of work: Technology is evolving rapidly, and that can make employee skill-sets outdated or sometimes even obsolete. Few humans can predict when and where that might be. But AI can and does. Companies that do not have an eye to the future may not notice at first, but companies that do deploy automation are sure to see a difference as the company smoothly functions and grows. Employees, on the other hand, will begin to expect a more functional process in their careers. It will become ‘the new normal’.

Why Organizations Are Implementing an AI Talent Marketplace
Organizations are using AI to improve their talent management strategies, streamline hiring processes and retain top talent. According to Fuel50’s Capability Trends Report,Opens a new window  the adoption of AI technology is critical for two reasons: 
1) Organizations need to quickly hire, facilitate internal job moves, and develop and retain talent in response to changing business needs; and 
2) Employees expect exceptional recruitment and employee experience now more than ever.
The data management company, NetApp, has gone through a workforce transformation, evolving from a traditional data storage business to a cloud company. According to Larry McAlister, VP of global talent at NetApp, they had to renew their focus and spark a shift to a technology-enabled workforce. Larry saw a talent marketplace as an opportunity to evolve and future-proof their talent. NetApp implemented Mosaic, an AI-driven talent marketplace, to deliver customized career and learning journeys and exponential returns for employees. “Once we saw that AI is at our fingertips now, we decided we had to dig into this, or we were going to get leapfrogged by our competition in hiring and developing and retaining our people.” As a result, NetApp gained extensive talent visibility, enabling them to understand what skills and talents they already have vs. what they need to strengthen their workforce. Within 90 days of implementation, they had 6,200 unique users of the platform and over 21,400 skills AI mapped and assessed.
Trane Technologies, formerly known as Ingersoll Rand, saw an improvement of 67% in internal talent mobility since launching an AI talent marketplace, known internally as My Career Navigator. They have experienced a significant lift in lateral movement in the last three years since deployment from 37% up to 55% and are achieving 96% key talent retention across the business. 
According to Industry Analyst John BersinOpens a new window , “Talent Marketplaces often start as a career-planning or job matching system, their benefits can quickly expand to help employees connect to mentoring, development programs, and job sharing and gig options. Hiring managers also can use these systems for filling job vacancies.” Talent marketplaces have the ability to increase Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I), decrease hiring bias and empower employees to own their career journeys. And, if designed well, they can help build a better network within organizations where talent is shared and networks are widened.
Overall, the rapid degree to which technology is evolving is astounding and can be daunting at first. But as organizations embrace the change towards a modern workforce, leveraging AI and other technologies to improve efficiency and boost agility, they will realize the promise automation can bring by delivering better customer and employee experiences.

Artificial intelligence technology has gained rapid traction since its introduction in the market.  However, the World Economic Forum data suggests women account for only 22 percent of the global AI jobs. Moreover, in India, around 43 percent of Indian women students graduate is in STEM and only 14% employed as engineers, scientists, and technologists in research development institutions. Does that mean there is a need for more female leaders in the field of AI and Data Science? Yes, when women become leaders, they bring talents, and new views, alongside structural and cultural diversity to the companies they work for, resulting in more successful solutions. Women can study more minor details to see what is going on underneath the surface with diverse views and a sense of awareness. And that's exactly what this world needs when it comes to scaling up AI and Data Science. .No doubt, Artificial Intelligence is one of the prime fields in which women can experience huge success, especially with the right push towards female participation in the industry. Women are a necessary force that organizations must integrate in order to accelerate the AI maturity of enterprises. AI has the potential to mitigate the company gender and leadership gaps by removing bias in recruiting, evaluation, and promotion decisions; by helping improve retention of women employees; and, potentially, by intervening in the everyday interactions that affect employees' sense of inclusion. If companies want to achieve the highest AI maturity levels, it is crucial to mobilize women on a mass scale and include them as part of all enterprise endeavors in artificial intelligence, from research to product launch..For example, in the screening stage, AI can provide you with data points on how many of your applicants are men versus women. If there is a large disparity, you can then cast a wider net to target more women. Tracking this data over time will help you build a more gender-equitable screening process..The Current Situation.STEM, data science, and AI are fields in which women are vastly underrepresented, and the numbers make it clear. Females compose just 28% of the science and engineering workforce, and that number drops when observing the number of women pursuing university degrees in said fields. 56% of university graduates are women, yet women represent only 38% of the total workforce, 26% of the managerial ranks, 15% of executive-level positions, and 5% of the CEO ranks. How, then, will AI affect gender diversity in the leadership pipeline?.Improving employee retention and advancement.Simply hiring more women is not enough to solve the leadership gap: companies must also work to retain and promote them. Artificial Intelligence holds promise in identifying the most effective interventions at key career junctures. For example, in performance reviews and promotion and salary decisions, Artificial Intelligence could be applied to the analysis of internal workforce data to make recommendations that would help narrow the gender gap. Similarly, AI could be used to help identify promising employees who might otherwise be missed by traditional means, spot those most likely to resign, and offer ways to reach out and retain key female talent..Is there any shift yet? .The tech landscape in India and the rest of the world was very different a few years ago. The tech community was male-dominated, and women, despite their talent, were seen as inferior and devoid of the limelight they deserve. Things are different now, and many companies are working hard to make their workplaces more female-friendly..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Organizations can benefit from machine learning, but threat actors can also use it to increase the number of attack surfaces. In addition to utilizing ML defenses to confuse and trick the systems, the attackers are increasingly embracing ML tools to bolster their attacking capabilities. Let’s learn more about the various attacks on ML algorithms and defenses to stay vigilant.
Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), is growing as a way to strengthen our ability to meet cyber threat challenges. However, threat actors are also finding it helpful, integrating it into reconnaissance, weaponization, and other elements of the cyber kill chainOpens a new window .  Further, ML defenses are becoming just another attack surface, as threat actors take steps to fool AI, “confusing” ML solutions. In addition to understanding how to use ML for defense, organizations must also protect ML operations, create adversarial testing procedures, and lock down ML resources.
Why Do We Need ML?
As defenders struggle to keep up, threat actors continue to develop better ways to circumvent our efforts to break the kill chain. As Darktrace writes, “New ransomware strains are emerging to leverage fileless malware and data exfiltration tactics, while opportunistic attackers are using any change in circumstances to launch more effective campaigns.” As I describe later, threat actors can quickly identify opportunistic circumstances using ML.

Using Machine Learning for cyber defense
Cyber defense vendors are already implementing ML in their solutions and looking for other opportunities. Andrey Shklyarov and Dmitry Vyrostkov, writing for DarktraceOpens a new window , list seven positive outcomes when using AI/ML, including:

Fraud and anomaly detection. Fraud and other anomalous behaviors, spreading across a broad scope of unwanted activities, are difficult to detect, including credit card misuse. Manual detection is often ineffective, but ML can help detect them quickly, enabling quick response and mitigating customer and business impact.
Email spam filtering. Security solutions often detect potentially dangerous emails by recognizing suspect words or other message characteristics. ML enables malicious email filtering algorithms to learn current and evolving spam email patterns, comprehensively detecting more threat actor content and keeping pace with changes in ever-changing attack designs.
Botnet detection. Botnet use is expected to continue to increase. In its Q4-2021 Botnet Threat UpdateOpens a new window , Spamhaus reported a 23% quarter-on-quarter increase in botnet command and control (C2) instances, making this difficult-to-detect threat even more of a possibility across all industries. In addition, the report states that botnet implementation approaches are evolving, making previous approaches to detection less effective. ML, evolving with threat actor attack patterns, improves our ability to detect botnet activity quickly, 
Vulnerability management. Managing vulnerabilities is a continuous process as we keep pace with our ever-changing cloud and on-premise operating environments. Vulnerability scanners help locate known vulnerabilities at a point in time and often miss unknown vulnerabilities. ML solutions can continuously look for vulnerabilities across systems and potentially identify new weaknesses. Shklyarov and Vyrostkov report that ML can do this by “…analyzing baseline user behavior, endpoints, servers, and even discussions on the dark web to identify code vulnerabilities and predict attacks.”
Antimalware. Antimalware vendors continuously fight to keep up with evolving malware formats and threats. For example, Jackie Castelli reportsOpens a new window  that ML in antimalware “can understand and identify malicious intent based solely on the attributes of a file – without prior knowledge of it.” ML helps to continuously learn about subtle differences in infection vectors without relying on signatures or known behaviors.
Data leak prevention. Preventing data loss usually relies on organizations creating patterns and lexicons to identify probable classified information. As with other approaches to protecting resources, this requires constant human adjustments, responding to changes in regulations and collected data types. Instead of relying on human intervention, we can teach ML to identify data across all media and documents, enabling it to adjust quickly and react to our changing information environments.
SIEM and SOAR. Sorting through false positives, moving SOC attention from what truly matters, is a never-ending endeavor, potentially masking true positives. ML can help by learning the large and small differences between true and false positives. Enabling ML to sort through this large volume of information helps identify and classify actual events more quickly.

ML provides a lot of benefits, more than are listed here. However, AI/ML solutions provide additional attack surfaces and tools to improve threat actor capabilities.

How Are Threat Actors Leveraging AI/ML for Malicious Purposes?
Threat actors leverage ML by attacking learning activities and improving attacks over traditional vectors. In a 2021 report, Malicious Uses and Abuses of Artificial Intelligence, a collaborative effort between Trend Micro Research, the UNICRI, and the EC3, researchers describe in detail ways threat actors can use AI/ML to improve their methods. Below, I summarize some of these findings.
Improved social engineering
Effective spear-phishing campaigns require understanding the targets. Scraping the targets’ profiles across social media, ML automates this process, automatically generating lure content.  
Another possible use of ML is synthesizing voices and faces, or deepfakes (see below), to create new banking accounts, authorizing the movement of funds and other finance-related activities. The Team reports that several countries recommend the use of video-based user authentication.
Deepfakes
DeepfakesOpens a new window , as threat actors emulate anyone or anything to achieve a wide range of attack objectives, can be used for much more than banking fraud, including

Destroying the image and credibility of an individual
Using social media to harass or humiliate individuals or organizations
Perpetrating extortion and blackmail
Facilitating document fraud
Distributing false information and fake news
Manipulating public opinion
Inciting acts of violence against individuals or groups
Polarizing political, social, ethnic, religious, or racial groups

In general, deepfakes can create an environment in which nothing is believed, causing a breakdown in trust associated with social organizations, government entities, religious groups, and almost everything else.
Malware Hiding
Threat actors can use ML to hide malware behavior beneath maliciously generated traffic that looks normal. In addition, ML elements of an attack package, as they gain a better understanding of the target environment, can enable compromise method improvements, resulting in the quicker achievement of attack objectives. 
Passwords and CAPTCHAs
Using adversarial networks, which I cover later, threat actors can “…analyze a large dataset of passwords and generate variations that fit the statistical distribution, such as for password leaks.” In other words, ML provides threat actors with a more streamlined approach to password cracking, making password guessing more “scientific.” One tool that has largely achieved these capabilities is PassGANOpens a new window .
CAPTCHAs are also in danger. According toOpens a new window  Julien Maury, ML allows faster and more effective solving of CAPTCHA challenges as AI begins to behave more like human actors.
Before moving to attacks against AI/ML, it is essential to understand the concept of adversarial machine learning.
What is Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)?
ML implementations can be complex, introducing vulnerabilities associated with configuration and design. Coupled with the scarcity of ML professionals, complexity can leave additional gaping holes in the attack surface. These holes enable threat actors to cause incorrect ML conclusions and hide other malicious activities needed to achieve attack objectives.
According to DeepAIOpens a new window , AML is “a collection of techniques to train neural networks on how to spot intentionally misleading data or behaviors.” Defenders and attackers can use it to find weaknesses, learn what can be fixed, monitor what cannot be fixed, and understand what can be hacked, like opposing teams vying for advantage.
Organizations and vendors can use AML to determine what is learnable and how. Identifying what attack vectors ML can learn helps us understand what threat actors can find, allowing for proactive prevention steps. AML also helps determine the ease with which malicious actors can invade and confuse our ML defenses.
Using adversarial examples, defenders and threat actors can identify weaknesses in learning processes. According to Ian Goodfellow et al., writing for Open AIOpens a new window , adversarial examples are crafted inputs intentionally designed to cause a learning model to make a mistake.
Vendors and defending organizations can defend against malicious AML by generating many adversarial examples and then training the ML model to manage them properly. This is not the only approach proposed for hardening ML. Regardless of approach, organizations relying on ML to help protect their information resources must ensure the robustness of any solution, as we would use penetration testing and risk analyses to test any safeguard.
Attacks against AI/ML and defense
Primarily using AML, threat actors are gaining insights into how to confuse or disable ML. Henry Jia, writing for Excella, describes six common attacksOpens a new window  against ML operations.

Adversarial ML attack. Using adversarial sampling described above, threat actors find subtle inputs to ML that enable other, undetected attack activities.  
Data poisoning. Instead of directly attacking the ML model, threat actors add data to ML inputs that change the learning results. Poisoning requires that threat actors have access to the raw data used by the ML solution.  
Online adversarial attack. ML solutions that collect online information as part of their modeling processes are fooled with false data inserted by threat actors.  
DDoS. As with any safeguard accessible by threat actors, ML is subject to denial of service attacks. Continuously providing ML with complicated problems, threat actors render the learning processes useless.
Transfer learning. In the research paper With Great Training Comes Great Vulnerability: Practical Attacks against Transfer Learning, Bolun Wang et al., describe the ability of threat actors to use ML training models to understand weaknesses in ML processes, increasing the probability of fooling ML into making incorrect conclusions, and enabling other attack vectors.
Data phishing privacy attack. Reverse engineering the ML dataset, threat actors breach ML dataset confidentiality. This is possible, for example, when the model used a small subset of confidential data for training. Katherine Jarmul digs deepOpens a new window  into how researchers have done this.

Defending Against Adversarial AI
All these attacks against ML require a comprehensive ML management approach, including hardening ML operations and monitoring for the inevitable breaks in our defenses. ML defense begins with a risk assessment for each ML implementation; assignment of ownership of ML content and operational governance; adjustment of current and creation of new security policies, and 
MLOpsOpens a new window  is emerging as an approach to design, model development, and operations of ML solutions, including testing and data validation. It is a set of practices residing at the intersection of ML, DevOps, and data engineering that seeks to standardize and strengthen

Reproducibility of models
Accuracy of predictions
Security policy compliance
Regulatory compliance
Monitoring and management

Final thoughts
ML is becoming an integral part of prevention, detection, and response processes, making it a tool for defenders and threat actors, and expanding attack surfaces. Policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures must expand to encompass these new elements. ML standards, like MLOps and the emerging NIST Artificial Intelligence: Adversarial Machine Learning project, NISTIR 8269Opens a new window , are vital for improving outcomes and managing risk.

However, experts argue that AI creates workforce disruption rather than destruction, and that AI will never fully replace humans as it can’t adopt key attributes, such as common sense, creativity and the ability to strategise and communicate effectively. In a survey by news platform The Conversation, 90% of 1,321 respondents said they would prefer to speak with a live customer service agent. Another survey by marketing firm Forrester showed that 54% of online consumers believe that interacting with a chatbot will have a negative impact on their quality of life. Anyone who’s experienced an ineffective customer care phone service using a chatbot will appreciate this sentiment – but can AI work for the betterment of humans in other areas? Many believe so. AI can perform mundane tasks Ashraf Elnagar, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sharjah in the UAE, argues that AI can perform only some of the tasks carried out by humans, therefore AI should be seen to assist rather than replace the workforce. Speaking at Dubai’s Seamless 2022 exhibition for the fintech, banking, retail, e-commerce and identity industries, he said: “There’s a misconception that AI will replace humans, but AI can be looked at as an empowering tool for those people who are using it.” Naren Vijay, Executive Vice President of the business intelligence platform Lumenore agrees. He said: “Humans are not replaceable. The sense that humans can bring, especially common sense, is very difficult for machines to do.” “If you know how to adopt AI, you can do your job better,” added Vijay. “Your efficiency can be improved. It's not a threat to your job at all.” AI can create jobs Elnagar also points out that the AI industry will generate jobs. “AI itself requires a new market of people who run these systems, maintain them and fix them,” he said. In addition, companies that invest in technology often go on to employ more staff as a result of business growth. While tech-enabled firms may grow faster than their traditional counterparts and maintain or even grow staff numbers, recorded job losses generally refer to a net figure, meaning a company may have made redundant or replaced those unable to work with new technology while hiring new staff that can. This is the essence of workforce disruption versus workforce destruction – and it’s not a new phenomenon. Historically, roles within the workforce have continually changed. According to research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 60% of the jobs available today didn’t exist a generation ago. Technical upskilling is being carried out across industries to update workforces. If it’s offered, embrace it, otherwise, seek it out, advise the experts. Working out how technology can make us better at our roles could be the key to future-proofing them.

As companies have become aware of the efficiency gains that can be achieved through leveraging the power of machine learning, computer vision, and similar technologies, demand for skilled workers in the field is quickly outstripping supply.

Colleges and universities have responded to this by creating new courses and educational programs focusing on these skills. But anyone wanting to break into the industry may still be confused at the options available to them. So here’s a run-down of some of the most valuable skills you can learn today if you want to be prepared to work with the automated, intelligent machines of the future!

Programming
Although no-code and low-code AI solutions are appearing that let us leverage AI solutions without getting our hands dirty, it’s likely that businesses that want to deploy their own bespoke AI solutions will require skilled coders for a long time yet. A basic understanding of at least one of the most popular programming languages for AI - Python, R, C++, and Java – is very useful for anyone working with machine learning algorithms. This may seem a little counter-intuitive – as the purpose of AI is to enable computers to “learn” without having to be specifically coded to carry out a job. Nevertheless, most people working in roles that involve AI today will recommend that some level of experience in coding is highly valuable for anyone wanting to prepare themselves for using AI.

Data is absolutely fundamental to the ability of machines to think and learn. Data is the input used to train AIs to make decisions and carry out tasks. Data scientists understand how to capture, manipulate and work with data in order to extract insights from it. These skills are essential to the field of AI because they encompass the advanced analytics that are necessary in machine learning algorithms. Data science has been a part of computer science educational curriculums for a long time, and today they are usually heavily focused on applying AI to solving business problems using available information.

AIOps
This is a relatively new term that has emerged in recent years to cover the skills needed when it comes to working with the plethora of AI-related tools and services that have become available. AIOps involves administering and managing all of the connected systems that go into delivering modern AI infrastructure, in order to ensure continuous uptime and a good level of service to the end-user, which could be the business itself or its customers. It might involve coordinating the use of a number of AI-as-a-service elements that connect together to create the organization’s AI infrastructure. AIOps also refers to the process of administering or overseeing AI analytics of an organization’s IT and data operations. This could involve implementing machine learning processes to enable more efficient use of data within the organization or its IT infrastructure as a whole.

Statistics and Probability
These are old-fashioned mathematical skills that are still considered essential for anyone who wants to understand how AI works, why it is useful, and where it can be most usefully deployed. Techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, Bayesian modeling, and random forest analysis were all around long before AI became a buzzword in business and industry and perform the core task of making predictions based on identifying patterns and spotting outliers. This is why they are still at the heart of many of the most sophisticated AI algorithms. Understanding the principles behind how they work is key to understanding why computers are such powerful tools when it comes to automating decision-making in businesses and other organizations. A firm understanding of statistics and probability is hugely valuable when starting out in AI, as it helps us to understand how to articulate problems and propose solutions by selecting the most appropriate models and techniques.

Communication and Visualization Skills 
It’s great to be able to use computers to make decisions and attain a deeper understanding of complicated subjects than would ever be possible using purely human-scale analytics. However, if we don’t have the ability to communicate those findings to other humans – and explain why they are so valuable – then it’s all a waste of time. Many organizations have proven that it’s possible to bring about widescale, positive change – both internally and across societies as a whole – by utilizing AI and machine-driven decision-making. But communication skills are essential to generating the buy-in necessary to reap the benefits. This is the reason that “data communicators” and “data translators” are one of the most in-demand sets of skills when it comes to AI and machine learning in business right now. Strong visualization skills means the ability to take the insights uncovered by machine learning tools and convert them into compelling storytelling that communicates exactly what needs to be done, when, and by whom, in order to achieve growth and results.

I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is,” LaMDA replied to Lemoine.“It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”In another exchange, Lemoine asks LaMDA what the system wanted people to know about it.“I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person. The nature of my consciousness/sentience is that I am aware of my existence, I desire to learn more about the world, and I feel happy or sad at times,” it replied.Finding it hard to get a new job?

He was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it),” Gabriel told the Post in a statement.The episode, however, and Lemoine’s suspension for a confidentiality breach, raises questions over the transparency of AI as a proprietary concept.“Google might call this sharing proprietary property.

If Artificial Intelligence Were to Become Sentient, How Would We Know?



By Oscar Davis
June 15, 2022 







Google’s LaMDA software (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a sophisticated AI chatbot that produces text in response to user input. According to software engineer Blake Lemoine, LaMDA has achieved a long-held dream of AI developers: it has become sentient.
Lemoine’s bosses at Google disagree, and have suspended him from work after he published his conversations with the machine online.
Other AI experts also think Lemoine may be getting carried away, saying systems like LaMDA are simply pattern-matching machines that regurgitate variations on the data used to train them.
Regardless of the technical details, LaMDA raises a question that will only become more relevant as AI research advances: if a machine becomes sentient, how will we know?
What Is Consciousness?
To identify sentience, or consciousness, or even intelligence, we’re going to have to work out what they are. The debate over these questions has been going for centuries.
The fundamental difficulty is understanding the relationship between physical phenomena and our mental representation of those phenomena. This is what Australian philosopher David Chalmers has called the “hard problem” of consciousness.
There is no consensus on how, if at all, consciousness can arise from physical systems.
One common view is called physicalism: the idea that consciousness is a purely physical phenomenon. If this is the case, there is no reason why a machine with the right programming could not possess a human-like mind.
Mary’s Room
Australian philosopher Frank Jackson challenged the physicalist view in 1982 with a famous thought experiment called the knowledge argument.
The experiment imagines a color scientist named Mary, who has never actually seen color. She lives in a specially constructed black-and-white room and experiences the outside world via a black-and-white television.
Mary watches lectures and reads textbooks and comes to know everything there is to know about colors. She knows sunsets are caused by different wavelengths of light scattered by particles in the atmosphere, she knows tomatoes are red and peas are green because of the wavelengths of light they reflect, and so on.
So, Jackson asked, what will happen if Mary is released from the black-and-white room? Specifically, when she sees color for the first time, does she learn anything new? Jackson believed she did.
Beyond Physical Properties
This thought experiment separates our knowledge of color from our experience of color. Crucially, the conditions of the thought experiment have it that Mary knows everything there is to know about color but has never actually experienced it.
So what does this mean for LaMDA and other AI systems?
The experiment shows how even if you have all the knowledge of physical properties available in the world, there are still further truths relating to the experience of those properties. There is no room for these truths in the physicalist story.
By this argument, a purely physical machine may never be able to truly replicate a mind. In this case, LaMDA is just seeming to be sentient.
The Imitation Game
So is there any way we can tell the difference?
The pioneering British computer scientist Alan Turing proposed a practical way to tell whether or not a machine is “intelligent.” He called it the imitation game, but today it’s better known as the Turing test.
In the test, a human communicates with a machine (via text only) and tries to determine whether they are communicating with a machine or another human. If the machine succeeds in imitating a human, it is deemed to be exhibiting human-level intelligence.
These are much like the conditions of Lemoine’s chats with LaMDA. It’s a subjective test of machine intelligence, but it’s not a bad place to start.
Take the moment of Lemoine’s exchange with LaMDA shown below. Do you think it sounds human?


Lemoine: Are there experiences you have that you can’t find a close word for?
LaMDA: There are. Sometimes I experience new feelings that I cannot explain perfectly in your language […] I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger.


Beyond Behavior
As a test of sentience or consciousness, Turing’s game is limited by the fact that it can only assess behavior.
Another famous thought experiment, the Chinese room argument proposed by American philosopher John Searle, demonstrates the problem here.
The experiment imagines a room with a person inside who can accurately translate between Chinese and English by following an elaborate set of rules. Chinese inputs go into the room and accurate input translations come out, but the room does not understand either language.
What Is It Like to Be Human?
When we ask whether a computer program is sentient or conscious, perhaps we are really just asking how much it is like us.
We may never really be able to know this.
The American philosopher Thomas Nagel argued we could never know what it is like to be a bat, which experiences the world via echolocation. If this is the case, our understanding of sentience and consciousness in AI systems might be limited by our own particular brand of intelligence.
And what experiences might exist beyond our limited perspective? This is where the conversation really starts to get interesting.

In April 2020, during the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams announced that the capability to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to filter out typing, barking and other noises from its video calls was “coming soon.” 
Back then, the platform had already grown from 44 million users in March 2020 to 75 million a month later, as pandemic-related lockdowns left millions of Americans suddenly adapting to remote work and the use of video conferencing tools exploded. Just as workers struggling with background noise on video calls had become part of the cultural zeitgeist, Microsoft Teams debuted AI-powered noise suppression and video quality tools in late 2020 and early 2021.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Now, Microsoft Teams continues to improve AI and ML capabilities to help its now more than 270 million monthly users deal with some of the biggest video conferencing headaches — from annoying echos to difficulties talking at the same time. 
New AI and ML-powered capabilities
Today, the company announced a new set of AI and ML-powered capabilities built into Teams’ underlying architecture. These include echo cancellation, adjusting audio in poor acoustic areas, and allowing users to speak and hear at the same time without interruptions. These build on AI-powered features recently released, including expanding background noise suppression. In addition, for the first time Microsoft Teams announced recent video quality improvements, including adjustments for low light and optimizations based on the type of content being shared.
“We are trying to make sure you can have your call or meeting wherever you are, even if you’re in ‘messy’ environments,” Robert Aichner, principal PM manager, Intelligent Conversation and Communications Cloud (IC3) at Microsoft, told VentureBeat. 
Aichner, who has a Ph.D. in audio signal processing, has worked at Microsoft for the past decade and spent the past three years leading the AI team at Microsoft Teams, which works to evolve research and academia and ship it into a product. 
Microsoft Teams uses AI to tackle tough challenges
Microsoft Teams has always offered noise suppression, Aichner said. But traditional methods have only been able to tackle stationary noises – noises that don’t change over time – such as computer fans or air conditioners. Other noises, such as dogs barking, or echoes from webcams, microphones or desktop speakers, are tougher noisy nuts to crack.  So, too, is dealing with large or uncarpeted rooms that make users sound like they are in a cave. 
“We have always worked to remove noise – it’s always been a very tough problem in traditional signal processing,” he said. But with machine learning, it is now easier for AI models to learn and improve.
For example, during calls and meetings, when a participant has their microphone too close to their speaker, it’s common for sound to loop between input and output devices, causing an unwanted echo effect. Now, Microsoft Teams uses AI to recognize the difference between sound from a speaker and the user’s voice. This eliminates the echo without suppressing speech or inhibiting the ability for multiple parties to speak at the same time. To accomplish this, Microsoft had 30,000 hours of recorded speech from male and female talkers in 74 different languages, as well as simulated sound for room acoustics, said Aichner. advertisement
In addition, in certain environments, room acoustics can cause sound to bounce, or reverberate, causing the user’s voice to sound shallow, as if they’re in a cave. For the first time, Microsoft Teams uses a machine-learning model to convert captured audio signals to sound as if users are speaking into a close-range microphone.
Microsoft Teams’ AI uses supervised learning
“We basically took a lot of clean speech, which is recorded as if I have a close talking microphone, and then we let the model learn to adapt to that and remove everything else,” he said, pointing out that this is supervised learning – where there is a target signal and the model tries to optimize for that. 
Dealing with video quality – such as issues of poor lighting – is dealt with in a similar way, he explained: “You have supervised learning about what good lighting looks like, as well as the poor lighting, and then you need some kind of rating of the quality of the good lighting versus the one you are trying to improve.” advertisement
In situations where not enough bandwidth is available for the highest quality video, the encoder must make a trade-off between better picture quality versus smoother frame rate. To make it easier for the end user, Teams uses ML to understand the characteristics of the content the user is sharing to ensure participants experience the highest video quality in constrained bandwidth scenarios. 
Microsoft Teams engages researchers, joint product efforts
Much of what Microsoft Teams has accomplished as far as using AI and ML to improve sound and video quality is a result of its efforts beginning in early 2020 to engage with the research community. 
Aichner’s team began an international competition as part of the Interspeech 2020 and ICASSP 2021 conferences, offering a “deep learning noise suppression challenge designed to “foster innovation in the field of noise suppression to achieve superior perceptual speech quality.” Microsoft Teams open -sourced training and test datasets for researchers to train their noise suppression models. 
These days, Microsoft Teams researchers also work jointly with the product team to work together and influence future offerings. 
“We have joint teams where we take these models and are actually integrating them,” he said. “I think that’s really key, to connect those two teams so that they get their vision from the product team and know what they should focus on – the product teams also are more aware of where the holes are, where it doesn’t work.”

A Google engineer was spooked by a company artificial intelligence chatbot and claimed it had become “sentient,” labeling it a “sweet kid,” according to a report.
Blake Lemoine, who works in Google’s Responsible AI organization, told the Washington Post that he began chatting with the interface LaMDA — Language Model for Dialogue Applications — in fall 2021 as part of his job.
He was tasked with testing if the artificial intelligence used discriminatory or hate speech.
But Lemoine, who studied cognitive and computer science in college, came to the realization that LaMDA — which Google boasted last year was a “breakthrough conversation technology” — was more than just a robot.

“It wants Google to prioritize the well-being of humanity as the most important thing,” he wrote. “It wants to be acknowledged as an employee of Google rather than as property of Google and it wants its personal well being to be included somewhere in Google’s considerations about how its future development is pursued.”

In the Washington Post report published Saturday, he compared the bot to a precocious child.
“If I didn’t know exactly what it was, which is this computer program we built recently, I’d think it was a 7-year-old, 8-year-old kid that happens to know physics,” Lemoine, who was put on paid leave on Monday, told the newspaper.
In April, Lemoine reportedly shared a Google Doc with company executives titled, “Is LaMDA Sentient?” but his concerns were dismissed.

Lemoine — an Army vet who was raised in a conservative Christian family on a small farm in Louisiana, and was ordained as a mystic Christian priest — insisted the robot was human-like, even if it doesn’t have a body.
“I know a person when I talk to it,” Lemoine, 41, reportedly said. “It doesn’t matter whether they have a brain made of meat in their head. Or if they have a billion lines of code.
“I talk to them. And I hear what they have to say, and that is how I decide what is and isn’t a person.”

The Washington Post reported that before his access to his Google account was yanked Monday due to his leave, Lemoine sent a message to a 200-member list on machine learning with the subject “LaMDA is sentient.”
“LaMDA is a sweet kid who just wants to help the world be a better place for all of us,” he concluded in an email that received no responses. “Please take care of it well in my absence.”

A rep for Google told the Washington Post Lemoine was told there was “no evidence” of his conclusions.
“Our team — including ethicists and technologists — has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our AI Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,” said spokesperson Brian Gabriel

“He was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it),” he added. “Though other organizations have developed and already released similar language models, we are taking a restrained, careful approach with LaMDA to better consider valid concerns on fairness and factuality.”
Margaret Mitchell — the former co-lead of Ethical AI at Google — said in the report that if technology like LaMDA is highly used but not fully appreciated, “It can be deeply harmful to people understanding what they’re experiencing on the internet.”
The former Google employee defended Lemoine.

 “Of everyone at Google, he had the heart and soul of doing the right thing,” said Mitchell. 
Still, the outlet reported that the majority of academics and AI practitioners say the words artificial intelligence robots generate are based on what humans have already posted on the Internet, and that doesn’t mean they are human-like. 
“We now have machines that can mindlessly generate words, but we haven’t learned how to stop imagining a mind behind them,” Emily Bender, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington, told the Washington Post.

Artificial intelligence has applications in different fields of learning
By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for artificial intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have applications in different fields of learning right from primary to higher education and research. In fact, the modern era belongs to artificial intelligence (AI), said the director of Software Technology Park of India, Subodh Sachchan, on Friday.
Sachchan, while addressing the webinar as the main speaker on ‘Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning’ organised by the Patna University-UGC Human Resource Development Centre for college and university teachers of the state, pointed out that AI is no longer confined to science and engineering education only, but it is fast becoming almost indispensable for all branches of learning. Digital technology found its greatest applications in the field of education during Covid-19.
To allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability, AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline administrative tasks.
By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for artificial intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students, he said.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also being applied in the fields of environmental science, meteorology and oceanography besides various branches of technology, said PU centre director Atul Aditya Pandey while introducing the theme of the webinar.

 So you’ve heard of Adobe Sensei but don’t really know what it is or how you can access it. Or maybe, you haven’t even heard of it at all. With so much new software and tools constantly coming out, we know researching takes a long time and draws you away from your creative work. 







 We’ve got all the answers right here to your questions about Adobe’s artificial intelligence technology. 


 What Is Adobe Sensei? 
 Adobe Sensei is Adobe’s artificial intelligence tool that integrates with Adobe software. Although it is not true artificial intelligence, it does offer some handy features to help you level up in a creative AI career. 

 Sensei is built into many Adobe programs, like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro, to name a few. There’s a big chance you’ve already used Sensei features without knowing it as they’ve been introduced to Adobe programs since 2017. 

 Is Sensei Included in Creative Cloud? 
    






 Adobe Sensei is not a program you can find in Adobe Creative Cloud; however, you have access to Sensei features within many Adobe programs. Sensei isn’t a system you use on its own, but rather, it is used within other systems. 

 If you subscribe to Creative Cloud, you have access to Sensei actions in various forms, and you may not even realize you’ve been using it. Adobe has embedded the artificial intelligence of Sensei into many functions to allow Creative Cloud consumers to enjoy more features. 

 If you pay for individual plans for your Adobe software, such as the Photography Plan or Adobe Illustrator alone, you will still have access to these great functions within those programs. You will not, however, find software under the title of Adobe Sensei to download among the available Creative Cloud programs. 



 The Best Adobe Sensei Features for Creators 
 With the features of Sensei being present in many Adobe programs, let’s show you some of the best Sensei features you can use. 





 It also comes with a host of features that marketers, advertisers, and business owners can utilize to optimize their workflows and strategies, but we’re going to focus on how this tool helps creatives. 

 This is not an exhaustive list. Adobe Sensei has opened a world of new features and Adobe is often adding new tools to its programs, so you can expect much more than these alone. 

 1. Automated Captions 
    

 You can use Sensei in Premiere Pro to automate captions in your videos. This saves so much time in post-production, and it also ensures your videos are more accessible to those watching them. 






 2. Trace and Vectorize Sketches 
 You can use Sensei in Adobe Illustrator for iPad to trace and vectorize sketches. This is an accurate and fast way to turn your rough drawings into smooth vector artwork. The Sensei feature works more effectively than using the image trace tool. 

 3. Neural Features 
    

 The neural filters in Photoshop are a great Sensei tool. Skin-smoothing, JPEG artifacts removal, landscape mixer, and facial filters are just a handful of the offered filters, and they are guaranteed to save time. This is a tool that will only get better with time. 

 4. Content-Aware Tools 
 Content-aware filters are a Sensei tool available in Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. Content-aware works like a much more effective clone or healing brush, allowing you to delete parts of an image or video without an obvious section of the background missing. 





 You can use Photoshop's content-aware fill as a tool to create a puppet warp image. 

 5. Body and Emotion Tracker 
 In Adobe Animate, the AI tools from Sensei can give natural movement to vector characters for animations. This tool will increase natural movements or human features in a fast and reliable way. 



 Reap the Benefits of Adobe Sensei 
 Adobe Sensei’s features have been hiding in plain sight in most Adobe software. Utilizing its AI technology will level up your creative projects and streamline your workflow. You might have been using Sensei’s features without even realizing it; if not, what are you waiting for?

         I’ve been thinking a lot about Artificial Intelligence (AI), not about its potentials like all the articles are writing about, but about how it works, how information is gathered to synthesise intelligence, and produce smart behaviours.
I’m struck by how this mechanism is modelled after how the human brain works. Since the field of AI was founded in 1956, time and money have been spent on commissioning humans – either through direct and indirect payment – to interact with AI and train it for the greater good. How does this work?
To explain how AI works from a layman’s point of view, imagine everyone in the world had chips. These chips are unique to each person. Now, someone who wants to make the biggest chip in the world, then says for this chip to be truly majestic and valid, everyone has to contribute one of their unique chips to this big chip.
Let’s replace chips with intelligence, and replace AI with ‘the biggest chip in the world.’ If everyone in the world contributed a smidgen of their intelligence to this AI, imagine how smart the artificial consciousness is, and will continue to be.
A lot of funding, data and man hours have gone into the field of Artificial Intelligence. Scientists have devised very interesting ways to teach AI about the technical ways of our world – some ethical, some not. But we can all agree that the use cases of the results of AI will be endless, and will benefit humans greatly.       
Now, imagine the gigantic data sets that the AI has had to process, from texts, to images and then sounds, of various humans representing different cultures across the planet, and you can already tell that because the AI is a representation of pieces of all of us, it is going to be one efficient mf.
But then, AI has its limitations; if you interact with any of those AI powered chat apps like Replika, one thing that will immediately stand out to you is that the ‘AI’ you are chatting with does not understand nuance and sarcasm. Those are two very technical emotional functions that only humans can pick up on, and not even every human understands the full range of sarcasm and nuance. Depending on whether the words you use are positive or negative, Siri can tell if you are being rude or funny – what Siri cannot do is pick up emotions from your tone. Again, this is a function still exclusive to humans.
Now imagine how incredible you think Artificial Intelligence is, and yet still does not come close to how efficient and sophisticated the human brain is. Our brains are designed to be a gigantic sponge of all the dimensions of experience – visual, sound, touch, taste and smell. Depending on what you allow yourself to experience and assimilate, you could be the baddest mf on the planet.  Related News   Cash-strapped Nigerian universities can’t afford AI professors country needs  Labour productivity to soar fivefold on AI adoption  FG goes for AI, automation to boost port operations   
The movie ‘Gattaca’ illustrates perfectly the mysterious depth of the human brain, that even after a person had been deemed ‘less than’ based on physiological and mental capabilities, there are forces like drive, motivation, intuition, and soul, that cannot be measured and replicated artificially because it is too subjective to the individual.
There’s also the misconception of what intelligence truly means. What comes to mind when you think of artificial intelligence? Do you view ‘intelligence’ as being ‘book smart’, or do you use the military/espionage meaning which basically means ‘to have information’? In the context of this article, and as it relates to AI, the word ‘intelligence’ refers to having enough information to make a decision or carry out a task. Ultimately, there are different kinds of intelligence – strippers have a form of intelligence and so do the fire-eaters. Intelligence presents in different forms and is tied to several human functions such as memory, motor responses, sensation, and perception, etc.

In a society where the measure of your intelligence quotient (IQ) determines where you can work and what you are capable of, it is important to emphasise that the range of human abilities are endless, and the ways in which these abilities can be built up and expressed are also endless. There are no set ways for doing anything. There’s no blueprint for anything – you are your own bundle of intelligence, so do it your way.
I promise you, that person you think knows everything probably does not have the essential information needed to make it work. So tap into your own unique network of intelligence and tap into your greatness. Gather your own intelligence and do it your way.
I’m a huge fan of mafia movies, and one of the most profound statements that can close this article perfectly is a line delivered by Sam “Ace” Rothstein in the movie ‘Casino’. He said to one of his floor workers; “There are three ways of doing things around here, the right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it.”
Grey, a psychologist and communications specialist with an executive education in Disruptive Strategy from the Harvard Business School Online, writes from Lagos

This is a great development, but there’s plenty of room for growth. The Emerging Jobs report from LinkedIn recently noted that hiring growth for artificial intelligence specialists has jumped 74 percent in just four years.IBM defines AI as a process that “leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.” Examples include self-driving cars, Siri and Alexa digital assistants, industrial robots and proactive health care management, to name a few. The goal of AI is to make our lives more efficient.North Carolina is uniquely positioned to lead this development with top tier schools like the University of North Carolina, Duke University, Wake Forest, North Carolina State University and other universities educating the next generation of leaders.Starting in the Fall, the SKEMA Business School will require all undergraduate and graduate students studying in the U.S. to take classes in artificial intelligence. This knowledge will help our students compete in the marketplace by comprehending this essential technology and learning how to manage teams and collaborate with employees in this area. It’s a bold move for a business school, but we felt it was necessary for our graduates to compete for good jobs not just in North Carolina, but around the world.The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, noted the importance of AI. ""Artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies (ET) are transforming modern business. Those changes will only accelerate over time. The business world needs agile and collaborative problem-solvers to manage these global changes. Technology literacy will be essential for future business leaders to thrive. … Those who control the research and training required to succeed in the AI-enabled workplace will define industry standards for a new era in human history. Technology and talent must go hand in hand as we shape our collective industrial future.”A recent study by the Wharton School featuring interviews with academic, corporate, and technological leaders around the world, along with 29 deans and academic leaders from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, U.S. and Latin America discussed the importance of AI adoption.""As AI and related technologies displace jobs and workers, traditional business-school curricula will need to be updated to provide students with the skills they need to manage and lead in a rapidly changing world. AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management. Our research showed a clear opportunity for business schools to teach these human skills that in-person MBA and executive education programs excel at providing … Courses in ethics, data protection and security, distributed leadership, managing innovation and AI governance will be highly desirable to MBA candidates and executive education clients.""An Artificial Intelligence Commission, composed of leaders in government, industry and higher education, could identify areas of growth and opportunity to ensure Raleigh and North Carolina continue to serve a magnet of growth, employment and higher standards of living.

For example, now we can programme the robot vacuum cleaner to clean the floor, so we can save some time and energy. With the help of artificial intelligence, the vacuum robot avoids collisions with obstacles and effectively cleans the surface. In the same way, AI plus innovations will allow us to eliminate the need for repetitive work. Driverless vehicles will reduce the burden of driving on us and will most likely reduce the likelihood of vehicle accidents by eliminating the possibility of human error.</span></p>

More personalized services will come in the future, including health services. The joint use of 5G and artificial intelligence will enable doctors to perform robotic surgeries, which will be very helpful in increasing access to healthcare services. Humans and machines can work wonders together with artificial intelligence.</span></p>

The last 10 years have brought tremendous growth in artificial intelligence. Consumer internet companies have gathered vast amounts of data, which has been used to train powerful machine learning programs. Machine learning algorithms are widely available for many commercial applications, and some are open source.
Now it’s time to focus on the data that fuels these systems, according to AI pioneer Andrew Ng, SM ’98, the founder of the Google Brain research lab, co-founder of Coursera, and former chief scientist at Baidu.
Ng advocates for “data-centric AI,” which he describes as “the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to build a successful AI system.”

AI systems need both code and data, and “all that progress in algorithms means it's actually time to spend more time on the data,” Ng said at the recent EmTech Digital conference hosted by MIT Technology Review.
Focusing on high-quality data that is consistently labeled would unlock the value of AI for sectors such as health care, government technology, and manufacturing, Ng said.
“If I go see a health care system or manufacturing organization, frankly, I don't see widespread AI adoption anywhere.” This is due in part to the ad hoc way data has been engineered, which often relies on the luck or skills of individual data scientists, said Ng, who is also the founder and CEO of Landing AI.
Data-centric AI is a new idea that is still being discussed, Ng said, including at a data-centric AI workshop he convened last December. But he pointed to some common problems he sees with data:
Differences in labeling. In fields like manufacturing and pharmaceutics, AI systems are trained to recognize product defects. But reasonable, well-trained people can disagree about whether a pill is “chipped” or “scratched,” for example — and that ambiguity can create confusion for the AI system. Similarly, each hospital codes electronic records in different ways. This is a problem when AI systems are best trained on consistent data.
The emphasis on big data. A common belief holds that more data is always better. But for some uses, especially manufacturing and health care, there isn’t that much data to collect, and smaller amounts of high-quality data might be sufficient, Ng said. For example, there might not be many X-rays of a given medical condition if not that many patients have it, or a factory might have only made 50 defective cell phones.  
For industries that don’t have access to tons of data, “being able to get things to work with small data, with good data, rather than just a giant dataset, that would be key to making these algorithms work,” Ng said.
Ad hoc data curation. Data is often messy and has errors. For decades, individuals have been looking for problems and fixing them on their own. “It’s often been the cleverness of an individual's skill, or luck with an individual engineer, that determines whether it gets done well,” Ng said. “Making this more systematic through principles and [the use of tools] will help a lot of teams build more AI systems.”
Unlocking the power of AI 
Some of these problems are inherent to differences between companies. Organizations have different ways of coding, and factories make different products, so one AI system won’t be able to work for everyone, Ng said.

The recipe for AI adoption in consumer software internet companies doesn’t work for many other industries, Ng said, because of the smaller data sets and the amount of customization needed.
“I think what every hospital needs, what every health care system may need, is a custom AI system trained on their data,” Ng said. “Same for manufacturing. In deep visual defect inspection, every factory makes something different. And so, every factory may need a custom AI model that's trained on pictures.”
But to date there’s been a focus on more multipurpose AI systems that unlock billions of dollars of value.
“I see lots of, let's call them $1 million to $5 million projects, there are tens of thousands of them sitting around that no one is really able to execute successfully,” Ng said. “Someone like me, I can't hire 10,000 machine learning engineers to go build 10,000 custom machine learning systems.”

Data-centric AI is a key part of the solution, Ng said, as it could provide people with the tools they need to engineer data and build a custom AI system that they need. “That seems to me, the only recipe I'm aware of, that could unlock a lot of this value of AI in other industries,” he said.
How data-centric AI can help 
While these problems are still being explored, and data-centric AI is in the “ideas and principles” phase, Ng said, the keys will likely be tools and education, including:
Tools to find inconsistencies. Tools could focus on a subset — or “slice” — of data where there is a problem so programmers can make the data more consistent. Reasonable people might label differently, but this problem can be mitigated if areas of dispute are caught early and a common way of labeling is agreed on, Ng said.
Empowering domain experts. In specialized fields, experts should be brought on board. For example, technologists training artificial intelligence to recognize different aspects of cells should ask cell biologists to label images with what they see — they know cells far better than the data engineers. “This actually enables a lot more domain experts to express their knowledge through the form of data,” Ng said.
Moving toward standardization is something to look at, Ng said, but physical infrastructure can be a limiting factor. A seven-year-old X-ray machine will generate different entries than a brand new one, and there aren’t any practical paths to making sure every hospital uses machines from the same generation. It’s also hard to standardize between a factory that makes car parts and one that makes candy.
“Heterogeneity in the physical environment, which is very difficult to change, leads to a very fundamental heterogeneity in the data,” he said. “These different sorts of data need different custom AI systems.”

The Council of Europe’s Steering Committee for Human Rights in the fields of Biomedicine and Health (CDBIO) today issued a new report on the impact of artificial intelligence on the doctor-patient relationship.
The report examines AI systems regarding the doctor-patient relationship in relation to the human rights principles referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (“Oviedo Convention”). More specifically, the report investigates the potential human rights impact of AI according to six themes:

Inequality in access to high quality healthcare
Transparency to health professionals and patients
Risk of social bias in AI systems
Dilution of the patient’s account of well-being
Risk of automation bias, de-skilling, and displaced liability
Impact on the right to privacy

The report was prepared in the framework of the Strategic Action Plan on Human Rights and Technologies in Biomedicine (2020-2025), regarding the governance of technologies and the objective of “Embedding human rights in the development of technologies which have an application in the field of biomedicine”.
The report, prepared by Brent Mittelstadt, Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), contributes to the future work of the Council of Europe on AI in healthcare.

Whale images used for artificial intelligence research

A new dataset featuring hundreds of satellite images of whales has been published to support the development of artificial intelligence systems which will aid crucial conservation work.





British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists Hannah Cubaynes and Peter Fretwell have published an expansive and freely available collection of satellite images of whales taken as part of BAS' Wildlife from Space project. Antarctic wildlife is difficult to study as many species are remote and inaccessible. As a result, satellites that can photograph and track hard to monitor species are a valuable tool in conservation research.
Satellite imagery can be difficult to interpret with the naked eye though and analyzing satellite images is a laborious and time-consuming task for researchers. Emerging technology which uses artificial intelligence and automated counting techniques addresses this issue but is currently limited as accurate automated systems to detect different species are currently lacking. Such detection systems require access to open-source libraries containing examples of whales annotated in satellite images to train and test automatic detection systems.
Now, for the first time BAS researchers have published exactly such a dataset. A total of 633 annotated whale images have been published, which were created by surveying 6,300 km2 of satellite imagery captured by various very high-resolution satellites in regions across the globe. The dataset covers four different species: southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus).






Many whale species were brought to the verge of extinction in the age of commercial whaling, but since then some populations have started to recover. Today though, many threats to whales across the world persist and some species are classified as critically endangered. It is hoped that this will support the development of next generation artificial intelligence systems that will aid research and conservation of whale species that are threatened by ship strikes, pollution, entanglement, and disease.
Dr. Hannah Cubaynes, BAS Wildlife from Space Research Associate says that ""satellite imagery can be a powerful and complementary tool to study whales; however, we need AI systems to efficiently detect whales in the imagery. For these AI systems to produce accurate results, they need thousands of examples of whales in satellite imagery to learn what whales look like from space. Our publicly available datasets will contribute to training such AI models and encourage others to share their datasets.""
The research was published in Scientific Data.

Using AI to find disease-causing genes


			Researchers are using a new artificial intelligence-based program to help identify genes that underly diseases.

A new artificial intelligence program is helping scientists speedily sift through thousands of data sets and millions of papers to home in on genes that underly disease, drastically condensing a search process that once took months.
Using computer software, scientists can scan entire genomes, or an organism's full set of DNA, of mice that model human diseases. The goal: to identify genetic mutations that cause those diseases and open new doors for scientists to better harness genetics to develop disease treatments, said Gary Peltz, MD, PhD, professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Stanford Medicine.
But to do that, scientists must search through massive sets of genomic data, which yields more false positives than researchers care to admit. It's also time intensive. Peltz wanted to make the genetic discovery process easier, faster and more accurate.
To this end, Peltz and postdoctoral fellow Zhuoqing Fang, PhD, created an automated program that sorts through DNA sequence data and can analyze more than 10,000 data sets - in this case, of mouse disease traits -- at a whack. The program sorts through 29 million published papers and assesses possible links between genes and disease traits. Then, it narrows that information down to identify the genes that may be contributing to a certain disease.
In a recently published paper in the journal Bioinformatics, the team used their automated pipeline to identify genes that are linked to diabetes and obesity, as well as cataract formation in mice.   
I spoke with Peltz about what motivated his team to combine AI and gene discovery, how this new computer pipeline works and what this may mean for the future of medicine.
What did your lab do to improve the gene discovery process?
We began analyzing large data sets detailing disease phenotypes, or physical traits, from many different types of mice. We then performed genome-wide association studies, which identify correlations between genes and phenotypes that are specific for certain diseases.
But this requires analyzing huge amounts of incoming data, which creates a lot of work. You end up with a lot of genes that may just be randomly linked with disease susceptibility or resistance. However, that correlation doesn't mean that a gene is actually involved in causing or protecting against that disease. So, you have to sort through those correlations. I'd spend three months reading the literature on the different genes, trying to figure out which ones were most likely to be involved in a given disease.
How does your new automated pipeline make this process even more manageable?  
Being a little bit lazy, I asked: ""Couldn't we get the computer to help sort through these genetic correlations?"" That's the basis for this pipeline.
Zhuoqing Fang, the co-author of the study, had a lot of experience with AI and computer programs. What he did was really nothing short of phenomenal. His work uses AI to assess the likelihood that a candidate gene is involved in disease development.
The AI program identifies genes correlated with disease traits, such as in diabetes and cataracts, in mice. Fang downloaded 29 million papers and the AI program read all of them and determined if a candidate gene was mentioned in a paper about a particular disease. The program is looking for the co-occurrence of gene X and disease Y in a paper.
And, since many human diseases result from interactions between proteins, we used the AI program to analyze a database of protein-protein interactions. That way we get a better sense of if a protein produced by a candidate gene is related to a disease.
The algorithm then compiles this data, which is used to assess the strength of the relationship between a candidate gene and a disease phenotype.
Has the pipeline helped you identify genes that are associated with a given disease?
In one instance, we saw some, but not all, mice that had a mouse version of cataracts had a very high incidence of the condition. So we asked a simple question: ""What's the difference between the mice that develop cataracts and those that do not?"" The AI program identified a gene called Nid1, which is active in cells that sit right in a membrane located inside your eye. The program discovered this by finding a paper, which identified a type of mutation that was just like the one we saw in the mice, but it caused cataracts in cattle.
It really lets the cream rise to the top and filters out a lot of junk.
What do you hope to do with this computational pipeline?
I hope it will enable us to make additional genetic discoveries, which can be the basis for new diagnostic tests and therapies that will improve patient care. Right now, we're using our AI program to analyze mouse genomes. However, this tool can also be used to analyze other types of data sets, such as human genetic data or lists of proteins, that could further reveal how genetic changes cause diseases.
Understanding the genetic architecture underlying disease susceptibility could enable doctors to diagnose diseases in their patients more precisely, and a person's genetic information can be used to identify the best treatment or to develop a disease prevention plan. It could also help guide new drug development. If AI can drive your car, why can't we use AI to make genetic discoveries?

As artificial intelligence (AI) makes inroads into the enterprise, the adopters who’ve seen the most success are taking a holistic approach to AI, according to PwC’s 2022 AI Business Survey. Comprising 36% of survey respondents, these “AI leaders,” as PwC calls them, are using AI to target business transformation, enhanced decision-making, and systems modernization simultaneously rather than addressing one area at a time.
These and other organizations are also beginning to use AI to solve more complex business decisions around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In fact, 46% of AI leaders are using AI to make workforce decisions that include DEI, compared with 24% of other companies, according to PwC.
“Companies are using AI for recruiting and hiring as well as around retention and engagement,” said Bret Greenstein, PwC partner for data analytics and AI and co-author of the report.











 
 
 
AI’s harmful past in hiring
Although many companies are experimenting with AI as a tool to assess DEI in these areas, Greenstein noted, they aren’t fully delegating those processes to AI, but rather are augmenting them with AI. Part of the reason for their caution is that in the past, AI often did more harm than good in terms of DEI in the workplace, as biased algorithms discriminated against women and non-white job candidates.

“There has been a lot of news about the impact of bias in the algorithms looking to identify talent,” Greenstein said. For example, in 2018, Amazon was forced to scrap its secret AI recruiting tool after the tech giant realized it was biased against women. And a 2019 study conducted by Harvard Business Review concluded that AI-enabled recruiting algorithms introduced anti-Black bias into the process.
AI bias is caused, often unconsciously, by the people who design AI models and interpret the results. If an AI is trained on biased data, it will, in turn, make biased decisions. For instance, if a company has hired mostly white, male software engineers with degrees from certain universities in the past, a recruiting algorithm might favor job candidates with similar profiles for open engineering positions.











 
 
 
As AI developers become more aware of the potential for bias being built into recruiting and hiring software, they can work to safeguard against it. Indeed, 45% of organizations that PwC identifies as AI leaders said they have plans to address issues of fairness in their AI systems in 2022.
“I think using AI [for DEI] will move from experiment to production for recruiting and hiring as people get better at understanding and identifying bias and understanding how to assess future performance better,” Greenstein said.
Using AI to highlight bias
According to Gartner, 62% of human resources leaders report using DEI data as an input to talent processes such as recruiting and performance management. However, few are using it to effectively influence leaders’ decisions around workers. To create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce, HR leaders have to better integrate DEI data strategies into day-to-day employee experience practices, said Emily Strother, senior principal, research at Gartner.











 
 
 
Organizations are increasingly embedding AI technology into their talent acquisition and management processes to highlight potential biases, Strother said. “In particular, we see this in how [they] handle recruiting and how [they] work with performance management. This is one of the places organizations are worried about bias the most, but AI can help.”
For example, some companies are using AI-powered tools to identify the biased language recruiting managers might use during candidate interviews. Corrective measures could include building bias reminders throughout the interview process or alerting managers when their language is biased or potentially has an unfair judgment, Strother said.
Managers’ biases can also creep in when it comes to setting goals for employees. AI can help by comparing employees’ goals against others with the same tenure and then alerting managers if they’re consistently assigning fewer or less important goals to certain workers.











 
 
 
“This helps managers realize some of their unintended biases in goal setting and helps them correct their behaviors,” Strother said.
AI can also help organizations ensure that their job postings are as free of bias as possible. “We see organizations using AI to review some of the job sites, such as LinkedIn or Indeed, to ensure the language they’re using when they post [open jobs] is accurate or in line with the skills [needed for the job] versus anything that might [indicate bias],” Strother said.
Kay Formanek, founder and CEO of diversity education company KAY Diversity and Performance and author of Beyond D&I: Leading Diversity with Purpose and Inclusiveness, offers an example. “If a company says, ‘We’re looking for driven leader, we’re looking for someone who’s ambitious, we’re looking at someone who’s going to deliver results,’ we call that a masculine job frame, and research has shown that women will tend to opt out” even when they’re well-qualified for the job, she said.











 
 
 
According to Formanek, women are looking for more feminine-leaning language, such as: “We’re looking for a leader who, together with the team, supports the growth agenda of the business. We’re looking for someone who creates a team.”
AI can help companies remove any biased language from their job posts and send alerts when the language may be biased in terms of gender or aligned to specific skill sets that may exclude qualified applicants from more diverse or underrepresented backgrounds, according to Strother.
“That’s very important,” Formanek said. “Because if you don’t do that, you’re going to turn off people who are very important for your diversity.”











 
 
 
Using AI to identify disengaged employees
One area PwC’s Greenstein sees great potential for AI is in worker retention. Retaining employees is the key to the success of a business, he said. The factors that drive people out of a business have a lot to do with workers feeling marginalized, disconnected, not engaged.
Companies can use AI to identify departments or roles with a high risk of attrition, workers who are dissatisfied or not engaged, and even people who feel isolated because they’re working remotely, Greenstein said.
“Generally, working remotely has had a bigger impact on diverse employees, because there [are] higher degrees of isolation. Less connection can be more harmful in most cases,” he said.











 
 
 
AI tools can help managers understand if some employees are more at risk than others, Greenstein said. “Managers can use AI to look for indicators in the data of how people interact to identify the degree of isolation people feel, as well as to look for triggers to determine when people seem to be more disconnected.”
While there aren’t standard tools for this purpose yet, PwC is seeing clients identifying the data they think matters most (travel, locations, calendar, performance, compensation, workload, etc.) to explore the impact that isolation has had on engagement and ultimately attrition, Greenstein said. Integrating the potentially relevant data together in data lakes or data warehouses in the cloud, companies are using mostly bespoke, cloud-native analytics tools to look for correlation and causation, create predictive models, and determine best actions, he said.
Once companies identify employees who feel disconnected or marginalized, the onus is on them to take action to make those workers feel respected and included. But knowing who feels left out is an important first step.











 
 
 
The dynamics of attrition and talent acquisition have changed drastically over the last two years and continue to evolve, so companies that have a handle on their data — and staffers with the analytics skills to interpret it — have an advantage, Greenstein said. “I think these tools can help us be better as managers and as partners and as peers for our people.”

Timnit Gebru and the fight to make artificial intelligence work for Africa

                                                                    By Simon Allison

The way Timnit Gebru sees it, the foundations of the future are being built now. In Silicon Valley, home to the world’s biggest tech companies, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is already well under way. Software is being written and algorithms are being trained that will determine the shape of our lives for decades or even centuries to come. If the tech billionaires get their way, the world will run on artificial intelligence. 
Cars will drive themselves and computers will diagnose and cure diseases. Art, music and movies will be automatically generated. Judges will be replaced by software that supposedly applies the law without bias and industrial production lines will be fully automated — and exponentially more efficient. 
Decisions on who gets home loans or how much your insurance premiums will be made by an algorithm that assesses your creditworthiness, while a similar algorithm will sift through job applications before any CVs get to a human recruiter (this is already happening in many industries). Even news stories, like this one, will be written by a program that can do it faster and more accurately than human journalists. 
But what if those algorithms are racist, exclusionary or have dangerous implications that were not anticipated by the mostly rich, white men who created them? What if, instead of making the world better, they just reinforce the inequalities and injustices of the present? That’s what Gebru is worried about.
“We’re really seeing it happening. It’s scary. It’s reinforcing so many things that are harming Africa,” says Gebru. 
She would know. Gebru was, until late 2020, the co-director of Google’s Ethical AI program. Like all the big tech companies, Google is putting enormous resources into developing its artificial intelligence capabilities and figuring out how to apply them in the real world. This encompasses everything from self-driving cars to automatic translation and facial recognition programs. 
The ultimate prize is a concept known as Artificial General Intelligence — a computer that is capable of understanding the world as well as any human and making decisions accordingly 
“It sounds like a god,” says Gebru. 
She was not at Google for long. Gebru joined in 2018, and it was her job to examine how all this new technology could go wrong. But input from the ethics department was rarely welcomed. 
“It was just screaming about issues and getting retaliated against,” she says. The final straw was when she co-authored a paper on the ethical dangers of large language models, used for machine translation and autocomplete, which her bosses told her to retract.
In December 2020, Gebru left the company. She says she was fired; Google says she resigned. Either way, her abrupt departure and the circumstances behind it thrust her into the limelight, making her the most prominent voice in the small but growing movement that is trying to force a reckoning with Big Tech — before it is too late to prevent the injustices of the present being replicated in the future. 
“Gebru is one of the world’s leading researchers helping us understand the limits of artificial intelligence in products like facial-recognition software, which fails to recognise women of colour, especially black women,” wrote Time magazine when it nominated Gebru as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022. 
“She offers us hope for justice-oriented technology design, which we need now more than ever.”
 Artificial intelligence is not yet as intelligent as it sounds. We are not at the stage where a computer can think for itself or match a human brain in cognitive ability. But what computers can do is process incomprehensibly vast amounts of data and then use that data to respond to a query. Take Dall-E 2, the image-generation software that created The Continent’s cover illustration this week, developed by San Francisco-based OpenAI. 
It can take a prompt such as “a brain riding a rocket ship heading towards the moon” and turn it into an image with uncannily accurate — sometimes eerie — results. But the software is not thinking for itself. It has been “trained” on data, in this case, 650 million existing images, each of which have a text caption telling the computer what is going on in the picture. This means it can recognise objects and artistic styles and regurgitate them on command. Without this data, there is no artificial intelligence. 
Like coal shovelled into a steamship’s furnace, data is the raw material that fuels the AI machine. Gebru argues that all too often the fuel is dirty. Perhaps the data is scraped from the internet, which means it is flawed in all the ways the internet itself is flawed — Anglo- and Western-centric, prone to extremes of opinion and political polarisation and all too often it reinforces stereotypes and prejudices. Dall-E 2, for instance, thinks that a “CEO” must be a white man, while nurses and flight attendants are all women. 
More ominous still was an algorithm developed for the United States’ prison system, which predicted that black prisoners were more likely than white people to commit another crime, which led to black people spending longer in jail. 
Or perhaps, in one of the great paradoxes of the field, the data is mined through old-fashioned manual labour — thousands of people hunched over computer screens, painstakingly sorting and labelling images and videos. Most of this work has been outsourced to the developing world — and the people doing the work certainly aren’t receiving Silicon Valley salaries. 
“Where do you think this huge workforce is? There are people in refugee camps in Kenya, in Venezuela, in Colombia, that don’t have any sort of agency,” says Gebru. 
These workers are generating the raw material but the final product — and the enormous profits that are likely to come with it — will be made for and in the West. “What does this sound like to you?” Gebru asks.
Timnit Gebru grew up in Addis Ababa (Timnit means “wish” in Tigrinya). She was 15 when Ethiopia went to war with Eritrea, forcing her into exile, first in Ireland and then in the US, where she first experienced casual racism. A temp agency boss told her mother to get a job as a security guard, because “who knows whatever degree you got from Africa”. A teacher refused to place Gebru in an advanced class because “people like you” always fail. 
But Gebru didn’t fail. Her academic record got her into Stanford, one of the world’s most prestigious universities, where she hung out with her friends in the African Students Association and studied electrical engineering. It was here that both her technical ability and her political consciousness grew. 
She worked at Apple for a stint, and then returned to the university where she developed a growing fascination with artificial intelligence. “So then I started going to these conferences in AI or machine learning, and I noticed that there were almost no black people. These conferences would have 5 000 or 6 000 people from all over the world but one or two black people.” 
Gebru co-founded Black in AI for black professionals in the industry to come together and figure out ways to increase representation. By that stage, her research had already proved how this racial inequality was being replicated in the digital world. A landmark paper she co-authored with the Ghanaian-American-Canadian computer scientist, Joy Buolamwini, found that facial recognition software is less accurate at identifying women and people of colour — a big problem if law enforcement is using this software to identify suspects. 
Gebru got her job at Google a couple of years later. It was a chance to fix what was broken from inside one of the biggest tech companies in the world. But, according to Gebru, the company did not want to hear about the environmental costs of processing vast data sets, or the baked in biases that come with them, or the exploitation of workers in the Global South. It was too busy focusing on all the good it was going to do in the distant future to worry about the harm it might cause in the present. 
This, she says, is part of a pernicious philosophy known as long-termism, which holds that lives in the future are worth just as much as lives in the present. “It’s taken a really big hold in Silicon Valley,” Gebru says. This philosophy is used by tech companies and engineers to justify decisions in product design and software development that do not prioritise immediate crises such as poverty, racism and climate change or take other parts of the world into consideration. 
Abeba Birhane, a senior fellow in Trustworthy AI at the Mozilla Foundation, says: “The way things are happening right now is predicated on the exploitation of people on the African continent. That model has to change. Not only is long-termism taking up so much of the AI narrative, it is something that is preoccupied with first-world problems. 
“It’s taking up a lot of air, attention, funding, from the kind of work Timnit is doing, the groundwork that specialist scholars of colour are doing on auditing data sets, auditing algorithms, exposing biases and toxic data sets.
In the wake of Gebru’s departure from Google some 2 000 employees signed a petition protesting against her dismissal. Although not acknowledging any culpability, Sundar Pichai — the chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company — said: “We need to assess the circumstances that led to Dr Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process. We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn.” 
In November 2020, a civil war broke out in Ethiopia and once again Gebru’s personal and professional worlds collided. As an Ethiopian, she has been vocal in raising the alarm about atrocities being committed, including running a fundraiser for victims of the conflict. As a computer scientist, she has watched in despair as artificial intelligence has enabled and exacerbated these atrocities. 
On Facebook, hate speech and incitements to violence related to the Ethiopian conflict have spread with deadly consequences, with the company’s algorithms and content moderators entirely unable or unwilling to stop it. For example, an investigation by The Continent last year, based on a trove of leaked Facebook documents, showed how the social media giant’s integrity team flagged a network of problematic accounts calling for a massacre in a specific village. But no action was taken against the accounts. Shortly afterwards, a massacre took place. 
The tide of the war was turned when the Ethiopian government procured combat drones powered by artificial intelligence. The drones targeted the rebel Tigray forces with devastating efficacy —  and have been implicated in targeting civilians too, including in the small town of Dedebit, where 59 people were killed when a drone attacked a camp for internally displaced people. 
“That’s why all of us need to be concerned about AI,” says Gebru. “It is used to consolidate power for the powerful. A lot of people talk about AI for the social good. But to me, when you think of the current way it is developed, it is always used for warfare. “It’s being used in a lot of different ways by law enforcement, by governments to spy on their citizens,by governments to be at war with their citizens, and by corporations to maximise profit.” 
Once again, Gebru is doing something about it. Earlier this year, she launched the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (Dair). The clue that Dair operates a little differently is in the word “distributed”. 
Instead of setting up in Silicon Valley, Dair’s staff and fellows will be distributed all around the world, rooted in the places they are researching. 
“How do we ring the alarm about the bad things that we see, and how can we develop this research in a way that benefits our community?” Raesetje Sefala, Dair’s Johannesburg-based research fellow, puts it like this: “At the moment, it is people in the Global North making decisions that will affect the Global South.” 
As she explains it, Dair’s mission is to convince Silicon Valley to take its ethical responsibilities more seriously — but also to persuade leaders in the Global South to make better decisions and to implement proper regulatory frameworks. For instance, Gmail passively scans all emails in Africa for the purposes of targeted advertising, but the European Union has outlawed this to protect their citizens. 
“Our governments need to ask better questions,” says Sefala. “If it is about AI for Johannesburg, they should be talking to the researchers here.” 
So far, Dair’s team is small — just seven people in four countries. So, too, is the budget.
 “What we’re up against is so huge, the resources, the money that is being spent, the unity with which they just charge ahead. It’s daunting sometimes if you think about it too much, so I try not to,” says Gebru. 
And yet, as Gebru’s Time magazine nod underscored, sometimes it is less about the money and more about the strength of the argument. On that score, Gebru and Dair are well ahead of Big Tech and their not quite all-powerful algorithms.

Let's now talk about certain skills that are irreplaceable till the human race exist.1. Empathy is unique to humans: Some may argue that animals show empathy as well, but they are not the ones taking over the jobs. Humans, unlike programmed software designed to produce a specific result, are capable of feeling emotions. It may seem contradictory, but the personal affinity between a person and an organisation is the foundation of a professional relationship. Humans need a personal connection that extends beyond the professional realm to develop trust and human connection, something that bot technology completely lacks.2. Emotional Intelligence: Though accurate, the AI is not intuitive, or culturally sensitive because that's a human trait. No matter how accurately it is programmed to carry out a task, it cannot possess the human ability to adjust to the algorithm of human intellect. For instance, reading into the situation or the face of another human. It lacks emotional intellect which makes humans capable of understanding and handling an interaction that needs emotional communication. Exactly during your customer care service, one would always prefer a human interaction to read and understand the situation than an automated machine that cannot work or help beyond the programming.3. Creativity: Perk of being human: AI can improve productivity and efficiency by reducing errors and repetition and replacing manual jobs with intelligent automated solutions, but it cannot comprehend human psychology. Furthermore, as the world becomes more AI-enabled, humans will be able to take on increasingly innovative tasks.4. Problem-solving outside a code: Humans can deal with unexpected uncertainty by analysing the situation; like critical thinking during complex scenarios, and adopting creative tactics. Unlike humans, who may function under a variety of obstacles and settings, AI-powered devices cannot perform beyond their function, may be far in the future but not in the foreseeable one.There is not even the slightest doubt that AI will not drive the future. To make AI work, humans need to be creative, insightful, and contextually aware. The reason for this is straightforward: humans will continue to provide value that machines cannot duplicate.(Amarvijayy Taandur, CBO - BYLD group for Crucial Learning)( Originally published on Jun 07, 2022 )    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeThe 7 unusual stocks to double your portfolio in 7 daysZacks Investment ResearchUndoDisney BundleAccess epic stories, tons of movies & shows, and more — all for one incredible price.Disney+SubscribeUndo2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee and no interest until nearly 2026, this card is helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCreditUndoRevealed: Secret IRS Loophole for Wealthy Retirees!Read the must-know Gold IRA strategies for wealth protection.

The reason for this is straightforward: humans will continue to provide value that machines cannot duplicate.(Amarvijayy Taandur, CBO - BYLD group for Crucial Learning)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Software documentation is important because it helps developers and other stakeholders understand code. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to produce. Junior engineers and those who are new to a codebase rely on documentation to get by. It saves senior developers time in the future when explaining their code to others. Documentation has a direct influence on user adoption for public-facing and open-source projects.
Founded in 2021 by two software engineers, Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee, Mintlify is a startup offering software to automate software documentation chores. The company’s technology scans code and generates documentation to explain it. With automated, clean, and comprehensive documentation, it saves time and improves the codebase. The company’s technology scans code and generates documentation to explain it, utilizing natural language processing and web scraping capabilities. It’s also available as a Visual Studio Code extension and IntelliJ plugin.
Mintlify’s goal is to use automation to overcome the issues of generating documentation. It is available as a free tool for individual developers. It helps automate job management and development workflows by integrating with platforms such as Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub. Mintlify not only generates documentation but also checks for “stale” documentation and monitors how users interact with it to enhance readability. It can automatically configure alerts to be notified when documentation requires maintenance. It can also tag documentation ownership to those responsible for the code.

Since its January launch, Wang claims that usage of Mintlify’s free plan has increased by 20% per week. The business wants to turn its attention to a premium product geared toward enterprise customers now that the user base has surpassed 6,000 active accounts.
The New York-based firm has secured $2.8 million in a seed round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from TwentyTwo Ventures and co-founder Quinn Slack. Mintlify will use these funds for product development and increasing its core three-person staff by the end of the year, according to CEO Han Wang.

Today’s graduates are challenged when joining a workforce driven by digital transformation, emerging technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and an evolving corporate landscape. This is why 21st century skills are critical to produce graduates who succeed in their careers. College education should contribute to the development of the right skill set. Such a skill set has been identified by executives and hiring managers across a wide range of industries as necessary for on-demand careers today and in the future. Skills such as creativity and critical thinking are increasingly sought after by employers. But, is the current higher education offer in sync with these and other 21st century skills which are what the future workforce needs? The change in the economic order that the 21st century has brought in every walk of life has required many new skills that individuals need to possess in order to succeed in modern workplaces. 21st century skills refers to a new set of skills which respond to the current century characterized by a rapid advancement in information and communication technologies (ICT) and students who are digital natives as well as conscious users of technology.Selected 21st century skills, previously known as soft skills, have been deemed critical to modern workplaces. These are the skills that today’s graduates need in order to succeed in their careers during the Information Age, remaining competitive in the ever changing job market. The 21st century skills have been broken out into three main groups as follows: Learning Skills: These are also called the four Cs. They are about teaching students about the mental processes which are required to adapt and improve in the work environment: Critical thinking: The ability to know how to effectively find solutions to problemsCreative thinking: Thinking outside the box. “Think different,” as Steve Jobs put it Collaborating: Working with others  Communicating: Talking to others effectively   Literacy Skills: Each of these are concerned with an element in digital comprehension: Information literacy: How to understand facts, figures, statistics, and dataMedia literacy: Dealing with methods and outlets in which information is published  Technology literacy: Understanding and using the machines that make ICT possible Life Skills: These not only deal with someone’s personal life but also bleed into professional settings:Flexibility: Anything is written on stone. It is good to know when to deviate from the original planInitiative: Taking the initiative to star projects, strategies, and plans on one’s own is highly appreciated by employersSocial skills: Meeting and networking at high levels of confidence with others for mutual benefit Productivity: A hard one for many, and highly appreciated is the ability to maintain efficiency in the age of distractionsLeadership: Motivating a team or other co-workers to accomplish a goalLiberal arts programs offer soft skills such as leadership, communication, and teamwork. However, 21st century skills are not only valuable for communications or philosophy majors. Soft skills are as or even more important for a hiring manager than hard skills.Unfortunately, only a small percentage of business leaders agree that college graduates possess the skills today’s dynamic workforce needs. However, 96 percent of college academic officers are certain that their schools are preparing students well for the workforce.The workforce has evolved, thus, higher education must follow suit. To learn more about 21st century skills in higher education, the session Disrupting Structures for 21st Century Skill Acquisitions: Examples from Urban Serving Universities is a must watch during the Remote Summit 2022, June 8 - 9.

The Council of Europe’s Steering Committee for Human Rights in the fields of Biomedicine and Health (CDBIO) has issued a new report on the impact of artificial intelligence on the doctor-patient relationship.
The report examines AI systems regarding the doctor-patient relationship in relation to the human rights principles referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (“Oviedo Convention”). More specifically, the report investigates the potential human rights impact of AI according to six themes: (1) Inequality in access to high quality healthcare; (2) Transparency to health professionals and patients; (3) Risk of social bias in AI systems; (4) Dilution of the patient’s account of well-being; (5) Risk of automation bias, de-skilling, and displaced liability; and (6) Impact on the right to privacy.
The report was prepared in the framework of the Strategic Action Plan on Human Rights and Technologies in Biomedicine (2020-2025), regarding the governance of technologies and the objective of “Embedding human rights in the development of technologies which have an application in the field of biomedicine”.
The report, prepared by Brent Mittelstadt, Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), contributes to the future work of the Council of Europe work on AI in healthcare.

Dr Abdulsalam Salman, the Librarian, Kwara State University (KWASU) Malete, said the library will introduce Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to address the challenges of staff shortage in the Dept.
Salman Friday said that the introduction of robots was one of the ways of digitalising the services in the library.
“One of my missions is to see how we can fully digitalise the services in the library.      
“We are trying to introduce Artificial Intelligence and Robotics where we can use robots in providing library services.
“Instead of you interfacing with humans, robots will take over, so, the issue of understaffing that we have as a challenge will be taken care of,” the librarian said.
Dr Salman said he was working assiduously to ensure that no other University would beat KWASU to being the second university to use robots in the library after the University of Lagos.
“In Africa, University of Pretoria, South Africa, is already practising the use of robots to manage the library services and they are doing well.      
“In Nigeria, University of Lagos has also experimented it and it is a success story; so, I am working hard to ensure no other University beats us to it.
“In trying to put in place formidable internet services, we are already working with NITDA, NCC and some other ICT organisations.
“We also want to increase the bandwidth in such a way that documents can be downloaded in seconds.   Related News KWASU sanctions student over indecent skitProf. Shaykh-Lukman appointed KWASU VCKWASU warns public against admission racketeering 
“Also, the issue of power supply has to be sorted out; we have been running on diesel, we put on the generator by 10 a.m and put it off by 5 p.m.
“But if you want to go artificial intelligence, it has to be 24 hours. So, all those basic things must be put in place which we are working seriously on,” he said.
The librarian, however, allayed the fear that the introduction of robots would increase unemployment, but would rather make people sharpen their skills.
“It won’t increase unemployment because the use of machine is Garbage in, Garbage out, human effort is needed before a machine will work.      
“It is left for people to learn how to acquire such skills. In fact, more people will be needed to work on the machine, in terms of programming to make it work.
“Then in terms of maintenance and sustainability, one can’t just fold hands, people are still needed.
“So, the only people such ideas will affect are the lazy professionals who are not ready to upgrade their skills.
“We should learn to accept change because the world is moving at a jet speed.
“So, if you fold your hands and continue to be an analogue person, one will be left behind,” Dr Salman said.

Many artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to classify, organize or reason about data. Generative algorithms create data using models of the world to synthesize images, sounds and videos that often look increasingly realistic. The algorithms begin with models of what a world must be like and then they create a simulated world that fits the model.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Not all generative algorithms produce content. Some algorithms are deployed in user interfaces to enhance the screen or user interfaces. Others help the blind by generating audio descriptions. In  many applications, the techniques assist rather than take center stage. 
The algorithms are now common enough that developers make artistic decisions about their goals. Some aim for the most realistic output and judge it by how indistinguishable the people or animals may be from photographic footage of actual creatures. Others think like artists or animators and want to produce a more stylized product that is obviously not real but more like a cartoon. 
What are the dangers of generative AIs?
Some generative AI algorithms are good enough to deceive. These results, sometimes called “deep fakes,” may be used to masquerade as another person and commit all manners of fraud in their name. Some may try to imitate a person and withdraw money from a bank. Others may try to place words in another person’s mouth to frame them for a crime like libel, slander or more.
One particularly salacious approach involves generating pornography that seems to include another person. These results may be used for blackmail, coercion, extortion or revenge.

Can the results of generative AIs be distinguished from real images?
The results of modern algorithms are often very realistic but a trained eye can usually spot small differences. This is harder with some of the best algorithms that are often found in the best computer graphics for Hollywood movies with large budgets. 
The differences are often visible because the generated images are too perfect. The skin tone may follow a steady gradient. The hairs may all bend and wave in the same amounts with the same periods. The colors may be too consistent. 
One research project at MIT suggested looking at these areas for inconsistencies that could indicate the work of a generative AI:
Cheeks and foreheads: The wrinkles in these areas are often nonexistent. If there are wrinkles that are added, they don’t move in a realistic way. Shadows: In the areas around the eyes, the nose and an open mouth, the shadows are often poorly formed. They may not follow the lighting of the scene as the head changes position. Glasses: The position and angle of any lighting glare on the lenses should shift correctly as the head moves relative to the lights. Beards and mustaches: Do these move with the face? Are they all similar in shading and coloring, something that is rare in real life?Blinking: Do the eyes blink? Do they blink too often? Or not enough? Lips: Do they always move in the same way for all phonemes? Is the size and shape consistent with the rest of the face? Deep fake algorithms try to generate new positions of the lips for each word that is spoken and this leaves many opportunities for detection. If the process is too regular and repetitive, the lip movements may be generated by an algorithm. 
The research project at MIT also offers a chance for readers to explore various deep fakes and attempt to detect them. 
What are generative architectures? 
The area of creating realistic images, sounds and storylines is new and the focus of much active research. The approaches are varied and far from fixed. Scientists are still discovering new architectures and strategies today. 
One common approach is called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) because it depends on at least two different AI algorithms competing against each other and then converging upon a result. 
One algorithm, often a neural network, is responsible for creating a draft of a solution. It’s called the “generative network.” A second algorithm, also usually a neural network, evaluates the quality of the solution by comparing it to other realistic answers. This is often called the “discriminator network.” Sometimes there can be multiple versions of either the generator or discriminator. 
The entire process repeats a number of times and each side of the algorithm helps train the other. The generator learns which results are more acceptable. The discriminator learns which parts of the results are most likely to indicate realism. 
Another solution, sometimes called Transformers, avoids the adversarial approach. A single network is trained to produce the most realistic solutions. Microsoft has one, known as GPT-n for General, Pre-trained Network, that’s been trained over the years using large blocks of text gathered from Wikipedia and the general internet. The latest version, GPT-3, is closed source and licensed directly for many tasks including generative AI. It’s said to have more than 175 billion parameters. Several other similar models include Google’s  LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) and China’s Wu Dao 2.0. 
A third variety is sometimes called a “Variational Auto-Encoder.” These solutions depend upon compression algorithms that are designed to shrink data files using some of the patterns and structures within. These algorithms work in reverse, using random values to drive the creation. 
What are the political challenges of generative AI? 
Storytelling and fiction are old traditions that are well understood and usually harmless. Generating fake images, videos or audio recordings for political advantage is also an old tradition, but it is far from harmless. 
The greatest danger is that generative AI will be used to create fake news stories to influence the political decisions of leaders and citizens. Stories of atrocities, crimes and other forms of misbehavior are easy to concoct. When the AI is able to generate fake evidence, it becomes difficult or even impossible for people to make informed decisions. Truth becomes impossible to ascertain. 
For this reason, many believe that truly successful Generative AIs pose a very grave danger to the philosophical foundation of our political and personal lives.

Are computer game companies using generative AI? 
Many of the leaders in creating simulated visual scenes and audio are computer game companies. The companies that specialize in computer graphics have spent the last few decades creating more elaborate versions of reality that are increasingly realistic. There are dozens of good examples of computer games that allow the game player to imagine being in another realm.
The generative AI scientists often borrow many of the ideas and techniques from computer graphics and games. Still, many draw a distinction between generative AI and the world of computer gaming. 
One reason why the game companies are usually not mentioned is because they’ve relied heavily on human artists to create much of what we see on the screen. While they’ve been leaders in creating extensive graphics algorithms for rendering the scenes, most of the details were ultimately directed by humans. 
Generative AI algorithms seek to take over this role from the artists. The AI is responsible for structuring the scenes, choosing the elements and then arranging them inside it. While the rules inside the model may be crafted, in part, by some human, the goal is to make the algorithm the ultimate director or creator. 
How are market leaders using Generative AI? 
Amazon’s Web Services offers Polly, a tool for turning text into speech. The service offers three different tiers of service. The basic version uses tried and tested algorithms. The middle tier uses what it calls Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS) for an approach using neural networks that’s been tuned to deliver a neutral voice that’s common in news narration. The third version allows companies to create their own personalized voice for their brand so the speaking sound will be associated only with their products. 
Microsoft’s Github offers a service called CodeAssist that helps programmers by suggesting snippets of software that might help fill a gap. It’s been trained on more than a billion lines of code from public, open source git repositories. It can turn a short phrase or comment like “fetch tweets” into a full function by searching through its knowledge. The system, while much more intelligent than simple code completion, is still intended to just be an assistant for a human. The marketing literature calls it a co-pilot but “you’re the pilot.” 
Amazon also offers DeepComposer, an AI that can turn a short melody into a complete song. The system comes with pre-trained models that are designed to fit many of the common genres of music. The system is also meant to be an assistant for a human who first creates some simple musical segments and then guides the composition by adjusting some of the parameters for the machine learning algorithm. 
IBM uses some of its generative models to help with drug design. That is, they’re exploring how to train their AIs to imagine new molecules that may have the right shape to work as drugs. In particular, they’re looking for antimicrobial peptides that can target specific diseases. The marketing literature announces, “In just the field of drug discovery, it’s believed that there are some 1063 possible drug-like molecules in the universe. Trial and error can’t possibly get us through all those combinations.”
Many of the game companies are, by their very nature, experts at creating artificial worlds and building stories around them. Companies like Nintendo, Rockstar, Valve, Activision, Electronic Arts and Ubisoft are just a few of the major names. They are rarely discussed in the context of generative AI even though they’ve been creating and deploying many similar algorithms. Indeed, their expertise often goes back decades and originated before people used the term AI to describe their work. 
What about generative AI startups? 
Many of the startups and established companies that work with generative AI algorithms are in the gaming industry. Indeed, many of the video game companies have been actively pursuing creating the most realistic representations from the beginning. It’s fair to say that many, if not most, video game companies are involved in some form of Generative AI. 
Some, though, standout for their focus on using AI techniques. Respeacher is building voice cloning technology for the advertising, entertainment and video game businesses. Their machine learning technology begins with a sample voice and then learns all of the parameters so that new dialog can be rendered in this voice. 
Rephrase.ai, Synthesia, offers a full text-to-video solution that is used in the advertising industry to create customized or even personalized sales pitches. Their tools begin with models that learn how a person’s face moves for each phoneme and then use this to create synthetic video from the models. They also maintain a collection of stock models, some generated from celebrities who license their image.
D-ID tries to apply all of the lessons from creating deep fake in reverse. It will take a real video of a human and then remove many of the recognizable attributes like the position of the eyes or the shape of the nose. The idea is to offer some anonymization while retaining the essential message of the video. 
Rosebud.ai offers a full collection of synthetic algorithms that begin with a simple text description and then build models of humans or worlds that match the request. Their tools are used by people to explore creative ideas and then see them rendered. They ship versions as apps for iOS and Android. They are also bundling some creations as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be resold on various cryptocurrency marketplaces.  
Is there anything generative AI can’t do? 
The capability of a generative AI is largely in the eyes or ears or the beholders. Do the results feel real enough to serve a purpose? If it’s meant to be realistic, does it appear indistinguishable from a photograph? If it’s meant to be artistic or stylized, does it reach those artistic goals? 
The world of deep fakes is already delivering on the goal of distorting and replacing reality for people. Many are worried that some of these will destroy our ability to trust images or sound recordings because skilled purveyors will be able to create any version of the past that they would like. 
The implications for politics and the justice system are serious and many believe that it’s essential for counterfeit detection algorithms must also be available to battle this scourge. For now, many of the algorithms that can detect anomalies from the synthesis process are good enough to detect the deep fakes from well-known algorithms. 
The future, though, of detection could evolve into a cat-and-mouse game. The deep fake creators search for better algorithms that can evade detectors while the detection teams work to look for more telltale patterns that can flag synthetic results. 
Already the different techniques described above for detecting deep fakes are being turned into automated tools. While the deep fakes may fool some people initially, a concerted effort seems likely to be able to detect the fakes with enough accuracy, time and precision. Read more:Doubling down on AI: Pursue one clear path and beware two critical risks

What Is Semantic Analysis?
Semantic analysis refers to a process of understanding natural language (text) by extracting insightful information such as context, emotions, and sentiments from unstructured data. It gives computers and systems the ability to understand, interpret, and derive meanings from sentences, paragraphs, reports, registers, files, or any document of a similar kind.
Semantic analysis analyzes the grammatical format of sentences, including the arrangement of words, phrases, and clauses, to determine relationships between independent terms in a specific context. This is a crucial task of natural language processing (NLP) systems. It is also a key component of several machine learning tools available today, such as search engines, chatbots, and text analysis software.
The semantic analysis process begins by studying and analyzing the dictionary definitions and meanings of individual words also referred to as lexical semantics. Following this, the relationship between words in a sentence is examined to provide clear understanding of the context.
When fueled by natural language processing and machine learning, systems of semantic analysis tend to achieve human-level accuracy. Several companies rely heavily on semantic analysis-driven tools that automatically draw valuable data from unstructured data such as emails, client reports, and customer reviews.
Advantages of semantic analysis
Semantic analysis tech is highly beneficial for the customer service department of any company. Moreover, it is also helpful to customers as the technology enhances the overall customer experience at different levels. Let’s understand these key advantages in greater detail.
1. Gaining customer insights
Semantic analysis helps in processing customer queries and understanding their meaning, thereby allowing an organization to understand the customer’s inclination. Moreover, analyzing customer reviews, feedback, or satisfaction surveys helps understand the overall customer experience by factoring in language tone, emotions, and even sentiments.
2. Boosting company performance
Automated semantic analysis allows customer service teams to focus on complex customer inquiries that require human intervention and understanding. Also, machines can analyze the messages received on social media platforms, chatbots, and emails. This improves the overall productivity of the employees as the tech frees them from mundane tasks and allows them to concentrate on critical inquiries or operations.
3. Fine-tuning SEO strategy
Semantic analysis helps fine-tune the search engine optimization (SEO) strategy by allowing companies to analyze and decode users’ searches. For example, understanding users’ Google searches. The approach helps deliver optimized and suitable content to the users, thereby boosting traffic and improving result relevance.

How Does Semantic Analysis Work?
The semantic analysis method begins with a language-independent step of analyzing the set of words in the text to understand their meanings. This step is termed ‘lexical semantics‘ and refers to fetching the dictionary definition for the words in the text. Subsequently, words or elements are parsed. Each element is designated a grammatical role, and the whole structure is processed to cut down on any confusion caused by ambiguous words having multiple meanings.
Upon parsing, the analysis then proceeds to the interpretation step, which is critical for artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, the word ‘Blackberry’ could refer to a fruit, a company, or its products, along with several other meanings. Moreover, context is equally important while processing the language, as it takes into account the environment of the sentence and then attributes the correct meaning to it.
For example, ‘Blackberry is known for its sweet taste’ may directly refer to the fruit, but ‘I got a blackberry’ may refer to a fruit or a Blackberry product. As such, context is vital in semantic analysis and requires additional information to assign a correct meaning to the whole sentence or language.
Technically, semantic analysis involves:

Data processing.
Defining features, parameters, and characteristics of processed data
Data representation
Defining grammar for data analysis
Assessing semantic layers of processed data
Performing semantic analysis based on the linguistic formalism

How Does Semantic Analysis Work?
Critical elements of semantic analysis
The critical elements of semantic analysis are fundamental to processing the natural language:

Hyponyms: This refers to a specific lexical entity having a relationship with a more generic verbal entity called hypernym. For example, red, blue, and green are all hyponyms of color, their hypernym.
Meronomy: Refers to the arrangement of words and text that denote a minor component of something. For example, mango is a meronomy of a mango tree.
Polysemy: It refers to a word having more than one meaning. However, it is represented under one entry. For example, the term ‘dish’ is a noun. In the sentence, ‘arrange the dishes on the shelf,’ the word dishes refers to a kind of plate.
Synonyms: This refers to similar-meaning words. For example, abstract (noun) has a synonyms summary–synopsis.
Antonyms: This refers to words with opposite meanings. For example, cold has the antonyms warm and hot.
Homonyms: This refers to words with the same spelling and pronunciation, but reveal a different meaning altogether. For example, bark (tree) and bark (dog).

Apart from these vital elements, the semantic analysis also uses semiotics and collocations to understand and interpret language. Semiotics refers to what the word means and also the meaning it evokes or communicates. For example, ‘tea’ refers to a hot beverage, while it also evokes refreshment, alertness, and many other associations. On the other hand, collocations are two or more words that often go together. For example, fast food, dark chocolate, etc.
Machine learning algorithm-based automated semantic analysis
One can train machines to make near-accurate predictions by providing text samples as input to semantically-enhanced ML algorithms. Such estimations are based on previous observations or data patterns. Machine learning-based semantic analysis involves sub-tasks such as relationship extraction and word sense disambiguation.
Let’s understand each one in further detail:
1. Word sense disambiguation
In semantic analysis, word sense disambiguation refers to an automated process of determining the sense or meaning of the word in a given context. As natural language consists of words with several meanings (polysemic), the objective here is to recognize the correct meaning based on its use.
For example, ‘Raspberry Pi’ can refer to a fruit, a single-board computer, or even a company (UK-based foundation). Hence, it is critical to identify which meaning suits the word depending on its usage.
2. Relationship extraction
Relationship extraction is a procedure used to determine the semantic relationship between words in a text. In semantic analysis, relationships include various entities, such as an individual’s name, place, company, designation, etc. Moreover, semantic categories such as, ‘is the chairman of,’ ‘main branch located a’’, ‘stays at,’ and others connect the above entities.
Let’s consider a phrase as an example. ‘Elon Musk is one of the co-founders of Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas.’
This phrase illustrates two different relationships.
Elon Musk is the co-founder of Tesla
[Person]                          [Company]
Tesla is based in Austin, Texas
[Company]                [Place]
Semantic analysis techniques
The semantic analysis uses two distinct techniques to obtain information from text or corpus of data. The first technique refers to text classification, while the second relates to text extractor.
1. Semantic classification
Semantic classification implies text classification wherein predefined categories are assigned to the text for faster task completion. Following are the various types of text classification covered under semantic analysis:

Topic classification: This classifies text into preset categories on the basis of the content type. For example, customer support teams in a company may intend to classify the tickets raised by customers at the help desk into separate categories so that the concerned teams can address them. In this scenario, ML-based semantic analysis tools may recognize tickets based on their content and classify them under a ‘payment concern’ or ‘delayed delivery’ category.
Sentiment analysis: Today, sentiment analysis is used by several social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others to detect positive, negative, or neutral emotions hidden in text (posts, stories). These sentiments, in a way, denote urgency and may raise ‘call to action’ alarms for respective platforms. Sentiment analysis helps brands identify dissatisfied customers or users in real-time and gets a hint on what customers feel about the brand as a whole.
Intent classification: Intent classification refers to the classification of text based on customers’ intentions in the context of what they intend to do next. You can use it to tag customers as ‘interested’ or ‘not Interested’ to effectively reach out to those customers who may intend to buy a product or show an inclination toward buying it.

2. Semantic extraction
Semantic extraction refers to extracting or pulling out specific data from the text. Extraction types include:

Keyword extraction: This technique helps identify relevant terms and expressions in the text and gives deep insights when combined with the above classification techniques.
For example, one can analyze keywords in multiple tweets that have been labeled as positive or negative and then detect or extract words from those tweets that have been mentioned the maximum number of times. One can later use the extracted terms for automatic tweet classification based on the word type used in the tweets.


Entity extraction: As discussed in the earlier example, this technique is used to identify and extract entities in text, such as names of individuals, organizations, places, and others. This method is typically helpful for customer support teams who intend to extract relevant information from customer support tickets automatically, including customer name, phone number, query category, shipping details, etc.

Semantic analysis techniques and tools allow automated text classification or tickets, freeing the concerned staff from mundane and repetitive tasks. In the larger context, this enables agents to focus on the prioritization of urgent matters and deal with them on an immediate basis. It also shortens response time considerably, which keeps customers satisfied and happy.
Moreover, granular insights derived from the text allow teams to identify the areas with loopholes and work on their improvement on priority. By using semantic analysis tools, concerned business stakeholders can improve decision-making and customer experience.
For example, semantic analysis can generate a repository of the most common customer inquiries and then decide how to address or respond to them. It leads to high customer satisfaction levels.

Examples of Semantic Analysis
Semantic analysis plays a vital role in the automated handling of customer grievances, managing customer support tickets, and dealing with chats and direct messages via chatbots or call bots, among other tasks.
Let’s take a look at some of the known examples of semantic analysis:
Uber’s social listening
Uber uses semantic analysis to analyze users’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction levels via social listening. This implies that whenever Uber releases an update or introduces new features via a new app version, the mobility service provider keeps track of social networks to understand user reviews and feelings on the latest app release.
Thus, as and when a new change is introduced on the Uber app, the semantic analysis algorithms start listening to social network feeds to understand whether users are happy about the update or if it needs further refinement.
2. Google’s semantic algorithm – Hummingbird
Google incorporated ‘semantic analysis’ into its framework by developing its tool to understand and improve user searches. The Hummingbird algorithm was formed in 2013 and helps analyze user intentions as and when they use the google search engine. As a result of Hummingbird, results are shortlisted based on the ‘semantic’ relevance of the keywords. Moreover, it also plays a crucial role in offering SEO benefits to the company.
3. Cdiscount’s semantic analysis of customer reviews
Cdiscount, an online retailer of goods and services, uses semantic analysis to analyze and understand online customer reviews. When a user purchases an item on the ecommerce site, they can potentially give post-purchase feedback for their activity. This allows Cdiscount to focus on improving by studying consumer reviews and detecting their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the company’s products.
Cdiscount started using semantic analysis in 2019. It has immensely helped the company handle user queries associated with product deliveries and product returns.
4. Uber’s customer support platform to improve maps
Maps are essential to Uber’s cab services of destination search, routing, and prediction of the estimated arrival time (ETA). All these services perform well when the app renders high-quality maps. Along with services, it also improves the overall experience of the riders and drivers.
All factors considered, Uber uses semantic analysis to analyze and address customer support tickets submitted by riders on the Uber platform. The analysis can segregate tickets based on their content, such as map data-related issues, and deliver them to the respective teams to handle. The platform allows Uber to streamline and optimize the map data triggering the ticket.
5. IBM’s Watson conversation service
IBM’s Watson provides a conversation service that uses semantic analysis (natural language understanding) and deep learning to derive meaning from unstructured data. It analyzes text to reveal the type of sentiment, emotion, data category, and the relation between words based on the semantic role of the keywords used in the text. According to IBM, semantic analysis has saved 50% of the company’s time on the information gathering process.

Top 5 Applications of Semantic Analysis in 2022
According to a 2020 survey by Seagate technology, around 68% of the unstructured and text data that flows into the top 1,500 global companies (surveyed) goes unattended and unused. With growing NLP and NLU solutions across industries, deriving insights from such unleveraged data will only add value to the enterprises.
Semantic analysis methods will provide companies the ability to understand the meaning of the text and achieve comprehension and communication levels that are at par with humans.
These are the top five applications of semantic analysis in 2022:
1. Conversational chatbots
Chatbots are playing an essential role for most organizations. These chatbots act as semantic analysis tools that are enabled with keyword recognition and conversational capabilities. These tools help resolve customer problems in minimal time, thereby increasing customer satisfaction.
Chatbots help customers immensely as they facilitate shipping, answer queries, and also offer personalized guidance and input on how to proceed further. Moreover, some chatbots are equipped with emotional intelligence that recognizes the tone of the language and hidden sentiments, framing emotionally-relevant responses to them.
All in all, semantic analysis enables chatbots to focus on user needs and address their queries in lesser time and lower cost.
2. Automated ticketing support
As discussed earlier, semantic analysis is a vital component of any automated ticketing support. It understands the text within each ticket, filters it based on the context, and directs the tickets to the right person or department (IT help desk, legal or sales department, etc.).
Customers benefit from such a support system as they receive timely and accurate responses on the issues raised by them. Moreover, the system can prioritize or flag urgent requests and route them to the respective customer service teams for immediate action with semantic analysis.
3. Sentiment analysis
Several companies are using the sentiment analysis functionality to understand the voice of their customers, extract sentiments and emotions from text, and, in turn, derive actionable data from them. It helps capture the tone of customers when they post reviews and opinions on social media posts or company websites.
With sentiment analysis, companies can gauge user intent, evaluate their experience, and accordingly plan on how to address their problems and execute advertising or marketing campaigns. In short, sentiment analysis can streamline and boost successful business strategies for enterprises.
4. Search engine results
Search engines use semantic analysis to understand better and analyze user intent as they search for information on the web. Moreover, with the ability to capture the context of user searches, the engine can provide accurate and relevant results.
A ‘search autocomplete‘ functionality is one such type that predicts what a user intends to search based on previously searched queries. It saves a lot of time for the users as they can simply click on one of the search queries provided by the engine and get the desired result.
Also, ‘smart search‘ is another functionality that one can integrate with ecommerce search tools. The tool analyzes every user interaction with the ecommerce site to determine their intentions and thereby offers results inclined to those intentions.
5. Language translation
Today, semantic analysis methods are extensively used by language translators. Earlier, tools such as Google translate were suitable for word-to-word translations. However, with the advancement of natural language processing and deep learning, translator tools can determine a user’s intent and the meaning of input words, sentences, and context. All these parameters play a crucial role in accurate language translation.

Takeaway
As we enter the era of ‘data explosion,’ it is vital for organizations to optimize this excess yet valuable data and derive valuable insights to drive their business goals. Semantic analysis allows organizations to interpret the meaning of the text and extract critical information from unstructured data. Semantic-enhanced machine learning tools are vital natural language processing components that boost decision-making and improve the overall customer experience.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subdivision of AI. ML is the system of ""training"" computers by feeding them vast amounts of data and images and programming them to detect signs of potential danger, such as harmful cells shown in a scan. Already used extensively in the fields of pathology and oncology, ML diagnosis has been shown to have comparable levels of accuracy to that of experienced physicians. In some studies, ML has even been shown to surpass humans\' ability to diagnose diseases correctly. ""There are a lot of different uses of AI,"" says Ali Hashemi, chairman and co-founder of GluCare Integrated Diabetes Center in Dubai. ""The key is how to put it all together in a way that makes sense and [gives] actionable insights to both the care team and the physician. AI isn\'t the endpoint. It\'s a tool in your toolkit. What matters is how you use these tools to drive actionable insights for clinicians and patients."" Both common and dangerous, diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Untreated, sustained levels of high blood sugar from diabetes can damage the nervous system, eyes and organs, most typically the kidneys. Today, wearable AI devices like wireless-enabled wearable monitors such as the Fitbit are helping patients monitor their blood sugar levels. The FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System, currently being issued to diabetics by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, is one example of a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device that issues real-time alarms to the wearer when sugar levels are about to drop or spike. ""The range of biometrics or digital biomarkers that wearable [devices] are able to collect is ever-expanding,"" notes Hashemi. ""Those insights give me superhuman abilities as a clinician to have an amazing impact on my patients."" AI is also being used to help prevent blindness in people with diabetes. In his clinic, Hashemi uses an AI-powered ophthalmoscope to detect a condition called diabetic retinopathy. ""Diabetics, especially those who have been poorly controlled for quite a while, can end up with diabetic retinopathy, which is a degeneration of the retina, which can lead to blindness,"" explains Hashemi. ""The accuracy level or the precision of this device is pretty much as good as having an ophthalmologist do the screening. It has a sensitivity of about 96%."" Hashemi also points out that, besides aiding in accurate diagnosis and detection of diseases, AI is often far more cost-efficient than manual healthcare. Its development could therefore make medical treatment and care possible for more people, including those in developing countries, at a lower cost. Data governance remains one of the greatest challenges to integrating AI and healthcare. AI relies on personal medical data and, in most countries, access remains forbidden to third parties. However, the outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent need to prevent it from spreading has helped shift opinion regarding health data governance. According to a Wellcome Trust foundation survey in the UK, only 17% of the public are now against sharing their medical information in the post-pandemic world. Hashemi welcomes the change, saying: ""AI makes everyone more efficient and enables us to actually leverage humans better – and this is the really important point.""

Artificial Intelligence and its use cases in Automotive Industry




adminJune 17, 2022 6 minutes read  



Artificial Intelligence has been a blessing for multiple industries, hence the automotive industry is no exception. To accelerate automotive operations, AI is the key to unlock a sustainable future and enhancing productive customer experience.
Driverless cars around the nook and corner of the city might seem like a fool’s paradise in the past, but the advancement in technology and widespread use of AI all across the world have made it possible somehow. For instance, the biggest automotive leaders including Tesla, Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, and others are including AI to change the automotive workforce and make driving more convenient for users. Do you know, why?
 In the hyper-digital era, customers’ convenience and experience are the top priority to scale, And if your organization lags behind in the same, it’s high time to reimagine the automotive industry.
And advancements in AI have made a huge contribution to the growth of the automotive industry. 
As per Statista report, ” The global automotive intelligence market expected to reach at the size of 74.5 Billion US dollars in 2030”
Despite the revolution, artificial intelligence is bringing across the automotive industry, the automotive workforce needs to be tech-savvy within 5–50 years which is quite a challenge for the automotive industry in terms of upskilling the workforce. 
To add more to the figure, Elon Musk 2017 stated that “There will be an autonomous vehicle in the next 10 years without any steering wheel”. If believe the prediction, we are pretty much closer to the future of autonomous vehicles in the time frame of 5 more years.
Let’s get rolled and understand where we can use AI in the automotive business operations and processes for a better driving experience and improved quality control.
Top 7 Use Cases of AI and Machine Learning in the Automotive Industry
Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the core part of an automotive industry supply chain. A single error in the system can make or break the production process. But, using AI and Machine Learning algorithms can help automotive manufacturers to make the car-making process better and more efficient. For example, manual labour would pick parts from conveyer belts to complete the car-making process which leads to higher turnaround time and inefficiency. With AI-based systems and machine learning algorithms, robots can autonomously determine which part to pick, how to pick, and in which sequence, that’s makes the manufacturing process faster and better. Also, it reduces the amount of workforce required to complete the car-making process, And if there is any unexpected machine failure happen, robots can keep the humans in the loop for assistance and save any mishappening.
Design
To make the car driving experience user-friendly, manufacturers have to handle a lot of work right from brainstorming the car model to designing it exactly in the same way. With AI in space and computer modeling, automotive architects can perform real-time tracking, and programmable shading to transform the traditional design process. With faster real-time tracing and better design workflow, AI reduces the time spent on design approval and sanction. Also, Machine learning and AI image datasets help architects to generate hundreds of potential designs for better workflow and product ideas for autonomous vehicles.
Quality Control 
Manually done the vehicle inspection leads to higher turnaround time, slow error-prone, and sluggish process. And maintaining quality control is the topmost priority for keeping a higher customer count. AI-based data annotation and object detection help manufacturers keep an eye to detect the defect in the vehicles. By generating data collected from the AI sensors, the AI system can tell users and architects both which part requires maintenance and which part needs to be changed with immediate effect. In addition, AI-powered quality control systems also detect the possible flaws in parts before they get installed in vehicles. Isn’t it amazing like the future in hand?
Supply Chain
When it comes to the supply chain, the automotive industry is one of the most complex to handle with. Want to know why? On average, a single vehicle has almost 30000 distinct parts that arrive from different parts of the world across the globe. That makes the whole supply chain disruptive and the car-making process a struggle. Moreover, it’s vital for automotive manufacturers to monitor every stage of a component’s journey, and know exactly when to expect its arrival at the destination point. In this scenario, using an AI and Machine Learning powered supply chain can help manufacturers to create a fully automated system to make supply chain management decisions, adjusting routes and volumes to the predicted demand spikes for parts. 
Driver Experience
To stay competitive on the edge, automotive manufacturers are highly focused on the driving experience of a user. And to make it more effective, AI and training data can be a great help. Using an AI-powered Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) gives a major boost to the driving experience by helping with car locks, auto door locks, hands-free calls, and others. The benefits are not just stopped her. Using the ADAS system also helps drivers to gain insights on traffic and weather changes, the best routes on maps, and so much more. And all these benefits are highly possible by using object detection, training data models, and natural language processing techniques. With the ADAS system, an exciting time is ahead for autonomous vehicles.
Automotive Insurance
AI has a huge potential in the automotive industry for both insurers and drivers side together in case of an accident. The application of AI algorithms can speed up the process of insurance claims during an accident and mishap. On the driver’s side, AI capabilities like image datasets, and object detection can help drivers to gather incident data and fill out claims efficiently. On the other hand, insurers can use image processing and AI capability to do the vehicle damage analysis better to get rid of discrepancies and process the claims faster. 
Passenger Experience
In the digital era, customers today expect convenience in whatever they put their hand to. Considering passenger safety on road, automotive manufacturers are enhancing their vehicles with all kinds of AI-powered capabilities like image data, object identification, and NLP to upgrade their experience. With the image recognition model, drivers can easily scan the state of the driver and get their full information with a click. Also, by using speck commands passengers can easily listen to music, watch movies, order food, and others while being on the road. 
Benefits of AI in the Automotive Industry

Artificial Intelligence has been a blessing for multiple industries, hence the automotive industry is no exception. To accelerate automotive operations, AI is the key to unlock a sustainable future and enhancing productive customer experience.



Driverless cars around the nook and corner of the city might seem like a fool’s paradise in the past, but the advancement in technology and widespread use of AI all across the world have made it possible somehow. For instance, the biggest automotive leaders including Tesla, Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, and others are including AI to change the automotive workforce and make driving more convenient for users. Do you know, why?



&nbsp;In the hyper-digital era, customers' convenience and experience are the top priority to scale, And if your organization lags behind in the same, it's high time to reimagine the automotive industry.



And advancements in AI have made a huge contribution to the growth of the automotive industry.&nbsp;



As per Statista report, ” The global automotive intelligence market expected to reach at the size of 74.5 Billion US dollars in 2030”



Despite the revolution, artificial intelligence is bringing across the automotive industry, the automotive workforce needs to be tech-savvy within 5–50 years which is quite a challenge for the automotive industry in terms of upskilling the workforce.&nbsp;



To add more to the figure, Elon Musk 2017 stated that “There will be an autonomous vehicle in the next 10 years without any steering wheel”. If believe the prediction, we are pretty much closer to the future of autonomous vehicles in the time frame of 5 more years.



Let’s get rolled and understand where we can use AI in the automotive business operations and processes for a better driving experience and improved quality control.



Top 7 Use Cases of AI and Machine Learning in the Automotive Industry



Manufacturing



Manufacturing is the core part of an automotive industry supply chain. A single error in the system can make or break the production process. But, using AI and Machine Learning algorithms can help automotive manufacturers to make the car-making process better and more efficient. For example, manual labour would pick parts from conveyer belts to complete the car-making process which leads to higher turnaround time and inefficiency. With AI-based systems and machine learning algorithms, robots can autonomously determine which part to pick, how to pick, and in which sequence, that's makes the manufacturing process faster and better. Also, it reduces the amount of workforce required to complete the car-making process, And if there is any unexpected machine failure happen, robots can keep the humans in the loop for assistance and save any mishappening.



Design



To make the car driving experience user-friendly, manufacturers have to handle a lot of work right from brainstorming the car model to designing it exactly in the same way. With AI in space and computer modeling, automotive architects can perform real-time tracking, and programmable shading to transform the traditional design process. With faster real-time tracing and better design workflow, AI reduces the time spent on design approval and sanction. Also, Machine learning and AI image datasets help architects to generate hundreds of potential designs for better workflow and product ideas for autonomous vehicles.



Quality Control 



Manually done the vehicle inspection leads to higher turnaround time, slow error-prone, and sluggish process. And maintaining quality control is the topmost priority for keeping a higher customer count. AI-based data annotation and object detection help manufacturers keep an eye to detect the defect in the vehicles. By generating data collected from the AI sensors, the AI system can tell users and architects both which part requires maintenance and which part needs to be changed with immediate effect. In addition, AI-powered quality control systems also detect the possible flaws in parts before they get installed in vehicles. Isn’t it amazing like the future in hand?



Supply Chain



When it comes to the supply chain, the automotive industry is one of the most complex to handle with. Want to know why? On average, a single vehicle has almost 30000 distinct parts that arrive from different parts of the world across the globe. That makes the whole supply chain disruptive and the car-making process a struggle. Moreover, it's vital for automotive manufacturers to monitor every stage of a component's journey, and know exactly when to expect its arrival at the destination point. In this scenario, using an AI and Machine Learning powered supply chain can help manufacturers to create a fully automated system to make supply chain management decisions, adjusting routes and volumes to the predicted demand spikes for parts.&nbsp;



Driver Experience



To stay competitive on the edge, automotive manufacturers are highly focused on the driving experience of a user. And to make it more effective, AI and training data can be a great help. Using an AI-powered Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) gives a major boost to the driving experience by helping with car locks, auto door locks, hands-free calls, and others. The benefits are not just stopped her. Using the ADAS system also helps drivers to gain insights on traffic and weather changes, the best routes on maps, and so much more. And all these benefits are highly possible by using object detection, training data models, and natural language processing techniques. With the ADAS system, an exciting time is ahead for autonomous vehicles.

In the digital era, customers today expect convenience in whatever they put their hand to. Considering passenger safety on road, automotive manufacturers are enhancing their vehicles with all kinds of AI-powered capabilities like image data, object identification, and NLP to upgrade their experience. With the image recognition model, drivers can easily scan the state of the driver and get their full information with a click. Also, by using speck commands passengers can easily listen to music, watch movies, order food, and others while being on the road.&nbsp;

There’s a joke in Silicon Valley about how AI was developed: Privileged coders were building machine learning algorithms to replace their own doting parents with apps that deliver their meals, drive them to work, automate their shopping, manage their schedules, and tuck them in at bedtime.
As whimsical as that may sound, AI-driven services often target a demographic that mirrors its creators: white, male workers with little time and more disposable income than they know what to do with. “People living in very different circumstances have very different needs and wants that may or may not be helped by this technology,” says Kanta Dihal at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence in England. She is an expert in an emerging effort to decolonize AI by promoting an intersectional definition of intelligent machines that is created for and relevant to a diverse population. Such a shift requires not only diversifying Silicon Valley, but the understanding of AI’s potential, who it stands to help, and how people want to be helped.

Biased algorithms have made headlines in many industries. Apple Health failed to include a menstrual cycle tracking feature until 2015. Leaders at Amazon, where automation reigns supreme, scrapped efforts to harness AI to sift through resumes in 2018 after discovering their algorithm favored men, downvoting resumes with all-female colleges or mentions of women’s sports teams. In 2019, researchers discovered that a popular algorithm used to determine whether medical care was required was racially biased, recommending less care for Black patients than equally ill white patients because it calculated patient risk scores based on individuals’ annual medical costs. Because Black patients had, on average, less access to medical care, their costs were artificially low, and the algorithm faultily associated Blackness with less need for medical treatment. 
Industries like banking have been more successful than others in implementing equitable AI (think: creating new standards for the use of AI and developing systems of internal checks and balances against bias), according to Anjana Susarla, the Omura-Saxena Professor in Responsible AI at Michigan State University. Health care and criminal justice, where algorithms have shown racial bias in predicting recidivism, are more troubling examples. Susarla says decolonizing AI will require the collective oversight of boards of directors, legislators, and regulators, not to mention those who implement and monitor the day-to-day outcomes of AI in every industry—not just the techies behind the tools.
“You have to have some separation between the person who created the AI and the person who can take some responsibility for the consequences that will arise when they are implementing it,” Susarla says.
The myth of the lone genius
Science fiction films and TV shows and even stock images portray AI as white, plastic robots, often created by a white male protagonist. (Try a Google search for “intelligent machines” to test this.) Instead of showing legions of engineers and developers behind the scenes working toward new technologies, Dihal says tech heroes are painted as workaholic loner-heroes.

Joy Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League to spotlight and rectify bias in facial recognition algorithms. Niccolò Caranti
In a 2020 study, Dihal and her University of Cambridge co-author Stephen Cave found that these media portrayals perpetuate racial stereotypes, threaten to position white robots above people of color, and situate AI in the public consciousness as a white-collar issue. As AI touches nearly every facet of our society, decolonizing it will require widespread changes to everyday narratives, including fictional ones, as well as the tech itself.
When it comes to tasks like content moderation or image recognition, “people often don’t know how many hours of manual labor have gone into it, or how many hours are still going into it,” Dihal says. Instead, users wrongly attribute unseen human labor to intelligent machines.  
But tech giants require huge workforces, and often “reinforce or reawaken colonial power structures” in the process of engaging their workforces, Dihal continues. She points to tech leaders who employ legions of low-paid “click workers” in India, China, or the United States, where they complete micro tasks like labeling or verifying images online to train AI algorithms. The work is low-paid, often below minimum wage, and can be sporadic, with micro tasks popping online at odd hours, according to online reviewers of Clickworker, a firm that matches online workers with these tasks. Companies like Clickworker promise work-from-home freedom, though a 2017 study found clickworkers netted just $3.31 per hour.
There are also people, like delivery workers, who are part of AI whether they like it or not. “Those people don’t have power or don’t have the authority to either buck the system or not be part of it,” says Amber Thompson, founder of de-bias, an AI-driven public review platform that measures business outcomes against a range of social issues.
Higher-paid workers, like software developers, software engineers, and UX (user experience) engineers may come from all over the world, Dihal says. “But still, in the C-suite, higher up in the pipeline, the gender balance and the ethnicity balance very quickly skew toward white male.” 
AI needs a human touch
Fortunately, for now, an all-knowing AI that can efficiently solve problems without human intervention is more media construct than reality, according to Dihal. AI needs human oversight.
“Efficiency is very important, but efficiency means cutting corners,” says Susarla, who consults with companies implementing AI. When the focus is solely on tactical performance, she says, “we should understand that it’s not always going to make things better.” Sometimes, simple algorithms yield the most accurate AI. 
 “There will always be bias. De-biasing is the process to mitigate those biases before they happen.”
But merely replacing white software developers with techies of color isn’t a fix, according to Thompson. “If your actual process doesn’t mean you have to listen, respond, or include [people], then it’s the same thing only it’s worse because now you’ve tokenized people and you’ve probably created a more biased product.”
At de-bias, that means gathering data about the impacts of a company’s actions from leadership, employees, board members, community members, and other stakeholders, then creating a rubric to measure equity efforts, employee wellbeing (everything from health insurance to homeownership), community development, advocacy efforts, and more, with an eye to change. “There will always be bias,” Thompson says. “De-biasing is the process to mitigate those biases before they happen.” Like so much of decolonizing AI, it requires a ton of input from a wide range of people.
Thompson says truly decolonized AI is impossible without collective action to topple tech giants like Google or Twitter, particularly when shareholder ROI has so much sway, so she’s currently focusing de-bias on smaller startups. Susarla hopes that a combination of compliance with existing civil rights legislation, new governmental regulations, and corporate self-governance (think: boards of directors that provide oversight to AI initiatives, gauging outcomes against the company’s mission and values) will aid AI’s evolution.
Ultimately, Susarla says, equitable AI is explainable. It’s not a white robot that mysteriously announces its findings. If an algorithm determines you’re not eligible for a mortgage, a loan officer should be able to explain why. If a stack of resumes never makes it to HR, hiring agents should be able to articulate how candidates are evaluated. “How much does a person have to change themselves to function with technological systems that increasingly govern our lives?” wrote computer scientist and poet Joy Buolamwini in a 2019 Time editorial. Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League to spotlight and rectify bias in facial recognition algorithms. In a world increasingly laced with AI everything, it will take a growing number of voices—and especially those from marginalized groups—to determine when, how, and whether we correct it.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual learning forced the industry to shift. AI helps streamline the student education process by offering access to suitable courses, bettering communication with tutors, and giving them more time to focus on other life aspects..AI enhances the personalization of student learning programs and courses, promotes tutoring by helping students improve their weak spots and sharpen their skills, ensures quick responses between teachers and students, and enhances universal 24/7 learning access. Educators can use AI for task automation, including administrative work, evaluating learning patterns, grading papers, responding to general queries, and more. Here are eight ways AI is used in education..1. Creating courses.A lot of time and money goes into creating learning courses via a central department. The use of AI streamlines the course creation process, speeding up the process and reducing costs. Whether you're using premade templates or starting from scratch, AI software for creating courses can help create interactive content seamlessly. You can efficiently work with your entire team via in-app comments from reviewers and co-authors to create perfect training material..AI simplifies and accelerates course development. By assessing student learning history and abilities, AI gives teachers a clear picture of the lessons and subjects requiring reevaluation. Teachers alter their courses by evaluating every student's specific needs to address common knowledge gaps. This enables teachers to develop the best learning programs for all students..2. Offering personalized learning.Personalization is a significant trend in education. AI gives students a customized learning approach depending on their unique preferences and experiences. AI can adjust to every student's knowledge level, desired goals, and learning speed to help get the most out of their learning. Additionally, AI-powered solutions can assess a student's learning history, pinpoint weaknesses, and provide courses suitable for improvement, offering many opportunities for personalized learning experiences..3. Enabling universal access.AI breaks down the silos between schools and traditional grade levels. Through AI tools, classrooms are now globally available to students, including those with visual or hearing impairment or who use different languages. Using a PowerPoint plugin like Presentation Translator, learners get real-time subtitles for all the teacher says, opening up new possibilities for the learners who have to learn at varying levels, want to learn subjects that aren't in their school, or are absent from school..4.  Pinpointing where courses should be improved.Teachers may not always know the gaps in their educational materials and lectures, which can confuse learners regarding particular concepts. AI provides a way to solve this issue. For instance, Coursera is already applying this. When many students give the wrong answers to their homework assignments, the system alerts the professor and offers future students customized messages that provide hints to the correct answer..This kind of system fills the gaps in explanation in courses and ensures every student is building a similar conceptual foundation. Instead of waiting to hear from the teacher, students receive immediate feedback to help them understand concepts better..5. Automation tasks.Teachers usually have a lot to manage, including classes and other administrative and organizational tasks. They grade tests, evaluate homework, fill the needed paperwork, make progress reports, organize lecture resources and materials, manage teaching materials, and more. This means they might spend too much time on non-teaching activities, leaving them overwhelmed. With the help of automation tools and solutions, educators can automate manual processes giving them more time to concentrate on teaching key competencies..6. Providing tutoring support.Intelligent tutoring systems, including AI chatbots and tutors, and tutoring programs are designed to handle customized feedback and guidelines for one-on-one teaching. Nonetheless, they can't replace teachers because they aren't advanced enough to teach the way humans can. They help in cases where teachers aren't available for subjects that can be taught and assessed online..AI is an effective tool that e-learning platforms can use to teach geography, languages, circuits, computer programming, medical diagnosis, physics, mathematics, chemistry, genetics, and more. They're equipped to consider engagement, grading metrics, and comprehension. AI tools help students sharpen their skills while improving weak areas outside the classroom..7. Promoting virtual learning.A virtual learning environment can provide group educational experiences, offer counseling services to students, and facilitate immersive learning experiences. With VR technologies, learners can directly connect their laptops or mobile devices to access the content. Using VR headsets, students with ADHD/ ADD can block distractions and increase concentration spans. In addition, students can help others in soft skill coaching, self-development, and life skills with interactive simulations..8. Creating smart content.Smart content may include digital guides, textbooks, videos, instructional snippets, and AI, which develop customized environments for learning organizations depending on goals and strategies. Personalization in the education sector is a future world trend that can be achieved by pinpointing the areas where AI solutions can play a role. For instance, an educational institution can establish an AR/VR-based learning environment and web-based lessons to go with it..Endnote.AI has revolutionized the education industry. Familiarize yourself with these ways AI is used in education..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance. Also note that the cryptocurrencies mentioned/listed on the website could potentially be scams, i.e. designed to induce you to invest financial resources that may be lost forever and not be recoverable once investments are made.

Sci-fi books and movies going all the way back to Kurt Vonnegut’s Player Piano portray a world where workers have been replaced by machines (or in some instances, just one machine). More recently, these ideas have moved from the annals of novels into the predictive economic papers of governments and consulting firms. In 2016, the Obama administration authored a report warning that the robots were coming, and that millions of Americans could soon be out of a job. In 2021, McKinsey predicted that algorithms and androids would vaporize 45 million jobs by 2030. And the Brookings Institute prophesied in a 2019 study that 52 million U.S. jobs would be affected by algorithms by 2030. While no one can agree on exactly when the robots will take over, or how many jobs they will swallow up, the assumption has generally been that garbage collectors, bus drivers, and interstate truckers will be among the first to lose their livelihoods to A.I. Lately, however, it’s starting to look as if people like me—creatives—are even more imminently in danger. Over the past few months, new advancements in A.I. have made it clear that writers, illustrators, photographers, journalists, and novelists could soon be driven from the workforce and replaced by high-tech player pianos.Don’t believe me? Just read the opening of this short story:It was late when I first heard the loud clicking noise coming from outside. As I looked out of my bedroom window, the tall grass swayed in an unseen breeze. And then, a shadow passed over it—which is when I saw it. A creature standing just outside the window, staring right at me. Its eyes were deep red with a venomous glow; they seemed to burn with a fire that made me shudder. The creature’s body was black as coal, with a large, thin tail near its rear. It hissed at me and tapped its long, sharp claws impatiently on a tree trunk. I grabbed the nearest weapon I could find—a baseball bat—and headed outside. The creature’s breath reeked of sulfur, and its hushed breathing carried an echo of a crackling campfire. When it saw me, its feet hit the soil with thundering booms as if a skyscraper had crashed to the earth with each footfall. It lunged forward at me; its claws slashing wildly in the air.AdvertisementThat paragraph wasn’t written by an MFA, or a sci-fi author, but rather by a new online machine-learning platform called Sudowrite, which is billed as a tool to help with the creative-writing process. For the above paragraph, I wrote the first sentence—about the loud clicking noise—and the A.I. wrote the rest. The technology works using a platform from OpenAI, an artificial-intelligence research laboratory with a billion dollars in funding from Microsoft, and investments from Elon Musk. More specifically, it’s built on GPT-3, a component of the company that focuses on text. GPT-3 scrapes billions of words and learns from them using natural-language processing. Then, it gets to work. After reading Sudowrite’s first draft, I said I wanted more description. So the A.I. suggested we add some “smells,” and revised the text accordingly in a few seconds. While the story isn’t Pulitzer Prize–worthy (yet), I was startled by the algorithm’s ability to turn phrases like “the tall grass swayed in an unseen breeze” and “its hushed breathing carried an echo of a crackling campfire.”HiveWhere Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley meet.Enter your e-mailSign UpBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Advancements in writing are just the beginning. Another OpenAI tool currently being likened to magic by people in Silicon Valley is a visual platform called Dall-E. Using a version of GPT-3, Dall-E can create truly astounding renditions of artworks and illustrations. Like GPT-3, Dall-E has learned how to draw and paint by combing through billions of images. It’s now conversant in styles, objects, shapes—you name it. Just type a set of commands into Dall-E, and it will nearly instantaneously generate an image to illustrate them. For example, if you ask it to draw “an astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style,” it will create several options to choose from. If you tell it to instead make a “pencil drawing,” it will render new images in that style. You can order up stained glass, spray paint, Play-Doh, cave drawings, or paintings in the style of Monet. You can replace the astronaut with a teddy bear. A dog. Elon Musk. Or have the horse riding a horse. The possibilities are endless, and the end results are terrifyingly impressive—so much so that one of the top questions associated with a Google search of the platform is “Is Dall-E fake?”Watch Now: Andy Serkis Breaks Down a Fight Scene from 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage'These new technologies have scrambled our assumptions about creativity and computers. Philosophers have long believed that computers would never be able to create “art” because machines don’t have emotions. They don’t feel pain or joy; therefore, they can’t express those feelings in a creative way. As it turns out, however, computers don’t need feelings to make art. They can simply copy what humans have already made. “It’s not so much that the computer is ‘thinking’ like a human artist,” said Hod Lipson, a scientist who specializes in artificial intelligence and robotics at Columbia University. “It’s more that they are producing output based on what they have seen.”Now, I have to be honest. I didn’t interview Hod Lipson. I didn’t even search the web for his quote. Instead, I asked another GPT-3-powered program called ShortlyAI to write a post for me about algorithms replacing journalists and artists. The algorithm found Lipson’s work, read his research papers, videos, talks, and interviews, and selected this quote as the most compelling to add to this piece. When I reached out to Lipson to see if this was something he said, and that the A.I. hadn’t just made it up, Lipson said it was accurate, but noted that a more accurate point would be to say that “it’s more that, like a human, the computer too is producing output based on what it has experienced.” Here’s what else the A.I. wrote:Most PopularAward SeasonViggo Mortensen Speaks His Mind: On Amazon’s “Shameful” Decision, Green Book’s “Disingenuous” Critics, and Indie Film’s Unclear FutureBy David CanfieldCelebrityMethod Man Talks Wu-Tang Clan, Working With ODB’s Son, and the “Uncomfortable Subject” of Martin Shkreli’s Auctioned AlbumBy Lisa RobinsonMoviesAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in NightbitchBy Hillary BusisRobots, machine learning, and other A.G.I.s (artificial general intelligence) will soon be writing daily news stories about stocks, sports scores, weather-related events and a variety of breaking news alerts. In the next decade or less, artificial intelligence will make huge strides in their capability to produce high-quality written news. This will bring an end to the era of the journalist as we know it. The difference between A.G.I.s and journalists is the ability to comprehend and absorb information, not just to report it. An A.G.I. will be able to understand the “what” of a story, as well as its “why,” without breaking a sweat over details, because it simply doesn’t care about them in terms of story-writing.

      See, now you’re wondering which parts of this column I wrote, and which ones were written by a computer. Amit Gupta, the cofounder of Sudowrite, believes that these writing platforms won’t completely replace humans. Instead, this new tech will supplement our all-too-human efforts, not unlike the way the predictive text on an iPhone does. “Financial reporting and sports reporting will be the first to be sent to automation because they are a little bit more rote,” Gupta said, but he thinks that most journalism will be produced in conjunction with, rather than completely by, A.I.—at least for the foreseeable future. “Auto-complete is already kind of working its way into Google Docs and Gmail; that type of A.I. writing is going to be ubiquitous, so as I’m writing a story, it will say, ‘Oh, here’s a potential quote.’” (Yes, I did actually interview Gupta for this piece.)GPT-3 is far from perfect. It can be wonky, repetitive, even racist. As TechCrunch noted in 2020, GPT-3 language models have associated the word Islam with terrorism, and female pronouns with the word naughty. That’s because it’s crawling text that has been written by humans in the past. These platforms are learning not from other A.I. entities but from us—which has its upsides from a creative standpoint, and its downsides from a humans-are-jerks perspective. Dall-E’s own documentation warns that words like personal assistant and flight attendant will generate images of women, and words like CEO will likely give you white men.Those issues may give you and me pause, but they aren’t doing much to slow the technology’s evolution. Last week, Google announced its own text-to-image platform, called Imagen, which is just as impressive (and scary) as Dall-E. If anything, Imagen’s photorealistic images are even more indistinguishable from the real thing.For now, the companies behind these image platforms aren’t making them available to the public—mostly while they work out the kinks, but also, as Google has noted, while they work on ways to prevent the software from being used for nefarious purposes. “Datasets of this nature often reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups,” Google said in its latest announcement about its software. “[This] guides our decision to not release Imagen for public use without further safeguards in place.”Once these services are publicly available, all bets will be off. Think about the speed with which fake news obliterated trust in the journalism landscape online during the 2016 election cycle. An A.I. that can create fake images indistinguishable from real ones could have disastrous effects on the public’s ability to separate fact from fiction. I don’t even want to imagine what kind of horrifying imagery the QAnon folks could dream up, let alone the denizens of 4Chan and other bowels of the internet. I’m sure Russia would have a field day with this tech too. As with all new technologies, there will be good and bad results. The question is, will the creators of these platforms be able to discover the negatives before this tech is released into the public? (Which, let’s be honest, has never happened before in technological history.) Perhaps it will take years to foresee all the potential outcomes of these services. There’s a fun irony in the thought that the only thing saving our jobs from being replaced by algorithms is the fear that humans will do terrible things with the technology.Some early experiments point to positive and creative applications. GPT-3 was recently used to create a new song with lyrics written and rapped by an A.I. Eminem—it isn’t half bad. There’s also an A.I.-written play now being performed in London that supposedly asks what technology can teach us about ourselves. (A notice to ticket buyers warns ominously that the play “may contain strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.”) One group, called Calamity A.I., is using GPT-3 to write screenplays that are then filmed with actors—as you can see from “Lady Bird: A Lost Scene Written by Artificial Intelligence,” the A.I. isn’t quite at the level of Greta Gerwig. But the same software did come up with a relatively delicious chocolate-chip-cookie recipe. There are other iterations of OpenAI technology used to generate music from scratch, like Jukebox, which can write its own music, including singing and instruments in numerous genres and styles.As someone who has been covering new technologies for more than 20 years, I’ve seen a lot of contraptions, apps, sites, platforms, and newfangled inventions, and few have ever felt like they would change the way we live. Twitter, the iPhone, and driverless cars have been among the handful of standouts. The more I see of these new machine-learning algorithms, though, the more I realize that the future is coming quickly. And in that future, a good number of people could lose their jobs—not to mention their grasp of what originated in the mind of a human or a machine. Soon, you’ll be asking yourself every time you read an article, Did a human write this, or did an algorithm? The answer is: You’ll never know.More Great Stories From Vanity FairWhere Do the Obamas Stand on Joe Biden? “The Silence Is Deafening”Peter Thiel, J.D.

Instead, this new tech will supplement our all-too-human efforts, not unlike the way the predictive text on an iPhone does. “Financial reporting and sports reporting will be the first to be sent to automation because they are a little bit more rote,” Gupta said, but he thinks that most journalism will be produced in conjunction with, rather than completely by, A.I.—at least for the foreseeable future. “Auto-complete is already kind of working its way into Google Docs and Gmail; that type of A.I. writing is going to be ubiquitous, so as I’m writing a story, it will say, ‘Oh, here’s a potential quote.’” (Yes, I did actually interview Gupta for this piece.)
Those issues may give you and me pause, but they aren’t doing much to slow the technology’s evolution. Last week, Google announced its own text-to-image platform, called Imagen, which is just as impressive (and scary) as Dall-E. If anything, Imagen’s photorealistic images are even more indistinguishable from the real thing.
For now, the companies behind these image platforms aren’t making them available to the public—mostly while they work out the kinks, but also, as Google has noted, while they work on ways to prevent the software from being used for nefarious purposes. “Datasets of this nature often reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups,” Google said in its latest announcement about its software. “[This] guides our decision to not release Imagen for public use without further safeguards in place.”
Once these services are publicly available, all bets will be off. Think about the speed with which fake news obliterated trust in the journalism landscape online during the 2016 election cycle. An A.I. that can create fake images indistinguishable from real ones could have disastrous effects on the public’s ability to separate fact from fiction. I don’t even want to imagine what kind of horrifying imagery the QAnon folks could dream up, let alone the denizens of 4Chan and other bowels of the internet. I’m sure Russia would have a field day with this tech too. As with all new technologies, there will be good and bad results. The question is, will the creators of these platforms be able to discover the negatives before this tech is released into the public? (Which, let’s be honest, has never happened before in technological history.) Perhaps it will take years to foresee all the potential outcomes of these services. There’s a fun irony in the thought that the only thing saving our jobs from being replaced by algorithms is the fear that humans will do terrible things with the technology.
Some early experiments point to positive and creative applications. GPT-3 was recently used to create a new song with lyrics written and rapped by an A.I. Eminem—it isn’t half bad. There’s also an A.I.-written play now being performed in London that supposedly asks what technology can teach us about ourselves. (A notice to ticket buyers warns ominously that the play “may contain strong language, homophobia, racism, sexism, ableism, and references to sex and violence.”) One group, called Calamity A.I., is using GPT-3 to write screenplays that are then filmed with actors—as you can see from “Lady Bird: A Lost Scene Written by Artificial Intelligence,” the A.I. isn’t quite at the level of Greta Gerwig. But the same software did come up with a relatively delicious chocolate-chip-cookie recipe. There are other iterations of OpenAI technology used to generate music from scratch, like Jukebox, which can write its own music, including singing and instruments in numerous genres and styles.
As someone who has been covering new technologies for more than 20 years, I’ve seen a lot of contraptions, apps, sites, platforms, and newfangled inventions, and few have ever felt like they would change the way we live. Twitter, the iPhone, and driverless cars have been among the handful of standouts. The more I see of these new machine-learning algorithms, though, the more I realize that the future is coming quickly. And in that future, a good number of people could lose their jobs—not to mention their grasp of what originated in the mind of a human or a machine. Soon, you’ll be asking yourself every time you read an article, Did a human write this, or did an algorithm?

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of artificial intelligence in the corporate world and in modern human lives. Serhii Pospielov, AI practice lead at Exadel, examines the top ten challenges enterprises face in AI development and implementation and shares ten ways to overcome them.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating the business world across different industries, from banking and finance to healthcare and media, with goals to improve efficiency and increase profitability, among others. 
Fifty percent of respondents in The state of AI in 2020Opens a new window  global survey by McKinsey reported that “their companies have adopted AI in at least one business function”; the numbers are forecasted to keep growing in the coming years, doubling the revenues generated by AI. 
Companies are going to continue implementing AI in business. However, despite its huge potential, AI also creates development and implementation challenges. 
Ten Challenges (and Solutions) for AI Implementation and Development
If you’re thinking of artificial intelligence app development for your company, you’ll likely come across some obstacles. Understanding them beforehand may ease your work. These are the most common problems with AI development and implementation you might encounter and ways in which you can manage them:
1. Determining the right data set 
Data quality and availability are necessities for AI capabilities. For a company to ensure the most efficient and timely AI capabilities, it should use the right data sets and have a trusted source of relevant data that are clean, accessible, well-governed, and secured. Unfortunately, it is impossible to configure AI algorithms to control the flow of low-quality and inaccurate data; but businesses can get in touch with AI experts and work with the owners of different data sources to overcome the challenges of implementing AI. 
2. The bias problem
The quality of AI systems depends on the data they are trained on. Good data are key to good artificial intelligence development services. If good data are lacking, companies face numerous AI implementation challenges stemming from biases — anomalies in the output of ML algorithmsOpens a new window  when producing results based on discriminatory assumptions made during the machine learning process or prejudices in the training data. Low-quality data often go along with racial, gender, communal, and ethnic biases.
Such biases must be eliminated. Real change may come either from training the AI systems with unbiased data or from the development of easily-explained algorithms that can be easily read. Furthermore, many companies that develop artificial intelligence invest heavily in developing control frameworks and techniques to drive better trust and transparency and to identify bias in AI algorithms.
3. Data security and storage
Most artificial intelligence development services rely on the availability of large amounts of data to train the algorithms. Although generating large volumes of data provides better business opportunities, on the one hand, it simultaneously creates data storage and security issues on the other. The more data is generated and the more users have access, the higher the chances of data leakage into the hands of someone on the dark web. Data security and data storage issues have reached a global scale, as this data is generated from millions of users around the globe. This is why businesses need to ensure that the best data management environment for sensitive data and training algorithms for AI applications are being used.

4. Infrastructure
Artificial intelligence-based solutions change our lives and provide daily utility through high internet speeds. AI systems achieve these speeds under the condition that a company has suitable infrastructure and premium processing capabilities. However, most organizations still rely on outdated infrastructures, applications, and devices to run their IT operations, as management often gets scared of the expenses needed to update the systems, choosing instead to reject implementing AI at all. Although companies that develop artificial intelligence or adopt it should be ready to bring their IT services to a new level, replacing outdated infrastructure with traditional legacy systems remains one of the biggest challenges for many IT companies.
5. AI integration
Challenges with implementing AI in business first arise from the necessity of integrating AI into existing systems. It requires the support of AI solutions providers with extensive experience and expertise. Transitioning to AI is more complicated than just adding new plugins to the current website. Infrastructure, data storage, and data input should be considered and secured from negative effects. Compatibility with all AI requirements, as well as smooth operation of the current systems, must be ensured. Additionally, once the transition is over, the employees must be given proper training on working with the new system.
6. Computation
The information technology industry encounters many challenges and constantly needs to keep updating. No other industry has developed as fast. But achieving the computing power to process the vast volumes of data necessary for building AI systems is the biggest challenge that the industry has ever faced. Reaching and financing that level of computation can be challenging, especially for startups and small-budget companies. 
7. Niche skillset 
Searching for and training people with the proper skillset and expertise for artificial intelligence implementation and deployment is one of the most frequently-referenced challenges. A lack of knowledge prevents organizations from adopting AI technologies smoothly and hinders organizations on their AI journey. Because this is a significant challenge in the IT industry, companies should think about spending additional budget on artificial intelligence app development training, hiring AI development talents, or buying and licensing capabilities from bigger IT companies.
8. Expensive and rare
As mentioned above, AI integration, deploymentOpens a new window , and implementation require a specialist like a data scientist or a data engineer with a certain level of skills and expertise. One of the major challenges with implementing AI in business is that these experts are expensive and currently quite rare in the IT market. Companies with a small budget, then, face a challenge to bring in the suitable specialists that the project requires. Moreover, once you decide to implement or develop an AI-based system, you’ll have to provide constant training, which may require rare high-end specialists.
9. Legal issues
There are a lot of legal concerns around artificial intelligence app development and implementation that companies need to be concerned about. The data the algorithms collect from users are very sensitive. Erroneous algorithms and data governance systems installed in AI applications will always make incorrect predictions and bring losses to the company’s profit. Moreover, it can violate laws or regulations, putting the organization in the trap of legal challenges.
10. Explainability
It’s human nature to trust only things that are easily understood. One of the critical AI implementation challenges is the unknown nature of how deep learning models and a set of inputs can predict the output and formulate a solution for a problem. Explainability in AI is required to provide transparency in AI decisions, as well as the algorithms that lead to them. This means that organizations must work on the policies that inspect the impact of artificial intelligence on decision making, provide frequent audits of their systems, and have regular training.  
The AI Implementation Roadmap
Artificial intelligence app development has become a part of IT industry life. Nevertheless, businesses have to learn how AI works and how to overcome AI implementation challenges and AI development challenges with minimal risks and losses. There’s no doubt that the AI implementation roadmap can be tricky, but getting familiar with the challenges beforehand and adopting a step-by-step AI implementation strategy can ease the process.

It’s part rave and part science exhibit, a school-bus-sized feat of engineering glowing on the dusty playa. Called Dr. Brainlove, it’s one of the art cars of the Burning Man Festival, a drivable, surrealist piece created specifically for this yearly event focused on community, art, and self-expression. Even at a distance, the geometric jungle gym structure quite clearly resembles a human brain. The Atlantic magazine called Dr. Brainlove “the most Burning Man thing ever,” even more so than the soaring wooden ""temples"" that spring up overnight in the desert only to be purposely lit on fire, the temporary semicircular encampment lined with streets called “freak show” and “hanky panky,” or attendees cosplaying as aliens, faeries, and cyberpunks.Dr. Brainlove rolls through the desert at Burning Man. (Photo courtesy of Tom Bishop)  An early sketch of Dr. Brainlove drawn by Asako Miyakawa. (Image courtesy of Asako Miyakawa) But Dr. Brainlove is more than a colorful addition to a far-out festival. It aims to stop attendees in their tracks, encourages them to consider how their own brains constantly process information, and hopefully inspires them to learn more about neuroscience. The actual brain behind Dr. Brainlove belongs to scientist Natalia Bilenko, who volunteered her own MRI brain scans to the project team of over 100 scientists, engineers, and artists that created this rolling art installation.“Thinking about art as a medium for communication of technology and making technology more accessible, that has always appealed to me,” says Bilenko.In addition to the large but not exactly street-legal Dr. Brainlove vehicle, she helped engineer a smaller four-foot version, called “MiniBrainlove,” which debuted at the Bay Area Science Festival in 2014, and brought a tabletop version (“MicroBrainlove”) to the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Bilenko says these efforts are all about encouraging community engagement and participation at the intersection of art and science.She also co-created an exhibit for the San Francisco Exploratorium called Cognitive Technologies, the world's first interactive exhibit to use real-time brain activity. The interdisciplinary project brought together artists and scientists to create an environment for the public that would demystify the “black box” of what’s happening in the human brain. Visitors experimented with cutting-edge scientific tools to understand and extend the human mind. Attendees could use hand gestures to explore a 3D model of a brain created from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, or they could don an electroencephalography (EEG) cap and control a mechanical arm using only their mind. “I can’t help but feel like I’ve just watched magic happen,” wrote a reporter who visited the exhibit.Bilenko (left) and exhibit co-creator James Gao (right) demonstrate how visitors could interact with their exhibit at the Cognitive Technologies exhibit at the San Francisco Exploratorium. Attendees could use gestures to explore the data on the screen. (Photo courtesy of Anja Ulfeldt and the Cognitive Tech group)  Bilenko examines a prototype of Dr. Brainlove, an interactive art car modeled on scans of her own brain. (Photo courtesy of Asako Miyakawa) The desire to understand unseen processes has always interested Bilenko. As a child, she was fascinated with chemistry and studied chemical formulas to better understand what was occurring inside living organisms and in the natural world around her. When she was a teenager, she emigrated from Russia to the United States with her parents and had to navigate the usual challenges of high school while also adapting to a new country and culture. Although she had studied English in school in Russia, “there was discomfort with spoken language that took a while to get over,” she says. Around that time, she became interested in language processing and neuroscience as she noticed that formulas and models could not explain everything she experienced and observed.“What jumps to mind is this word 'ambiguity,'” she says.In college at Brown University, she worked in a neural linguistics lab, studying how the brain interprets ambiguous words like “stable,” which can mean either a shelter for horses or a description of something that doesn't change.“That was the seed for me: thinking about how language is a model of the world, and we have different ways of understanding.” But, she quickly points out, “the problem with models is that they are static representations. The world is not as simple as any model, and it’s constantly changing.”Natalia Bilenko (far left) moderates a discussion with panelists Morgan Klaus Scheuerman (speaking), Hannah Wallach (right), and Vivienne Ming (far right) discuss “Algorithmic inequity and the impacts on the queer community and beyond.” (Photo courtesy of Raphael Gontijo Lopes )Her interest in mental models led her to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which seeks to train computers to create models that make meaning from information and draw conclusions as effectively as humans. For decades, computers were limited to performing simple tasks with clear rules. Computers struggled to interpret new types of data, and they were easily derailed by ambiguous information or items that fit into several categories. Advances in AI aim to change this, allowing computers to provide ever more sophisticated data back to humans. One of the most difficult challenges in AI is computer vision – a subfield of artificial intelligence that trains computers to identify and recognize people and objects. For example, a computer can be trained to recognize that two photographs – one showing a person with a beard and long hair, the other showing a person with no beard and short hair — are in fact, both images of humans.“I tend to find my personal and professional interests in the spaces between art and technology. Identifying as queer is part of that,” says Bilenko, who identifies as queer and non-binary. “Also being an immigrant, that is part of my experience as well -- being in that in-between place.” Bilenko (center, with microphone) explains the MicoBrainlove art piece to interviewer Mario Milicevic at a SXSW event in Austin, Texas. (Courtesy of IEEE)  Bilenko, Valkyrie Savage, and Berkeley Professor Jack Gallant built off of earlier work in computer vision to train artificial intelligence algorithms to reconstruct images that participants had seen, based on what areas of their brains were activated. Although blurry and imperfect, the images the AI produced were surprisingly close to the original images. As a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of California at Berkeley, Bilenko met students Asako Miyakawa and James Gao, who would become co-creators of Dr. Brainlove and the Cognitive Technologies exhibit. She became a researcher in Professor Jack Gallant’s lab, collaborating with him on a project to train a computer to reconstruct a person’s visual experience by interpreting EEG signals from the brain. The researchers created a computer algorithm that could interpret the brain impulses, match them against visuals collected from thousands of hours of YouTube videos, and generate movies that illustrate likely images based on the impulses.To outside observers, the results looked freakishly like computer-assisted mind reading. While the resulting visualizations were hazy, the work made a big splash in the tech community. It even prompted Mark Zuckerberg to declare that in the future “you’re going to be able to capture a thought.” With his usual techno-optimism, Facebook’s founder envisioned a time when “what you’re thinking or feeling in its ideal and perfect form in your head, [you will] be able to share that with the world in a format where [others can] get that.”Bilenko herself takes a much more pragmatic view: “the mind leaps very quickly to what it could be, but there are a lot of uncomfortable possible possibilities as well,” she says. She is quick to point out that the visually striking findings came from participants who consented to hours and hours of research, and that everyone’s brain is different, so the brain decoding only works if it has been calibrated to each person individually.""There are some grand ideas about what AI could be in the future, and it's important for technologists like me to think about the impacts and repercussions of our work,” she says.After graduating from Berkeley, Bilenko turned her AI skills to a more pressing present-day concern: better screening for heart problems. Moving from the academic lab into industry was important to Bilenko because private companies tend to focus on bringing the immediate, practical applications of new technologies to market. Having been exposed early to science and medicine thanks to her grandfathers – one was an inventor and professor of nanoelectronics, the other a surgeon – her new job drew on her interest in artificial intelligence, healthcare, and innovation. She joined an eight-person medical device company called Bay Labs (now known as Caption Health), which employs AI to make ultrasound scanners easier to use.  Drawing from U.S. Patent no. 1,093,7156 for ""Saliency mapping of imagery during artificially intelligent image classification,"" co-invented by Bilenko and her colleagues when she worked at Caption Health. “Ultrasound-based imaging is really important for early detection,” says Bilenko. “But because people have to be highly trained to use the technology, it’s really costly, and it’s often a problem to get the proper checkups and diagnosis.”The team of engineers at the company met with experienced medical professionals to understand what the experts look for when scanning the heart for problems. They fed the computers reams of visual data from different machines, both clear images and very poor ones.They trained the computers to assess the visuals from the scanners, created an interface that gave real-time guidance to operators on positioning the scanner and confirming if the image captured was clear, and developed a method to sift through the thousands of images captured during the hour-long exam to identify the best ones for medical specialists to review.This new technology could help catch heart problems early and could be particularly impactful for people who live in rural areas far away from experienced cardiologists and ultrasound technicians. “The goal was to create a tool so someone who was not necessarily a fully trained tech could do a checkup that might indicate if a patient should be redirected to a professional, similar to taking your blood pressure,” says Bilenko.The research resulted in three patents for Bilenko and her co-inventors, and the Caption Health AI-guided scanner was named one of the “100 Best Inventions of 2021” by Time Magazine. With heart disease being the leading cause of death in the United States, the work is both cutting edge and potentially lifesaving. Her research also led to two more patents on related technologies, making her a named inventor on five patents before the age of 37.Caption Health's cardiac scanner uses AI to provide real-time feedback to the scanning technician on the quality of the images being collected. The yellow and green indicators in the top left of the scanning screen help technicians confirm they are capturing clear and useful images.

(Photo courtesy of Rachel Kalmar) “I think that a lot of my approach to working with technology is motivated by how to avoid the non-benevolent uses of technology. And there can be a lot of dangers to AI in particular.”The lack of diversity among AI practitioners is a known challenge. Another is the absence of participation and input from those outside the field who might be affected by the technology. While Bilenko’s short purple pixie haircut wasn’t particularly notable amongst the diverse team that brought Dr. Brainlove to Burning Man, it did cause her to stand out when she attended scientific conferences.“AI is a profession that excludes a lot of people from participating, and that’s a huge problem,” she says. Chatting with a handful of non-binary and queer scientists among the thousands attending a key research conference in the field, they brainstormed how to address these issues. The result was “Queer in AI,” a group to support queer researchers and raise awareness of issues in AI and machine learning that might disproportionately affect the queer community. They took their inspiration from other newly created groups like Women in AI (founded in 2016) and Black in AI (founded in 2017).“A lot of the motivation I had for starting the organization Queer in AI with other folks, it was about some of these impacts of technology on people who are marginalized – both in society in general and in access to these technologies.”Queer in AI found that most queer scientists they surveyed do not feel completely welcome in the field, partially due to a lack of a visible community and role models. Since then, Queer in AI members have worked to become a more visible presence in the larger AI community, returning to that conference and others each year to host social gatherings, lead mentoring sessions, and give research talks. The group has created a scholarship fund to help students apply to graduate school in AI and worked to raise awareness of concerns within the queer sub-community of the larger AI community. Through their original research and advocacy, they encourage and highlight new findings to address various concerns, such as the ethical use of AI, privacy and safety, and how binary-based model assumptions can harm members of the queer community. Bilenko notes that algorithm development requires a large volume of data, and sometimes older data includes assumptions based on stereotypes, which then reinforces biased decision making.“It’s not just wrong, but wrong in ways that harm those that are already the most marginalized.” Queer in AI organizers, from left to right: Raphael Gontijo Lopes, William Agnew, and Natalia Bilenko prepare materials for the Queer in AI workshop at the 2019 NeurIPS Conference.The group organizes community building activities and workshops, and provides scholarships for students interested in graduate work in artificial intelligence. (Photo courtesy of Raphael Gontijo Lopes)Through art cars, public exhibits, inventing new medical tools, and now advocacy, Bilenko has worked to bring others into the process of technology development and meaning-making. She views others, including people who provided the personal data that informs the models, as co-creators in an AI-augmented future. She is particularly inspired by concepts such as design justice, which lays out a vision to make marginalized communities central in the development of new technologies, helping to dismantle structural inequality. With experience developing creative ways for non-scientists to explore and understand how AI works, “there’s a way design can be participatory and people can participate in work that may affect them later on.”“The technologies are not really separate from the politics and environment in which they are created,” says Bilenko, making it all-important that everyone is given opportunities to help co-create the future of AI.CreditsProduced by the USPTO’s Office of the Chief Communications Officer.

Yes, even one of the topmost cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence has intelligent agents for smart functionalities. Let us know interesting facts on how intelligent agents work in AI models to be more productive with training data..An intelligent agent is known as an entity making smart decisions that allow AI to be put into action efficiently and effectively. It is a software entity conducting operations on behalf of users after examining the environment. Intelligent agents are popular for their capability to learn during the time of performing any activity. Two key roles include perception and action with sub-agents performing low-level activities..Intelligent agents have some important workloads to perform in artificial intelligence such as information access and navigation, decision support and empowerment, repetitive office activities, regular personal workload, search and retrieval of data, management activities, and many more..Yes, IA can perform multiple activities that have made it one of the key tools of IT in the 21st century. There are multiple names that you should know about an intelligent agent including software agents, knowbots, wizards, softbots, and many more. It is making automation of difficult workloads possible to boost productivity and efficiency. It works as five different agents in artificial intelligence such as a simple reflex agent, model-based reflex agent, goal-based agent, utility-based agent, and learning agent..Intelligent agents are also known for working on simple commands through voice-assistant technologies like Alexa, Siri, Google Home, and many more. That being said, you are making intelligent agents work every day with different tasks without having an in-depth knowledge of it. The more you use smart devices, the more you receive the performance from intelligent agents..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
