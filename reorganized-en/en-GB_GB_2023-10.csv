Why It Matters		



Generative AI can boost worker productivity, but organizations must first establish a culture of accountability, reward peer training, and encourage role reconfiguration.

A new study on the impact of generative AI on highly skilled workers finds that when artificial intelligence is used within the boundary of its capabilities, it can improve a worker’s performance by as much as 40% compared with workers who don’t use it.

But when AI is used outside that boundary to complete a task, worker performance drops by an average of 19 percentage points.
The findings have implications not only for worker productivity but for organizations looking to successfully navigate what the researchers have termed the “jagged technological frontier” of AI — specifically, generative pretrained transformers (GPT), which produce text after being given prompts. Understanding the upper limits of AI’s abilities is imperative, particularly as those abilities continue to expand, the researchers write.
It’s important for managers to maintain awareness of this jagged frontier, said Harvard Business School’s Fabrizio Dell’Acqua, the lead author of the paper, because the researchers found that it was not obvious to highly skilled knowledge workers which of their everyday tasks could easily be performed by AI and which tasks would require a different approach.
A multidisciplinary team of researchers authored the paper, including Karim Lakhani and Edward McFowland III from Harvard Business School; Ethan Mollick, SM ’04, PhD ’10, from The Wharton School; Hila Lifshitz-Assaf from Warwick Business School; and MIT Sloan’s Kate Kellogg.
Here’s a closer look at the study, along with some suggestions from Dell’Acqua, Kellogg, and Lifshitz-Assaf of steps organizations can take when introducing generative AI to a highly skilled workforce.
For best results, use cognitive effort and experts’ judgment
The study was conducted in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and involved more than 700 consultants who were assigned a skills assessment task and an experimental task.
The participants were sorted into two groups: One group was given a task designed to fall within GPT-4’s capabilities of producing humanlike outputs, while the other group received a task “designed so that GPT-4 would make an error when conducting the analysis, ensuring the work fell just outside the frontier,” according to the paper.
Within those two groups, study participants were sorted into three conditions: no access to AI, access to GPT-4 AI, and access to GPT-4 AI with an overview of how to use GPT.

Generative AI can improve a highly skilled worker’s performance by as much as 40% compared with workers who don’t use it.
The “inside the frontier” group was asked to imagine that they worked for a shoe company and that their manager had asked them to come up with a new product and present it at a meeting. Participants in this group were also instructed to complete several other actions, including coming up with a list of steps from pitch to launch, creating a marketing slogan, and writing a 2,500-word article describing the end-to-end process for developing the shoe and lessons learned.
AI had a positive effect on that group of participants: The GPT-only participants saw a 38% increase in performance compared with the control condition (no access to AI), while the performance of those who were provided with both GPT and an overview saw a 42.5% increase in performance compared with the control condition.
Interestingly, the researchers observed a bigger jump in performance scores for the participants in the lower half of assessed skills who used GPT-4 compared with those in the top half of assessed skills — at 43% and 17%, respectively — when they were compared with their baseline scores (i.e., no AI use).
The “outside the frontier” group was asked to imagine that they worked for a company with three brands. They were tasked with writing a 500-to-750-word memo to their CEO explaining which of the brands the CEO should invest in to drive revenue, and with suggesting innovative actions the CEO could take to improve the selected brand. The memo needed to include the rationale for their recommendation, and group participants were provided with interview comments and financial data from which they could draw. Additionally, participants were graded on the “correctness” of their recommendation — their reasoning or justification — by human evaluators.
AI had a negative effect on participants in this group. The GPT-only condition saw a decrease in performance of 13 percentage points compared with the control condition, while participants who had been provided with GPT and an overview showed a decrease of 24 percentage points compared with the control condition.
Dell’Acqua said that for the “outside the frontier” group, the researchers observed a performance decrease because people would “kind of switch off their brains and follow what AI recommends,” which was more likely to be incorrect. However, even when an incorrect recommendation was made under one of the AI conditions, the quality of the participant’s recommendation justification improved.
The quality improvement and decrease in performance indicates that, rather than blindly adopting AI outputs, highly skilled workers need to continue to validate AI and exert “cognitive effort and experts’ judgement when working with AI,” the researchers write.

Interface design, onboarding, role reconfiguration, and a culture of accountability
According to the researchers, there are several things organizations and managers should consider as they integrate AI into their employee workflows.
While it’s tempting to use AI for knowledge work because it is fast, can boost rapid idea generation, and produces persuasive text, managers and professionals need to be cautious when using it for important tasks, Lifshitz-Assaf said.
Because some AI-generated answers look credible even when they’re incorrect, “that suggests there’s a role for internal or ‘wrapper’ developers to help design the interface in a way that makes it less likely that people fall into some of these traps,” Kellogg said.
Developers can also help with figuring out where AI can be inserted into workflows and how to design technology for doing that.
Kellogg and Dell’Acqua also recommended that organizations have an onboarding phase so workers can get a sense of how and where the AI works well and where it doesn’t and receive performance feedback. Relatedly, some people are very good at upskilling themselves, and those workers can be helpful as peer trainers. But they should be rewarded and recognized for their work.
Managers will also need to reconfigure roles.
“To use generative AI well, it’s important to investigate the specific tasks along the work process,” Lifshitz-Assaf said. “Some may be within the jagged frontier, and others outside.”
Kellogg said that leaders can encourage role reconfiguration by having people from different positions experiment together to find the most productive structure.
Leaders should also encourage a culture of accountability. In talking with study participants, Kellogg said, one suggestion was that “we need to teach people to be able to explain what they did without using the term ‘generative AI.’”
“Managers and workers need to collectively develop new expectations and work practices to ensure that any work done in collaboration with generative AI meets the values, goals, and standards of their key stakeholders,” Kellogg said.

A new survey I worked on, sponsored by AWS and the MIT Chief Data Officer Symposium, has been released, and it’s one of the first I have seen that addresses how organizations are dealing with generative AI. There are some interesting findings, the most important of which is that while those who are leading data and AI efforts at their companies think that generative AI is likely to transform their organizations, they haven’t done much yet to prepare for the change.


Let’s get into the details. First, there is some diffusion of responsibility relative to generative AI. The survey was of 334 global chief data officers (CDOs), who usually lead the development of analytics and AI as well. But in this survey, only 42% of CDOs said they have responsibility for strategy and execution with respect to generative AI. This is despite 49% saying that they are responsible for building AI capabilities, and 61% for advanced analytics capabilities. It’s not clear who else has the oversight for generative AI, but AI is highly related to analytics and highly dependent on data, so I hope it moves into the CDO bailiwick eventually.

Overall, the surveyed CDOs are excited about the potential of generative AI. 80% believe it is likely to transform their organizations. 45% agreed that they foresee or are already seeing wide adoption of it within their organizations. That should motivate a lot of activity to get ready for it.

PROMOTED
Experimentation, Not Production
Despite this enthusiasm, it is clearly early days for AI in most organizations. 16% of CDOs said their organizations ban it altogether, which to my mind is a bad idea—it’s easy enough to protect intellectual property if that’s your concern. 47% said their organizations were allowing experimentation at the individual employee level, either with or without clear usage guidelines. Only 19% said they had department or business unit-level experimentation with gen AI use cases, and 11% had organization-wide experiments. A mere 6% said they had one or more gen AI use cases in production deployment. We clearly need more of those.

In terms of what organizations are experimenting with, 40% said their focus was on overall personal productivity. That’s fine, but the technology clearly offers more. One potential benefit it offers is customer operations benefits, such as with gen AI chatbots. 44% are prioritizing this type of use case—the highest percentage. 37% are prioritizing use cases for software engineering, such as code generation. 32% are pursuing marketing and sales use cases, and 14% are prioritizing R&D applications.

Data Is Key, But It’s Not Ready
CDOs believe data is key to preparing for generative AI, but they haven’t done much yet with it. 93% agree that “data strategy is crucial to getting business value from generative AI.” However, 57% said that they had made no changes to data yet to prepare for generative AI. Only 38% agreed that “My team and I have the right data foundation to pivot to generative AI,” and only 11% agreed strongly with the statement. 71% agreed that “generative AI is interesting, but we are more focused on other data initiatives to achieve more tangible value.” Tangible value is great, but perhaps this low priority is why many CDOs haven’t been given responsibility for generative AI. At least they are planning to spend more on the technology: 62% said that their teams are planning on investing more in generative AI.

Those who are preparing seem to be taking relatively small steps. 25% are undertaking “data integration or cleaning of datasets for generative AI use cases;” 18% are surveying data that might support gen AI use cases, and 17% are curating proprietary documents or textual data to train domain-specific generative AI.

Upping Their Game
I believe that CDOs need to increase their focus on generative AI. It is the technology that has most excited both executives and employees in organizations around the world. CDOs can use this to build their own reputations; one that we interviewed for the survey report, for example, said that she feels like the “belle of the ball” since generative AI came out.
If organizations are to succeed with generative AI, they need to increase the focus on data preparation for it, which is a primary prerequisite for success. Leaders in the adoption of generative AI, such as Morgan Stanley, have been working aggressively on these types of initiatives for a couple of years.
They also need to become experts on the technology and how to take advantage of it. Among other things, this means using gen AI in their own work. In our survey, only 53% said that they were currently using generative AI themselves. Admittedly, it’s almost a full-time job to keep track of all the changes in this technology, but you can’t become an expert just by reading about it.
Generative AI is the most dramatic advancement of our age. It’s time that companies were more active in their preparation for and adoption of it. Chief data officers can lead the way, but it’s not clear that they are doing so yet. Granted that these busy executives already have a lot on their plates (see survey report for details), but this is already or soon to be the main course.

Generative AI technology, as the name implies, generates outputs based on some kind of input -- often a prompt supplied by a person. Some GenAI tools work in one medium, such as turning text inputs into text outputs, for example. Others transform among media: turning a text prompt into graphical output, perhaps, or a sound prompt into a textual output.







The most headline-grabbing uses of generative AI tools involve text generation. With the public release of ChatGPT in late November 2022, the world at large was introduced to an AI app capable of creating text that sounded more authentic and less artificial than any previous generation of computer-crafted text. Humans eagerly adopted it, making ChatGPT the fastest-growing app in history while using it for seemingly endless text-generating purposes, from writing term papers and taking a state bar exam to writing the scripts of the news stories about ChatGPT's capabilities.

GenAI's transformative role in various types of content
Text is not the only area where generative AI is pushing boundaries. Here are some examples of its broad impact.
Text-to-speech. Whether its own words or someone else's, generative AI is advancing speech synthesis, improving the quality of artificial readers for e-books, synthetic presenters for news clips and advertising -- including clickbait posts on social media -- synthetic characters in video games and literal chatbots that answer phone calls. Intonation, cadence and volume variations are all becoming more realistic, subtle and flexible. The improvement in quality is also increasing the threat of deepfake audio.
Image synthesis. OpenAI's Dall-E 2 and other products (see ""GenAI tools"" section below) use AI to create pictures based on text descriptions. If you tell one to create a ridiculous picture of 14 lemmings and a talking cantaloupe wearing a trenchcoat and pretending to be a private investigator, it will do so. Dall-E and its many competitors have taken a huge leap forward, in both their image quality and their ability to translate arbitrary text into images. Such systems are finding their way into advertising, product design, set design, film and other industries. But they are also showing potential as engines of misinformation and disinformation, as they can generate deepfake images of events that never happened or alter images of events that did happen.

Space synthesis. As is the case with images, this kind of synthesis can occur with 3D spaces and objects, both real and digital. On the real-world side, applications such as Autodesk or Spacemaker can help design buildings and the spaces in them or urban landscapes incorporating built and natural elements. In these situations, AI supplements human designers' work by filling in missing details or proposing solutions to fit specific code requirements or space and material constraints. Many companies -- most notably Meta and all the major game creators -- are also developing applications to generate virtual spaces for game designs. These AI systems can constantly generate new spaces and possibly even make them infinitely expandable.





Real-world examples of GenAI
The use of GenAI is continuing to emerge and expand within organizations. According to a recent Gartner poll of over 1,400 executive leaders, 43% indicated that they are in the process of piloting generative AI products and tools.
The instances that drive the use of GenAI in this setting can vary widely. The Gartner survey indicated that 47% of respondents invested in GenAI for customer-facing functions, such as sales, marketing and customer service. IT functions were also a common area where generative AI investments take place, which includes software development, infrastructure and operations.


Industries experimenting with generative AI tools
Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical companies -- including Amgen, Insilico Medicine and others -- and academic researchers are working with generative AI in areas such as designing proteins for medicines. Predicting the folding of proteins has been an enormous challenge for geneticists and pharmaceutical developers for decades. Deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are increasing researchers' abilities to understand and use protein synthesis.
Genetics research. Although its emergence in genetics research is not particularly rapid, generative AI is contributing to this field. A common barrier associated with the use of this technology for genetics research is limited access to genetic databases, largely due to privacy concerns. A recent study, however, consisted of training GANs and restricted Boltzmann machines to learn distributions of real genomic datasets. This would then enable them to create artificial genomes.
Manufacturing. In manufacturing, Autodesk, Creo and other products use generative AI to design physical objects. In some cases, they also create those objects through 3D printing or computer-controlled machining and additive manufacturing. Generative AI can create machine parts and subassemblies of larger objects, for example, and can sometimes optimize designs for the following aspects of the manufacturing process: materials efficiency (minimizing waste), simplicity (fewest parts) and speed of production.
Entertainment. ChatGPT, Dall-E and other tools are already employed in generating conceptual art to guide scenario and environment development and are expected to be used to generate full environments in the future. Generative AI tools are also taking up background music generation for games. It's worth noting that artists and corporations are filing a flurry of lawsuits based on copyright infringement and intellectual property theft, arguing that the use of their protected IP in the training data, coupled with the ability to request output in a particular person's style, equate to unfair use and violations of copyright. This kind of legal challenge is slowing the use of generative tools in some contexts.


Cautionary note on applying generative AI
It's important to underscore the downside of generative AI tools. As good as the text outputs are, for example, they still won't always meet the professional standards in the field in question. Professors often can tell immediately that the paper was not written by the student, just as they generally could when students bought papers from term-paper mills -- and instructors themselves can now deploy AI tools to detect papers that are produced by AI. Judges and other lawyers can pick apart briefs cobbled together by generalist AI because they are incorrectly reasoned or inadequately supported.
And so, the tragic flaw (in the Greek tragedy sense) of generative AI systems has come clearly into view: The characteristics that make the current GenAI tools so very powerful in creating real-sounding text and other content also make it possible for them to fabulate. That is, they can generate answers that are at odds with reality. To wit: the social media images of Pope Francis in a big, puffy white coat; Elon Musk hobnobbing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; and Donald Trump being dragged away by police.
Compounding the problem is the ability of the tools to make up supporting materials when pushed to provide support for something they generated. Pushed to support a point in a term paper, for example, a GenAI tool might fabricate a quote in support, for a real person or a person made up for the purpose. When asked to provide legal citations in support of a brief, an AI tool might make up court cases and even entire courts.
While the potential uses for GenAI tools are basically any use case in which a human would generate output in any medium, the tools are not yet ready to do everything well enough -- or cheaply enough -- to be used everywhere. Organizations seeking to implement GenAI tools have to be selective and proceed with significant provisions in mind.








Examples of generative AI tools
With all that in mind, GenAI tools are still hugely useful aids to professionals working with text. ChatGPT is the gold standard for general-purpose text synthesis, though similar tools such as Bloom can do about as well.
In addition to the problems cited above, in this context it's very important to keep in mind that a GenAI tool is perfectly capable of spitting out a block of text that is, in whole or in part, one of its training texts. In some cases, that text will have copyright attached to it, but the GenAI tool will not ""know"" that -- or, if it knows, will not tell you about it. So, using text that a GenAI tool spits out in any public-facing use case, such as an article for publication or ad copy, without considering this possibility and doing some due diligence is dangerous. And, of course, right now the output of such tools is not itself copyrightable, so publishing it is in effect giving it away as public-domain text.
Creating summaries
Some tools have been trained specifically for summarizing text, sometimes in specific fields. Writing assistance site Grammarly has a general-purpose summarizer, as do Jasper, QuillBot and TLDR This. Tools such as Iris.ai and SciSummary focus on academic papers, LegalMind and Legalyze on legal documents, and other specific publication spaces are seeing similar tools evolve to address them.
Creating translations
Translation is a special case of text-to-text transformation, and Google Translate is perhaps the best known and most widely used tool in the space. People also use Alexa Translations, Bing Translator and Meta's SeamlessM4T, as well as other general-purpose tools like ChatGPT. In areas of specific technical specialization, such as medicine or law, professional translators sometimes employ AI tools to assist them; currently, however, there are few AI tools themselves specialized by discipline.
Creating code
GenAI tools are extremely well suited to dealing with what are called domain-specific languages, which include networking protocols and programming languages. DSLs have strict and small vocabularies, along with well-defined and orderly syntaxes. General-purpose tools like ChatGPT can help; there are many specialized tools too, such as GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, CodeWP and Amazon CodeWhisperer, some of which can plug directly into a coder's chosen integrated development environment.
Creating documentation
Just as they can be used to generate code, AI tools can be used to document code. They can provide explanations of what a procedure does, for example, or what kinds of data an object holds and manipulates. They can sometimes even supply the explanation of what a procedure or module is used for in the framework of a larger program. While these tools might not always provide the level of explanation of an algorithm a human can, they can do an enormous amount of the tedious work of fully documenting a codebase.
Using GenAI to create images
GenAI got a huge and surprisingly positive PR bounce with the advent of ChatGPT. This distracted from -- and even, to some extent, washed away -- the previous round of much more negative commentary centered on AI image creation. Basically, discussion of image GenAI had focused largely on the destructive potential of deepfake images: fictional constructions intended to look like real photos of actual events and people.
The rise of Dall-E and Stable Diffusion around the time of GPT-3.5's release also helped broaden the discussion. Stories and examples focused on whimsy: ""Draw me a picture of a yellow dragon on a green motorcycle driving through Brown's Valley, Minnesota."" All the negative potentials associated with deepfakes persist, though, and other problems have become apparent as well.
Copyright considerations apply here, too, just as they do with text: Outputs might include protected inputs, and outputs cannot be copyrighted.
Creating pictures
Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-E -- now Dall-E 2 -- continue to be important. As indications of the breadth of the space, consider also the free photo restoration tool GFPGAN and Lumen5, a commercial product with a free ""community"" tier, which generates video content rather than still images. Hunting through the spaces at Hugging Face, a community built around free AI models such as Llama and Stable Diffusion, one can find specialized tools for other kinds of image generation or manipulation -- e.g., for comic creation or image upscaling.
Creating technical drawings
Generative design applies GenAI to the problems of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) by generating design models and images. Generative design has been applied in areas as diverse as architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and biomedical device design. Autodesk Fusion 360 and Dassault CATIA Generative Design Engineering, longtime CAD/CAM vendors, are prominent generative design tools.
Creating logos and icons
Any image generator can generate a logo, but there are specialist AIs focused on this activity specifically, including Logo Diffusion, Designs.ai Logomaker and Looka Logo Maker.


Future generative AI examples
Although there's no way to predict which generative AI examples and use cases show the most promise for the future, there are some -- such as image generation and speech synthesis -- that have shown enormous progress in the last few years. Other areas, such as medicine and manufacturing, have also proven enormously promising and show the wide range of fields that AI might contribute to. Progress in physical use cases appears slower, which makes sense given the inherent limits imposed by manipulating matter instead of data.
Such progress builds on itself, a dynamic on full display in 2022 and 2023. As the base tools become cheaper, more widely available and easier to use, the pool of people harnessing those tools broadens. This increases the number and type of situations those tools get trained to deal with, further accelerating the pace of change.
Incorporating generative AI into other AI-powered tool suites can turn them into a more powerful gestalt. For example, current code- and documentation-generation systems aren't great, but as they improve and are combined with other kinds of AI systems already in place -- for detecting coding errors, common security flaws and the use of licensed code in unlicensed ways, for example -- the developer tool set will become more powerful and productive.
What's important to remember is that there are antisocial and dangerous applications of AI that will also become easier in the same ways.

These machine learning models are only capable of pumping out images and text because they’ve been trained on mountains of real people’s creative work, much of it copyrighted. Major AI developers including OpenAI, Meta and Stability AI now face multiple lawsuits on this. Such legal claims are supported by independent analyses; in August, for instance, the Atlantic reported finding that Meta trained its large language model (LLM) in part on a data set called Books3, which contained more than 170,000 pirated and copyrighted books.And training data sets for these models include more than books. In the rush to build and train ever-larger AI models, developers have swept up much of the searchable Internet. This not only has the potential to violate copyrights but also threatens the privacy of the billions of people who share information online. It also means that supposedly neutral models could be trained on biased data. A lack of corporate transparency makes it difficult to figure out exactly where companies are getting their training data—but Scientific American spoke with some AI experts who have a general idea.Where do AI training data come from?To build large generative AI models, developers turn to the public-facing Internet. But “there’s no one place where you can go download the Internet,” says Emily M. Bender, a linguist who studies computational linguistics and language technology at the University of Washington. Instead developers amass their training sets through automated tools that catalog and extract data from the Internet. Web “crawlers” travel from link to link indexing the location of information in a database, while Web “scrapers” download and extract that same information.A very well-resourced company, such as Google’s owner, Alphabet, which already builds Web crawlers to power its search engine, can opt to employ its own tools for the task, says machine learning researcher Jesse Dodge of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI. Other companies, however, turn to existing resources such as Common Crawl, which helped feed OpenAI’s GPT-3, or databases such as the Large-Scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION), which contains links to images and their accompanying captions. Neither Common Crawl nor LAION responded to requests for comment. Companies that want to use LAION as an AI resource (it was part of the training set for image generator Stable Diffusion, Dodge says) can follow these links but must download the content themselves.Web crawlers and scrapers can easily access data from just about anywhere that’s not behind a login page. Social media profiles set to private aren’t included. But data that are viewable in a search engine or without logging into a site, such as a public LinkedIn profile, might still be vacuumed up, Dodge says. Then, he adds, “there’s the kinds of things that absolutely end up in these Web scrapes”—including blogs, personal webpages and company sites. This includes anything on popular photograph-sharing site Flickr, online marketplaces, voter registration databases, government webpages, Wikipedia, Reddit, research repositories, news outlets and academic institutions. Plus, there are pirated content compilations and Web archives, which often contain data that have since been removed from their original location on the Web. And scraped databases do not go away. “If there was text scraped from a public website in 2018, that’s forever going to be available, whether [the site or post has] been taken down or not,” Dodge notes.Some data crawlers and scrapers are even able to get past paywalls (including Scientific American’s) by disguising themselves behind paid accounts, says Ben Zhao, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. “You’d be surprised at how far these crawlers and model trainers are willing to go for more data,” Zhao says. Paywalled news sites were among the top data sources included in Google’s C4 database (used to train Google’s LLM T5 and Meta’s LLaMA), according to a joint analysis by the Washington Post and the Allen Institute.Curated by Our EditorsThe State of Large Language ModelsSophie Bushwick & Lauren Leffer'AI Anxiety' Is on the Rise--Here's How to Manage ItLauren LefferAI Platforms like ChatGPT Are Easy to Use but Also Potentially DangerousGary MarcusParis Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass SurveillanceAnne Toomey McKenna & The Conversation USWeb scrapers can also hoover up surprising kinds of personal information of unclear origins. Zhao points to one particularly striking example where an artist discovered that a private diagnostic medical image of herself was included in the LAION database. Reporting from Ars Technica confirmed the artist’s account and that the same data set contained medical record photographs of thousands of other people as well. It’s impossible to know exactly how these images ended up being included in LAION, but Zhao points out that data get misplaced, privacy settings are often lax, and leaks and breaches are common. Information not intended for the public Internet ends up there all the time.In addition to data from these Web scrapes, AI companies might purposefully incorporate other sources—including their own internal data—into their model training. OpenAI fine-tunes its models based on user interactions with its chatbots. Meta has said its latest AI was partially trained on public Facebook and Instagram posts. According to Elon Musk, the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) plans to do the same with its own users’ content. Amazon, too, says it will use voice data from customers’ Alexa conversations to train its new LLM.But beyond these acknowledgements, companies have become increasingly cagey about revealing details on their data sets in recent months. Though Meta offered a general data breakdown in its technical paper on the first version of LLaMA, the release of LLaMA 2 a few months later included far less information. Google, too, didn’t specify its data sources in its recently released PaLM2 AI model, beyond saying that much more data were used to train PaLM2 than to train the original version of PaLM. OpenAI wrote that it would not disclose any details on its training data set or method for GPT-4, citing competition as a chief concern.Why are dodgy training data a problem?AI models can regurgitate the same material that was used to train them—including sensitive personal data and copyrighted work. Many widely used generative AI models have blocks meant to prevent them from sharing identifying information about individuals, but researchers have repeatedly demonstrated ways to get aroundthese restrictions. For creative workers, even when AI outputs don’t exactly qualify as plagiarism, Zhao says they can eat into paid opportunities by, for example, aping a specific artist’s unique visual techniques. But without transparency about data sources, it’s difficult to blame such outputs on the AI’s training; after all, it could be coincidentally “hallucinating” the problematic material.A lack of transparency about training data also raises serious issues related to data bias, says Meredith Broussard, a data journalist who researches artificial intelligence at New York University. “We all know there is wonderful stuff on the Internet, and there is extremely toxic material on the Internet,” she says. Data sets such as Common Crawl, for instance, include white supremacist websites and hate speech. Even less extreme sources of data contain content that promotes stereotypes. Plus, there’s a lot of pornography online. As a result, Broussard points out, AI image generators tend to produce sexualized images of women. “It’s bias in, bias out,” she says.Bender echoes this concern and points out that the bias goes even deeper—down to who can post content to the Internet in the first place. “That is going to skew wealthy, skew Western, skew towards certain age groups, and so on,” she says. Online harassment compounds the problem by forcing marginalized groups out of some online spaces, Bender adds. This means data scraped from the Internet fail to represent the full diversity of the real world. It’s hard to understand the value and appropriate application of a technology so steeped in skewed information, Bender says, especially if companies aren’t forthright about potential sources of bias.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersHow can you protect your data from AI?Unfortunately, there are currently very few options for meaningfully keeping data out of the maws of AI models. Zhao and his colleagues have developed a tool called Glaze, which can be used to make images effectively unreadable to AI models. But the researchers have only been able to test its efficacy with a subset of AI image generators, and its uses are limited. For one thing, it can only protect images that haven’t previously been posted online. Anything else may have already been vacuumed up into Web scrapes and training data sets. As for text, no such similar tool exists.Website owners can insert digital flags telling Web crawlers and scrapers to not collect site data, Zhao says. It’s up to the scraper developer, however, to opt to abide by these notices.In California and a handful of other states, recently passed digital privacy laws give consumers the right to request that companies delete their data. In the European Union, too, people have the right to data deletion. So far, however, AI companies have pushed back on such requests by claiming the provenance of the data can’t be proven—or by ignoring the requests altogether—says Jennifer King, a privacy and data researcher at Stanford University.Even if companies respect such requests and remove your information from a training set, there’s no clear strategy for getting an AI model to unlearn what it has previously absorbed, Zhao says. To truly pull all the copyrighted or potentially sensitive information out of these AI models, one would have to effectively retrain the AI from scratch, which can cost up to tens of millions of dollars, Dodge says.Currently there are no significant AI policies or legal rulings that would require tech companies to take such actions—and that means they have no incentive to go back to the drawing board.Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer portal for developers, is laying off nearly a third of its workforce to replace it with generative AI-driven coding assistants, such as Microsoft Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google Bard.
“This year we took many steps to spend less. Changes have been pursued through the lens of minimizing the impact on the lives of Stackers. Unfortunately, those changes were not enough and we have made the extremely difficult decision to reduce the company’s headcount by approximately 28%,” company CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar wrote in a blog post.
The downsizing activity, which impacted the go-to-market and support teams, was a result of the company’s strategy to focus on its products and move toward profitability, especially at a time when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, Chandrasekar said.











 
 
 
Stack Overflow has also restructured the remaining workforce in order to boost its Overflow AI offering, which uses generative AI to answer developer questions.

While Chandrasekar blamed macroeconomic conditions for the layoffs, the downsizing can be directly linked to the proliferation of generative AI assistants, a study from Cornell University showed.
The study, which investigated how the release of ChatGPT changed human-generated open data on the web by analyzing the activity on Stack Overflow, found that ChatGPT is displacing duplicate or low-quality content.











 
 
 
“These results suggest that more users are adopting large language models to answer questions and they are better substitutes for Stack Overflow for languages for which they have more training data,” the authors of the study wrote.
While the authors called out the improved efficiency of the generative AI-driven coding assistants, they also pointed out that widespread adoption of such tools may result in a shift away from public exchange on the web, which will limit the open data that developers and models can learn from in the future.
This is the second round of layoffs at Stack Overflow so far this year as the company tries to meet its profitability goals. In May, the company laid off 58 staffers. The impacted employees included positions such as UX designers, human resource professionals, product designers, and senior software developers, LinkedIn posts from the affected employees showed.











 
 
 
Layoffs at several technology companies, including Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, have seen professionals across roles lose jobs since last year.
According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1061 technology companies have laid off about 243,141 staff so far this year, compared to 164,769 employees laid off last year.

Can we stop generative AI art? With ever increasing access to the best AI art generators and now AI image generation even becoming available directly in Bing and Google search, that seems unlikely. However, steps are being taken to fight back against generative AI.Artists have been shocked to find that their names were being used as prompts to churn out pastiche works that closely mimic their distinctive styles, sometimes even carrying garbled versions of their own signatures. Even when AI-generated images from don’t closely resemble any one artist’s work, many find it galling that their images have been used as training data without their consent to create a product that may threaten their livelihoods (see our pick of the best AI art tutorials and our guide to how to use DALL-E 2 for more on how text-to-image generators work).The outrage of artists work being scraped to train AI art generators such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney caused many digital artists to protest on ArtStation. While we still look on in amusement at the freakiest AI art, this technology is becoming no joking matter for many digital artists. We spoke to several artists about the problems with AI art. None of the art in this article is AI generated.Generative AI art: the problemArtists like Deb JJ Lee are taking action against AI art generators to protect their work and copyrights (Image credit: Deb JJ Lee)Illustrator Deb JJ Lee describes the moment they first encountered AI art in their style. ""The experience of seeing someone toss my work into Stable Diffusion and make a model off it was nothing short of devastating,"" they say. ""An artist’s voice is a lifetime development that is an amalgam of their visual vocabulary, interpretations of influences, and even their beliefs. It’s everything. To have work come out from a mindless machine learning model that looks just like mine, but without the struggle of developing that voice, is a slap in the face.""LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqJJ Lee isn’t the only one to go through this experience, and some rights holders are fighting back. Three artists have launched a class-action lawsuit against Stable Diffusion with a lawyer also litigating against GitHub CoPilot, an AI-powered programming tool trained on publicly available code from GitHub.The suit alleges that ""Stable Diffusion contains unauthorised copies of millions – and possibly billions – of copy righted images,"" and seeks to use existing copyright law to sue Midjourney, Stability AI and DeviantArt. Getty Images has also filed a suit against Stable Diffusion, and the Concept Art Association has raised over $200,000 to pay for a government lobbyist in the US, with the intention of updating laws to ensure artists’ interests are protected.Images by German illustrator Roena Rosenberger have been used by AI generators without permission (Image credit: Roena Rosenberger)For individual artists, taking a first step legally can be a constructive action, even just to combat frustration and help with mental wellbeing. Roena Rosenberger, an illustrator and concept artist based in Germany, used her legal costs insurance to hire a lawyer with a view to suing companies that have used her images to train AI models without her consent.Get the Creative Bloq NewsletterDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""It absolutely gave me peace of mind,"" she says. ""I'm a person who needs to have a plan and it helped me a lot to contact a lawyer."" Strategically it makes sense for her to wait until the German courts are more familiar with the issue before moving forward, so she’s currently biding her time.Rosenberger describes the technology as ""a pretty, glossy toy"" that’s alarmingly good at mimicry of artists’ styles, and notes that similar tools will likely start to affect other professions. When that happens, many more people will join the fight to protect the rights of creators. ""Our boat won’t stay as small as it is now,"" she says.Generative AI art needs to be ethical""I'd like AI image generator founders to finally listen to artists. So far they haven't,"" says Christina Kraus. (Image credit: Christina Kraus)Many artists hope the makers of AI image generators will be forced to discard models trained on data sets that contain work they don’t have permission to use, and build new ones using images for which they do have consent. Some companies are going down this road already, for example the photo and video editor Prequel powers some of its effects with its own in-house neural network built on images that artists have been commissioned and paid to create.It's hoped that when artists’ rights are respected, the conversation can move on to exploring how this technology can be used to assist the creative process, as opposed to replacing it. ""I would like to see studios have a dialogue with their artists on how it's possible to implement AI in a way that lightens the workload on tasks that are repetitive, tedious, unwanted time sinks, so that artists have more time for the actual important creative work,"" says Christina Kraus, a freelance artist who specialises in fantasy characters.Alongside the ethical issue of artists’ work being used without permission is the question of the extent to which AI art poses a threat to the livelihoods of artists. It’s often pointed out that AI can’t do the kind of problem-solving that’s core to the role of a professional artist, so do they really need to worry?""I think they have the potential to become a serious threat to working artists in the future if they don't get regulated,"" says Kraus. ""We already see AI images being used on book and magazine covers, to illustrate articles, and even Netflix experimenting with using AI for its anime Dog and Boy.""""Companies simply don't want to pay artists a fair wage for their work and AI is a quick and cheap fix,"" says Kraus. (Image credit: Christina Kraus)Kraus anticipates that more companies will follow in the footsteps of Netflix, especially as the technology becomes more capable and overcomes some of its limitations. ""It's always about saving money and churning out as much content as possible, often with no regard for the quality of the output or the wellbeing of the people creating it,"" she says.""I don't think that AI can displace artists entirely, but it will change the climate, and many of the entry-level jobs that provide the first working experiences will be taken over by AI. Students and artists trying to break in will have an even harder time.""Kraus supports efforts to make training sets ethical by obtaining consent and paying artists, but still holds reservations about the basic nature of the technology. Could we end up with a situation similar to music streaming, in which artists are paid a pittance per ‘use’ of their work?""If AI becomes ethical, there’s nothing to stop companies from using it. If we’re lucky, we’ll get a few bucks for our images being in the training data and that's it. That's why it's so important that studios have a dialogue with artists instead of simply cutting costs and getting rid of them. In the end, I'm not sure if ethical AI would make the situation better or worse for artists at large.""The impact of AI art is seriousCopyright infringement of art has been taken less seriously than fields such as music or film, until now (Image credit: Greg Rutkowski)One artist who became a prominent voice in the conversation is Greg Rutkowski, after it became a trend to use his name as a prompt for generating a particular painterly style. ""I was shocked to find so many artworks signed with my name that weren't mine,"" he says.Rutkowski sees the use of artwork to train AI models without permission as a ""violation on many levels"", and believes that the building of datasets for AI should be strictly regulated. Like many artists, he notes that while AIs might be good at copying a style and producing work with superficial appeal, they can’t design art the way a human does and adapt to feedback.""There is a purpose in designing something from scratch,"" he says. ""When you design clothing for a specific time period, you think about its purpose and the historical context. When you create concept art of machinery, for example, it has to make sense, be believable and look like it works. So far, AIs produce abstract, almost surreal ideas, that may lead you somewhere but have no consistent purpose.""The current situation is something we have seen many times before and will no doubt see again: a new technology emerges and the law has to catch up. Only when that happens will we have an idea of how AI art will fit into our lives.This article originally appeared in Imagine FX issue 226. If you liked this piece, you'll love ImagineFX.

CopyWill Artificial Intelligence replace architects in their roles? In the May 2023 edition of Building magazine, Thomas Lane suggests that AI has the potential to automate up to 37% of the tasks typically carried out by architects and engineers. This automation, though, is likely to target routine and less creative tasks, allowing professionals to concentrate on more strategic and imaginative aspects of their work.Just as Revit and 3D software did not replace architects but only transformed their workflows, the same principle holds for AI tools. AI is poised to bring about new tasks, such as AI management, alongside existing responsibilities, signaling a shift in how architects work.In early 2023, the abundance of images generated by Midjourney and similar AI systems has left many architects pondering its implications. While there's a general concern about the possibility of Artificial Intelligence becoming all-powerful, architects are also intrigued and actively exploring how AI can be integrated into their practice, seeking to grasp its potential applications in their field.It is improbable that AI will fully replace architects shortly. The architectural landscape is evolving rapidly, and although new applications will continue to surface, we are gradually gaining a clearer comprehension of AI's capabilities and boundaries. This developing understanding is shaping a more defined perspective of how AI can impact and transform our professional endeavors.We have nothing to worry about until AI wins an architectural design competition.Possible Future UsesHere are some broad categories that illustrate how Artificial Intelligence can complement architects and enhance our work:1) Design Options Based on Specific CriteriaAI algorithms are highly skilled at handling vast amounts of data and, when equipped with the right tools, have the potential to generate design choices. In the future, architects will likely input criteria like budget, space needs, or sustainability objectives, enabling AI to produce optimized design alternatives for human review.

Imagem © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)2) Site Analysis and Mass StudiesAI tools, such as Autodesk Forma, can extract urban information from open-access databases and help you quickly create mass studies considering environmental data, floor areas, building shapes, heights, setbacks, building codes, etc.3) Generative Design:AI can rapidly produce visual designs when given specific guidelines, including photorealistic images. Architects can leverage generative design software like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Dall-e 2, or Adobe Firefly to investigate different material choices and spatial designs during the initial project phases. Furthermore, hand-drawn sketches or existing images can be used as a starting point for creating more elaborate designs, iterating on them, or making modifications.4) Pattern RecognitionAI can analyze and identify patterns within extensive datasets, spanning architectural drawings, technical configurations, and historical projects. Currently, the process of creating a database that's easily accessible and analyzable by AI is complex, but it is anticipated to become more manageable in the future as technology advances.5) Coding - Custom Apps, Programs, and PluginsAI can assist in coding and developing your applications and software, potentially aiding in organizing your design resources for building databases. It would be particularly beneficial if there were open-source code libraries where architects could collaborate and share information, as opposed to the current situation where libraries are often isolated and fragmented under corporate ownership.6) Energy Efficiency and SustainabilityAI can help architects design energy-efficient and sustainable buildings. By analyzing factors such as climate data, building orientation, material, and energy consumption patterns, AI algorithms can recommend design modifications that make building energy use more efficient and reduce its environmental impact.Save this picture!Contemporary house in Mexico according to IA. Image © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)7) Data SummarizationAI can additionally assist in condensing information from books and reports, making it easier for you to locate essential details swiftly while still having the source available for review. ChatGPT is currently introducing plugins, initially accessible to Premium subscribers, that broaden the range of data that can be analyzed, including real-time internet data.8) Building MaintenanceAI tools have been developed to analyze video feeds and detect weaknesses in areas such as road conditions and the exteriors of existing buildings, which enables early detection of required maintenance for infrastructure.9) Bim and Project ManagementBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of a construction project, encompassing geometric data, materials, and other pertinent information. AI can analyze BIM data, spot potential conflicts or clashes, optimize schedules, and aid in project management activities, thus enhancing coordination and diminishing errors in the construction process.10) Virtual Reality and Augmented RealityArchitects can harness the power of AI-driven virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies to create visualizations and presentations of their designs. These immersive experiences enable stakeholders to navigate 3D virtual environments at various scales, even life-size (1:1 scale), to study spatial connections and make better-informed decisions regarding the building's design and layout.11) Cost Estimation and Material SelectionAI algorithms can scrutinize historical cost data, building material specifications, and market trends, offering precise cost estimates and material recommendations. Architects can utilize this data to make well-informed choices that align with budget restrictions and project needs. To employ this, you might need to establish a database and establish a method for AI to access it unless an open-source or subscription-based database for such information becomes accessible in the future.Save this picture!Contemporary house in China according to IA. Image © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)Considering TrainingWhile AI is unlikely to cause mass job losses for architects shortly, it will fundamentally change the nature of our profession. To effectively embrace new tools and evolving knowledge, architects must remain current and continually update their skill sets.The present moment calls for proactive discussions and solutions. Architects must begin leveraging AI to maintain a competitive edge in an ever more competitive environment. We must acquaint ourselves with AI's capabilities and elevate our proficiency to become ""superusers.""When examining architectural education, we find numerous disciplines that delve into the history of architecture but few that contemplate its future.

Many technologies created to strengthen social connections have had the opposite effect, making users feel isolated and misunderstood. And our move to remote work only extended this problem into the workplace. But generative AI can help bring people together again by helping them do what they do best: connect genuinely through shared experiences and storytelling, says John Ehrhard, CEO of Orson.
Social technologies were a saving grace for businesses when COVID-19 shuttered offices, and millions of people learned to work and remain connected to their teams from home. We gained something from the increased use of Zoom, Teams, Slack, and other collaboration tools. But we lost something, too. 
The ability to collaborate with individuals across different regions and time zones has undoubtedly presented incredible opportunities and efficiencies in business. But this connectivity brings serious pitfalls as well. Incorporating a remote workforce into a company’s culture poses its own set of obstacles.
Research showsOpens a new window  that teams who know and trust one another are more productive. But when people no longer gather together in a physical workplace daily and build face-to-face relationships, mutual understanding and trust become more difficult.
Alignment around a company’s vision can suffer, affecting both remote workers and their employers. With employees frequently switching companies, it becomes increasingly challenging to establish meaningful connections with colleagues. This prevailing sense of isolation and replaceability creates a breeding groundOpens a new window  for anxiety and depression.
Fortunately, the emergence of generative AI can help us reverse this trend. 
Antisocial Networks 
Social technologies designed for the workplace or to strengthen personal connections—have not entirely lived up to the promise of creating happy, cohesive communities. Instead, many have deepened divisions and contributed to increased rates of anxiety and depression. 
The sense of isolation can be particularly pronounced for younger users, which is why there is a growing movementOpens a new window  to prevent people from using Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and other networks until they reach the age of 16. 
We have sacrificed understanding and empathy in our quest for brevity, reducing ourselves to mere soundbites. Though we have unparalleled access to information, we need more effective communication and genuine storytelling about who individuals truly are to determine who to trust. And the more reliant we become on technology, the more disconnected we feel. 
Many of the technologies we have been using to talk to work colleagues or loved ones don’t help to create and maintain new communities – they simply help us distribute content more easily. But real connections aren’t built on just a photo, video, or pithy comment. They are built on shared stories and empathy for one another. 
Social technologies, ironically, have caused our social skills to atrophy. But there is no reason we need to accept this outcome simply. We can fight it and use new technologies to strengthen communities and increase our social skills, especially one of our most critical: building community and empathy through storytelling.

The Art of Storytelling 
Throughout history, human beings have built connections through sharing our stories. But human storytelling arguably took a turn for the worse when stories filled with colorful characters, relatable scenes, and valuable lessons took the form of tweets and self-congratulating Instagram posts. 
Despite the many communication channels available, people today need help to tell their stories effectively. But deep human connection stems from meaningful interactions, and it is through storytelling that we feel stronger empathy toward one another and bind ourselves together into a community. 
Storytelling is ancient; even before oral storytelling took root, visuals were the preferred wayOpens a new window  to tell tales. Today, despite the emergence of many different channels and mediums, video is the most compelling way to share stories.
But telling stories this way has typically required the expertise of producers, directors, writers, cinematographers, and editors.
Reality TV earned a place in our hearts by making us fall in love with—or viscerally loathe, strangers within minutes. Behind this magic lies the science of storytelling.
But until the emergence of generative AI, creating video stories compelling enough to captivate people has been out of reach to just about everyone but entertainment industry insiders.
This is what has changed, and this is why technology can now begin to help us move closer together instead of further apart.

Generative Video
Tech companies today are integrating the science of storytelling into automated video storytelling technology, allowing anyone with an internet connection to create compelling stories and share them. 
AI can now function as a director, revolutionizing unscripted video storytelling by automating every aspect, from conducting interviews to crafting stories and editing engaging episodes with music, imagery, and graphics. 
Anyone can take a short film with a mobile phone. Still, generative AI allows us to take this concept further by building a fully dynamic experience customized to tell specific stories in specific ways. An AI video director can select music and visuals that synchronize with the narrative at precisely the right moments and ask the user the follow-up questions that help the story come to life. This results in beautifully crafted storytelling videos that build meaningful connections with audiences. 
An AI video director might sound like something to have fun with over the weekend, but it is far more than that. It can also be the ultimate employee engagement tool and workplace culture builder. 
Imagine being able to watch a micro-documentary of your new coworker to not only learn what they are passionate about but also to learn how they speak about things they are passionate about. Little things like that help teams get to know each other and build trust much more than reading a resume.
Building Genuine Team Connections in a Globalized World
A company’s success is directly linked to its ability to attract and retain talented individuals while nurturing a strong and connected company culture built around a shared purpose and mission. But today, scaling human connection has become even more daunting as workers try to collaborate across multiple time zones and company leaders look for new ways to lead teams.
Creating stories that resonate with employees across different levels, cultures, and backgrounds is nearly impossible if you don’t have decades of practice and understand the science of storytelling. A skilled AI director could help the CEO share their vision in a way that will resonate with their audience and build alignment and connection across the whole company.
Genuine team connection today necessitates a medium that transcends boundaries, something social media needs to catch up on. Only collaboration authentically and ideally in the visual format that people prefer can accomplish that.
Combining generative AI with video storytelling gives us the first real opportunity to do that. An AI director can do what previous digital collaboration tools and many HR teams have needed help to do.
Companies that want to experience the benefits of having a truly connected team should get on board.

Generative AI is a new and rapidly emerging form of artificial intelligence that has the potential to revolutionize precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment, and drug discovery. It’s comprised of Large Language Models and other intelligent systems that replicate a human’s ability to create text, images, music, video, computer code, and more.




So, naturally, when Damian Doherty, Editor-in-Chief of Inside Precision Medicine, approached me about writing an article on Generative AI, the first thing I did was ask the latest version of ChatGPT to provide a 2,800-word manuscript on the opportunities and issues of its application to precision medicine.
The content it generated was relevant, logically organized, and backed up with factual information. Sentence structures were precise and delivered in an easy-to-understand format. There was a formulaic beginning, middle, and end, with the correct provisos stated for being wrong.
The result was quite good, but in the end, it was a little too GPT-ish. There were many things my human brain wanted to know that it didn’t cover or guide me towards.
In some ways, this exercise mirrors the deeper discussions and explorations that are just getting underway to both understand our new and evolving AI capabilities and define a logical pathway to help clinicians and researchers make the practice of medicine more precise.
I’ve had the benefit of working with the application of AI in health and medicine for over a decade. Here are my very human thoughts on what should be considered as we approach this opportunity.
An AI taxonomy
Generative AI is a relatively new form of AI that has been released into the wild. As such, there are very few experts. This means that we are all early in the journey of understanding what it is and how we apply it to do good.
The chart below provides a simple taxonomy to help differentiate generative AI from other forms of Predictive Analytics.

While there is a great deal of hype over generative AI, there is a growing body of evidence on the things it can do well with humans in the loop:

Write clinical notes in standard formats such as SOAP (subjective, objective assessment and plan)
Assign medical codes such as CPT and ICD-10
Generate plausible and evidence-based hypotheses
Interpret complex laboratory results

Going forward generative AI will provide benefits in many areas including:
Drug Discovery and Development: Assistance in the discovery of new drugs and their development by predicting molecular structures, simulating drug interactions, and identifying potential drug candidates more quickly and accurately. AI can identify existing drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic uses, potentially speeding up the drug development process and reducing costs.
Personalized Treatment Plans: Analyze large-scale patient data, including genetic information, medical records, and imaging data, to guide physicians in the creation of personalized treatment plans tailored to an individual’s unique genetic makeup and health profile.
Disease Diagnosis: Assistance in the early and accurate diagnosis of diseases by analyzing medical images, genomic data, and clinical records, helping healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.
Medicine has been here before—change is hard
Since medicine came out of the shadows and into the light as a data-driven, scientific discipline we’ve always aspired to be better. The reality is that change is hard. It requires us to think and act differently.
When cholera was raging through London in the 1850’s Dr. John Snow was initially rebuffed when he challenged the medical establishment by gathering and presenting data demonstrating that the root cause of cholera was polluted water rather than the prevailing view that it was caused by bad air. From this came the early stages of epidemiology.
In the 1970’s the introduction of endoscopy into surgical practice was met with resistance in the surgical community which saw little use for “key-hole” surgery as the prevailing view and practice was that large problems required large incisions. Today, the laparoscopic revolution is seen as one of the biggest breakthroughs in contemporary medical history.
Generative AI and Large Language Models are part of medicine’s next frontier. They are already challenging current practices across the spectrum of research, clinical trials, medical and nursing school curricula, and the front-line practice of medicine. It’s not a matter of whether it will affect what you do but rather how and when.
With the right dialogue and guidance from a diverse set of stakeholders, we will create a path forward that leverages the benefits of our evolving creations to improve health and medical practices while ensuring that appropriate guardrails are put in place to monitor and guide its use.
It’s not about going slow. It’s about getting things right
In some ways, the challenge of generative AI today is less about increased AI capabilities and more about the velocity of change it is driving.
Generative AI came screaming into mainstream consciousness in the fall of 2022. ChatGPT, a generative AI product from OpenAI, racked up 100 million users in two months. In the history of humans, there has never been a product that has seen such rapid adoption. Shortly after ChatGPT reached this milestone the next version of GPT was released with greatly increased capabilities.

From the practice of medicine to the development of new drugs, generative AI’s “speed of progress” is not following the normal path that economists refer to as linear growth. This is where something new is created that adds incremental value, which then creates a small gap between the time of its creation and when it starts being used. As adoption occurs there is another small gap between uptake and the time it takes for policymakers to develop necessary guard rails to both guide its use and safeguard users from risks. Linear growth is steady and predictable and what clinical and operational systems are set up to manage.
Generative AI is upending linear growth. It’s taking a different trajectory that economists call exponential growth. This is where something increases faster as it gets bigger. Most of our systems are not designed to accommodate this dramatic escalation in change. Exponential growth doesn’t last and eventually, the pace of change returns to linear growth. But when it’s happening it feels like the world is inside a tornado.

Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved landmark rules for AI, known as the EU AI Act. While the regulation is far from becoming law, it aims to bring generative AI tools under greater restrictions. This includes generative AI developers being required to submit these systems for review before releasing them commercially.
The rapid change driven by generative AI has some calling for measures to slow or even suspend AI development to evaluate its impact on humans and society. A petition from the Future of Life Institute was put forward and signed by leaders including Elon Musk calling for a six-month moratorium on AI development.
While there is uncertainty in what we are creating and how it should be applied, it is unlikely that any mandates will slow the pace of AI innovation.
Instead of attempting to slow progress, let us expedite the education and dialogue among policymakers, medical and research leaders, and frontline practitioners to chart a course for progress in applying our new intelligent capabilities. These groups are also most relevant to ensuring that a necessary set of laws, regulations, and protocols are in place to safeguard those both providing and receiving health and medical services.
In keeping with this “gas and guardrails” approach to AI innovation there are two important areas to consider.
The creation of enforceable responsible AI principles
Let’s recognize and support the overall good that can come from AI innovation. At the same time, we must be mindful of how our ever-expanding AI capabilities can replicate and even amplify human biases and risks that work against the goal of improving the health and well-being of all citizens.
Prioritizing fairness and inclusion in AI systems is a socio-technical challenge. The speed of progress is spawning a new set of issues for governments and regulators. It’s also challenging us with new ethical considerations in the fields of medical and computer science. Ultimately the question is not only what AI can do, but rather, what AI should do.
While legislators and regulators work on finding common ground, health and medical organizations using AI today should have a defined set of Responsible AI principles in place to guide the development and use of intelligent solutions. Most often, these principles or guidelines are reviewed and approved at the highest level of leadership and incorporated into an organization’s overall approach to Data Governance.
A framework to manage decisions about decisions
Up until recently, all decisions in health and medicine were made by humans. As AI becomes pervasive in clinical processes it will increasingly make, aid, or impact thousands of granular decisions made each day.
Clinicians, researchers, and leaders must recognize how this impacts decision-making at all levels of an organization. Leaders will need to make a paradigm shift from “making decisions” to creating processes to guide making “decisions about decisions.”
One model gaining traction is put forward by Michael Ross, an executive fellow at London Business School, and James Taylor, author of Digital Decisioning: Using Decision Management to Deliver Business Impact from AI. The model creates a taxonomy well suited to the types of decisions made in providing health and medical services.  Categories include:
Human in the loop (HITL): A human is assisted by a machine. In this model, the human is making the decision, and the machine provides only decision support or partial automation of some decisions or parts of decisions. This is often referred to as intelligence amplification (IA).
Human in the loop for exceptions (HITLFE): Most decisions are automated in this model, and humans only handle exceptions. For the exceptions, the system requires some judgment or input from the human before it can make the decision, though it is unlikely to ask the human to make the whole decision. Humans also control the logic to determine which exceptions are flagged for review.
Human on the loop (HOTL): Here, the machine is assisted by a human. The machine makes the micro-decisions, but the human reviews the decision outcomes and can adjust rules and parameters for future decisions. In a more advanced setup, the machine also recommends parameters or rule changes approved by a human.
Human Out of the Loop (HOOTL): The machine is monitored by the human in this model. The machine makes every decision, and the human intervenes only by setting new constraints and objectives. Improvement is also an automated closed loop. Adjustments, based on feedback from humans, are automated.
Over time AI-driven leaders will create frameworks and new management models that optimize the use of AI in making decisions while supporting clinicians who will remain in control of improved clinical processes and workflows.
AI capabilities will continue to change. How it adds value won’t
In working with health and medical organizations I’m often surprised how many times I see significant investments being made in AI without leaders being able to explain how AI investments will actually drive value at scale.
Using AI to transform anything requires a fundamental understanding of the capability differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what I call Natural Human Intelligence (NHI). Once understood, this becomes your superpower. You now have the ability to pair the unique characteristics of each to drive measurable change.
AI allows us to leverage massive quantities of data and information to look for patterns that humans simply don’t have the ability or time to see. AI is good at finding things we care about, such as identifying patients at high risk of readmissions, falls, or unexpected deterioration. Generative AI is increasingly showing it can generate plausible and evidence-based hypotheses, and automate many activities such as clinical notes or assigning diagnostic codes.
By contrast, humans have the unique ability to draw on a set of skills and characteristics that no form of AI can mimic or replicate. As “smart” as AI is becoming, no one has figured out how to imbue machines with qualities that are essential in the world of health and medicine like wisdom, reasoning, judgement, imagination, critical thinking, experience, abstract concepts and common sense. Such attributes remain as uniquely human characteristics that are essential to making decisions in the provision of health and medical services.
The key to AI driving value comes when it is planned and applied in ways that augment the experiences and skills of clinicians, researchers and knowledge works to help them be better at what they do.
AI in medicine is not about technology. It’s about empowerment
AI has a PR problem. The narrative in the popular press and professional journals is often negative. Headlines like “Half of U.S. Jobs Could be Eliminate With AI,” paint a picture of a future work world dominated by what novelist Arthur C. Clarke calls robo-sapiens.
It’s no wonder that people are worried. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, the potential impacts that AI could have on the workplace and jobs is now one of the top issues impacting the mental health of workers.
Generative AI is already impacting today’s workplace and will be the single greatest change affecting the future of work in the next decade. It will impact how all work is done. As you let that statement sink in, recognize that the issues to be addressed go beyond productivity. After all, work brings shape and meaning to our lives and is not just about a job or income.
In this regard, there is growing evidence to suggest that AI can increase not only productivity but also job satisfaction.
In a randomized trial using generative AI, 453 college-educated professionals were given a series of writing tasks to complete. Half were given support with ChatGPT. The control group was not given access to ChatGPT. The results showed that the time taken to complete tasks was reduced by 40% among those using this form of generative AI. Beyond increased productivity, those using ChatGPT reported an increase in job satisfaction and a greater sense of optimism. Most importantly, inequality between workers decreased.
Done right, AI is not about technology. It’s about empowerment. Properly curated, generative AI will help solve one of the most significant challenges facing healthcare – The shortage of human capital. Here are two immediate opportunities in medicine today.
Keyboard liberation
Many physicians spend more time doing administrative work than they do with patients. One-third of doctors spend 20 or more hours per week doing paperwork. The electronic health record (EHR) creates a virtual 24/7 work environment for physicians. The impact of such “desktop medicine” on their wellness is a challenge for clinicians and organizations alike.
The promise of AI reducing highly repetitive, low-value activities is what Eric Topol MD, Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Institute, and best-selling author of Deep Medicine, refers to as “keyboard liberation.” A study by McKinsey & Company suggests that using AI and intelligent solutions in healthcare could reduce lower-value, repetitive activities performed by clinicians by 36%.
Reducing cognitive burden
A newly minted physician in 1950 would go their entire career (fifty years) before medical knowledge doubled. Today it is doubling roughly every 72 days. Without the use of AI to tame the data explosion, growing cognitive burden impacts quality, patient safety and physician burnout.
Today, 50,000 data points are in the typical EHR system that physicians must sift through each day. Primary care physicians spend more than an hour each day processing notifications.
Value from the exponential growth of data will only be realized by humans harnessing the power of AI.
The effective introduction and use of generative AI in health and medicine enables both cost-cutting automation of routine work and value-adding augmentation of human capabilities. As it and other forms of AI become pervasive in health and medicine, a new intelligent health system will emerge. It will facilitate systems that improve health while delivering greater value. It will provide a more personalized experience for consumers and patients. It will liberate clinicians and restore them to be the caregivers they want to be rather than the data entry clerks we’re turning them into by forcing them to use systems and processes conceived decades ago.
And while generative AI is coming at us fast with much to understand in how we use it, it could not have come at a better time.

AI impact on tech workforce



Prominent figures in the technology industry have recently expressed their thoughts on how Artificial intelligence (AI) might significantly impact the workforce by cutting out numerous professions and leading society to reconsider how individuals spend their time. These forecasts were discussed during a conference where OpenAI CEO Sam Altman delved into AI’s possible influence in reshaping employment opportunities. As AI continues to advance and be integrated into various industries, there is a growing concern about the displacement of human labor, potentially resulting in job losses for many. However, some experts argue that AI and automation could create new jobs and industries, requiring workers to adapt and upskill to remain relevant in the changing job market.
There is a great vid on this discussion last Tuesday. Listen Here.
Unequal distribution of the effects of AI on society
Altman indicated that the unparalleled shifts prompted by AI would not impact everybody equally. However, he anticipates that society as a whole will see improvements, with specific demographics experiencing the majority of these transformations. The CEO of OpenAI highlighted that individuals most affected might have difficulty coming to terms with AI taking over their occupations and re-establishing their sense of purpose. As AI continues to become more prevalent, it will be crucial for governments, educational institutions, and organizations to provide the necessary resources and support to help those facing displacement in the workforce. By fostering adaptability, re-skilling, and promoting lifelong learning, societies can ensure a smoother transition and enable individuals to harness the potential of this technological revolution, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation.
Experts anticipate that incorporating AI in various sectors will result in increased overall productivity and further technological advancements. Nevertheless, the approaching possibility of job loss due to AI has ignited conversations on potential solutions, such as retraining and workforce preparedness initiatives, to dampen the societal consequences of these technological advancements.
Collaboration between industry leaders and policymakers to discuss potential solutions to AI-driven job loss
Industry leaders must collaborate with policymakers to ensure a seamless transition and address the economic hurdles created by the AI-driven shift in the job market. Creating comprehensive strategies for reskilling and upskilling workers impacted by these changes will be essential in maintaining employment and fostering innovation. Furthermore, promoting continuous learning and adapting to new technology will help bridge the talent gaps, ensuring a more inclusive and prosperous future for all.

But new data indicates that AI will not be the job-killer many fear. Ninety-two percent of employees agree that in order to stay competitive their companies will have to shift to an AI-first approach in the next year, according to newly released research from IT solution provider Avanade. But rather than AI replacing jobs, 64% of business and IT leaders actually believe that AI will maintain or even increase the number of human roles at their organization in 2024, with most expecting headcount to increase by up to 9%.  ""This is not about job replacement, it's about task replacement,"" says Erik Barnett, North American digital healthcare and life sciences lead for Avanade. ""There's been so much conversation around the notion of replacing people's jobs when the data seems to prove and support that we still need people, just in different ways."" Read more: A 3 step guide on how AI can be HR leaders' best friend  Fifty-two percent of employees say they trust that their company has the proper safeguards in place to preserve jobs as they expand on AI. According to Barnett, roles that require a lot of coding, transcription and data entry will see the most AI-driven innovation in the months ahead, and the need for employees with the same skills and expertise that can fact check a chatbot's work will continue to grow. ""While AI will take some of the workload off of people's plates, there will be an audit and risk piece that will be increased as a result,"" Barnett says. ""There will be a need for all those technology pieces to come together and be transmitted in a certain way for review. Connecting all those dots behind the scenes is an area where we see potential job increase.""

   But presently, fewer than half of organizations have put in place a complete set of specific guidelines or policies for responsible use of AI, according to Avanade's research. Forty-nine percent of employees are not confident  that their organization's risk management processes are adequate for an enterprise-wide integration of generative AI. Additionally, most employees recognize that they will need additional education and training to best utilize these new tools. Read more: How AI is reshaping job security in the tech world""AI is like a whole new language,"" Barnett says. ""Employees will need to know how to ask themselves, 'How does this impact what we're doing today?' and 'How do we expect that to evolve over time?' There will be a continual change in elements, but that's a good thing as long as I have the right tools."" The task of addressing the skills gap will differ from company to company, according to Barnett. Most likely it will take a team effort among IT leaders, HR departments and even executive leadership.

With the explosive popularity of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, there have been rumors that Apple is working on its own AI product, and that some kind of ""Apple GPT"" artificial intelligence bot could launch in the future.





This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.

Internal Testing and Development

Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Giannandrea established a team that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.

For the last several months, Apple has been testing an ""Apple GPT"" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an ""Ajax"" framework for large language models.

Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.

Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are more powerful than Ajax. Apple reportedly does not have a ""clear strategy"" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with Siri enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.

Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars a day on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend more than $4 billion on AI servers in 2024.

""Ask"" for AppleCare Support Advisors

Apple is testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool with its AppleCare support employees. Called ""Ask,"" the tool is designed to generate responses to technical questions and provide information from Apple's internal knowledge base to speed up support replies.

The feature is in beta right now. Advisors can rate a provided question as helpful or unhelpful, and can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple says the Ask tool is useful for solving complex issues, and because it is pulling from Apple's internal knowledge base, Apple has told advisors that the information is factual, traceable, and useful.

AI for Siri

Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its Siri voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 held an AI summit and briefed employees on its large language model work.

Because of the way Siri is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former Siri engineer John Burkey told The New York Times that Siri's ""cumbersome design"" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the Siri database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.

There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to Siri. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused Siri to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.

The Information suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let Siri automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is aiming for a smarter version of Siri that's deeply integrated with AI. Apple is planning to update the way that Siri interacts with the Messages app, allowing users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. 

Rumors suggest that Siri will have better natural conversation capabilities and improved user personalization. The new functionality will be available across device, so Siri may retain conversation information from one device to another.

AI for Apps

Apple is rumored to be planning to add AI to as many Apple apps as possible. In Apple Music, for example, Apple could use AI to create auto-generated playlists, while in Xcode, AI support could help developers write and troubleshoot code. 

In Pages and Keynote, AI could be used for writing and creating slide decks, while Apple's internal customer support apps could be updated with generative AI to assist with AppleCare. 

Apple's full generative AI vision will take time to fully scale, so the complete suite of AI features that Apple has planned might not arrive until 2025.

On-Device AI

The first AI features coming to the iPhone with iOS 18 will run entirely on-device using the iPhone's hardware rather than relying on a cloud server. Apple may add new capabilities in the future through a potential partnership, but on-device AI will be the focus to begin with.

News and Publisher Deals

Apple wants to partner with major publishers to get permission to use their content for AI training purposes.

So far, Apple has approached Condé Nast, NBC News, and IAC about possible AI deals. Condé Nast publications include Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, Ars Technica, Glamour, The New Yorker, GQ, and more, while IAC owns publications like People, The Spruce, Serious Eats, Martha Stewart Living, Real Simple, Entertainment Weekly, and Better Homes & Gardens.

Proposed deals have been worth at least $50 million, and would al... Click here to read rest of article

While some are worrying about AI wiping out their jobs, others are cashing on the hype — and big money — surrounding the technology by getting jobs in artificial intelligence.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT last November, generative AI technology has taken the corporate world by storm. Venture capital firms have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into AI startups, and companies across industries are looking to beef up their own AI strategies in an effort to cash in on the hype.

That means more jobs in the generative AI space, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Netflix hiring employees to work on their AI initiatives and listing six-figure salaries.But it's not just tech companies seeking AI talent. Employers across a range of sectors — from law to education to healthcare — have been looking to hire workers familiar with tools like ChatGPT, and some were hiring prompt engineers to fine-tune their own AI chatbots.

So how do you start a career in AI and land a job?To understand what recruiters look for in applicants, Insider spoke to four hiring leaders at IBM, Nvidia, Hugging Face, and Jasper for their advice on how to land an AI-related job at their respective companies.Here are 4 tips from hiring leaders on how to increase your chances of landing a job in AI.1) Include your AI skills and past projects on your résuméBefore submitting your job application, make sure your résumé includes the skills and projects needed for the role.

When reviewing applications, Nvidia, the chip giant hiring for technical roles related to machine learning and AI, looks for ""critical skills"" related to math proficiency, programming, deep learning, algorithms, data handling, and AI infrastructure like utilizing graphic processing units, Lindsey Duran, the vice president of global recruiting at Nvidia, told Insider.IBM, the tech giant currently hiring AI engineers, AI application consultants, and AI research scientists, also requires applicants to have strong math and coding skills, as well as an understanding of APIs and other technical concepts, Chris Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, told Insider.

Demonstrating your technical expertise by showing examples of previous work is a plus, Flavien Coronini, the talent acquisition lead at Hugging Face, an AI company behind tools like text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, told Insider.Since Hugging Face is an open source company, Coronini said he looks for GitHub links to their projects when reviewing resumes. By reviewing their projects, Coronini said he can gauge how much impact the applicant could bring to Hugging Face — whether that's the ability to solve a problem or make a program run faster — and can identify if their vision aligns with the company's mission.

When making hiring decisions for less-technical roles like sales and product management, the three recruiters said they look for ""soft skills"" like strong communication, the ability to collaborate, and adaptability to change.2) Demonstrate your interest in AI during the interview — and be able to prove itIf you're lucky enough to land an interview, be prepared to talk about your interest in generative AI.Alex Shapiro, the chief people officer at Jasper AI, an AI marketing and writing software that Shapiro said recently completed its ""key hiring"" over the last three years, said she expects job candidates to show that they've ""done their homework"" and ""understand the technology."" For instance, she said that candidates for engineering roles should be able to differentiate between a ""model layer"" and an ""app layer.""For technical and non-technical roles alike, interviewees can stand out if they can articulate how they've been playing around with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This especially applies to those interviewing for client-facing roles like customer service as it shows ""whether or not people have dived into this industry,"" she said.

""For a new field, I think what helps us to differentiate people is just how much curiosity they've had about the space and what work they've done to learn more about it,"" Shapiro told Insider.Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, would agree with Shapiro. He said that applicants who read AI research papers, follow AI forums, and explore AI-related online courses stand out from the pool because it shows they are genuinely curious about AI and have a ""desire to continuously learn.""3) Don't expect your ChatGPT skills to get you hiredUsing AI tools like ChatGPT can be useful when writing your résumé and cover letters. But make sure you double-check the AI-generated documents for accuracy before submitting them.Shapiro acknowledged that using ChatGPT can be ""great"" in helping applicants ""brainstorm verbs"" and ""bring a level of polish"" to their applications. However, she urges applicants to make sure their AI-generated documents accurately reflect their qualities.

She said there's been times when Jasper recruiters interviewed candidates and discovered that there's a skill in their resume they didn't intend to be there, or a characterization they're not familiar with, which she said could lead to problems down the line.In fact, ChatGPT can actually hurt an applicant's chances of moving forward in the hiring process if the chatbot is used irresponsibly.Duran from Nvidia said there's been instances where recruiters at her company caught candidates using ChatGPT during interviews to answer questions, which she said is prohibited. Coronini from Hugging Face has even seen cover letters that include prompts like ""Insert a cover letter in order to explain why my background is a good fit for this role"" used to generate them — which he calls a"" ""really bad"" practice.""For me, this is a showstopper, because it doesn't really show your motivation to join,"" he said.

4) Don't be afraid to apply — even if you don't meet all of the job requirementsMany AI job listings may require applicants to have college or higher level degrees in computer science and engineering. But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.

""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.

But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.",,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Steven Tweedie'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What, exactly, are soft skills? And why do soft skills even matter, when generative AI seems more skilled than most workers today? Soft skills are things like interpersonal communication, work ethic and other “non-essential” abilities for employees. For example, if you are an architect, hard skills might include working with design software, understanding how air conditioning systems work in large buildings, and being familiar with the fundamentals of earthquake regulations in California. These are hard skills: j0b-related technical knowledge and abilities. Soft skills, like empathy, creativity, integrity, and adaptability might not be as obviously important in your job, they are actually mission-critical for your career. And these skills can’t be outsourced to artificial intelligence, because these soft skills exist inside of you.


In a recent survey, 70% of Gen Z employees report an eager desire to land in the C-Suite, according to Insider. But the path to leadership starts with soft skills. Ambition without effective personal interaction is called “frustration”, as your desires and abilities are not in sync. Instead of wondering what’s missing, access your soft skills - and advance your career in the process.

Soft Skill 1. Learning to Listen
There are three ways to listen. The first is to “listen to affirm” - in other words, so that you can tell someone what their conversation sparks inside of you. Typically, this means referencing something that you’ve learn, read or experienced. This type of listening can be a version of “waiting to talk”, so you can affirm what you already know. The second way to listen is to “listen to defend”. That’s the way that lawyers listen, in a courtroom. When you take a position that’s contrary to what’s being said or offered, you can cut yourself off from possibility, as you wait to counter-punch. Are you really hearing what’s being said? The third way to listen is to “listen to discover”. Discovery points toward what you might learn, gain or uncover inside a conversation. From the standpoint of connection and career advancement, which way do you think is best?

PROMOTED
Soft Skill 2. Presentation Skills
Have you seen a presentation with more “um’s”, “uh’s” and “likes” than you might like? Attention to detail is important in a presentation, which means you have to choose the words that will help you most (and drop the ones that don’t). One key principle of communication: the simplest message is the strongest. Your ability to present your ideas will teach people how to treat you, how to pay you and how to follow your ideas. “Communication,” says Virgin founder, Sir Kenneth Branson, “is the most important skill any leader can possess.”

Soft Skill 3. Resilience and Adaptability
Bouncing back after a challenge is called resilience. Fortunately, for all of us on the other side of the pandemic, we’ve experienced (and accessed) our resilience. Remember the hard times you’ve been through, and notice that you’re still standing. The past reminds us, but it does not define us. We all have the ability to adapt and change. Even when life wasn’t easy, you found a way through. And you can do it again - that’s how adaptability and resilience works. Resilience is remembering. Accessing resilience starts with a reminder: you’re still here. Resilience is inside of you, right now, no matter what you are facing. When we remember that we are often capable of more than we think, we take the first step towards resilience - and away from resistance.

Soft Skill 4. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
Joanne Frederick, a licensed professional health counselor in Washington, DC, explains what emotional intelligence is: “The ability to use, understand and manage one’s own emotions in a positive way, and to manage stress, communicate effectively, de-escalate issues, problem solve and empathize with other people.” That’s a powerful list of soft skills! Emotions are part of the package of human experience, and managing our emotions is really just a question of focus. Where are you putting your attention, in the midst of challenge, and is that the most intelligent choice you can make right now? Sometimes accessing emotional intelligence is as simple as knowing where to look - and learning what you need to ignore.

Soft Skill 5. Nonverbal Communication / Body Language
How’s your non-verbal communication? Your body language is key to your ability to connect with other human beings - and that connection is important to your career advancement. Body language is used for alignment, confirmation and connection: to see if you really mean what you are saying. Body language creates trust, and that soft skill is key to credibility and connection.

Soft Skill 6. Observing Role Models / Learning
The missing piece, when it comes to soft skills, is having a good role model. That’s according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, called New Grads Have No Idea How to Behave in the Office. Recruiters point to the importance of mentorship, coaching and guidance, so that everyone can understand the nuances of connection, visibility and office politics. Soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI. Machine learning is big, but learning from others is bigger (when it comes to advancing your career). Who’s in your corner, when it’s time to for your promotion? Maybe that’s a career model you need to generate.
Soft Skill 7. Access Accountability
During the pandemic, deadlines slipped and shifted. Flexibility was the name of the game, as work from home initiatives took center stage. Now, deadlines matter more. Getting into the office is often a requirement. Showing up on time and at your best means holding yourself and others accountable. What would be one thing you could change, to keep a promise to yourself, and become more accountable?
Moving forward in your career is about keeping promises - another soft skill that goes by the name of “integrity”. These promises aren’t written in your job description, but they are carved into the way you move forward in your career. Keeping your promises to yourself, and to others, is a soft skill that we all possess. As companies outsource hard skills to AI, investing in soft skills just might be promise of the future. Because there’s no generative AI that can make you keep your promises. Your potential is still your responsibility, and your gift to the world. Promise yourself to access the soft skills that define your talents, your contribution, your integrity... and your humanity. Some things - like your career - don’t need to be outsourced to generative AI.

Embrace AI as a tool, focus on unique skills, and secure your future in accounting. Anees Pretorius of Bean explains how to thrive alongside generative AI in the industry.
Generative AI is already making its presence felt in the $587 billion global accounting industry. And while top firms are excited about the possibilities, many accountants worry that the bulk of their day-to-day work will be automated, leaving them scrambling to find billable hours. But accountants who serve as trusted advisors to their clients and go beyond number-crunching have little to fret about, even in the era of ChatGPT.
As Deloitte launches a new practiceOpens a new window  aimed at harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and PWC announces plans to invest $1 billion in the technology, accountants are understandably excited–but also nervous–as generative AI moves deeper into the industry.
On the one hand, GPTs can automate time-consuming tasks like invoice processing, data entry, tax preparation, expense management, and reconciliation, making every accountant more efficient. Long before ChatGPT emerged, McKinsey Global InstituteOpens a new window  estimated that around 86% of the tasks performed by bookkeepers, accounting, and auditing clerks could be automated. And with GPTs in the picture,  it looks more likely that that percentage of the workload will be automated.
The technology can also take significant work off accountants’ plates by finding patterns and trends in massive amounts of data in seconds, which is exciting.
But there is also fear that this improved efficiency could come at a steep cost. A study by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, which placed accounting at the top of the list of industries exposed to disruption and potential job loss thanks to advancements in AI, did little to assuage the fear.
But as any accountant can tell you, the industry is about far more than simply crunching numbers. The human touch, which can never be automated, is as important as data analysis, trend forecasting, and other important functions.
However, generative AI will cause job losses in the accounting industry, at least in the short term. With this in mind, every accountant should take stock of their current job responsibilities and double down on the work machines will never fully master. In some cases, this will mean learning new skills; in others, it will mean seeing your career and what you have to offer clients in a new light.
Some accountants could be out of a job as generative AI begins to take on more accounting work. But those who hone their focus can have a long, gratifying career in the business.

What Machines Cannot Do?
Algorithms won’t replace human judgment and expertise. In-depth financial analysis, forecasting, and modeling require more than simply separating signal from noise, which AI is great at. They also require the interpretation of data, which is followed by expert recommendations. This requires human beings.
Accountants are indispensable when advising businesses on strategy, longer-term planning, and investment decisions. Critical thinking, creativity, and a grasp of context cannot be automated.
Building and maintaining strong client relationships is the best example of something humans do well, but AI (at least so far) cannot. Empathy, communication, and negotiation skills are critical in many client relationships, and the most successful accountants employ these traits and skills regularly.
Human judgment is also necessary to navigate ethical conundrums and help ensure responsible business practices, as it is to adhere to accounting standards and regulations.
Machines can crunch numbers and often determine appropriate courses of action. However, applying laws, regulations, and other considerations to specific situations takes human acumen. Every client has different needs, so they will still turn to an accountant even if an algorithm is helping in the background.

Preparing for the Future
Accountants must prepare for a future where generative AI is a useful tool – not their replacement. To that end, accounting professionals should:

Be a Strategic advisor, not a number cruncher: High-value services like strategic financial planning, business consulting, risk management, and tax planning are more important than ever. Focus on high-value services. Small and young businesses, including early-stage startups, particularly value the strategic guidance an accountant can offer.
Upgrade your data analysis and technology skills: AI can extract valuable insights from data, so you must be good at this, too. And remember: It won’t be a computer that advises the client on how to use these insights; it will be you. As some tasks are automated, accountants will likely have more face-timeOpens a new window  with clients, and clients will likely have a range of questions about new technologies.
Focus on ethics and compliance: Stay up-to-date on changing regulations and accounting standards. Ethics is not AI’s strong suit. You should aim to provide guidance on responsible technology usage and help clients navigate the complex regulatory, ethical, and legal landscapes. This focus will be especially important if clients work in heavily regulated areas, for example, healthcare or government.
Find new niches: Specialize in specific industries, services, or client segments, and be an expert. Becoming an expert means that your specialized knowledge sets you apart from rivals and AI. The most popularOpens a new window  niche areas for accountants today include real estate, manufacturing, professional services, and healthcare facilities – but these are likely to evolve as time goes on.
Harden up the ‘soft skills’: Building and maintaining strong relationships with clients is the future wave since AI will be performing many more solitary tasks. Client relationship management will be one of the most sought-after skills going forward. The most coveted soft skills will vary by industry, but being able to discuss the future direction of new technologies is a skill that will cut across all business verticals.

You are not alone if you already feel the shockwaves from this powerful new technology. Professionals in every industry assess what they bring and what functions can and cannot be automated.
For accountants, it’s all about going beyond number-crunching, preparing necessary tax and business forms, and serving as a strategic advisor to your clients. Accountants who focus on this are poised to prosper in the future.

					Anees Pretorius is a “recovering accountant” and the Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder at Bean, a SaaS-managed marketplace for specialized accounting services. Driven to elevate the accounting and finance profession into a digital age after his experience in the industry, Anees launched Bean to offer the world’s first digital accounting firm and the largest provider of accounting services— without employing a single accountant.

Before Bean, Anees led audit teams at Deloitte, worked as a consultant for Fortune 1000 companies to assist in their assurance practices, and held leadership roles where he implemented strategic strategies focused on technology and transactions (IPO, Divestitures, M&A). While at Deloitte, he transferred from his home in South Africa to San Francisco, and the proverbial veil was lifted after moving to the biggest economy in the world (the U.S.). It inspired him to think bigger about what is possible within accounting and financial services, and Anees coined the company name Bean as an homage to the “beancounters, ” or accountants, he grew up around in Africa.

Since the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace, it has revolutionized business processes like operations and employee engagement and transformed how organizations think about their future. As we look ahead, AI will continue its growth trajectory in both popularity and capabilities.
While these advancements hold great promise, they also carry the responsibility of grappling with AI’s inherent limitations, which could prevent progress in the workplace. Such limitations include algorithmic bias, lack of emotion, creativity challenges and implementation costs. Organizations must comprehend these constraints to fully harness AI’s capabilities. And the new breed of evolving AI — generative AI — will cause significant disruptions across industries and continue to change the way organizations work.
Here are the three main ways I foresee AI developing.

1. Employee Support and Engagement
AI has significantly enhanced employee support and engagement when integrated into workflow structures. When using in-depth analysis of email conversations and biometric data, AI allows employers to better understand employee satisfaction levels, enabling leadership to elevate the employee experience and create a healthier company culture. How does it do this?
AI-powered systems can provide managers with insights about when an employee is facing burnout as they gauge overall sentiment and activity on a daily basis, surpassing traditional tools such as surveys and basic feedback forms. 
For example, AI and natural language processing-powered solutions have the ability to rate the sentiment of a conversation on both Microsoft Teams and Outlook. In doing so, it can rate the conversation in terms of positive, negative or neutral and analyze it over a period to deliver a strong understanding about the employee’s exact sentiment of the workplace.
Employers can also use predictive analysis tools to recommend learning courses and information specific to employee needs and implement improvement action plans without waiting for review meetings.
Looking ahead, AI is set to further revolutionize personalized support and guidance for employees by optimizing workplace-specific algorithms. For instance, AI will incorporate nudging capabilities to identify project misalignments and tasks requiring immediate attention. These workplace-tailored algorithms are meticulously designed to boost productivity, ensuring employees receive timely, customized feedback.
Essentially, AI will enable organizations to shift from reactive to proactive engagement strategies. By implementing AI-based self-assessment tools and personalized recommendations, employees can take ownership of their workplace performance, work-life balance and overall well-being.
 
2. Productivity and Decision-Making
It’s no secret that AI has empowered organizations to make more informed decisions than before, and this will not change. AI-driven decision-making will only grow as AI algorithms provide stronger, more advanced insights that aid such processes. 
Advancements in task automation will continue to streamline repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing employees to dedicate their time to strategic and creative work. Consider a customer support team that previously spent a significant portion of its day manually entering data from customer inquiries. With automation, this time-consuming task is now taken care of, allowing the team to focus on delivering personalized assistance and resolving complex issues more efficiently.
Another area of innovation that has experienced great success thus far is AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools can be transformative resources for improving the employee experience, and they will undoubtedly continue to excel. While these technologies can’t fully replace the need for human intervention, they will offer more sophisticated capabilities in answering complex queries, understanding emotion and delivering personalized responses. 
As a result of the trust organizations have in AI’s ability to assist with decision-making, we will likely see an increase in AI for cybersecurity. AI will be instrumental in enhancing cybersecurity measures as it proactively identifies and mitigates potential threats to protect company data, allowing leaders to act based on AI-driven decisions.

3. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
While AI cannot develop its own ethics and regulations, organizations will begin to prioritize ethical AI development and usage further as its adoption in all other areas will continue to grow. There will be an increased focus on AI governance, data privacy, fairness and transparency to address potential biases and AI-related risks. Striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility will be crucial in harnessing the full potential of generative AI for the betterment of workers and employers alike in 2024 and beyond.When it comes to AI, employee support and engagement, productivity and decision-making and ethical and regulatory considerations will set the stage for workplace advancement in 2024. AI’s capabilities are diverse and will continue to flourish as time goes on. As it evolves, businesses will find the advancements necessary to leverage to create a competitive edge, foster a more engaging and inclusive work environment and achieve company growth.

Space Force Temporarily Bans the Use of Generative AI for Its Workforce




Peter Suciu / Oct 19, 2023 














Intelligence  













 

The United States Space Force has banned the use of web-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools including ChatGPT for its workforce over security concerns. The sixth and newest branch of the United States military issued a memo at the end of last month that called upon Guardians to stop using the AI tools including large-language models on government computers until they receive formal approval by the force’s Chief Technology and Innovation Office.
Though the ban is reportedly temporary, it was “due to data aggregation risks,” the memo stated. The Air Force has confirmed the ban, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“An Air Force spokesperson confirmed the temporary ban, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“A strategic pause on the use of Generative AI and Large Language Models within the U.S. Space Force has been implemented as we determine the best path forward to integrate these capabilities into Guardians’ roles and the USSF mission,” Air Force spokesperson Tanya Downsworth said in a statement, and added, “This is a temporary measure to protect the data of our service and Guardians.”
However, Dr. Lisa Costa, the U.S. Space Force’s chief technology and innovation officer, said in the memo that the technology could serve a purpose in the future. She added that generative AI “will undoubtedly revolutionize our workforce and enhance Guardian’s ability to operate at speed.”
 AI and the DoD
Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that while the private sector has employed AI for years, the Department of Defense (DoD) hasn’t issued department-wide AI acquisitions guidance needed to ensure consistency. The watchdog recommended that the Pentagon develop such guidance and consider private company practices as appropriate.
However, efforts are already moving forward.
In August, the DoD announced the establishment of a generative AI task force, an initiative that reflects the Pentagon’s commitment to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence in a responsible and strategic manner. The DoD recognized that AI has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including defense.
By leveraging generative AI models, which can use vast datasets to train algorithms and generate products efficiently, the DoD aimed to enhance its operations in areas such as warfighting, business affairs, health, readiness, and policy.
Yet, as noted by the Space Force’s pause on its use, concerns remain.
“AI is a new technology, and the risks aren’t well understood, for instance, how is the information being used to train the model assured and protected,” explained technology industry analyst Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group.
Not a Fear of AI
It would be wrong to suggest that the Space Force fears the technology specifically, nor is it simply a matter of security.
“This isn’t so much a fear of AI but the common fear of someone who doesn’t understand the risks implementing a technology that is either unsecured or installed improperly resulting in the potential for a breach,” Enderle told ClearanceJobs. “It isn’t just security either that this kind of policy tries to address because back when Windows 95 was released there were massive outages that occurred because that technology wasn’t properly vetted before implementation. AI’s potential to do harm is far greater than Windows 95, or anything like it ever was, thus a measured approach with the proper approvals and vetting process is required as this policy attempts to assure. I’m actually more surprised this didn’t happen faster than that it happened at all.”
The Space Force’s ban is simply being cautious about new technology that has the potential to do as much harm as good.

Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Legal Profession
10.17.2023
By Susan DeSantis







Panelists at a New York State Bar Association conference predicted that lawyers who are in charge of high-level legal strategies for clients have nothing to fear from artificial intelligence, but the jobs of attorneys who conduct the research and draft the legal documents will change dramatically.
“The battle won’t be between humans and AI but between humans with AI and humans without AI,” said Massimo Sterpi, a partner at Gianni & Origoni in Rome and a member of a panel on artificial intelligence. “Work for lawyers will still be there but at a more complex level. The work is going to become more and more sophisticated.”
Sterpi said that lawyers will want to restructure their fees because generative AI will cut down on the number of hours needed to research and prepare legal documents but will require deep strategic thinking. It will make more sense for lawyers to charge for results rather than hours worked, which in itself would be a dramatic change for the legal profession.
Simple tasks such as drafting rental agreements will be among the 300 million jobs worldwide that Goldman Sachs estimates will be eliminated, Sterpi said. Junior lawyers need to get trained as soon as they can on artificial intelligence and gain higher-level legal skills that automation cannot perform, panelists warned.
“Lawyers who do not embrace artificial intelligence will be replaced,” said Eliseo Roques-Arroyo, managing partner of EDGE Legal in San Juan and another member of the panel on artificial intelligence. “Make no mistake about it. Artificial intelligence is here to stay.”
The speakers were all participating in  the New York State Bar Association’s “Deep Dive into the Metaverse and Web3: The Second Global Law Symposium & Tech Summit, which took place Oct. 16 to 17 at New York University.
Emily Lewis, an associate at ArentFox Schiff in Washington, D.C., who was on a panel on cybersecurity, warned lawyers that ChatGPT, an OpenAI program, should be off limits.
“It’s important to remember that the second you input something into ChatGPT, your attorney-client privilege is broken,” she said.
Instead, firms should create their own AI software to preserve attorney-client privilege, she said. Creating such software is not easy; it requires hiring expert support staff, training lawyers and making clients aware of the role AI is playing. And after all that work is done, lawyers need to understand the limitations.
“You need to be careful to use AI as a tool.  It’s not a substitute,” she said. “But don’t ask it to write a brief for you.”
A case in point is Mata v. Avianca, which prompted New York City lawyer Steven A. Schwartz of the firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman to use ChatGPT to write a brief. The problem is that ChatGPT made up the cases. Schwartz told  U.S. District Court Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York that he didn’t realize that ChatGPT could invent case law.
Despite such growing pains, Marc Beckman, chief executive officer of DMA United and the moderator of the panel on AI, said lawyers need to embrace AI and other newer technologies. He believes that AI, in particular, will have a positive impact on those in the bottom 30% of U.S. socioeconomic brackets. People who can’t afford legal representation will be better off once they can use AI to get basic legal help, he said.
Christopher Lyon, a partner at Goldberg Segalla in New York City and a member of the AI panel, doesn’t think the transformation will come as quickly as Beckman predicts. Only 30% of attorneys are early adapters of technology, he said. So change will come but lawyers still have time to adapt. “There’s going to be a hundred different ways to integrate AI into the practice,” he said.
One participant at the conference asked why every lawyer has to become familiar with AI rather than rely on specialists within the firm who are the experts.
Roques-Arroyo, the managing partner of EDGE Legal from San Juan, said that won’t work.
“Lawyers have an ethical obligation to be competent in these technologies,” he said. “You have a duty to supervise technology.”
And Roques-Arroyo went even further, “I think I have a duty to disclose to a client if I’m using AI technology. Not doing so will expose you to malpractice.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to include proposals and give shape to plans for the future of artificial intelligence in New York in January's State of the State, including ideas to regulate the developing technology and expected impacts on the workforce.
Hochul and her staff are meeting with experts to develop proposals related to AI in the coming months.
""Executive Chamber staff and the governor herself are engaged in ongoing discussions with experts inside and outside of government to develop proposals on the big issues facing New Yorkers, including artificial intelligence,"" a spokesperson with Hochul's office said in a statement Thursday. ""The governor will, as always, release a bold comprehensive policy agenda in January as part of the State of the State.""
Hochul announced $20 million to advance AI research in the state at SUNY's first-ever AI Symposium at UAlbany earlier this week. When speaking to reporters at the event, Hochul floated forming a state task force to research the best ways to use AI and safeguard against possible consequences. Officials expect her to release more details about proposals for that task force in her executive budget proposal to be released in early 2024.
Artificial intelligence does not have its own line item in the state budget, and state Budget Division officials say it's difficult to calculate the state's total annual expenses related to the industry.
Assembly members on Thursday held a public hearing in Albany to examine the impact of artificial intelligence on the workforce. Lawmakers said they want to work with business owners and union leaders as artificial intelligence expands in society, and is expected to transform the workplace.
""AI is on the rise and it's here to stay, and it's going to change the world as we know it,"" Assembly Labor Committee chair Latoya Joyner said.
The technology can allow for faster decision-making, but it's not always accurate, or ethical, with potential copyright infringements, privacy concerns and inevitable bias in its algorithms.
""It's accelerating at a pace where it may be used in ways that we don't want as a society and we need to get the checks and balances in place for it,"" said Christopher Ford, council leader and executive board member of state workers' union Public Employees Federation.
State workforce union leaders testified to lawmakers Thursday that workers must be trained for new skills or other positions to avoid job cuts or displacement of employees.
On Monday, Hochul said she's confident the development of AI will not impact the state workforce, citing thousands of open positions.
""No one in our workforce needs to worry about losing a job, I'm trying to find more workers,"" the governor said. ""I just stopped a hiring freeze that had been in place for many years that eviscerated our agencies. I'm trying to hire people.""
But PEF leaders say AI will pose a risk to employees, as managers will eye potential cost savings. 
Union leaders say artificial intelligence was discussed in the latest collective bargaining agreement ratified earlier this year, and that a human must remain accountable for decisions made on the job. 
They warned lawmakers AI should not be used for public assistance, substance use treatment, mental health referrals and other human services.
""There is no price tag you can put on humans, right? That's truly what makes our society move forward,"" Joyner said.
She said the Legislature wants to be cautious with AI and avoid its hazards without suppressing the potential benefits of the unfolding technology.
Proposals regulating artificial intelligence could become a higher priority next session, but lawmakers say they're committed to putting humans first.
Assemblyman Alex Bores says he expects it will be part of upcoming difficult budget conversations as AI can streamline processes and cut costs.
""Where we can save money using AI, we should definitely be looking at it, but where we have to spend to reduce the risks, that will be a top priorioty,"" said Bores, a Manhattan Democrat. ""This is a field that's moving so quickly, we can't just kick it off to future budget cycles.""
Panelists also suggested lawmakers explore imposing a tax on employers that choose to replace staff with AI technology.

As school districts in the Treasure Valley see a rise in the use of artificial intelligence, educators say they’re figuring out ways to ensure the new tools are being used responsibly and don’t impede student learning.School officials in Meridian and Nampa told the Idaho Statesman that they’ve seen students increasingly use AI in their work. In Nampa, administrators have created a task force to recommend to the district any changes or policies to implement. The West Ada School District plans to expand teachers’ resources to allow them the ability to detect AI-generated work, spokesperson Nicole Scheppers told the Statesman by email.“As a district, we are aware of the growing use of AI by students and have taken the role of leading learning toward the use of AI in a responsible manner,” Scheppers said. “West Ada will add ... the ability for teachers to determine areas in student work that may have been AI-generated to ensure we are able to reinforce ethical practices and genuine student learning.”Scheppers said West Ada has also provided guidance for teachers on what qualifies as cheating when students use AI, ways to promote ethical use of it and other resources. She said the district has software that monitors internet access on its devices, lets teachers monitor students’ screens, and identifies potential plagiarism in student work. Scheppers didn’t respond to follow-up questions seeking additional details about the software. Drew Williams, Nampa School District’s K-12 blended learning specialist, told the Statesman the district has seen a rise in students using ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses AI to replicate realistic dialogue, to cheat in the past couple of months. The trend has been most common in language arts classes and at the high-school level, she said.Williams said teachers and faculty have told her that students’ use of ChatGPT has made it challenging to identify how much students really learned, and whether they’re developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. If teachers suspect students of cheating, she said, they might ask students to provide information on their sources and where they got the information to assess their knowledge in the topic.Because technology is moving fast, Williams said, it will be a slow process of understanding the full impact that ChatGPT and AI technology will have on education. The task force is in the early stages and has no deadline to complete its research, she added. But it plans to seek input from educators and will later open the meetings to students and parents as well.Having a foundation of understanding of how to generate code in a computer science class and how to structure a paragraph effectively by doing their own writing before using tools to help draft, refine, and evaluate are important learning skills for students, Williams said. The Nampa School District currently blocks ChatGPT and other AI tools from school-issued devices for students but not for teachers.“Teachers are figuring this out and everybody’s figuring this out,” Williams said. “Hopefully we can really put together recommendations that will lead us forward and help prepare kids, because that’s what our job is at the end of the day.”The Boise School District didn’t respond to requests for comment.Can AI be used as a learning tool?In West Ada’s statement, Scheppers acknowledged that rapidly developing technology, such as ChatGPT, can be used in responsible ways and can be “powerful tools to assist in the teaching and learning process.”“We want students to develop critical thinking skills that will help students learn to problem solve rather than engage in learning that is solely focused on ‘answer getting,’” Scheppers said. “As educators, it is imperative that we learn about and engage in AI tools.”Yu-hui Ching, associate professor of educational technology at Boise State University, told the Statesman that benefits can arise from the use of ChatGPT and other AI features for educational purposes. Specifically, Ching said AI could aid in reducing teacher burnout following the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Ching said educators could use AI tools to generate tests and multiple-choice questions.Instead of students using ChatGPT and other AI tools to generate work, Ching said students could instead learn to use the technology as a learning companion. For example, if teachers can’t address the immediate needs of a student and answer questions, then students could instead input a question into an AI tool.“If teachers can learn how to use this generative AI more efficiently in teaching, it has a lot of potential to help fight teacher burnout and help teacher retention,” Ching said.Ching worries that AI is going to affect white collar workers. Ching said she anticipates the fields most affected will be education, journalism, graphic design, software engineering and most computer science programs that require generating code.

Still, it’s difficult to realize the full potential of these tools without clear purpose. Adopting technology just for technology’s sake carries inherent risks: new technology plus an outdated process will only equal an expensive old process, creating a subpar experience for employees and customers. The more sustainable value of technology adoption doesn’t come from what the technology does, but what the user can do with it.
 
With this in mind, we can plot the potential impact of generative AI in two powerful categories of use cases: AI collaboration and talent and governance strategy.
 
AI collaboration
 
Organizations will have to assess how AI could influence both back-office functions, and customer-facing work. For example, AI might be thought of as an added digital assistant taking on bulk analytical or technical tasks in a first instance. Employees could utilize their AI tools for mundane or repetitive tasks. The Digital Worker Experience Survey from Gartner found that 47% of digital workers struggle to find the information or data needed to effectively perform their jobs, presenting an opportunity for AI-powered tools and collaborative technologies to increase efficiency.
 
More wide-reaching for internal use is generative AI’s influence across business functions, like HR and  Payroll (via ey.com US). AI tools can perform rolling analysis on performance indicators of employees and recommend training and upskilling opportunities. Through individualized credentials and authentication, AI tools can give different levels of information appropriate to the seniority and job title of the requestor. These digital tasks can run independently, around the clock, allowing for reports or red flags to be delivered constantly. This is more robust than traditional automation because these new tools have deeper context and generative abilities.
 
Talent and governance
 
Generative AI’s ability to identify training opportunities for employees can also contribute to an overall assessment of the skills organizations have now and will need in the future. The ability to customize these technologies can enable new ways to create a career development track attuned to employee experience and business need.
 
Importantly, the enterprise-level implementation of generative AI with large data sets and confidential materials can help ease compliance exercises, while also creating areas for potential risk. These AI tools built for purpose can automate the gathering, cleansing and interpretation of data, while summarizing findings and offering recommendations from it. These tasks need to be done within the context of an organization’s ethical AI governance framework, maintaining guardrails that are appropriate for an organization’s particular needs. Generative AI outputs should be seen as first drafts, with people making adjustments and final assessments of the work.
 
But appropriate guidelines can make that first draft even better.
 
For business functions requiring bulk retention of certain types of data to maintain regulatory compliance, or more stringent privacy controls, generative AI tools need to follow clearly defined and transparent access and retention policies and have processes in place to monitor for potential legal risks around the use or leveraging of intellectual property.
 
This need extends to AI-enabled HR tools to assess opportunities for improvements to internal communication, process change or technology investments, or other unseen challenges. By mixing quantitative and qualitative assessments of the workforce, both with AI tools and apart from them, leaders can better understand the state of organizational culture and capabilities. Industrializing the analysis of multiple data sources may help identify bright spots or hotspots related to employee retention, and quickly, deeply and consistently respond to and anticipate opportunities.
 
Similarly, this assessment can flag potential compliance or regulatory risks in real time. But the effectiveness and reliability of this activity relies on an appropriate ethical generative AI framework and governance model, including countering potential bias transmitted through public training data, and avoiding the recycling of toxicity received in certain inputs.   
 
Even with the need for regular management and maintenance of generative AI tools, these systems can provide better visibility on how an organization is operating and organizing itself for the “next normal” of work.

So how can legal professionals build trust in AI? ",,,,"  Artificial IntelligenceEstablishing trust in generative AI October 9, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 9, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email OpenAI’s ChatGPT prototype opened a world of possibilities to generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the technology continues to revolutionize the way we live and work. As its role in our daily lives continues to expand, many lawyers and legal industry experts are beginning to recognize what these tools could mean for the profession. In a recent survey of lawyers conducted by the Thomson Reuters Institute, 82% of legal professionals said they believe that generative AI such as ChatGPT can be applied to legal work, with 59% of partners and managing partners sharing generative AI should be applied to legal work. Despite this large majority, organizations are still taking a cautiously proactive approach. 62% of respondents shared their concerns with the use of ChatGPT and generative AI at work, and all who were surveyed noted that they do not fully trust generative AI tools like ChatGPT with confidential client data.  The introduction of any new technology comes with understandable hesitancy, but these key findings show one thing for certain: establishing trust in AI is essential. So how can legal professionals build trust in AI?  Trust in AI starts with transparencyAs explained in our companion article about the current state of AI, transparency in relation to AI means that stakeholders — including developers, users, and legal practitioners — should feel confident in the quality of the data that AI models use and how they make decisions. They should also be prepared to test AI outputs against their own knowledge and expertise in early implementations of those outputs.  Furthermore, transparency gives confidence that ethical principles are being followed throughout the development and deployment of a generative AI system to avoid bias. This includes confirming that data used for training models is collected responsibly and without prejudice toward particular groups or individuals.   Legal work and AI transparency The greatest and most fundamental trust generator is accuracy. Keep in mind that generative AI tools may not always produce correct results and that human oversight is still necessary. Therefore, lawyers should always review any documentation provided by an AI system to ensure that it meets standards for accuracy, explainability, and security. Using generative AI with confidential client data also means firms must establish proper governance structures, including strong security measures such as:Encryption and authentication protocolsRobust policies about ethical usageRegular auditing and testingStrong content filtration systemsHuman in the loop (HITL): always submit large language model (LLM) outputs to human review (at least during the initial phase of working with LLM)Knowing your user (for traceability)Educating employees about the promise of LLM and its limitationsAppropriating personnel trained on best practices for using the technology securely and responsibly Having these measures in place will help ensure that any risks are minimized while maximizing generative AI’s potential benefits. One consideration to take is adopting a “fail safe” system where any discrepancies or errors flagged by the AI tool are automatically escalated for manual review by a lawyer or other qualified personnel. This way, inaccurate decisions can be corrected quickly and confidently in a way that benefits both clients and organizations alike.  It is clear that generative AI is poised to revolutionize the way the legal industry practices law, and it is here to stay. But with this emerging technology comes a crucial need for trust — giving lawyers the confidence that they are able to protect client interests while learning to do better work with an innovative solution. What you should know before investing in an AI-powered legal tech providerHere are three important criteria for choosing the right AI-powered legal tools.Read blog postVisit our hub on artificial intelligence.  AwfulPoorAverageGoodExcellentRated 4.0 by 4 users.Sending rating...Thank you!

The study, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of Visier - a cloud-based analytics platform designed to assist people and businesses in decision-making - found that UK employees who are already  embracing AI in the workplace  are saving 1.55 hours per day. This amounts to around 390 hours a year. But employees taking advantage of the new technology are far from the majority. Some 56 per cent of employees in the  Visier  study said that their employers are not encouraging the use of AI at work,  and 53 per cent are concerned about AI replacing the skills they currently have and taking away their jobs. The research took in responses from 3,030 people aged 18 and above working at companies with over 250 employees in the UK, Germany US, and Canada between 25 and 31 May.  How do workers feel about working with AI? Despite the time-saving potential of AI, the study shows that workers feel ambivalent about  how the new technology is going to impact their work life.  More than one in three (36 per cent) said that AI will make them more stressed at work, while 37 per cent said they’re concerned that their work will be less accurate because of AI. Some 38 per cent are worried that AI might compromise data privacy. But while they fear the consequences of deploying AI in the workplace, more than two in three (67 per cent) think that developing AI skills is going to be important for their future career growth, showing that they think AI will inevitably be part of their job one day. At the same time, workers do not necessarily think it will be their AI skills that get them a promotion in the future. Some 40 per cent of employees studied by Visier think that soft skills are the most important to support career growth, while 43 per cent believe leadership skills are.  Only 10 per cent of employees thought that hard skills - like mastering the use of emerging technology - was a crucial aspect to get further in their careers. Some 40 per cent think that AI will improve their work-life balance, and 31 per cent think that it will help close the skills gap in the UK workforce. Is AI likely to become part of UK employees’ jobs? The UK is currently in the process of building the regulation of AI in the workplace, after campaigners, trade unions and some members of Parliament called for the government to impose stricter oversight of how the new tech could be used. For years now, the debate around AI in the workplace has been split between pros and cons, and the need to find a balance between the two. “Making work more rewarding, making it more satisfying, and crucially making it safer and fairer: these are all the possibilities that AI offers us,” Mary Towers, an employment lawyer who runs a Trade Union Congress (TUC) project on AI at work, said during a half-day conference about the topic in April. “We’re at a really important juncture, where the technology is developing so rapidly, and what we have to ask ourselves is, what direction do we want that to take, and how can we ensure that everyone’s voice is heard?” A survey published last month by the Prospect trade union showed that almost 60% of British people want regulation of AI in the workplace. “The workplace has been disrupted by rapid innovation and everyone has a role to play in its smooth adoption. With skills gaps widening across the UK, AI can alleviate a wide range of pain points. But, with opportunity comes responsibility,” said Ben Harris, Director UK MD at Visier.  “Business leaders must ensure they are spotting gaps in employee skills, and training them on emerging technologies like, but not limited to, AI. By taking a skills-based view, organisations can rethink roles, and identify skills that can be combined with emerging technologies like AI to future-proof jobs, boost productivity and enhance performance. In a context of skills and labour shortages, combining AI with transferable skills will enable companies to fill gaps easily and stay competitive while minimising redundancies.” ', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-10 15:46:45 +02:00', 'dateModified': '2023-07-10 15:59:15 +02:00', 'datePublished': '2023-07-10 15:59:13 +02:00', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/74/15/26/1440x810_cmsv2_5b595f70-839a-5a19-94a3-1c35799137ea-7741526.jpg', 'width': '1440px', 'height': '810px', 'caption': 'Working with AI could save hundreds of hours of work every year for UK workers -- but many are worried that the new tech will replace their skills.', 'thumbnail': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/74/15/26/385x202_cmsv2_5b595f70-839a-5a19-94a3-1c35799137ea-7741526.jpg', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'euronews', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png'}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Giulia Carbonaro', 'url': 'carbonaro', 'sameAs': 'https://twitter.com/carbonaro_giu'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'legalName': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png', 'width': '403px', 'height': '60px'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}, 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'hasPart': {'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.poool-content'}, 'speakable': {'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xPath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""], 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/07/10/embracing-ai-could-save-employees-about-390-hours-of-working-time-per-year-uk-study-shows'}}, {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Euronews.com', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'potentialAction': {'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.euronews.com/search?query={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}]",BreadcrumbList,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Next', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/next'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Tech&#x20;News', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/tech-news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'name': 'AI models don’t comply with the EU’s AI Act, according to a Stanford study'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, 66% said they would not want to apply for a job with an employer that uses AI to help make hiring decisions.
But AI is here to stay. In fact, it is one of the most innovative and promising tools for workplace efficiency and workforce management.
As we navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new frontier: generative AI. This cutting-edge technology presents both opportunities and significant challenges. In this article, we delve into the world of generative AI, its implications in the workplace, and the legal considerations surrounding its use. To help illustrate the concept, we will draw parallels with the iconic movie, “The Matrix.” And regardless of if you are taking the red pill or the blue pill (watch the movie!), the takeaways for employers are the same:

We have been living with and benefiting from AI for decades. However, generative AI is different, both in what it can do, how it does it, and who can use it.
There are serious concerns about the proliferation of generative AI without proper guardrails in place to harness the technology, especially the potential for bias in recruiting and hiring.

Understanding Generative AI
AI has been subtly influencing our lives for decades. However, generative AI is a different beast altogether. It can generate text, images, video, and audio, and even replicate a human’s voice after just hearing three seconds of audio. In a way, the new technology is analogous to The Matrix; it creates a simulated reality almost indistinguishable from the real world.
The many pros and cons of generative AI in the workplace underscore the need for a balanced approach that respects legal boundaries while harnessing the power of this innovative technology.
The Benefits
Generative AI holds immense potential for both individuals and businesses. In the workplace, this technology can be leveraged to draft more accurate job descriptions, simplify processes, and eliminate repetitive tasks. By handling the preliminary legwork, generative AI allows companies to optimize efficiencies, thereby revolutionizing the hiring process. It is like having your own Agent Smith, the main antagonist of The Matrix franchise, tirelessly working behind the scenes to streamline operations – but, hopefully, without the destruction.
Beyond the workplace, generative AI can solve complex problems, preserve languages on the brink of extinction, and assist visually impaired individuals in understanding their surroundings. It can tailor professional development content to each person’s unique style, needs, and preferences. The potential applications of this technology are vast, promising a future where AI can significantly enhance our capabilities and experiences, much like the limitless potential of The Matrix.
The Risks and Regulations
Despite its potential benefits, generative AI also presents significant risks. It could potentially automate weapons, and quickly identify and exploit security vulnerabilities. It also has a power that is not necessarily controlled by its human creators. This echoes the dystopian future presented in The Matrix, where AI has become an uncontrollable force.
The potential for misuse of generative AI underscores the need for robust regulations. In the context of hiring, for instance, there are concerns about the potential for bias when using generative AI. Recognizing this, New York City recently passed a statute requiring employers to notify candidates if an automated system is being used in the hiring process. The law also mandates that employers provide candidates with an alternative means of being screened and commit to having an external auditor evaluate the tools annually for evidence of bias.
Other states and local jurisdictions across the country have bills in the works and are considering some form of regulation around the use of AI in the hiring process.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also has instructed employers: “Be careful, be conservative. We’re watching that you’re using this. We think that there’s bias here and you shouldn’t be using these tools.”
These developments represent a significant step toward ensuring the responsible use of AI in the workplace. However, as generative AI continues to evolve, so too must our legal frameworks. We need to train the models to continue in the direction that we intend them, and not go down a rabbit hole, and start to do things that are in misalignment from the intended purpose. This is akin to the struggle in The Matrix – to control AI and prevent it from taking over.
Conclusion
Generative AI represents a new frontier in technology, one that holds immense potential but also significant risks. As we continue to explore this brave new world, it is crucial that we strike a balance between harnessing the power of generative AI and ensuring its responsible use. This technology can revolutionize the workplace. However, without proper guardrails and legal frameworks in place, the proliferation of generative AI could lead to unforeseen consequences, much like the dystopian future depicted in The Matrix.AuthorsTracey E.

Published: 10 Oct 2023


 
A factory filled with robot workers once seemed like a scene from a science-fiction movie, but today, it's just one real-life scenario that reflects manufacturers' use of artificial intelligence.







Manufacturers can benefit from AI implementations in several ways. Here are 10 examples of AI use cases in manufacturing that business leaders should explore now and consider in the future.

1. Cobots work with humans
Collaborative robots -- also called cobots -- frequently work alongside human workers, functioning as an extra set of hands.
While autonomous robots are programmed to repeatedly perform one specific task, cobots are capable of learning various tasks. They also can detect and avoid obstacles, and this agility and spatial awareness enables them to work alongside -- and with -- human workers.
Manufacturers typically direct cobots to work on tasks that require heavy lifting or on factory assembly lines. For example, cobots working in automotive factories can lift heavy car parts and hold them in place while human workers secure them. Cobots are also able to locate and retrieve items in large warehouses.

2. RPA tackles tedious tasks
While manufacturing companies use cobots on the front lines of production, robotic process automation (RPA) software is more useful in the back office. RPA software is capable of handling high-volume or repetitious tasks, transferring data across systems, queries, calculations and record maintenance.
RPA software automates functions such as order processing so that people don't need to enter data manually, and in turn, don't need to spend time searching for inputting mistakes. In this way, RPA has the potential to save time and labor.
RPA is also known for being able to handle server issues and downtime. In the event of these types of complications, RPA can reboot and reconfigure servers, ultimately leading to lower IT operational costs.



Manufacturers are increasingly adding AI components into their processes to boost efficiency while lowering costs.







3. Digital twins help boost performance
Companies can use digital twins to better understand the inner workings of complicated machinery.
A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object that receives information about its physical counterpart through the latter's smart sensors. Using AI and other technologies, the digital twin helps deliver deeper understanding about the object. Companies can monitor an object throughout its lifecycle and get critical notifications, such as alerts for inspection and maintenance.
As an example, sensors attached to an airplane engine will transmit data to that engine's digital twin every time the plane takes off or lands, providing the airline and manufacturer with critical information about the engine's performance. An airline can use this information to conduct simulations and anticipate issues.


4. Predictive maintenance improves safety, lowers costs
Manufacturing plants, railroads and other heavy equipment users are increasingly turning to AI-based predictive maintenance (PdM) to anticipate servicing needs.
If equipment isn't maintained in a timely manner, companies risk losing valuable time and money. On the one hand, they waste money and resources if they perform machine maintenance too early. On the other, waiting too long can cause the machine extensive wear and tear. The latter can also expose workers to safety hazards.
PdM systems can also help companies predict what replacement parts will be needed and when.


5. Lights-out factories save money
An AI in manufacturing use case that's still rare but which has some potential is the lights-out factory. Using AI, robots and other next-generation technologies, a lights-out factory operates on an entirely robotic workforce and is run with minimal human interaction.
Manufacturers can potentially save money with lights-out factories because robotic workers don't have the same needs as their human counterparts. For example, a factory full of robotic workers doesn't require lighting and other environmental controls, such as air conditioning and heating. Manufacturers can economize by adjusting these services.
Robotic workers can operate 24/7 without succumbing to fatigue or illness and have the potential to produce more products than their human counterparts, with potentially fewer mistakes.


6. Machine learning algorithms predict demand
AI systems that use machine learning algorithms can detect buying patterns in human behavior and give insight to manufacturers.
For example, certain machine learning algorithms detect buying patterns that trigger manufacturers to ramp up production on a given item. This ability to predict buying behavior helps ensure that manufacturers are producing high-demand inventory before the stores need it.





7. Inventory management prevents bottlenecks
Some manufacturing companies are relying on AI systems to better manage their inventory needs.
AI systems can keep track of supplies and send alerts when they need to be replenished. Manufacturers can even program AI to identify industry supply chain bottlenecks.
For example, a pharmaceutical company might use an ingredient that has a short shelf life. AI systems can predict whether that ingredient will arrive on time or, if it's running late, how the delay will affect production.


8. AI boosts supply chain management
One strong AI use case in manufacturing is supply chain management. Large manufacturers typically have supply chains with millions of orders, purchases, materials or ingredients to process. Handling these processes manually is a significant drain on people's time and resources, and more companies have begun augmenting their supply chain processes with AI.
For example, a car manufacturer might receive nuts and bolts from two separate suppliers. If one supplier accidentally delivers a faulty batch of nuts and bolts, the car manufacturer will need to know which vehicles were made with those specific nuts and bolts. An AI system can help track which vehicles were made with defective hardware, making it easier for manufacturers to recall them from the dealerships.


9. AI systems detect errors
Manufacturers can use automated visual inspection tools to search for defects on production lines. Visual inspection equipment -- such as machine vision cameras -- is able to detect faults in real time, often more quickly and accurately than the human eye.
For example, visual inspection cameras can easily find a flaw in a small, complex item -- for example, a cellphone. The attached AI system can alert human workers of the flaw before the item winds up in the hands of an unhappy consumer.


10. AI systems help speed product development
Some manufacturers are turning to AI systems to assist in faster product development, as is the case with drug makers.
AI can analyze data from experimentation or manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can use knowledge gained from the data analysis to reduce the time it takes to create pharmaceuticals, lower costs and streamline replication methods.

According to the National Registry of Exonerations, since 1989, the wrongly convicted have lost 29,950 years of their lives thanks to miscarriages of justice in the U.S. legal system.


In an attempt to tackle this, the California Western School of Law established the California Innocence Project, which aims to assist in cases with compelling evidence indicating that people have been locked up unfairly.

This is often highly complex, labor-intensive work requiring many hours of dedication by professional lawyers and researchers. However, an innovative artificial intelligence partnership is helping to hugely speed up the painstaking work, giving hope that it will lead to a reduction in time spent behind bars by innocent people.

PROMOTED
In this piece, I’ll take a look at the partnership and the technology behind it, as well as consider the potential impact that generative AI tools can have on the legal profession in general.

What is the California Innocence Project?
The project was founded in 1999 with the aim of freeing the wrongfully convicted, advocating for reform in the justice system and training lawyers and students to deal with miscarriages of justice.

Students are selected from the California Western School of Law to work alongside qualified attorneys on cases where there is evidence of wrongful convictions and incarceration.
It’s one of a number of legal organizations dedicated to overturning wrongful convictions, which, between them, have played a part in securing close to 4,000 exonerations.

Examples of high-profile wins include the overturning of the conviction of Timothy Atkins, who spent 23 years in prison after being wrongfully imprisoned for a murder carried out during a carjacking, and the conviction of Kimberly Long in 2016 for murdering her boyfriend. In both cases, lawyers working with the project uncovered new evidence that persuaded judges that the convictions were unsafe.

How is the California Innocence Project using Generative AI?
To assist with the time-consuming and highly technical work of reviewing mountains of evidence and case law connected to their investigations, CIP lawyers deployed a generative AI model developed by CaseText in partnership with ChatGPT creators OpenAI.
Billed as an AI legal assistant, the platform – known as CoCounsel, is capable of reviewing and summarizing legal documents, preparing depositions and drafting reports. It's based on a large language model (LLM) of the same type used by the OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot but specifically trained on legal documents, case law and court proceedings.
According to CIP attorney Michael Semanchik, the time saved by using the tool for these essential but mundane tasks frees the legal team to spend time on tasks that require human interaction. For example, drafting a letter to send to a client traditionally takes around 15 minutes but can now be achieved in under one minute. Complex documents can be summarized in plain English, reducing the time taken by a human to digest and comprehend them.
Of course, working in such a sensitive field means it’s critical that the AI produces accurate output and isn’t affected by bias, hallucinations and other issues that can affect generative AI.
In order to minimize this risk, CoCounsel was beta-tested by lawyers from 400 firms, including multinational law firms, solo practitioners and Fortune 500 companies. Care is also taken that the sensitive information often entered into the system by those using it isn't stored or fed back into the platform for training to mitigate the risk of “leaking” confidential data.
While it’s too early to measure the precise impact that generative AI will have on the work of the CIP, Semanchik expects that in the future, it will mean they are able to take on more clients and potentially overturn greater numbers of wrongful convictions.
As reported by the California Western School of Law Campus News, he believes “There’s no question it can make for better lawyering. I would argue that in the long-term, failure to embrace and utilize AI may result in a lawyer not being the best and most competent advocate for their client.”
How Will Generative AI Impact Lawyers and the Legal System?
Generative AI has the potential to transform the legal profession by automating many routine and time-consuming tasks, aiding in research and helping lawyers to make better decisions.
As an information-intensive field of work, AI companies have been quick to build and bring products to market.
One leading provider of consumer legal services, LegalZoom, has said that AI will help it to streamline its operations and eliminate inefficiencies in drafting and reviewing contracts.
ThoughtRiver has developed an AI platform designed to automate the process of reviewing contracts and highlighting risks, and Lex Machina offers a product that aims to predict the behavior of courts and judges, forecasting the likely lengthiness of litigation and potential costs and outcomes.
As well as helping lawyers to work more quickly and productively, innovation in this field has the potential to benefit society as a whole by reducing the cost of accessing justice and legal redress.
There are still barriers to be overcome, in particular around data quality and privacy. However, the potential time and money savings will undoubtedly create incentives for these to be tackled. Overall, it's hard to overstate the opportunities that generative AI creates for driving transformative change in the field of law, and it’s an area where I’m confident we’ll see more exciting developments in the future.

The technology is currently on a path that emphasizes automation, the displacement of skilled labor, and diminished worker voice due to stepped-up monitoring and surveillance, according to a new policy memo by MIT professors Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and Simon Johnson.
But the nature of generative AI’s impact is not an inevitable consequence of the technology itself, the authors write. Rather, it depends on how society develops and shapes AI.
The following summary outlines the automation path of generative AI and suggests five policies that could steer AI development and implementation in a direction that complements humans  and augments their skills.
+++
Over the past 40 years, the diffusion of digital technologies significantly increased income inequality.
Generative AI will surely impact inequality, but the nature of that effect depends on exactly how this technology is developed and applied. Nothing about the path of this (or any) technology is inevitable.
The private sector is pursuing a path for generative AI that emphasizes automation and the displacement of labor, along with intrusive workplace surveillance.
Simply displacing workers is never good for the labor market, even when the displaced are highly paid. Displaced formerly high-paid workers are forced to compete for jobs with lower-wage workers, leading to a downward cascade in wage levels.
A better path is available, along which generative AI would be complementary to most humans — augmenting their capabilities — including people without a four-year college degree.

The case for an 'automation tax' 


Choosing the human-complementary path is feasible but will require changes in the direction of technological innovation, as well as in corporate norms and behavior.
The goal should be to deploy generative AI to create and support new occupational tasks and new capabilities for workers. If AI tools can enable teachers, nurse practitioners, nurses, medical technicians, electricians, plumbers, and other modern craft workers to do more expert work, this can reduce inequality, raise productivity, and boost pay by leveling workers up.
Public policy has a central role in encouraging this positive path of technology to complement all workers, elevating the achievable level of skill and expertise for everyone. 
At this time, the five most important federal policies should be:
Equalize tax rates on employing workers and on owning equipment/ algorithms to level the playing field between people and machines.
Update Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to create safeguards (i.e., limitations) on the surveillance of workers. Finding ways to elevate worker voice on the direction of development could also be helpful.
Increase funding for human-complementary technology research, recognizing that this is not currently a private sector priority.
Create an AI center of expertise within the government, to help share knowledge among regulators and other officials.
Use that federal expertise to advise on whether purported human-complementary technology is appropriate to adopt in publicly provided education and healthcare programs, including at the state and local level.

Cheryl Porro of Betterworks explores the game-changing impact of Generative AI on HR performance management and the path to a more equitable, agile, and empowered workforce.
Let’s face it: Human resources professionals are inundated with technology solutions to solve problems, with some working better than others. From applicant tracking systems, human resources information systems, and employee engagement software to onboarding, benefits, and payroll technology, the list is endless regarding streamlining and enhancing organizational processes. 
However, one HR technology solution has failed since its inception in the 1920s: performance management software. That’s because it’s built on faulty ground, the misguided belief that a militaristic model of hierarchy and control form the best basis for managing collaborative teams toward business outcomes and, understandably so, is universally hated. Most HR leaders and employees will lament the bureaucratic process when completing the much-begrudged annual performance review. HR professionals and employees know it’s dreadful and doesn’t change performance.
Time for Change: As Work Dynamics Evolve, So Should Performance Management
Fast forward to today, over 100 years later, and work has radically changed. Performance management, however, still needs to be improved and more effective. They do it to check the box without a true grasp on why they do it other than because that’s how it’s always been done. We know that the evolution of performance management processes is imminent to create a happier and more productive workforce.
We also know that this said evolution required to transform workforces just got more interesting – as what might be the most transformational technology of our time, generative AI, promises to impact the interaction between humans and machines fundamentally. The buzz surrounding AI and how it will affect our work cannot be ignored. There is a vast opportunity in front of us— especially HR leaders.

AI and HR Transformation: Generative AI Is Poised to Reinvent Performance Management
The hype cycles in technology are aplenty. You might think that AI is just another industry fad and that the passionate conversations around us will die down soon, but these conversations have happened for the past decade. The technology is just improving at a quick rate, adding to its virality this time around. While the initial excitement may fade, AI integrations into everyday performance management processes will become the norm. For HR leaders, we’re entering an important time where we can leverage its benefits to enhance employee experiences and, as a result, drive stronger business outcomes.
I’m optimistic that generative AI is well on its way to helping HR teams transform workforce performance by doing things like detecting and eliminating unconscious bias from the performance evaluation process, boosting goal quality, encouraging goal achievement, simplifying the arduous process of conducting performance reviews, prompting timely recognition, providing tailored coaching suggestions, and much more. It will help employees work faster, smarter, and more productively. It will help managers in becoming better managers and coaches.
Practical Magic: How Managers Can Implement AI to Become More Effective at Cultivating Talent
With the help of AI, managers, in particular, are positioned to become more effective and efficient at cultivating talent by understanding their talent pool, what skills they have, and where the gaps lie. With these added insights, managers can do more for employee development in recognizing wins, automating 1:1 check-ins, suggesting skills development areas where the organization is comparatively weak, or matching employees’ career development goals with available opportunities.
If we leave it to AI to get it right regarding strengths, weaknesses, skill sets, building relationships, and connections, it won’t work. AI could and is likely to get it wrong. The combination of human intuition and AI makes it exceptionally powerful. This has to be a partnership governed by the human responsible for the people.
The human element of the performance process doesn’t go away:, with the assistance of AI to streamline more administrative tasks, one could argue that it’s enhanced. Imagine a day where the manager has a complete perspective on the employee’s contribution to goals without digging around to find scraps of incomplete information. The manager spends more time understanding the data, seeing recommendations on how to help the employee, and ultimately decides the right coaching. What is the priority? How does the person need to hear this? How does this connect to other things I know that are going on in the person’s life? A manager’s EQ is not replaceable, and with the power of generative AI, they are given insights at the moment it matters to drive meaningful conversations.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that AI is rapidly becoming a necessary staple, inside and outside of HR, because it can also do rote, repetitive tasks much faster and more accurately than humans. It’s accelerating productivity. Resisting it puts your organization at risk of falling behind. However, its benefits cannot be discussed at length without also addressing the perceived risks of AI that linger quite heavily: proprietary information leaks, sources being unknown, copyright infringement, plagiarism, making the workplace less human, lack of critical thinking, too much similarity across content where variety and specificity is essential (i.e., feedback and performance reviews), and the widespread concern of unconscious bias.
Thoughtful change management, which includes communicating these benefits and risks, is essential in the company-wide adoption of AI. Organizational leaders are wise to consider what can go right and wrong with the technology so that guardrails can be put in place to ensure governance, privacy, and security before these changes are implemented. Without an effective change management plan, organizations can stifle their ability to use this technology effectively, even as deceivingly simple as ChatGPT.

The Path Forward: Embracing the AI-HR Convergence One Step at a Time
HR leaders can start by implementing small-scale pilot projects to demonstrate the value and feasibility of AI within performance management processes. They can also encourage employees to jump in with low-risk use cases of generative AI. Tell employees what you’re doing, how you’re approaching it, and what opportunities there are for them to make it a success. Allow employees to share their successes as they experiment with the technology. Be clear about what “unauthorized use” means. Then, memorialize it as part of a company policy.
Employees, customers, and partners will all expect organizations to be transparent about their use of generative AI and the policies in place to keep their data safe. Everyone’s appetite for AI is going to be different. Some may be asking where that “button” is to fill in information for them automatically, and others will be hesitant to trust it. We’re still in a time where employees are reacting to technology, so organizations will need the processes and infrastructure in place for them to opt in. 
With open dialogue and setting clear boundaries, organizations are ready to tap into the potential of generative AI. The promise of AI might seem like another fleeting phenomenon to some, but its integration into HR practices is not just a fad; it’s a paradigm shift that will reshape the employee experience for the better. The urgency is there, and some may rush into adopting it. But more than anything, HR leaders have the chance to do it right by thinking about the end user and putting their needs first: employees. It can dismantle biases ingrained in evaluations, elevate goal-setting precision, and catalyze timely recognition. AI refines performance reviews and empowers managers to step into a new role — one of strategic coaches who guide their teams toward greater success.
The convergence of AI and HR represents a pivotal moment, a turning point in how we perceive and manage performance. Human resources leaders have a unique opportunity to harness generative AI’s potential, paving the way for a more equitable, agile, and empowered workforce. The journey may be complex, but it holds the promise of tapping into human potential, embracing innovation, and shaping the future of work for the better.

The initial surge of excitement and apprehension surrounding ChatGPT is waning. The problem is, where does that leave the enterprise? Is this a passing trend that can safely be ignored or a powerful tool that needs to be embraced? And if the latter, what’s the most secure approach to its adoption?
ChatGPT, a form of generative AI, represents just a single manifestation of the broader concept of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are an important technology that’s here to stay, but they’re not a plug-and-play solution for your business processes. Achieving benefits from them requires some work on your part.

[ Read next: What can ChatGPT and LLMs really do for your business? ]

This is because, despite the immense potential of LLMs, they come with a range of challenges. These challenges include issues such as hallucinations, the high costs associated with training and scaling, the complexity of addressing and updating them, their inherent inconsistency, the difficulty of conducting audits and providing explanations, and the predominance of English language content.











 
 
 
There are also other factors like the fact that LLMs are poor at reasoning and need careful prompting for correct answers. All of these issues can be minimized by supporting your new internal corpus-based LLM by a knowledge graph.

The power of knowledge graphs
A knowledge graph is an information-rich structure that provides a view of entities and how they interrelate. For example, Rishi Sunak holds the office of prime minister of the UK. Rishi Sunak and the UK are entities, and holding the office of prime minister is how they relate. We can express these identities and relationships as a network of assertable facts with a graph of what we know.
Having built a knowledge graph, you not only can query it for patterns, such as “Who are the members of Rishi Sunak’s cabinet,” but you can also compute over the graph using graph algorithms and graph data science. With this additional tooling, you can ask sophisticated questions about the nature of the whole graph of many billions of elements, not just a subgraph. Now you can ask questions like “Who are the members of the Sunak government not in the cabinet who wield the most influence?”











 
 
 
Expressing these relationships as a graph can uncover facts that were previously obscured and lead to valuable insights. You can even generate embeddings from this graph (encompassing both its data and its structure) that can be used in machine learning pipelines or as an integration point to LLMs.
Using knowledge graphs with large language models
But a knowledge graph is only half the story. LLMs are the other half, and we need to understand how to make these work together. We see four patterns emerging:

Use an LLM to create a knowledge graph.
Use a knowledge graph to train an LLM.
Use a knowledge graph on the interaction path with an LLM to enrich queries and responses.
Use knowledge graphs to create better models.

In the first pattern we use the natural language processing features of LLMs to process a huge corpus of text data (e.g. from the web or journals). We then ask the LLM (which is opaque) to produce a knowledge graph (which is transparent). The knowledge graph can be inspected, QA’d, and curated. Importantly for regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, the knowledge graph is explicit and deterministic about its answers in a way that LLMs are not.











 
 
 
In the second pattern we do the opposite. Instead of training LLMs on a large general corpus, we train them exclusively on our existing knowledge graph. Now we can build chatbots that are very skilled with respect to our products and services and that answer without hallucination.
In the third pattern we intercept messages going to and from the LLM and enrich them with data from our knowledge graph. For example, “Show me the latest five films with actors I like” cannot be answered by the LLM alone, but it can be enriched by exploring a movie knowledge graph for popular films and their actors that can then be used to enrich the prompt given to the LLM. Similarly, on the way back from the LLM, we can take embeddings and resolve them against the knowledge graph to provide deeper insight to the caller.
The fourth pattern is about making better AIs with knowledge graphs. Here interesting research from Yejen Choi at the University of Washington shows the best way forward. In her team’s work, an LLM is enriched by a secondary, smaller AI called a “critic.” This AI looks for reasoning errors in the responses of the LLM, and in doing so creates a knowledge graph for downstream consumption by another training process that creates a “student” model. The student model is smaller and more accurate than the original LLM on many benchmarks because it never learns factual inaccuracies or inconsistent answers to questions.











 
 
 
Understanding Earth’s biodiversity using knowledge graphs
It’s important to remind ourselves of why we are doing this work with ChatGPT-like tools. Using generative AI can help knowledge workers and specialists to execute natural language queries they want answered without having to understand and interpret a query language or build multi-layered APIs. This has the potential to increase efficiency and allow employees to focus their time and energy on more pertinent tasks.
Take Basecamp Research, a UK-based biotech firm that is mapping Earth’s biodiversity and trying to ethically support bringing new solutions from nature into the market. To do so it has built the planet’s largest natural biodiversity knowledge graph, BaseGraph, which has more than four billion relationships.
The dataset is feeding a lot of other innovative projects. One is protein design, where the team is utilizing a large language model fronted by a ChatGPT-style model for enzyme sequence generation called ZymCtrl. Purpose-built for generative AI, Basecamp is now wrapping increasingly more LLMs around its entire knowledge graph. The firm is upgrading BaseGraph to a fully LLM-augmented knowledge graph in just the way I’ve been describing.











 
 
 
Making complex content more findable, accessible, and explainable
Pioneering as Basecamp Research’s work is, it’s not alone in exploring the LLM-knowledge graph combination. A household-name global energy company is using knowledge graphs with ChatGPT in the cloud for its enterprise knowledge hub. The next step is to deliver generative AI-powered cognitive services to thousands of employees across its legal, engineering, and other departments.
To take one more example, a global publisher is readying a generative AI tool trained on knowledge graphs that will make a huge wealth of complex academic content more findable, accessible, and explainable to research customers using pure natural language.
What’s noteworthy about this latter project is that it aligns perfectly with our earlier discussion: translating hugely complex ideas into accessible, intuitive, real-world language, enabling interactions and collaborations. In doing so, it empowers us to tackle substantial challenges with precision, and in ways that people trust.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that by training an LLM on a knowledge graph’s curated, high-quality, structured data, the gamut of challenges associated with ChatGPT will be addressed, and the prizes you are seeking from generative AI will be easier to realize. A June Gartner report, AI Design Patterns for Knowledge Graphs and Generative AI, underscores this notion, emphasizing that knowledge graphs offer an ideal partner to an LLM, where high levels of accuracy and correctness are a requirement.
Seems like a marriage made in heaven to me. What about you?

The use of generative AI is cutting down cloud migration efforts by 30 percent to 50 percent when done correctly, according to McKinsey's Bhargs Srivathsan, speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday.
""This is only starting to scratch the surface. As the large language model (LLM) matures, this timeline to migrate workloads to public cloud will just keep going down – and hopefully the migration will also be efficient,"" said Srivathsan.
She advised that organizations can use an LLM to understand what a system's infrastructure looks like, decipher its weaknesses and strengths, move the workloads, and then apply AI-based tools to understand if the migration actually worked.







It can also lean on LLMs for tasks such as producing Architecture Review Board guidelines.











The McKinsey partner said although many enterprises are just starting to think about implementing AI, 40 percent of those that have already invested are updating their investment.
Srivathsan called the relationship between generative AI and cloud ""symbiotic.""







""We absolutely cannot deny that cloud really is needed to bring generative AI to life. And, similarly, generative AI can really accelerate the migration to public cloud, as well as the unlock from it,"" she said.
The four biggest use cases Srivathsan sees for generative AI are content generation, customer engagement, creating synthetic data, and coding. The latter role is especially useful when working on legacy code written by coders who are long gone from an organization, or when such code needs translating to a new programming language.
She stressed the need to use public cloud instead of attempting to build in-house models as enterprises don't typically have the necessary access to GPUs. Off-the-shelf models are also cheaper.

More and more LLMs in biz products, but who'll take responsibility for their output?

Those working in regulated industries, with large amounts of proprietary data or concerned about IP infringement, can put guardrails in place, Srivathsan said.
She also stressed that LLMs will stay in hyperscale environments for the next five to six years until models mature. While many people feel the need to be closer to their compute power, she advised that very few use cases actually need ultra low latency.


Unless you are Tesla operating self-driving or perhaps operating in real time on a manufacturing floor, it's just not necessary, she said.
There is also no need to require tailored or massive models.
""Many enterprises think they need a Lamborghini to deliver a pizza, you definitely don't, you probably don't need as complex and as big as a model, you don't need a 65 billion parametric model to generate customer support scripts, for example,"" said the McKinsey partner.
However, she recommended not skimping on an API gateway between an organization and the outside world in order to surface some of the ""real-time alerts"" if developers are accessing non-proprietary models or data they shouldn't be touching. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey

But with great promise come great concerns, including—but certainly not limited to—the spread of misinformation at scale, especially via deepfakes; using creators’ work without attribution; and massive job loss thanks to automation. 

With those potential downsides in mind, governments around the world are attempting to create AI regulations that promote safety and fair use while still encouraging innovation.

US 🇺🇸

The US government has so far let tech companies come up with their own safeguards around AI. But lawmakers say that AI regulation is necessary. They have held multiple meetings in 2023 with leading AI companies from OpenAI to Nvidia. Lawmakers have discussed licensing and certification requirements of high-risk AI models when necessary.

 Meanwhile, federal agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission have said that many AI applications are already subject to existing laws.

UK 🇬🇧

The United Kingdom, which is home to AI companies like Google’s AI lab DeepMind and AI video maker Synthesia, wants to avoid heavy-handed legislation that could stifle innovation. Regulation would be based on principles such as safety, transparency, fairness, and accountability, reported Reuters.

The UK government also wants to play a key role in regulating AI. It is expected to hold its first AI safety summit on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. “The UK has long been home to the transformative technologies of the future,” Prime minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement. “To fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities of artificial intelligence, we must grip and tackle the risks to ensure it develops safely in the years ahead.”

The country plans to split responsibility for governing AI between existing regulators for human rights, health and safety, and competition rather than creating a new body dedicated to the technology—which differs from US regulators who have discussed creating an independent body to oversee the licensing of high-risk AI models. Academics have criticized the independent regulator, saying that it will take time to create an entirely new agency.

EU 🇪🇺

Since 2021, the EU, which has a track record of implementing stricter rules on the tech industry compared to other regions, has been working towards passing the AI Act, which would be the first AI law in the West. 

The act proposes classifying AI systems by risk. Higher-risk systems, including AI hiring tools and exam scoring software, would face greater compliance standards, such as data validation and documentation, compared to lower-risk ones. The proposed rules also prohibit intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI, such as real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces or predictive policy systems based on profiling. 

 Last month, European Commission committee member Thierry Breton said that the EU is developing an AI Pact that will help companies prepare for the implementation of the AI Act and that startups—not just Big Tech—need to be included in discussions around developing governance of AI. Startups in the past have said that the EU’s proposed regulation is too restrictive.

China 🇨🇳

In China, generative AI providers must undergo a security assessment, and AI tools must adhere to socialist values. But generative AI technology developed only for use outside of the country is exempt from the rules.  Chinese tech companies like Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei have research and development centers in Silicon Valley. 

To rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the country’s biggest internet companies—Alibaba, Baidu, and JD—have announced their own AI chatbots. In the past, China has said it wanted to be the world leader in AI by 2030 and has laid out plans to commercialize AI in a number of areas from smart cities to military uses, as CNBC reported. 

Japan 🇯🇵

Japan is leaning towards softer rules governing the use of AI. This week, prime minister Fumio Kishida pledged that the next economic package will include funds for AI development in small and midsize companies, which could help boost Japan’s lost lead in technology.

Japan has also said that using copyrighted images to train AI models doesn’t violate copyright laws, which means that generative AI providers can use copyrighted work without securing permission from the owners of the images. “In Japan, works for information analysis can be used regardless of the method, whether for non-profit purposes, for profit, for acts other than reproduction, or for content obtained from illegal sites,” said a member of the House of Representatives for the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. 

That said, the representative acknowledged that using the image against the will of the copyright holder is problematic from the viewpoint of rights protection, and suggested a need for “new regulations to protect copyright holders.” 

Brazil 🇧🇷

Lawmakers in Brazil have started to draft regulations for AI that include requiring providers of AI systems to submit a risk assessment before rolling out the product to the public. 


Regardless of the risk classification of AI systems, regulators say that people affected by those systems have the right to an explanation about a decision or a recommendation made within 15 days of the request. Academic experts contend that it’s hard to explain why an AI system does something.

Israel 🇮🇱

The country, which has been having discussions with both Israeli and US-based tech companies, has proposed regulation that focuses on “responsible innovation” that protects the public while also advancing Israeli’s high-tech industry.

The government has said, vaguely, that AI policy will include the use of “soft” regulatory tools to govern AI and the adoption of ethical principles similar to what is acceptable around the world. Regulation is expected to arrive “in the coming years.”

Italy 🇮🇹

In March, Italy was the first Western country to—temporarily—ban ChatGPT over unlawful data collection. Since then, the government said it has allocated 30 million euros (or $33 million) to help unemployed people and workers in positions at risk of automation to boost their digital skills.

Nearly all (96%) of employers believe that generative artificial intelligence will have an impact on their business, but there seems to be a slow adoption of the technology, according to a recent report.
Overall, just 4% of employers say that generative AI will not affect them. Yet, just 9% of companies have fully deployed a generative AI use case in their organization, reports MIT Technology Review Insights.
It seems employers are still unsure about a lot of things around AI, and that’s causing them to delay adoption. The primary challenges employers face in successfully implementing generative AI include:










understanding the risks (59%)
better understanding data (51%)
developing use cases (42%)
engaging with regulators or uncertainty around regulation (40%)
hiring talent or upskilling employees around generative AI (26%)

""Business leaders are cautiously pursuing the transformative potential of generative AI, with nearly all respondents acknowledging its impact on their businesses,"" says Laurel Ruma, global editorial director, MIT Technology Review Insights. ""However, only a small fraction have fully embraced generative AI use cases, highlighting a measured approach to implementation. Workforce implications vary across industries, and while regulation looms, uncertainty stands as today's primary challenge.""
Currently, only 26% of employees say that their employer has a policy related to the use of generative AI, and 23% say that such a policy is under development, according to a previous report from The Conference Board. Over a third (34%) say their organization does not have an AI policy, and 17% don't know.
Who’s leading the charge in generative AI adoption?
When it comes to the adoption of generative AI, small companies (those with annual revenue less than $500 million) are three times more likely than mid-sized firms ($500 million to $1 billion) to have already deployed a generative AI use case (13% versus 4%), reports MIT Technology Review Insights.
In fact, these small companies had deployment and experimentation rates similar to those of the very largest companies (those with revenue greater than $10 billion), based on the survey of 1,000 business leaders in July and August 2023.
“Affordable generative AI tools could boost smaller businesses in the same way as cloud computing, which granted companies access to tools and computational resources that would once have required huge financial investments in hardware and technical expertise,” says MIT Technology Review Insights.

Also, while 75% of executives plan to work with partners to bring generative AI to their organization at scale, they are somewhat more likely to plan to team up with small AI-focused companies (43%) than large tech firms (32%).
While previous reports have caused fear of automation on many workers before, only one quarter of business leaders expect generative AI’s primary effect to be a reduction in their workforce. 
The figure was higher in industrial sectors like energy and utilities (43%), manufacturing (34%), and transport and logistics (31%). It was lowest in IT and telecommunications (7%).
“AI is democratizing technical skills across the workforce in ways that could lead to new job opportunities and increased employee satisfaction. But experts caution that, if deployed poorly and without meaningful consultation, generative AI could degrade the qualitative experience of human work,” says MIT Technology Review Insights.
Here’s how AI will affect the HR industry, according to HR futurist Jim Carroll.









Imbalance with skills, training opportunities
However, employers should put more focus on equipping their workers with the necessary skills to successfully use generative AI at work, says Sander van ‘t Noordende, CEO at Randstad.
“AI is increasingly an enabler and enhancer of skills, holding a profound impact on productivity and overall performance in the workplace. But the imbalance between skills demanded by businesses and desired by employees, on the one hand, and the training opportunities provided, on the other, has to be addressed,” he says.
“AI is here to stay and the benefits of it are very clear - our data shows that employees stand ready to embrace it for their own gain too. Successful organizations will be those that leverage this readiness and harness the opportunities of AI in their workforce.”

Finding the right person for the job is no walk in the park, as any recruiter will tell you. And it’s at least as challenging for job seekers to wade through the opportunities, apply for a job, and get that coveted first interview.
But iCIMS believes generative AI can help. Today, the company is announcing its own iCIMS Copilot, an AI assistant powered by the GPT-4 in Azure OpenAI Service introduced earlier this year by Microsoft that will live as a persistent, easily accessible chatbot inside the existing iCIMS Talent Cloud recruiting software, allowing recruiters to instantly ask it questions, prompt it to generate job descriptions and interview questions, draft candidate offer letters, and create marketing content around job opportunities.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“If you’re at a point in using our products where you need to create content over and over, let the Copilot give you a starting point,” said iCIMS CTO Al Smith in an exclusive video interview with VentureBeat.
Whatever data recruiters have introduced to their secure and private iCIMS Talent Cloud instances can be drawn upon and leveraged for use by the Copilot, but users can also prompt it with their own outside data.

An AI evolution for recruiters
iCIMS is no stranger to AI. The company headquartered in Holmdel, New Jersey, was an early leader at bringing software to the recruiting journey, having been founded in 2000, and has since grown to service more than 6,000 customers across sectors, specializing in those needing a high volume of new hires and those with high turnover, such as retail outlets and seasonal businesses.
For the last five years, even long before the current generative AI gold rush, it has pursued integrating what it calls “responsible AI” with its platform, and has “worked very, very hard around the world,” according to Smith, to fulfill the various compliance requirements where it and its enterprise customers do business. 
So far, iCIMS has integrated responsible AI into its platform in the form of “AI-led search, match, and job fit recommendation capabilities to candidates,” including routing and sorting job candidates who are both the “best fit” and a “close match” to the job description. iCIMS also takes into account hard and “soft,” or derived skills when evaluating candidates to see who could grow into organizations to take on more roles. 
The importance of avoiding bias
Eliminating bias is especially critical for recruiting, where laws prohibit technology discrimination and bias in hiring. For example, Smith told VentureBeat that iCIMS is compliant with New York City’s recently enforced NYC 144 law.
“We have a big belief that AI is not this black box that says ‘bing, here’s your answer!'” explained Smith. “It should be helping you make better contextual decisions and be explainable on why it’s helping you provide that information.”
However, Smith acknowledges this explainability is a challenge with generative AI solutions like its own new iCIMS Copilot. Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, which powers the iCIMS Copilot, are great at delivering fast answers and content on demand, but not necessarily at explaining how they arrived at those responses. 
A recruiting aid, not a replacementadvertisement
That’s why iCIMS has worked to introduce fine-tuning and safeguards around its implementation of generative AI, and views it as a recruiting aid, especially for content creation, not as a replacement for human recruiters.
Generative AI assistants can help “eliminate like the undifferentiated work that anybody could do, and let you focus more on the outcomes that you’re trying to do,” Smith said, referring to his recruiter customers.
Early innings
As VentureBeat has previously remarked, it is still early innings in the metaphorical baseball game of enterprises competing to figure out the best applications for generative AI.
iCIMS believes its Copilot is a valuable addition, but plans to offer users the chance to give feedback continuously and at multiple points through their usage.
“Honestly, I want to learn ‘what is the definition of high quality in this technology?'” said Smith. “I want feedback that when you use it, you can choose options that say ‘this was really helpful, somewhat helpful, or not helpful at all.'” advertisement
As iCIMS collects feedback from its enterprise users, it will use it to iterate and refine its Copilot, as well as add new capabilities and bring new generative AI products and tools to market.
As such, “we’re still trying to figure out the monetization side of it,” said Smith. Right now, the iCIMS Copilot will be bundled in with its regular Talent Cloud, which charges on an “enterprise pricing model,” not per user.

Powering GenAI’s potential requires purpose-built approaches to mitigate the inherent risks of its adoption.Generative AI (GenAI), the basis for tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard and Meta LLaMa, is a new AI technology that has quickly moved front and center into the global limelight.GenAI Meets the EnterpriseToday, an estimated 60% of IT leaders are looking to implement GenAI.At the same time, concerns exist. Most notably, for about 71% of IT leaders, angst about security creates a barrier to adoption, mandating that approaches, infrastructure, data strategies and security be appropriately aligned. According to the Dell Technologies 2023 Innovation Index report, 59% of Indian businesses are currently investing or exploring the feasibility of investing in AI, Machine Learning and advanced analytics to advance innovation. Finding the right, fit-for-use GenAI model for enterprises is the key to mitigating its risks, dispelling concerns and ushering in GenAI’s mainstream adoption in the enterprise world.Pivoting to Purpose-built GenAITo enable that revolution, the way enterprises use GenAI will likely differ from general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Instead, enterprises are likely to use GenAI models that are trained and tuned to solve specific problems; for instance, to enable automated customer support, financial forecasting and fraud detection. Although LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used for enterprise applications, the accuracy of their results will not match that of a purpose-built model created to meet a specific need.Other major benefits of purpose-built GenAI include:Data security and compliance: AI’s unique capability is handling and analyzing huge datasets with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Simply put, if AI is a rocket ship, data is the fuel. Enterprises can tune their LLMs with customer purchase history, support or telesales logs, health records, financial records and other data sources. Consequently, handling this data in a secure manner will become even more important than it is today. Additionally, some industries, such as healthcare and finance, must comply with stringent regulations regarding data privacy and security. The privacy of data that is entered into third party LLM services is the subject of intensifying debate. Thus, enterprises that need to retain control over their data must tread carefully.Agility and time to market: Most enterprises will need to update their GenAI models regularly, which is easier to do with purpose-built GenAI models. The time required to train general-purpose LLMs can take months. That’s because massive amounts of data are required for training, eclipsing deployment speed and time to market, the very benefits GenAI enables. Reducing time-to-model and facilitating faster data-to-decisions can improve business efficiency.Performance: Purpose-built models also provide performance benefits over general-purpose models. Specifically, enterprises using third party general-purpose LLMs may not be able to optimize performance and reduce the latency of their GenAI workloads. This is problematic for applications that require real-time processing or low-latency response times, a key attribute of GenAI adoption.Cost: The smaller amounts of training data needed for purpose-built GenAI models also translate into cost savings. As a result, purpose-built LLMs often cost far less to train and re-train compared to general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT.Moving Enterprise GenAI Forward According to the Dell Technologies 2023 Innovation Index report, India has the highest number of businesses (37%) using AI-based optimization software to automate processes. For enterprises, in India and across the globe, GenAI holds the profound potential to automate complex processes, improve customer interactions and unlock new possibilities with better machine intelligence—and CIOs are the key to moving it forward. (The author is Manish Gupta, Vice President, Infrastructure Solutions Group, Dell Technologies India, and the views expressed in this article are his own)    Tags :generative-aiadd a commentLeave a Response Cancel replyCommentNameEmailSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

A recent survey conducted by ITWeb in partnership with KnowBe4 Africa examined the extent of generative AI (GenAI) adoption by SA organisations.The objective was to understand businesses’ concerns around the technology and how leaders mitigate risks.A total of 156 valid responses were captured, with 73% of respondents being at executive or middle management level. While almost half (42%) of the survey respondents came from the IT sector and 12% from financial services, the remaining 46% came from a wide range of major industry sectors.“The majority of South African organisations participating in this survey are embracing emerging technologies and embedding GenAI into their day-to-day operations,” says Anna Collard, SVP of content strategy and evangelist at KnowBe4 Africa. She continues, “However at the same time, not enough is being done to regulate the use thereof or educate their staff. Security and privacy risks, ethical concerns such as bias, inaccuracies, and impact on critical thinking are challenges that need to be addressed by a combination of regulation, guidelines and awareness training.”The majority of South African organisations...are...embedding GenAI into their day-to-day operations.Almost all (92%) of the survey respondents said they were familiar with ChatGPT and/or other GenAI technologies. Three quarters (72%) of respondents currently allow employees access to ChatGPT and/or other generative AI technologies. However, 39% of those don’t have any restrictions in place, 14% have defined process and policies, 13% have additional technical control measures and 6% say it is part of one of the products or processes that they use.The top five current and future use cases for ChatGPT or other GenAII in respondents’ organisations include:Content generation (64%)Research purposes (62%)Customer support (56%)Writing code/scripts (43%)Creative tasks (49%).The ways in which data privacy concerns are addressed when using ChatGPT or GenAI are: employee training on responsible AI usage (36%); policy (29%); and encryption (28%). A quarter (27%) of respondents say this is not addressed or regulated.Half (50%) of respondents say employees are provided with guidelines on the appropriate use and limitations of ChatGPT and GenAI. Of those providing guidelines, 67% provide basic guidelines only, while 37% are detailed. Over a third (36%) of survey respondents don’t address or regulate the potential misuse of ChatGPT or GenAI within their organisation. For those that do, the top three ways in which misuse is mitigated are: employee training on responsible AI usage (33%), policies (32%) and AI ethics and usage policies (25%).The majority of respondents (74%) say there haven’t been any incidents of misuse or security breaches related to ChatGPT or generative AI within their organisation. A quarter (22%) of respondents aren’t sure and 4% said there had been incidents.Some 30% of respondents provide basic training to employees about identifying and countering AI-generated misinformation or deepfakes. Thirteen percent of respondents provide comprehensive training and 58% say no specific training is provided around this. The majority (79%) of respondents are concerned about adversaries using generative AI like ChatGPT or uncontrolled versions of it in their attacks (i.e., better social engineering, deep fakes etc). Respondents’ main concerns about generative AI in general are:Security threats becoming more sophisticated (60%)Ethics and bias issues (49%)Impact on critical thinking (49%)Not being able to keep up with the pace of innovation and competitors (36%)Job replacements and unemployment (29%).The AI services currently in use in respondents’ organisations are ChatGPT (68%), CoPilot (27%) and Otter.ai (21%). Just over a third (36%) of respondents’ organisations have integrated ChatGPT or other generative AI into their business processes, systems or applications. Half of respondents (53%) say they’re planning to use ChatGPT or other generative AI systems in the future.Collard ends off by underlining the importance of awareness, education and training as a measure to ensure the responsible use of AI. “This is followed by a need for more regulations and policy, as well as technology to help solve the challenges.”Share",http://schema.org,,BreadcrumbList,,"['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/02/Anna-Collard-Feb-2023.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-1-1.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-2.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-3.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-4.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alison Job', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/contributors/gGb3Bw7WNAv2k6Vn'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'ITWeb', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/contributors/organizations/2010/11/resized/itweb-logo-c.xl.gif'}, 'description': 'Business technology news and information portal for South Africa’s tech professionals and decision makers.'}",Survey: SA business is on board with generative AI,2023-10-12T08:00:00+02:00,2024-05-20T11:53:36+02:00,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Survey: SA business is on board with generative AI', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/survey-sa-business-is-on-board-with-generative-ai/kYbe9MXbeaxvAWpG'}]",https://www.itweb.co.za/article/survey-sa-business-is-on-board-with-generative-ai/kYbe9MXbeaxvAWpG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just a few days ago, we marked the inspiring occasion of Teachers’ Day. These educators, the unsung heroes and architects of society, tirelessly shape our futures. It’s our duty and privilege to provide every resource to elevate and simplify their monumental tasks.
With the onset of the digital age, teaching has transcended traditional classrooms. Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands at the forefront of this transformation, offering tools and solutions that can make educators’ roles both easier and more impactful. As we reflect on Teacher’s Day, it’s apt to explore how AI can assist teachers in their noble profession.

1. Personalised Learning:
One of the most significant challenges teachers face is catering to a diverse group of students, each with unique learning needs. AI-driven platforms can analyse each student’s strengths, weaknesses, preferences, and pace. With this data, AI can help create a customized learning path for every student, ensuring that each one receives the instruction they need when they need it. The result? Enhanced student engagement and improved outcomes. Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all. AI facilitates a dynamic, adaptive learning environment tailored to individual needs, bridging gaps, and accelerating progress.

2. Automating Administrative Tasks:
Administrative duties, while essential, can detract from a teacher’s core objective: educating. Grading assignments, tracking attendance, and managing timetables often consume a significant chunk of their time. AI’s automation potential comes as a saving grace, taking over these mundane tasks. For example, AI-driven systems can grade not only multiple-choice tests but, with advancements, even essays to some extent. This automation ensures consistency, reduces human error, and provides teachers more time for student interaction and curriculum planning.


3. Intelligent Content Creation:
Crafting content that resonates with every student is a challenge. With AI, teachers have tools at their disposal that can generate smart content, including customized reading material, study guides, and problem sets. These tools are informed by pedagogical best practices and are designed to enhance learning experiences. For subjects like Math and Science, AI can even generate quizzes or flashcards that adapt difficulty based on student performance, ensuring consistent progression.
4. Virtual Tutors and Assistants:
The role of an educator extends beyond classroom walls. Students often require assistance after school hours, and while teachers strive to be available, there are limits. Enter AI-powered virtual tutors. These tutors, available 24/7, can offer homework assistance, answer queries, and provide additional study resources. This doesn’t diminish a teacher’s role but supplements it, ensuring students have support whenever they need.
ad5. Enhancing Professional Development:
Continuous learning is a hallmark of great educators. AI’s analytical capabilities offer a unique advantage here. By assessing classroom interactions, teaching methodologies, and even student feedback, AI can pinpoint areas where a teacher might improve. Moreover, based on these insights, AI-driven platforms can suggest tailored professional development opportunities, whether courses, workshops, or seminars. This kind of targeted growth strategy can lead to significant advancements in teaching techniques.
6. Early Identification of Student Issues:
The holistic development of students is paramount. Beyond academic performance, there are numerous challenges students might face, from emotional and psychological hurdles to learning disabilities. AI, with its data-driven approach, can detect anomalies in student behavior or performance. By flagging these early, teachers can collaborate with parents and counselors to ensure the student receives the necessary support.
7. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Integration:
adThe union of AI with AR and VR is ushering in a new era of experiential learning. Imagine a literature class where students can interact with characters from a novel or a geography lesson where they can virtually traverse the Amazon rainforest. These immersive experiences, powered by AI, enhance understanding, foster curiosity, and make learning genuinely enjoyable.
8. Data-Driven Insights for Curriculum Design:
Beyond individual student performance, AI can provide insights on the effectiveness of teaching materials and curricula. By analyzing aggregate student data, educators can discern which topics are well-understood and which require additional emphasis. Such insights can inform curriculum adjustments, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.
9. Language Translation Tools:
In multilingual classrooms or where students are non-native speakers, AI-driven translation tools can be invaluable. Real-time translation can ensure every student, regardless of their primary language, has access to the same information. This fosters inclusivity and ensures no student is left behind due to language barriers.
Conclusion:


The harmonious integration of AI in education presents a promising future. Rather than replacing teachers, AI seeks to empower them, amplifying their efforts and enriching the educational landscape. On this Teacher’s Day, as we laud the invaluable contributions of educators, it’s exhilarating to imagine a future where, with AI’s assistance, they mold minds with even greater efficiency and profound impact. The dawn of AI in education heralds a new era of empowered teaching and enriched learning.

1. Main points


Only one in six (17%) adults said they could often or always tell when they are using artificial intelligence (AI), with men (21%), adults aged 16 to 29 years (31%), and adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (22%) among those more likely to report this; awareness decreases with age, with more than half (55%) of adults aged 70 years and over reporting they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI.
Twice as many adults thought AI brings greater risks than benefits (28%) than those who thought it has more benefits than risks (14%), while 43% thought there are equal benefits and risks to AI adoption.
Around one-third (32%) of adults agreed or strongly agreed that AI will benefit them, with men (38%), adults aged 16 to 29 years (46%), and adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (49%) among those more likely to report this.
When asked about the positive impacts AI could have on their life, adults reported it would improve their access to healthcare (31%) and their shopping experiences (27%), and 25% expected it to increase their access to learning or education.
Over one in three (36%) adults said they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their lives. Reasons given included having limited knowledge about AI or feeling it was irrelevant to their lives, believing AI is untrustworthy and risky, and distrusting the ability and intentions of companies developing or using AI.
Reported negative impacts of AI included the use of personal data without consent (72%), making it difficult to tell whether news or information are fake (68%) and increased chances of experiencing cyber crime (60%). 
Over a quarter (28%) of adults in employment surveyed thought AI could make their job easier, including those working in professional (41%) and managerial (34%) occupations, while 32% reported AI could put their job at risk, including those working in administrative and secretarial (43%) and sales and customer service (41%) occupations.

2. Research background

The rapid development and increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way we live.In September 2021, the government developed a National AI strategy (PDF, 3.5MB) setting out its ten-year plan. This was followed by a consultation process and a white paper published in March 2023, which detailed how the UK intends to support innovation while providing a framework to ensure risks are identified and addressed. The UK government is hosting the first global AI safety summit on 1 and 2 November 2023.To fill important evidence gaps, inform the public, and support AI policy, this article explores adults' perceived awareness of AI use, their views on the benefits and risks of AI, and their expectations about the impact this technology will have on their lives. Our analysis reveals significant differences across population groups and sheds light on perceived and potential inequalities.This article reports differences between groups where these are statistically significant. See Section 9: Data sources and quality for more information.

3. Awareness of AI use

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a variety of ways, including online product recommendations, facial recognition software and chatbots. Figure 1: Examples of the use of AI in daily life

In June 2023, our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) showed that around one in five (19%) adults said they could explain what AI is in detail and over half (53%) could provide a partial explanation.To gain a deeper insight into adults' awareness of AI, we evaluated their perceived ability to recognise when they engage with this technology. We found that around:

one in six (17%) adults reported that they can often or always recognise when they are using AI
one in two (50%) adults reported that they can some of the time or occasionally recognise when they are using AI
one in three (33%) adults reported that they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI
Given awareness of AI use was self-reported, it is possible that adults' perceived ability to recognise when they are engaging with AI differs from their actual ability to do so.Groups that were significantly more likely than other groups to report they can often or always recognise when they are using AI included:

men (21%)
adults aged 16 to 29 years (31%)
adults in ""Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups"" (36%)
non-disabled adults (18%)
adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (22%)
adults working in professional occupations (24%)
More than half of adults aged 70 years and over (55%) and 39% of those without a degree reported they can hardly ever or never recognise when they are using AI.

4. Risks and benefits of AI

We provided respondents with a broad definition of artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section 8: Glossary), and then asked them to consider its benefits and risks. Among all adults: 

14% reported they think there are more benefits than risks
43% reported they think there are equal benefits and risks
28% reported they think there are more risks than benefits
16% reported they don’t know if there are more benefits or risks

5. AI benefits for individuals

Respondents were also asked the extent to which they agree or disagree that artificial intelligence (AI) will benefit them. We found that around:

one in three (32%) adults strongly agreed or agreed that AI will benefit them
one in five (19%) adults disagreed or strongly disagreed that AI will benefit them
one in two (49%) adults neither agreed nor disagreed that AI will benefit them
Groups that were significantly more likely than other groups to strongly agree or agree that AI will benefit them individually included:

men (38%)
adults aged 16 to 29 years (46%) and 30 to 49 years (41%)
adults in the ""Asian or Asian British"" ethnic group (49%)
non-disabled adults (36%)
adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (49%)
adults working in professional occupations (51%) and as managers, directors, and senior officials (48%)
adults living in London (41%) and the South East (35%)
adults living in the least deprived areas of England (36%)
Some of these differences are broadly consistent with findings from our article analysing the UK's digital divide, which shows that women, older age groups, disabled adults, and adults with lower household incomes are less likely to use the internet.

6. Positive and negative impacts of AI

The UK government's 2023 white paper A pro-innovation approach to artificial intelligence (AI) regulation identifies benefits and risks associated with AI. Potential benefits include improvements to public services, high-quality jobs, and scientific and technological advancements. Identified risks include threats to national security, physical and mental health concerns, and ethical challenges.To gain deeper understanding of the public's perceived benefits and risks of AI, we asked respondents to identify ways in which AI could positively or negatively affect their lives.Positive impacts of AIThe most reported ways in which AI could positively affect adults lives were:

improve their access to healthcare (31%)
improve their shopping experiences (27%)
increase their access to learning or education (25%)
Over one-third (36%) of adults, however, did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life. Women (40%), those aged 50 to 69 years (44%), and 70 years and over (57%) were among those more likely to select that option.These adults were asked to describe in their own words why they felt that way. We used thematic analysis to analyse their responses, identifying six overarching themes, and selected representative quotes to illustrate key findings.Limited knowledge or irrelevant to own way of lifeA strong theme was lack of knowledge about AI or feeling it had no or little use to them. Some respondents mentioned they could not think about any positive impacts of AI because of their lack of understanding. 

... don't really understand it, so can't see any benefits to me.


Male, aged 70 years or overOthers mentioned their age (being too old or young) as a reason why they felt AI was not relevant to them. Some said they did not use computers or other devices where they could interact with AI.

As a retired person, I am not sure that I would make much use of it...


Male, aged 70 years or overSome respondents said AI was in its infancy and was, therefore, difficult for them to assess its benefits.This theme was more prevalent among those aged 70 years and over.Untrustworthy and riskyA second strong and multifaceted theme revolved around distrust of AI and the risks it could bring about.Some respondents were concerned about ""being taken over by the internet"" or becoming too dependent on technology.

[AI] like a lot of other things - the internet being one prime example - it is not properly governed/legislated/controlled. It is open to huge abuse, corruption, etc.


 Female, aged 50 to 69 yearsOthers expressed frustration about the lack of aptitude or flexibility of AI, particularly when referring to chatbots, and not being able to access human help when things went wrong. However, it is unclear if the chatbots respondents referred to were powered by AI.A group of respondents raised concerns about AI applications exhibiting biases or using their data without their consent, and the potential for this technology to enable cyber crime or other unlawful activities.

I feel worried about security risks for myself and the younger generation.


 Female, aged 70 years or overAnother group felt AI was dangerous and were afraid of unforeseen and irreparable consequences of the rollout of current and future AI technology.A minority of respondents mentioned that AI benefits depended on its application or that AI benefits seemed small compared with its risks.This theme was more common among adults aged 50 years and over.Distrust in the ability and intentions of companies developing or using AIRespondents expressed distrust in companies' primary motivation to use AI; some felt companies were focused on maximising profits, hence the benefits of AI would not be shared.

It will be used for corporate purposes, to make money for shareholders or to cut costs. Either way, the average consumer is not the main consideration.


 Male, aged 50 to 69 yearsOthers noted that those who develop and manage AI are ""fallible"", raising concerns about the technology itself and its use. Another concern was the perception that companies were hiding behind AI applications to avoid accountability.This theme was more common among those aged 50 years and over.Loss of human interaction and damage to social fabricRespondents were worried about the individual and social consequences of having fewer opportunities to interact with humans, with some feeling that the introduction of AI would lead to ""social disintegration"".

I would prefer to interact with humans. Interacting with AIs makes me feel unimportant and lonely.


 Female, aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among those aged 50 years and over.Loss of jobs and worsening of working conditionsSome respondents felt worried about losing their jobs or, in the case of retired respondents, how job displacement or replacement would affect younger generations. 

I also work as a [occupation] in films and currently there is a strike as studios are proposing to replace [occupation] with AI. I am also an [occupation] and this industry is under threat too.


 Female, aged 30 to 49 yearsA few participants mentioned they did not expect AI to improve job opportunities, but instead feared financial hardship.Others were concerned about increased workload or stress at work, with some describing how it was already happening in their workplace.

Where I work, we have self-service tills. These are taking jobs off people plus theft is higher. They also raise stress levels in the workplace.


 Male, aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among adults aged 30 to 69 years.Inadequate information, regulation, and monitoringConcerns were raised about insufficient monitoring and regulation of AI and the need for fit-for-purpose legislation to ensure AI use is in the public interest. Respondents also voiced a need for more information about AI and for more public debate and consideration.

Much more consideration needs to be given to this and legislation introduced which helps to manage the use of AI (as should also be the case with social media) so that its use is in the public interest rather than commercial and shareholder interests and profits.


 Male aged 50 to 69 yearsThis theme was more common among adults aged 50 to 69 years.For more methodological details about this thematic analysis, see Section 9: Data sources and quality.Figure 4: Over a third of adults do not think AI could have a positive impact on their lifeProportion of adults reporting positive impacts AI could have on their life, Great Britain, 26 July to 1 October 2023

Notes:

Question: ""In which ways, if any, do you think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a positive impact on your life?”
Respondents were able to choose more than one option.
Base: all adults.
Differences across groups reporting positive impacts of AIThe ways in which adults thought AI could have a positive impact on their life differed by sex, age group and education.SexMen were significantly more likely to report that AI could:

improve their access to healthcare (35%)
increase their access to learning or education (28%)
make their household tasks easier (25%)
make their job easier (25%)
Age groupAdults aged 16 to 29 years were significantly more likely than other age groups to report that AI could increase their access to learning or education (44%). This is possibly because this age group is more likely to still be in education.Adults aged 16 to 29 and 30 to 49 years were significantly more likely than older age groups to report that AI could:

improve their shopping experiences (31% of adults aged 16 to 29 years and 35% of adults aged 30 to 49 years)  
make their household tasks easier (30% of adults aged 16 to 29 years and 29% of adults aged 30 to 49 years)
Adults aged 70 years and over (57%) were significantly more likely than other age groups to report they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life.EducationAdults educated to degree level or equivalent were more likely to report that AI could:

improve their access to healthcare (39%)
improve their shopping experiences (36%)
make their job easier (36%)
increase their access to learning or education (35%)
make their household tasks easier (31%)
Adults without a degree were more likely to report they did not think AI could have a positive impact on their life (43%) compared with those educated to degree level or equivalent (20%).Negative impacts of AIThe most common ways in which AI could negatively affect adults' lives were: 

using their personal data without consent (72%)
make it difficult to tell whether news or information are fake (68%)
increase their chances of experiencing cyber crime (60%)
There were few significant statistical differences in how population groups answered this question, which indicates there is more consensus about the negative impacts of AI than the positive ones. Full breakdowns can be found in the accompanying dataset.Figure 5: Around 7 in 10 adults are concerned that AI could use their personal data without consentProportion of adults reporting negative impacts that AI could have on their life, Great Britain, 26 July to 1 October 2023

Question: ""In which ways, if any, do you think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a negative impact on your life?” 
Respondents were able to choose more than one option. 
Base: all adults. 
AI impacts on adults in employmentWhen considering how adults in employment perceived the positive impacts AI could have on their jobs, we found that around:

3 in 10 (28%) think that AI could make their job easier
1 in 9 (11%) think that AI could reduce their working hours without reducing their pay
1 in 13 (8%) think that AI could improve their job prospects
1 in 14 (7%) think that AI could increase their income
When investigating how adults in employment perceived the negative impacts AI could have on their jobs, we found that around:

a third (32%) think AI could put their job at risk
a quarter (23%) think that AI could reduce their income
AI impacts on different occupation groupsWe found that adults working in professional occupations (41%), managers, directors, and senior officials (34%) and associate professional occupations (34%) were significantly more likely to report AI could make their job easier than adults working in all other occupations (see Figure 6). Examples of job titles for each occupation can be found in the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) 2020 coding index.In contrast, adults working in administrative and secretarial (43%), sales and customer service (41%), associate professional (36%), and professional (33%) occupations were significantly more likely to think AI could put their job at risk than adults working in skilled trade (20%) and caring, leisure and other service occupations (18%) (see Figure 7).Recent cross-country analysis from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on labour market exposure to AI found that the UK has a large share of workers in occupations:

with high exposure and high complementarity (AI's potential to complement human labour) (52%)
with high exposure but low complementarity (AI's potential to displace human labour) (32%)
Although the classification of occupations used in the IMF analysis (ISCO-8) is not completely aligned with the classification we used (one-digit SOC), some of our findings resonate with the IMF's estimated impact of AI on the UK labour market.Adults in some high-exposure occupations that are expected to be enhanced by AI, such as professional roles, were also more likely to say AI could make their job easier. In contrast, adults in some high-exposure occupations, which are deemed at higher risk of displacement, such as administrative and secretarial roles, were more likely to say AI could put their job at risk. Adults in occupations that are forecast to be much less exposed to AI, such as those in elementary occupations, appear to be concerned about losing their jobs, possibly because of previous experiences with automation (see our Probability of automation in England article for more information).

8. Glossary

Artificial intelligenceThe following definition of artificial intelligence (AI) was provided for survey respondents:""By artificial intelligence (AI) we mean computer programmes or machines that can learn from data and perform tasks usually done by humans. AI is currently used in a variety of ways, including: 

online product recommendations
facial recognition 
self-driving vehicles
medical diagnostic tools
chatbots that interact in a conversational way and can answer complex questions""
Disability statusTo define disability in this publication, we refer to the Government Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised ""core"" definition of disability. This identifies ""disabled"" as a person who has a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more that reduces their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported.EducationHighest education level, as defined in this government page covering qualification levels, refers to the level of the highest qualification obtained by a respondent. Qualifications have been grouped into the following groups for ease of analysis and communications, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes:

degree or equivalent: level 6 or higher qualification obtained anywhere
below degree level (including GCSEs, A Levels or equivalent)
other qualification obtained in the UK not included in the other categories, or any qualification obtained outside the UK, which is not a degree
none: no formal qualifications
EthnicityThe ethnicity disaggregation used has been chosen to provide the most granular breakdown possible, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes. Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) ethnicity questions are not completely aligned with the GSS harmonised standard. However, the reporting of the five-category ethnicity groups is aligned with this guidance. More information can be found on the GSS harmonised ethnicity page.The five-category ethnicity breakdown includes:

Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani or any other Asian background
Black, African, Caribbean or Black British: African, Caribbean or any other Black, African or Caribbean background
Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups: White and Asian, White and Black African, White and Black Caribbean,  or any other Mixed or Multiple ethnic background
Other ethnic group: Arab or any other ethnic group
White: White British, White Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller, or any other White background
The Index of Multiple DeprivationThe Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in England. The IMD ranks every small area in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area). Deciles are calculated by ranking the 32,844 small areas in England, from most deprived to least deprived, and dividing them into 10 equal groups. These range from the most deprived 10% of small areas nationally to the least deprived 10% of small areas nationally. For this analysis, to ensure robust sample sizes, we have further grouped deciles into quintiles.Statistical significanceThis article presents a summary of results, with further data including confidence intervals for the estimates shown in the charts presented and contained in the associated datasets. Where comparisons between groups are presented, 95% confidence intervals should be used to assess the statistical significance of the change. For more information, see our Uncertainty and how we measure it for our surveys methodology.Standard Occupational ClassificationOccupation is self-reported on the OPN and, therefore, should be treated with caution.Our Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is a common classification of occupational information for the UK, in which jobs are classified by their skill level and content into the following nine major groups:

managers, directors and senior officials
professional occupations
associate professional occupations
administrative and secretarial occupations
skilled trades occupations
caring, leisure and other service occupations
sales and customer service occupations
process, plant, and machine operatives
elementary occupations

9. Data sources and quality

This release contains data and indicators from the Office for National Statistics's (ONS) Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN).QualityMore quality and methodology information on the OPN and its strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in our Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Quality and Methodology Information (QMI). SamplingThe analysis throughout this article is based on adults aged 16 years and over in Great Britain. The latest analysis in this report is based on 12,511 adults from a pooled dataset comprising five waves of data collection, covering the following periods:

26 July to 6 August 2023
 9 to 20 August 2023
 23 August to 3 September 2023
 6 to 17 September 2023
 20 September to 1 October 2023
Pooling fives waves of data together increases sample sizes and allows us to carry out detailed analysis for different groups of the population.WeightingSurvey weights were applied to make estimates representative of the population.Weights were first adjusted for non-response and attrition. Subsequently, the weights were calibrated to satisfy population distributions considering the following factors: sex by age, region, tenure, highest qualification, and employment status.For age, sex, and region, population totals based on projections of mid-year population estimates for June 2021 were used. Therefore, the resulting weighted sample is representative of the Great Britain adult population by a number of socio-demographic factors and geography.Qualitative analysisBetween 9 and 20 August, survey respondents who told us that they thought AI could not have a positive impact on their life were asked: ""In your own words, tell us why you don't think artificial intelligence (AI) could have a positive impact on your life"".Inductive thematic analysis, a bottom-up approach whereby themes emerge from the data themselves, was used by two analysts to code the data. For quality assurance purposes, 10% of responses were independently double coded by a third analyst. This ensured codes were correctly classified within each theme, while any differences were resolved through discussion and review until consensus was reached.All survey responses were anonymous and any potentially identifying information has been removed from the quotations. Some quotations have been shortened for brevity.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Professors Jack Stilgoe (University College London) and Jonathan Ives (University of Bristol) for their contribution to the selection and design of the survey questions, and more generally, for their expert guidance and ideas.

Emerging technologies have ushered in a new era of legal complexities for employers. While artificial intelligence and, more recently, generative AI have garnered significant attention, the initial wave of regulation is focusing on automated employment decision tools (AEDTs). This article delves into an overview of AEDTs, the guidance provided by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the unique legal landscape in various jurisdictions, including New York City, Illinois, California, and Maryland. Our goal is to help employers navigate this evolving landscape while emphasizing the importance of automating processes without sacrificing fairness in employment decisions.


The Rise of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the employment lifecycle has become pervasive. As AI becomes integrated into employment decision-making, concerns regarding bias (or perceived bias) imparted by algorithms have taken center stage. Employment decisions, ranging from filtering job applications to making hiring, retention, promotion, and termination choices, have become reliant on these automated tools. The promise of using technology to streamline decision-making is alluring, but it comes with significant risks and, in some cases, imposes compliance requirements on employers who choose to incorporate AI into their processes.

Algorithmic Bias and Regulatory Attention

One of the most significant concerns in the AI-driven employment landscape is algorithmic bias. Just like humans, algorithms are not immune to bias, and this issue has garnered increasing attention from lawmakers and regulators in recent years. For example, President Biden recently signed an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. The order establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, and advances American thought leadership in terms of AI around the world.
PROMOTED
The focus on AI within the employment context has gained momentum, as demonstrated by a joint statement from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Justice (DOJ), EEOC, and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning discrimination and bias. The joint statement underscores three crucial points:


Application of Existing Legal Authorities: The statement affirms that existing laws and regulations are equally applicable to the use of automated systems and new technologies, signaling that agencies will apply existing legal frameworks to AI.
Addressing Harmful Outcomes: It highlights the ways AI can “perpetuate unlawful bias, automate unlawful discrimination, and produce other harmful outcomes,” emphasizing the need for vigilance in AI employment practices.
Protection of Individual Rights: The statement concludes with a commitment from these agencies to vigorously protect individual rights against discriminatory AI practices.

Charlotte Burrows, Chair of the EEOC, emphasizes the need to ensure that new technologies do not become a “high-tech pathway to discrimination.” The EEOC has established an initiative on artificial intelligence and algorithmic fairness to address those concerns.

EEOC Guidance on AI in Employment
The EEOC has taken proactive steps to guide employers when using AI in employment decisions. Two essential pieces of guidance have been released:


1/100:28Forbes Leadership

Continue watchingKamala Harris’s Presidential Bid: Triumph Or Trial?after the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
1. Select Issues: Assessing Adverse Impact in Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence Used in Employment Selection Procedures Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: This document addresses the use of AI in employment decisions and the concept of disparate impact. Disparate impact occurs when an employer uses a process that appears neutral but disproportionately affects individuals based on protected characteristics, such as race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The guidance outlines several critical points:


Employers must audit AI tools that significantly contribute to employment decisions to ensure they are not discriminatory.
If there is a possibility that an AI tool imparts disparate impact, employers must demonstrate that using the tool is “job-related and consistent with business necessity” and that there are no less discriminatory alternatives that are equally effective.
Employers who use third-party AI solutions, software, or online tools for employment decisions are not shielded from liability if these tools disproportionately affect individuals in protected classes.
The “four-fifths rule,” which suggests that there should not be more than a 20% variance in selection between members of a protected class, can be used as a benchmark for assessing disparate impact.


2. The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees: The guidance also addresses the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the context of AI. It outlines three ways in which an employer’s AI tools may violate the ADA:


Failure to provide a “reasonable accommodation” in lieu of AI. Employers should ensure that accommodations are available, such as oral exams for individuals with limited manual dexterity.
Screening out a candidate with a disability who can perform essential job functions with a reasonable accommodation. For example, if an AI tool screens out someone with a speech impediment who can perform the job, it likely raises discrimination concerns.
Conducting disability-related inquiries or medical examinations that violate the ADA’s restrictions.


The guidance provides employers with practical steps to comply with the ADA when using AI decision-making tools, including allowing for opt-outs, providing notice before AI use, focusing on essential job qualifications, and reviewing vendor compliance.
State and Local Measures: New York City, Illinois, California, and Maryland
Now, let’s focus on state-specific measures that directly affect employers using AI in employment decisions. These unique legal landscapes add an additional layer of complexity to the use of AI and AEDTs.
New York City: The city’s artificial intelligence and hiring ordinance, effective since July 5th, 2023, impacts employers who use AEDTs that significantly aid in employment decisions. This law prohibits employers from using AEDTs for candidate or employee screening without first conducting a bias audit. Employers must undergo an annual bias audit conducted by an independent auditor and publish the results on their website. Furthermore, employers must give candidates ten days’ notice before using an AEDT for hiring decisions.
Illinois: The state enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act in 2020. This landmark legislation places specific obligations on employers:


Employers must provide prior notice to applicants that AI may be used to analyze video interviews.
Employers must explain how AI works and the types of characteristics it uses to evaluate applicants.
Applicants must give their consent to be evaluated by AI software.
Employers are prohibited from sharing an applicant’s video with others, except those necessary for evaluating fitness for the position.
Candidates can request the deletion of videos after a specified time period.


Recent amendments to this act aim to address racial bias and AI in employment. Employers relying solely on AI to determine in-person interviews must submit demographic information about those not offered in-person interviews and those hired.
Maryland: Maryland’s Facial Recognition Technology law defines “facial recognition service” and “facial template.” Employers must obtain signed waivers that provide an applicant’s consent if facial recognition technology is used during interviews. The waiver must include the applicant’s name, interview date, consent to facial recognition use, and whether the applicant read the consent waiver.
California: While California’s Fair Chance Act is not AI-specific, it influences the use of AI in employment decisions for candidates with a criminal history. Recent revisions expand the definition of an employer to include services that evaluate an applicant’s criminal history on behalf of an employer. This means AI solutions assessing an individual’s criminal history could be subject to compliance requirements under the Fair Chance Act. Additionally, the state’s case law aligns with this approach.
Legislation and Beyond
Dozens of bills were introduced by lawmakers in the 2023 legislative session, although few advanced beyond discussion. For example, a bill that would have imposed specific obligations on California employers to evaluate the impact of automated employment decision tools, though it did not pass, might be reintroduced in future legislative sessions. Employers should monitor developments in this area. Similarly, a bill in Washington, D.C., has reappeared and, although less restrictive than previous versions, still focuses on prohibiting discriminatory actions taken by AI tools in employment decisions. Expect similar bills to emerge in various statehouses in 2024.
As these state and local measures continue to evolve, it’s imperative for employers to stay vigilant and proactive in their approach to AI in employment decisions. While we’ve covered the guidance, regulations, and laws that are in place or emerging, it’s important to understand the practical implications and best practices for employers in this AI-driven landscape.
Balancing Innovation with Compliance
Employers understand that AI can significantly enhance the efficiency and precision of various aspects of the employment process. It offers the potential for substantial gains in terms of speed and accuracy. However, it’s equally important to strike a balance between leveraging AI for its capabilities while also ensuring that the technology aligns with legal requirements and maintains fairness and non-discrimination in employment decisions.
Scoring and predictive analysis represent areas where AI can significantly benefit employment decisions. Many employers are inundated with vast amounts of factual data about their workers, but they often struggle with synthesizing this data effectively. AI tools can provide solutions by assessing an individual’s criminal history and determining recidivism rates, offering insights into the likelihood of reoffending or committing future crimes. Similarly, AI can analyze an individual’s credit history, evaluating the risk based on unsecured debt, mortgages, student loans, and medical bills. It can also examine public records to explain gaps in an individual’s history.
While the benefits of scoring and predictive analysis are evident, there are potential pitfalls. Predictive analysis, especially in the context of criminal recidivism, has faced scrutiny for its accuracy and potential bias. AI models assessing recidivism have been found to be incorrect, particularly for black criminal offenders, highlighting the “bias in, bias out” nature of AI data models. Furthermore, the belief that scoring is impartial can lead to detachment from the human implications of machine-born decisions. From a compliance perspective, the EEOC mandates assessing if predictive analysis or scoring causes a disparate impact. Additionally, from an FTC or CFPB perspective, mechanisms must be created for individuals to challenge and dispute adverse information produced by AI.
Aside from scoring and predictive analysis, the background check industry is considering various ways to use AI to enhance the employment screening process:


Background Check Accuracy: AI could enhance the accuracy of background checks. It may be used to verify identities by matching personal identifiers, helping verify credentials, and conducting geographic analysis to help narrow an individual’s location at the time of a purported crime.
Adjudication Analysis: AI can create continuous learning models for adjudication decisions. By analyzing past adjudication decisions and feedback from human adjudicators, AI can spot patterns and trends that influence decisions.
Quality Improvement: One of the most valuable applications of AI in background checks is the analysis of information disputed by candidates. AI may help identify trends and areas of improvement, leading to higher-quality background reports.


Transparency and Compliance
Transparency and compliance with evolving regulations are paramount. To navigate this terrain successfully, employers should focus on the following five factors:


Transparency: Employers must ensure transparency when implementing AI in their processes. Providing clear and understandable communication to candidates about the use of AI in decision-making is crucial. Candidates should be informed about how their data will be used and how decisions will be made. Transparency builds trust and enables individuals to make informed choices.
Accountability: Employers should establish accountability for AI-driven decisions. This means taking responsibility for the outcomes and actions of automated systems. Understanding the factors that influence AI decisions and being ready to explain or rectify any discrepancies is essential.
Auditing: Regular audits of AI systems can help identify and rectify bias or unintended discrimination. Employers should consider third-party audits to ensure impartiality.
Bias Mitigation: Employers must actively work on minimizing bias in AI models. This includes continuous monitoring, refining algorithms, and ensuring that the data used to train AI systems is representative and diverse.
Fairness and Equal Treatment: Employers should strive for fairness and equal treatment throughout the hiring and employment lifecycle. This includes conducting fair background checks, providing equal opportunities, and ensuring that AI does not lead to unlawful discrimination.


The use of AI in employment decisions is rapidly evolving, and employers must adapt while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. As we look to the future, technology will continue to transform how we make employment decisions. However, the responsibility lies with employers to embrace these changes while upholding the principles of fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination. In a world where technology and human values intersect, the key to success is to harness the power of AI to enhance processes while keeping human ethics at the forefront of decision-making. By achieving this balance, employers can navigate the complex legal landscape and make better, more informed employment decisions.

Unleashing a New Era of Work, with Generative AIAlan Connolly and Maciej Kafel31 Oct 2023 
FacebookTwitterLinkedin
Generative AI within the workplace isn’t just innovation, it is a whole new way of working. Whilst the technology has been around for some time, it hasn’t been so readily available to everyone across the workplace, and it has caused a paradigm shift transforming the very foundation of how we work, collaborate, and perform our daily tasks, promising a future rich in creativity, innovation, and peak performance.
Generative AI is fundamentally changing the way we work. It is poised to create a future of work where human and artificial intelligence work as one to achieve extraordinary outcomes.​
The onus is now on businesses to harness the opportunities the technology presents whilst also understanding its implications on security, data, and people, and to truly rethink new ways of working to fully maximize the benefits.
In less than a year since ChatGPT’s release, generative AI is now discussed in almost every boardroom – the Capgemini Research Institute recently found that 96% of organizations say generative AI is on their agenda – and most are optimistic about its benefits. The next step is to turn optimism into action, and the workplace is at the epicenter of this change.
Hyper-personalization: A game-changer
In the era of generative AI, the workplace will no longer be a one-size-fits-all environment. It’s a dynamic space where services and experiences are tailored to individual preferences, work patterns, and communication styles.
With the ability to analyze colossal amounts of data, Generative AI can create a unique work environment for everyone, allowing new ways of working and opportunities for businesses to rethink the modern workplace. This hyper-personalization redefines digital engagement, collaboration, and personal performance, and transforms how we learn, develop, and perform.
Imagine AI-powered virtual assistants that understand your unique work style and dynamically optimize workflows accordingly.
Or what if you could experience personalized learning paths designed around your unique strengths and weaknesses, providing you with the precise skills you need to excel in ways that work for you so that knowledge and retention are at their maximum.
This augmented human experience shifts the focus towards innovation and creativity, makes work more enriching.
The performance renaissance
Generative AI is not just enhancing personalization; it’s redefining productivity and more excitingly it will have a transformational impact on personal performance. By integrating AI co-pilots into everyday applications, mundane tasks are automated, time is optimized, and errors are minimized. This allows employees to focus on the strategic and creative aspects of their jobs, thereby boosting their performance to new heights.
With performance enhancement copilots such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, employees now have the ability to take their performance to the next level, to be more expressive and impactful in their presentations, more creative and efficient when producing documentation, more analytical across large complex datasets, and more resourceful when engaging with communications channels such as email and instant messaging.
The transformation is all-encompassing, extending to frontline workers as well. AI copilots can optimize the performance of various professionals, from doctors to retail workers. For instance, retail assistants could leverage AI copilots that analyze customer behavior, preferences, and past purchases to provide personalized shopping experiences.
These AI-powered applications can streamline tasks, provide real-time insights, and enable frontline workers to deliver unparalleled service, thereby transforming their roles and enhancing their productivity.
Operational excellence: The new norm
Beyond enhancing workplace personalization and productivity, generative AI is fast becoming the bedrock of operational efficiency, ensuring organizations remain relevant and sustainable.
For example, AI chatbots empower customer service agents to deliver rapid and superior solutions. Agents can be trained to provide better responses, reduce issue resolution times, and gain easy access to information during customer interactions.
The impact extends to the onboarding of new colleagues who can quickly become as effective as senior agents. This not only improves service quality, but also customer perception. Agents have the ability to not only respond, but also to train AI models, further improving data quality and value.
Generative AI’s impact extends to every layer of support, from foundational operations to knowledge management, streamlining processes and reducing the burden on employees.
Our point of view – The Generative AI imperative
The advent of generative AI has ushered in a new era, ready to transform industries across the spectrum. With pace come challenges, and organizations must tread carefully, considering the ethical and social implications of AI. Privacy, security, bias mitigation, accountability, and digital inclusion should all be integral to integrating AI in all its forms across your business.
To harness the transformative potential of generative AI and reinvent the employee experience, a human-centered approach is paramount. Organizations must prioritize the needs and aspirations of their employees, engage in collaborative AI co-creation, and respect individual values and preferences.
Generative AI is not a distant wave but a powerful tide reshaping the employee experience. The extent to which an organization participates will define its future in the ever-evolving market. It’s not a race to be the fastest; it’s a commitment to being in the game, adapting to change or risking obsolescence.
In conclusion, the dawn of generative AI is an inspiring, exciting, and transformative event. It’s about unleashing a whole new way of working, enabling people to be more creative, innovative, and efficient in their roles. It’s about empowering individuals, enhancing experiences, and driving businesses forward into an exciting future.
The caveat is that the effectiveness of gen AI in the workplace hinges on your ability to manage and secure your data, move quickly to the cloud, and have an unwavering focus on your most important asset – your people.

  How to use AI to innovate




Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its presence felt across many industries—and the accounting profession is no exception. While 51% of accounting professionals believe that ChatGPT and generative AI should be applied to tax, accounting, and audit work, opinions are divided about the usefulness of AI tools.
One of the primary concerns centers on how AI will affect accounting jobs and the career outlook for tax professionals. While AI is undeniably changing the face of the industry, it also holds positive implications for the future of accounting.
How is AI affecting accounting?
A growing interest in artificial intelligence is leading more firms to stake an investment in its potential. A Thomson Reuters survey found that 1 in 10 accounting and tax professionals are currently using ChatGPT/generative AI or planning to integrate these technologies into their operations.
Although the adoption rate for AI remains relatively low, the growth potential is high. AI is reshaping the way the industry functions by allowing accounting professionals to work more efficiently and at a faster pace. Some of the most notable impacts include:

Data collection and analysis
Tax research and optimization
Strategic planning and forecasting
Streamlining back-end operations

As an evolving technology, AI is far from perfect, and it still lacks certain capabilities. While the latest version of ChatGPT passed a practice CPA exam, AI primarily remains a tool for aiding accountants and tax professionals, rather than a substitute for human expertise.
Is AI replacing accounting jobs?
Concerns about AI replacing accounting jobs are certainly valid. However, that isn’t happening yet, and it’s debatable whether it will happen at all. The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs Report suggests that the jobs least likely to be lost to artificial intelligence include ones that require “human skills such as judgment, creativity, physical dexterity, and emotional intelligence.”
Accountants must be able to think logically to make informed decisions, use their creativity to find solutions for clients, and communicate effectively with everyone in their professional sphere.
There’s still no direct evidence that accountants are losing jobs to AI, though hiring for back-office roles could be affected as more tasks become automated. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ occupational outlook for accountants and auditors over the next decade calls for the field to increase by 4%—compared with a 3% average growth rate for all occupations.
What is AI automating in accounting?
AI is a web of connected technologies that accountants can use to automate mundane tasks that are essential to day-to-day operations. In doing so, they’re positioned to have more time to dedicate to higher-level activities, such as nurturing client relationships.
Robotic process automation (RPA), for example, is software technology that’s designed to act as a complement to processes performed by a human. Robotic accounting is a form of RPA that relies on software “bots” to perform certain accounting tasks, such as:

Invoicing and account reconciliation
Cash flow reporting and forecasting
Budgeting and bookkeeping
Document management and audit support
Tax research and preparation
Compliance

The use of AI allows accountants to take more of a hands-off approach to these types of activities, without compromising on data security or accuracy. AI is often instrumental in helping to identify errors and improve the overall accuracy of financial statements and reports, while streamlining and standardizing workflows.

Can AI do accounting?
While accounting software and tax preparation programs increasingly include elements of AI, accounting remains largely a human process. Accounting professionals are, however, turning to AI to automate parts of the tax workflow, including manual data entry.
There’s also an opportunity for AI to offer an enhanced client experience. SurePrep, a recent Thomson Reuters acquisition, has created Do It Like Last Year (DILLY), an AI process that utilizes both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify documents. The technology is designed to do so even if the documents in question change—eliminating the need to sift through and carry over information from prior years and shortening the time frame for completing client returns.
Using AI to innovate
Developing a knowledge base about AI will help you understand what it can—and cannot—do to assist your firm, as well as help allay any fears you might have about accounting jobs being replaced by the technology.

        Are companies ready for generative AI?

            Most European financial services companies in a survey expect the technology to make an impact in short order, but not nearly as many have shored up training plans.

            By Bryan Strickland

Strategy and innovationTechnology and analytics



Nearly seven of ten European financial services companies recognise that the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) means a significant portion of their workforce soon will require training, but nearly eight of ten admit their plans for training are, at best, in their infancy.
Responding to the EY European Financial Services AI Survey earlier this month, 77% of executives at 60 financial institutions across Europe said they expect GenAI — technology that can use existing data to generate new content like text, photos, and videos — to affect their company's operations.
Sixty-eight per cent believe that up to one-quarter of their workforce will require related training and upskilling in the next six to 12 months. However, 77% said plans for that training are barely off the ground (35% said there are no plans in place; 42% said plans are ""in their infancy"").
The potential positive impact of GenAI has reached the doorstep — 60% of respondents said their organisation has actively invested in the last six to 12 months, and 75% expect even more spending in the next six to 12 months — but preparations for putting GenAI to work aren't matching that pace.
""Europe's financial leaders are investing in AI technologies, targeting increased productivity, customer benefits, and operational efficiencies. However, the challenge of enabling the workforce to realise and capitalise on potential gains requires in-depth, long-term planning, which is not yet in full force,"" said Ayman Awada, Financial Services Technology Consulting Leader for EY in Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa.
""GenAI technologies and the potential of their applications continue to evolve rapidly. Financial services leaders must ensure that they are adopting a strategic mindset as they manage their investment, both in new technologies and their people. Bringing together the best of human-driven insight, with the breadth of GenAI capabilities, will be fundamental to successful GenAI integration,"" Awada said.
The EY survey was released the same week that CPA.com, the business and technology subsidiary of AICPA, released its GenAI toolkit aimed at equipping accounting and finance professionals.
Participating leaders in the EY survey cited their top concern as limited understanding and experience with GenAI applications and their impact across the workforce (36%).
Although some organisations are off schedule on plans for getting the workforce up to speed on GenAI, a portion are mapping out a new model for the workforce of the future. Thirty-five per cent of executives said they plan to integrate AI training within their graduate programmes, and 25% are planning a more widespread restructuring of roles and responsibilities across entry-level positions.
Survey respondents most often cited an innovative and interdisciplinary mindset and a tech-savvy and experimental approach as the top attributes they will target when recruiting entry-level talent for a GenAI-enabled workforce.

  A research paper released today describes ways generative AI can assist one of the most complex engineering efforts: designing semiconductors.
The work demonstrates how companies in highly specialized fields can train large language models (LLMs) on their internal data to build assistants that increase productivity.
Few pursuits are as challenging as semiconductor design. Under a microscope, a state-of-the-art chip like an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU (above) looks like a well-planned metropolis, built with tens of billions of transistors, connected on streets 10,000x thinner than a human hair.
Multiple engineering teams coordinate for as long as two years to construct one of these digital megacities.
Some groups define the chip’s overall architecture, some craft and place a variety of ultra-small circuits, and others test their work. Each job requires specialized methods, software programs and computer languages.
A Broad Vision for LLMs
“I believe over time large language models will help all the processes, across the board,” said Mark Ren, an NVIDIA Research director and lead author on the paper.
Bill Dally, NVIDIA’s chief scientist, announced the paper today in a keynote at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, an annual gathering of hundreds of engineers working in the field called electronic design automation, or EDA.
“This effort marks an important first step in applying LLMs to the complex work of designing semiconductors,” said Dally at the event in San Francisco. “It shows how even highly specialized fields can use their internal data to train useful generative AI models.”
ChipNeMo Surfaces
The paper details how NVIDIA engineers created for their internal use a custom LLM, called ChipNeMo, trained on the company’s internal data to generate and optimize software and assist human designers.
Long term, engineers hope to apply generative AI to each stage of chip design, potentially reaping significant gains in overall productivity, said Ren, whose career spans more than 20 years in EDA.
After surveying NVIDIA engineers for possible use cases, the research team chose three to start: a chatbot, a code generator and an analysis tool.
Initial Use Cases
The latter — a tool that automates the time-consuming tasks of maintaining updated descriptions of known bugs — has been the most well-received so far.
A prototype chatbot that responds to questions about GPU architecture and design helped many engineers quickly find technical documents in early tests.
A code generator will help designers write software for a chip design.
A code generator in development (demonstrated above)  already creates snippets of about 10-20 lines of software in two specialized languages chip designers use. It will be integrated with existing tools, so engineers have a handy assistant for designs in progress.
Customizing AI Models With NVIDIA NeMo
The paper mainly focuses on the team’s work gathering its design data and using it to create a specialized generative AI model, a process portable to any industry.
As its starting point, the team chose a foundation model and customized it with NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models that’s included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. The selected NeMo model sports 43 billion parameters, a measure of its capability to understand patterns. It was trained using more than a trillion tokens, the words and symbols in text and software.
ChipNeMo provides an example of how one deeply technical team refined a pretrained model with its own data.
The team then refined the model in two training rounds, the first using about 24 billion tokens worth of its internal design data and the second on a mix of about 130,000 conversation and design examples.
The work is among several examples of research and proofs of concept of generative AI in the semiconductor industry, just beginning to emerge from the lab.
Sharing Lessons Learned
One of the most important lessons Ren’s team learned is the value of customizing an LLM.
On chip-design tasks, custom ChipNeMo models with as few as 13 billion parameters match or exceed performance of even much larger general-purpose LLMs like LLaMA2 with 70 billion parameters. In some use cases, ChipNeMo models were dramatically better.
Along the way, users need to exercise care in what data they collect and how they clean it for use in training, he added.
Finally, Ren advises users to stay abreast of the latest tools that can speed and simplify the work.
NVIDIA Research has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide focused on topics such as AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics. Other recent projects in semiconductors include using AI to design smaller, faster circuits and to optimize placement of large blocks.
Enterprises looking to build their own custom LLMs can get started today using NeMo framework available from GitHub and NVIDIA NGC catalog.

Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to save $243.5 billion in production capacity across Indonesia, according to Access Partnership’s The Economic Impact of Generative AI: The Future of Work in Indonesia report.
“The new generation of AI, which is generative AI, helps us to interact with data in new ways,” said Dharma Simorangkir, president director of Microsoft Indonesia. “From summarising text and detecting anomalies to recognising image, its natural language interface allows us to interact with this technology using everyday language, and its ability as a reasoning engine helps us identify patterns and draw insights much faster.”
The Microsoft-funded report also detailed three aspects that require attention, including improving access to and use of AI, managing its risk and encouraging further innovation. According to Microsoft Indonesia, AI needs to continue to be democratised so that new skills can be mastered such as prompting, analytical evaluation and problem solving.
To manage risk, Microsoft will continue to raise awareness of responsible AI usage such as through its Responsible AI Impact Assessment report.
“In a democratic society, one of our fundamental principles is that no one is immune to the law,” said Ajar Edi, director of government affairs at Microsoft Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam. “That’s why we feel it’s appropriate for regulators and policymakers to increase oversight and consider new laws and regulations. We will continue to actively participate by sharing our experiences and insights on responsible AI practices.”
Meanwhile, Microsoft will collaborate with the government and private sector to protect and encourage innovation through the use of AI. It will also drive innovation through its AI Customer Commitments, including the Copilot Copyright Commitment.
“AI can help people focus on essential elements of their tasks, not replace them,” said Simorangkir. “Because, after all, AI can only work with data provided by humans, and is developed to improve human competence.”

 On October 30, 2023, President Biden issued an “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” to address the growing concerns surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The 111-page document identifies several areas of concern with the use of AI, including labor, competition, cybersecurity, education, health, and privacy. The order not only calls on federal agencies to work collaboratively, provide more guidance, and conduct training, but it also urges agencies to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers.
Here are some of the key directives from the executive order:

Orders the Secretary of Labor, in conjunction with outside entities such as labor unions, to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers by addressing job displacement, labor standards, workplace equity, health, and safety, and data collection. Once these best practices are identified, the agencies are expected to adopt these guidelines, to the extent feasible, in their programs. A fact sheet, which was issued before the executive order was released, explains that “[t]hese principles and best practices will benefit workers by providing guidance to prevent employers from undercompensating workers, evaluating job applications unfairly, or impinging on workers’ ability to organize.”


Orders the Secretary of Labor to issue guidance emphasizing that employers must ensure that employees are appropriately compensated for all hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act when using AI tools to monitor or augment employees’ work. Significantly, this marks the first time that the Biden administration has shown any interest in AI-related concerns in the wage and hour context.


Directs the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to produce a report regarding AI’s potential impacts on the labor market, and directs the Secretary of Labor to submit a report identifying options for strengthening federal support for workers facing labor disruptions caused by AI.


Directs the U.S. Department of Justice to increase coordination with federal civil rights offices on AI and algorithmic discrimination issues, “improve external stakeholder engagement to promote public awareness of potential discriminatory uses and effects of AI; and develop, as appropriate, additional training, technical assistance, guidance, or other resources[.]”


Instructs the Director of the National Science Foundation to “prioritize available resources to support AI-related education and AI-related workforce development through existing programs.”


Encourages the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether to use its existing authorities, including the agency’s rulemaking authority, “to ensure fair competition in the AI marketplace and to ensure that consumers and workers are protected from harms that may be enabled by the use of AI.”


Creates a White House AI Council to help coordinate the efforts of the various agencies to ensure the effective formation and implementation of policies related to AI, including those contained within the executive order.

The executive order puts the onus on the federal agencies to achieve the goals articulated for them. Most agencies will have anywhere from 30 to 365 days to fulfill their respective requirements as outlined in the document.
Even though the executive order is largely focused on the federal workforce, private entities are still affected. For example, companies that develop (or intend to develop) AI tools for the federal government are required to provide the government certain information, reports, and records. Additionally, the executive order leverages the federal government’s pocketbook, as one of the largest purchasers of technology, to ensure the compliance of private companies. These federal procurement procedures provide a method for federal agencies to regulate AI indirectly.
The new executive order continues the approach the Biden administration initially laid out in its “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in October 2022 and Executive Order 13985, which directed agencies to combat algorithmic discrimination and enforce existing laws to protect rights and safety. The new executive order is also the byproduct of continued cooperation with many leading AI companies. In 2023, the White House announced that it had secured voluntary commitments from 15 of the leading AI companies to control the risks posed by AI.
The new executive order also reflects the Biden administration’s “whole of government” approach to aggressively promote a pro-union agenda across the entire spectrum of the government. This “whole of government” approach has relied on executive orders, interagency task forces, councils, interagency agreements, individual agency actions such as rulemaking and enforcement strategies, attempts to influence Congress, and a variety of other means to achieve a pro-union agenda. The new executive order continues this approach. Most notably, the fact sheet that was released before the executive order identifies the dangers of increased workplace surveillance, bias, and job displacement and then explains that mitigating these risks must involve supporting “workers’ ability to bargain collectively.” One of the eight “guiding principles and priorities” of the executive order is explicitly pro-union: “The responsible development and use of AI require a commitment to supporting American workers. As AI creates new jobs and industries, all workers need a seat at the table, including through collective bargaining, to ensure that they benefit from these opportunities.” In addition, the executive order’s fact sheet emphasizes that the Biden administration’s response to the risks of using AI entails instructing agencies to develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms, including if AI tools impinge “on workers’ ability to organize.”
Because the executive order urges agencies to develop AI principles and best practices, employers should stay alert to new guidance and regulations that could affect business operations.

What are people asking about artificial intelligence? What are the most burning questions? What concerns people about A.I.?

As an independent career and executive coach, this is becoming increasingly important to me, because it is to my clients – and now to readers. So I embarked on a journey to find out. During the period of September 26 through October 25, 2023, I aggregated 10 independent surveys and conducted an informal one myself. I then ran this by a long-time colleague of mine, Brad McDaniels, a statistician and data analyst. Therefore, my report is not scientific. For all intents and purposes, this could wind up amounting to no more than another Top 10 list, but it is, I’m confident, a relevant and reliable snapshot of what matters as of today. Note: No answers are offered; this is simply to explore what people want to know.


What people want to know about A.I.: Top 10 questions
The questions appear in bold, followed by my comments.

#10 What are the top A.I. companies in the world?
That’s not a great question, but it’s on every list. In tech, especially tech on steroids, which is what A.I. is, that will change quickly. To get a feel for the current market, OK, but tomorrow’s another day.

PROMOTED
#9 What is deep learning?
If you’re asking this question, you’re most likely in for the duration, but still wet behind the ears. It’s a good question, though, and will serve as a strong foundation.

#8 What is natural language processing (NLP)?
Same story as the previous question.
#7 Will robotics kill jobs or create them?
This tells me there is a real acceptance of A.I., but an uncertainty about the near future. If history is our guide, large-scale technology transformations or disruptions create jobs – and lots of them.

#6 A.I. in gaming and sports betting.
It’s too early to tell if this question means that a lot of people are about to lose their shirts or to start new careers in online gambling.

#5 What is artificial intelligence?
The fact that this question is still so high on the list suggests strongly that we’re still at the early part of the early adopter stage of the innovation-adoption cycle. Maybe not even out of the innovators stage.
#4 What role will A.I. play in health care?
Good question to ask – and to keep asking. There’s so much potential to eradicate diseases, test drugs on computer chips instead of animals or humans, etc. But think of the possible misuse or abuse.
 #3 A.I. in self-driving cars?
This is probably one of the three questions that are closest to home. Many people can taste it. In fact, if your can self-park or keep you in lane, you’ve already got a piece of it.
#2 A.I. in investment and finance.
This isone of the other close-to-home question. I sense that many people see A.I. as the route to wealth they haven’t yet had. I also think they should curb their enthusiasm. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs don’t
And the #1question about A.I….
#1 A.I. and the future of work.
Obviously, the thirds close-to-home question. For some, it; about the future of work, but it’s really about a future that is already here.
One more thing: There’s a missing question that should be obvious by its absence:

America’s diversity has always been our nation’s greatest strength and we must continue to leverage capabilities from all people. People with disabilities have long strengthened our economy and expanded our Nation’s possibilities.
The growing popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening new doors that are enhancing the work capabilities and performance for persons with disabilities. In recognition of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, the Department of Commerce hosted a panel discussion on the intersectionality of AI and neurodiversity and the impact of AI on hiring persons with disabilities as well as promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility by all employees.
During the discussion, panelists stressed how AI can shape careers and improve day to day learning through neurodivergence, machine learning, and technology.
Panelist and Chief Information Officer André Mendes commented that some of the most significant contributions in fields like science, technology, and the performing arts have been given to us by individuals with neurodivergent characteristics.
“Humanity is a spectrum, and that spectrum applies to all of us,” said Mr.  Mendes. “Some of us have challenges that do not fit the norm. However, we all have intersectionality, and we all are more than our job.”
Panelist Victoria Houed, Director of AI Policy and Strategy at the Department of Commerce’s Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, commented on the importance of making data more accessible to persons with disabilities, particularly among unrepresented communities.
“As a black woman, it is important to me to be the voice in the room and get data into the hands of unrepresented communities and people that are just different than the stereotypical community,” she said.
Ms. Elham Tabassi, NIST Associate Director for Emerging Technologies, participated in the panel discussion and stressed that AI systems can serve all people and that it is a shared responsibility for all of us.
“We have a responsibility to make sure our technologies are fair and just,” said Ms. Tabassi. “When we increase the diversity of thoughts and thought process, magic happens.”
Ms. Tabassi was nominated by Time Magazine as one of the most influential people in AI.
Making Commerce services, science, and data more accessible is a top priority for several agencies within Commerce that are utilizing AI to complete their missions. The inventory of Commerce AI Use Cases shows how AI is enhancing the department’s mission and promoting the use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Federal Government.
The mission of the Department of Commerce is to help create economic opportunities for all communities, including people with disabilities. Internal to that goal is hiring and retaining more people with disabilities. At 10.9% percent, Commerce falls below the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission (EEOC) benchmark for federal agencies to have 12% of their total workforce made up of people with disabilities. Yet, at 2.49 percent, Commerce exceeds the EEOC benchmark to have two percent of their workforce be made of up people with targeted disabilities which include persons with blindness, mobility impairments, or are deaf and hard of hearing.
The Biden Administration and the Commerce Department are committed to the equality and diversity of all Americans and creating a workplace and an economy that works for all Americans.

Generative AI Ethics

Generative AI is revolutionizing our creative landscape, unlocking unprecedented possibilities. But at what cost? Dive into the ethical dilemmas of this transformative technology, exploring the fine line between innovation and ethical consideration. 
2022 was a huge year for Generative AI. The release of DALL-E 2 in April showed the public the possibilities of text-to-image Gen AI, while the real game changer arrived in November with the launch of ChatGPT. Both AI-powered tools are developed by OpenAI and have quickly gained attention from the mainstream media and social media because of the incredible possibilities offered and the ease of use. Their human-like output has opened exciting doors in various creative fields but also steered in a host of ethical challenges that society must navigate. 
One of the primary differences between more traditional AI and Generative AI is that the latter can create novel output that appears to be generated by humans. Read the high-impact use cases across six major industries by Deloitte AI Institute.
This opens up exciting opportunities in creative industries and poses some ethical challenges. Let’s have a look at them. 
Is Generative AI ethical? 
The answer is: That it depends! Gen AI has the potential to enhance and elevate human creativity, helping artists find their unique style and creating art in virtually any form, from poetry to music, from digital art to 3D models.  
Research in Generative AI has been going on since the 1950s but has gained popularity just very recently; for this reason, there is still a concerning lack of regulations surrounding it. We must quickly address the ethical issues posed by Gen AI and embed it in our society sustainably. 
Why Gen AI poses a serious issue of copyright violations
Many digital artists are fervently complaining against Generative AI tools like Midjourney and DALL-E, which are able to create in seconds what takes them hours and hours of hard work and years of practice. And some of them are even taking legal action for copyright infringement. The problem lies in the datasets used to train these models: hundreds of thousands of digital artworks are used for training Gen AI without the artists’ consent and knowledge. With DALL-E and other tools, it is even possible to create content by copying the style of a particular artist, posing a serious plagiarism issue.  
But the issues regarding copyright don’t end here. Another important question still open to debate is whether content created by Gen AI should be eligible for copyright protection. Many countries currently don’t consider AI-generated artworks to apply to copyright protection requirements because they do not result from human creativity. However, what if such artworks entail substantial human involvement? In this case, they could be eligible for copyright protection, but it is not so simple to determine who should be the owner. There are three different possibilities: 

AI itself is the creator of the work, in which case the AI owner would have the copyright. 
AI model’s human programmer is the creator, in which case the programmer would be the copyright owner. 
Humans who prepared the AI model’s training data are the creators and copyright owners.

Data privacy violations concerns for Gen AI 
In April 2023, the Italian Data Protection Authority temporarily blocked ChatGPT in the country because of privacy violation concerns. Even though the tool has been restored in Italy after a month, those concerns remain valid, and experts worldwide are still examining the question. 
What privacy concerns does ChatGPT pose? 
Generative AI large language models are trained on data sets that sometimes include personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals. Read the article- Generative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns.
Compared to traditional search engines, this data can be elicited more simply while at the same time being more difficult to locate and request removal. To comply with privacy laws, companies building and training the models must ensure that PII isn’t embedded in the language models and that it’s easy to remove it upon request.

Is Generative AI going to steal our jobs? 
This is perhaps the most asked question since the advent of automation and Artificial Intelligence, and the fear has grown exponentially bigger with the boom of Generative AI trends in the last year. The ethics of human replacement by algorithms and machines is a topic that must be discussed if we want to ensure the sustainable and positive development of these advanced technologies. 
Responses to the issue of unemployment from AI have ranged from the alarmed to the optimistic. What is clear is that the effect of Artificial Intelligence on the market will be disruptive and require huge abilities to adapt. Companies and professionals need to be ready to not be made superfluous and obsolete by the upcoming AI revolution. 
Why it’s important to discuss ethical concerns regarding Generative AI right now? 
Gen AI is an extremely powerful tool able to transform your business, optimize costs and increase efficiency in the workplace. To avoid being left behind and be able to thrive in an ever-changing environment, businesses need to leverage generative AI solutions, invest in new technologies and take the leap towards digitalization. 
But Gen AI also poses major ethical concerns and risks regarding privacy, copyright, and human replacement. Those risks require a comprehensive approach, including a clearly defined strategy, good governance, and a commitment to responsible AI. Generative AI shouldn’t be seen as a threat to human creativity or a competitor but instead as a powerful ally to open up possibilities that weren’t even considered possible. 
Generative AI FAQs


What is Generative AI, and how does it relate to human creativity? 
Gen AI is a type of Machine Learning able to produce human-like content. It is extremely valuable in creative industries, as it can support artists in generating texts, images, music, video, and other media. 



What are the key ethical concerns surrounding Gen AI in the context of creativity? 
The key ethical concerns surrounding Generative AI in creative fields are mainly related to intellectual property rights, ownership, and privacy. There is also a major concern about the possibility that the use of Generative AI in creativity could lead to the loss of jobs for human creators and the devaluation of their skills and expertise.

Is Generative AI genuinely creative or mimicking human creativity? 
According to MIT Technology Review, Generative AI is becoming better and better at mimicking human creativity, but this does not necessarily indicate that it is actually developing this ability, which seems to remain uniquely human for the present moment. To quote Ryan Burnell, senior research associate at the Alan Turing Institute: 
“Proving that machines can perform well in tasks designed for measuring creativity in humans doesn’t demonstrate that they’re capable of anything approaching original thought.” 

How does Generative AI affect creative job markets? 
It is unclear what kind of impact Gen AI will have on the creative industries and the creative job markets. Machines shouldn’t be seen as a threat stealing humans’ jobs but rather as a powerful ally able to enhance human creativity and support artists in their work. 

What are the pros and cons of using Generative AI in creative fields? 
The main pros are: 

Efficiency: Gen AI is much faster than humans, creating artwork in a couple of seconds or minutes. 
Versatility: Gen AI can range across all kinds of media (audio, image, text, video, 3D). 


Cost-effectiveness: Using generative AI can be cost-effective as it reduces the need for hiring additional staff or freelancers for creative projects. 

Cons of using Generative AI in creative fields are: 

Limited creativity: Generative AI mimics human creativity, but it is limited by the data used for its training. 
Lack of human touch: Gen AI lacks the empathy and sensitivity of humans, which may result in weaker art. 
Ethical concerns: all the ethical issues we have explored in this article are risks companies should be aware of when employing Gen AI.

Faculty members have been slower than students to adopt artificial intelligence tools in the last year, despite the buzz across academia about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, according to a new report released today.
Nearly half of college students are using AI tools this fall, but fewer than a quarter (22 percent) of faculty members use them, the report from Tyton Partners finds. The study, sponsored by Turnitin, was conducted in September and included roughly 1,600 students and 1,000 faculty members across more than 600 institutions. 
On AI, “students seem to be more curious about it than instructors, and those using it daily are using it in and out of schools; that made us think it might be ubiquitous moving forward,” said Cathy Shaw, a director at Tyton. “The differential between student use and instructor use will be one to watch.”

Faculty members who are familiar with AI acknowledge the importance of the technology: 75 percent of those regular AI users said they believe students will need to know how to use generative AI in a professional setting in order to succeed.
Despite that, the faculty is taking its time with both adoption and setting policy, the report found.
“I read it less as, ‘I’m resistant, this isn’t my job,’ and I interpret it as, ‘I’m still learning how to use the tool,’” Shaw said.











Generative AI was just inching into academic conversations following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Tyton, an advising firm focused on the “global knowledge sector,” initially polled faculty and students about the technology in March. The study released today provides an update on the fast-changing landscape of AI in academia. Tyton plans to release another update on generative AI usage in spring 2024.
Student and Faculty AI Use
Generative AI use, however low, increased by both students and faculty over the last year, the study found. This spring, just 9 percent of faculty members used AI writing tools, but by this fall that had risen to 22 percent.
Students had a higher adoption rate from the start, and that has increased over time. In spring 2023, 27 percent of students were using AI writing tools, and by the fall, that had jumped to 49 percent. The study defined “adoption” as daily, weekly or monthly usage of generative AI products.











For students, the applications for generative AI writing tools varied depending on how often they used the technology. Daily users’ top use of AI was summarizing or paraphrasing text, followed by organizing their schedule and answering homework questions. For nondaily users (using it weekly or monthly), the top use was understanding difficult concepts, followed by summarizing or paraphrasing text and assisting with writing assignments.
For the faculty members who do use AI, the top use (43 percent) was running prompts through an AI tool to “see” what their students see, with faculty assuming students are running their own prompts. More than a third (35 percent) of faculty members use the tools to teach students how to effectively use generative AI writing tools, and nearly one-third (29 percent) are using the tools to create more engaging, in-class activities.
While other experts have called for policies, or, at the very least, AI advisory boards, to set standards, the study found that students would keep using ChatGPT or other generative AI tools even if they were banned.



According to the study, the majority of students that identify as AI “users” (75 percent) said if their instructor or institution banned generative AI writing tools, they would be at least “somewhat likely” to continue using the tools. Half of students that were “non-users” also stated they would be somewhat likely to use the AI tools if they were banned.
Impact on the Workforce
The disconnect of faculty members believing AI will be important in the job market, while they themselves rarely use it in the classroom, was a standout finding of the report, according to Shaw. She said that next year, the spring study will most likely seek further details on why the faculty is hesitant to adopt generative AI writing tools.
The October report found that 75 percent of faculty members who use AI regularly say they believe students will need to know how to use the technology in a professional setting to succeed in the workforce. Nearly half of faculty members who are “non-regular” AI users, meaning they’ve only experimented with generative AI once or twice, reported a similar belief.
Students had less enthusiasm on AI’s impact at work. The study found that roughly one-third of “non-user” students believe they will need to know how to use the tools to succeed. More than half of students (55 percent) who use generative AI at least monthly believe they will need to know how to use these tools in future workplaces.
“There’s a popular quote: ‘It’s not AI that will take my job, it’s someone who knows how to use AI,’” Shaw said.
Attitudes and Policies
Initial faculty attitudes on the impact of generative AI on work and academic performance have become more positive over the last six months. In the spring of 2023, half of faculty members said they believed generative AI writing tools would have a negative impact on student learning, with that number dropping to 39 percent in fall 2023.
Student opinions on AI’s impact on learning remained largely the same from the spring to this fall. About 26 percent of students said generative AI would have a negative impact on learning, up from 22 percent in the spring.
Despite the increased use among faculty and students, institutions varied on implementing systemwide policies.



About a third (32 percent) of private, four-year institutions rely on instructors to set their own policy, although more than a quarter (26 percent) have institutionwide policies. Public four-year institutions are split on policies: 28 percent say policies at the institution have been set, 25 percent say they do not know if there are any policies and 21 percent said no policies were made at their institution.
Meanwhile, public two-year institutions have the lowest rate of policy adoption: 52 percent said they do not have a policy or do not know if they have a policy.
“It’s concerning, especially since community college is all about access and equity and often preparing students for work,” Shaw said. “[Policy] needs to be more front and center, which is where institution leaders and technology providers can have an opportunity to be the bridge.”

In November 2022, OpenAI grabbed headlines by releasing ChatGPT, and “generative AI” became a term used in households around the world. According to Open AI CEO Sam Altman, “A lot of people working on AI pretend that it’s only going to be good; it’s only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced.” But, he adds, “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.” Two major labor strikes this year, by the Writers Guild of America and the actors union (SAG-AFTRA), have helped focus attention on the threat AI poses to well-paid jobs.
Artificial Intelligence is poised to upend work around the world over the coming decades. Whether this lessens or increases inequality remains to be seen. AI technology is relatively new, but the impacts of previous high-impact innovations like the power loom, steam engines, electricity, and digital computers shed ample light on what could happen next. The consequences of any technology depend on who gets to make pivotal decisions about how the technology develops. This is doubly true for AI, because these new tools can be developed for many different types of activities, with the potential to spread rapidly in every sector of the economy and in every aspect of our lives.






Making Tech Work for Workers 


This in-depth article series, sponsored by the Ford Foundation, explores the harms of the digital economy and asks workers, organizers, technologists, economists, and funders: How can we collectively build a future of work that is just, equitable, and sustainable for all?

Too many commentators see the path of technology as inevitable. But the historical record is clear: technologies develop according to the vision and choices of those in positions of power. As we document in Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle over Technology and Prosperity, when these choices are left entirely in the hands of a small elite, you should expect that group to receive most of the benefits, while everyone else bears the costs—potentially for a long time.
Rapid advances in AI threaten to eliminate many jobs, and not just those of writers and actors. Jobs with routine elements, such as in regulatory compliance or clerical work, and those that involve simple data collection, data summary, and writing tasks are likely to disappear.
But there are still two distinct paths that this AI revolution could take. One is the path of automation, based on the idea that AI’s role is to perform tasks as well as or better than people. Currently, this vision dominates in the US tech sector, where Microsoft and Google (and their ecosystems) are cranking hard to create new AI applications that can take over as many human tasks as possible.
The negative impact on people along the “just automate” path is easy to predict from prior waves of digital technologies and robotics. It was these earlier forms of automation that contributed to the decline of American manufacturing employment and the huge
increase in inequality over the last four decades. If AI intensifies automation, we are very likely to get more of the same—a gap
between capital and labor, more inequality between the professional class and the rest of the workers, and fewer good jobs in the economy.
There is a second, very different path available to us, however. This path would focus on creating new tasks and capabilities for humans, rather than sidelining them. This too is not new in history. The augmentation of human capabilities, by creating new tasks and providing better tools and information for workers, was the bedrock of wage growth and shared prosperity during the decades that followed World War II.
In principle, AI could magnify the possibilities for human-complementary technological change. It could enable the development of a wide array of tools that provide better information to human decision-makers. Critically, this need not be limited to office workers and professionals. Much of the workforce today, from blue-collar workers in factories to electricians, plumbers, educators, and health care providers, depends on problem-solving and real-time decision-making. With better context-specific information, these workers could become more productive in the tasks they are performing and venture into new, more complex tasks.
Alas, this more hopeful path is not where we are heading. Three big social changes would be necessary for such a path, and each one of them is a tall order.
First, management needs to see and understand workers as a key resource whose productivity should be augmented, whose information should be improved, and whose training should be a priority. But the dominant perspective in most C-suites views
labor as a cost to be cut, either to withstand competition or to better remunerate shareholders. What gets lost in the rush to reengineer the corporation with fewer workers is the long-term health of the companies, which never achieve the promised productivity gains from so-so automation and offshoring. Companies must recognize that, in reality, labor is a critical resource for productivity growth.
Second, the tech sector needs to prioritize helping workers, rather than focusing on tools of automation and surveillance. The industry’s vision has too long been shaped by an ill-advised quest for artificial general intelligence and autonomous machine intelligence, and many technologists are still preoccupied by showing how their algorithms can reach “human parity.” In practice, that means automating as many tasks as possible.
Third, labor needs to have a voice in how technologies are used. This voice is critical not only for resisting excessive emphasis on labor cost-cutting and automation. It is also essential because workers typically know which parts of their jobs would benefit from automation and which would not. They recognize which tasks could be made more efficient, freeing them to spend time on more productive activities, or even creating new opportunities for increased productivity. Increased worker buy-in reduces businesses’ incentives for further intensification of worker monitoring and surveillance. It also ensures that any productivity gains are shared more fairly between capital and labor.
These three social changes are possible, even if very unlikely to happen without a coordinated effort. 
There is much greater pushback against the “shareholder values revolution”—which elevated cost-cutting and the interests of shareholders at the expense of workers—than at any other time over the last four decades. A new philosophy prioritizing long-term productivity growth may yet emerge, which management and workers can work together to achieve.
The tech sector can change, too. It was always an aberration that arguably the most powerful industry in the US (and the world) would ignore all social responsibility and elevate the virtues of “disruption” with an almost religious zeal. In its next, more mature phase, the industry could focus on providing better tools for workers and augmenting human capabilities, rather than replacing them wholesale.
And labor can become better organized and better focused on charting a new course for involvement in the production process during the age of AI, which will also enhance productivity. In fact, pro-union sentiment is higher
than we’ve seen in decades, and the WGA strike has set an example of how focusing on technology—who controls it and how it will be used—could become central to contract
negotiations in other industries.
It is crucial, however, that the renewed energy of organized labor is channeled in the right way. Labor cannot hope to ask for and obtain high wages unless technology moves in a more pro-worker direction. Nor can one reasonably expect that opposing new technologies, including AI, will be a viable option for the union movement. Rather, leaders and rank-and-file workers alike must understand the potential of new tools, including artificial intelligence, and articulate a vision for how these technologies can be used in a way that helps both labor and corporations. Making workers more productive in their decision-making and problem-solving tasks is the bedrock of such an approach.
None of this will happen automatically. Any meaningful change must start with a recognition of the problem—technology is heading in an anti-labor direction. People promoting change must also recognize the feasibility and desirability of a pro-worker direction for technological change.
Neither the tech industry nor other large corporations will undertake a huge course correction without strong pressure from others in society. In addition to robust labor voices, government regulation and civil society organizations have previously played a critical role in pushing companies in the right direction. This role is even more important today when we need a fundamental redirection of AI technology.
The government should adopt a set of complementary policies encouraging a better path for technology use and development, as we detail in a recent policy memo (jointly written with our MIT colleague David Autor, through the new MIT Shaping the Future of Work Initiative that we collectively co-direct) entitled “Can We Have Pro-Worker AI?”
Lawmakers should revise the federal tax code to equalize the tax burden across labor and machines, so companies are encouraged to hire, train, and retain human workers. Regulatory agencies should also find ways to include and amplify worker voice on how AI and other technology is used in the workplace—including regulating AI-assisted personnel management and placing safeguards around workplace surveillance.
The public sector should invest in research that prioritizes human-complementary AI technology and create a federal government consultative AI center of expertise to support lawmakers and officials who need to understand this technology. We should use this federal expertise to assess whether specific AI technologies live up to their promise to augment human work before they are rolled out in any publicly funded programs such as education or health care.
There is much to be alarmed about when it comes to AI. But if AI brings a dystopian future, it will not be because this was the only path available to us. It will be because we failed to grasp how this technology could be developed and used, and how it could help workers, rather than just replacing them. Understanding this is a first step toward the right type of AI revolution.

Sarah AyoubSun 22 Oct 2023 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 22 Oct 2023 18.55 EDTShare3434When Anisa* graduated from her second degree, she felt “fairly confident” that her postgraduate studies, double-major undergraduate degree and years spent balancing two volunteering roles and a part-time job would account for something in the job market.She applied to every entry-level or junior role she could find in her industry, tracking each application’s outcome on a spreadsheet. Before she knew it, “applying for jobs became a full-time job”: in total, she applied for, and was rejected from, 350 jobs before finally landing one 18 months later. And she believes that AI – in particular its use in screening applications – is a huge part of the reason.Artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT to be allowed in Australian schools from 2024Read more“The rise of third party, AI-run digital online forms are a huge pain point for so many jobseekers,” Anisa says as she recalls uploading CVs alongside filling in digital forms.“I can count on one hand how many personalised interview processes I had where there was a face I could put to it.”Although the uptake of AI in the recruitment space in Australia is fairly new, it is not uncommon. The elements of the hiring process that were once the domain of human beings – resume screening and preliminary interviews – are increasingly being outsourced to AI, with researchers estimating that there are now more than 250 commercial AI recruitment tools being used in Australia. As of last year, one in three Australian organisations reported that they had utilised AI tools while filling positions, though some researchers have deemed this a “high-risk” activity.

John Shields, professor of human resource management and organisational studies at the University of Sydney Business School, says increasing use of AI in the recruitment sector is not necessarily a bad thing.He believes that it’s all about “quickly and effectively managing huge bodies of information on candidates” and achieving “a strong alignment between individual and organisation, or individual and job”, mitigating the issues and cost of a mis-hire.According to Sue Williamson, associate professor of human resources management at UNSW, employers are turning to AI because the typical, traditional recruiting process – application, interview, work test, referee contact – is “outdated, onerous and time-consuming” and does not always result in the best person for a job.View image in fullscreenJobseekers are increasingly being interviewed on video by AI. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images“Managers are increasingly time-poor and looking for ways to shorten the recruitment process,” she says. “They may be turning to AI to help streamline the administrative processes or to assist in vetting potential candidates, for example, by ‘assessing’ resumes or providing candidates with work tests. Video resumes are also becoming increasingly popular and these can also be assessed by AI.”But it’s a sore point for many jobseekers, raising issues around fairness and merit. Recent research has revealed that AI-assessed job applications reinforce biases against women and cultural minorities. In Australia, the Merit Protection Commissioner issued new guidance for employers in the public sector after overturning 11 promotional decisions made by Services Australia in the 2021-22 financial year because they were made using AI-assisted and automated selection techniques  that involved no human review, leading to “meritorious applicants missing out on promotions”.“A lot of research has been conducted about biases in recruitment and selection, with one of the most well-known being that of Amazon, where programmers loaded up the AI [resume screening tool] with resumes from men,” Williamson says. “The AI then preferenced future resumes from men, disadvantaging women. Studies have also shown that candidates with non-western names, including Arabic and Asian names, also receive far fewer invitations for interview than candidates with western names.”‘Job search depression’Amplifying candidate concern is the lack of transparency around the recruitment process – or specifically, how they will be reviewed. Williamson says that Australia does not have specific laws that require candidates be informed about AI screening processes.“This is potentially problematic as it may lead to indirect discrimination against groups of jobseekers,” she says. “Requiring candidates to undertake online tasks as part of recruitment [for example] may disadvantage those with limited manual dexterity.”Candidate-recorded interview is going to be an increasingly important part of a filtered process John ShieldsAnisa cites the time spent on various tasks, the lack of feedback to applications and the emotional and physical toll of such a repetitive process, which often culminated in what she calls “brutal” rejections, as a source of frustration and resentment.“[The process] was stressful, disheartening and draining in the searching and the applying, the numerous interview stages and [consecutive] rejections and then the hundreds of times I was simply ghosted,” she says.With the average job search taking around five months, that resentment can also lead to “job search depression” which experts warn can manifest in increased procrastination, maladaptive coping (such as increased drinking, sleeping or disordered eating) and prolonged anxiety.Lisa*, who has been in her industry for 15 years, applied for the same job at a different employer and found herself being interviewed on video by AI. She would be asked a question, given 60 seconds to respond and then recorded as she answered it. Frank*, a data analyst, remembers how “nerve-wracking” it was having to answer a 100-question “psych-test” before taking up his current role. It’s since turned him off any tasks employers expect of candidates at the first instance.“I think the first point of call should always be a face-to-face interview to get to know a candidate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It felt really impersonal and I didn’t meet or speak to anyone – even through a phone call – before I got a generic rejection email. For another role we were given problem-solving maths questions, working out [the] cost of services after inflation, and a final open question about how much money you’d need to live the rest of your life comfortably without working.”View image in fullscreen‘I think the first point of call should always be a face-to-face interview to get to know a candidate,’ says jobseeker Frank. Photograph: Aleksandr Davydov/Alamy‘Biases and unfairness’But Shields says that cognitive abilities tests are nothing new.“No [candidate] can succeed unless they are quite literate or quite numerate so we have to be careful not to say that these things are the phenomenon of the age of the robot,” he says.“What is new is the use of candidate-generated online videos where the responses are then analysed by AI to profile candidates and to rank them in terms of qualities or attributes that the AI platform is analogically programmed to identify as desirable or undesirable. Candidate-recorded interview is going to be an increasingly important part of a filtered process before a candidate gets close to a face-to-face or panel interview.”Anisa has described the rejections during her job search as brutal; Lisa* says the situation is insane because the process should be two-sided.AI is not a one-time bomb, but a slow burn of devastation that is consuming jobs and culturePeter LewisRead more“Initial interviews are vital in understanding more about the business and how you see yourself working there,” she says. “It feels egotistical of [a] business to think that a interview should be one-sided.”But Shields says the technology can be effective for both employees (in aligning them for the right job) and employers (getting the most suitable candidate) if it is used properly.“If the programming that determines the recommendations of the AI platform is itself biased, it’s garbage in, garbage out,” he explains. “There’s got to be close attention paid to [ensure] analogic rules for AI platforms are literally written to iron out biases and unfairness.”So what’s a jobseeker to do?Stick to employer expectations and be clear about their strengths when applying for jobs, Shields says, recommending resumes are concise, precise and accurate, “and more importantly the covering letter needs to be forensically focused on the selection criteria”.He also warns jobseekers to be careful of their online footprint. “If you’re serious about getting that job, do not have anything in your media profile that might raise questions about your integrity, behaviour, your political views,” he says.*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job huntingWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveSecret Service director resigns after assassination attempt at Trump rally – liveBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in face",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the public release in November 2022 of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s large language-based chatbot, the number of people who have experimented with generative AI has grown rapidly. In its first five days the platform had more than one million users. Insider Intelligence, the research and insights provider, forecasts that by the end of 2023, 25 per cent of internet users in the US, nearly 80mn people, will deploy generative AI at least monthly, up from 8 per cent at the end of 2022. It says that proportion will rise to 33 per cent in 2024. Most people will experiment with AI in the office, Insider Intelligence says. Unlike many new technologies more users are aged 55 to 64 than aged 12 to 17 as usage is concentrated in the workplace. The AI phenomenon is not limited to America. A Salesforce survey of 4,000 people in the US, UK, Australia and India found that half of them had used generative AI. India was the leader with nearly three-quarters of respondents having tried the technology. Since the public release, the functionality of generative AI models has improved. Their understanding, reproduction of natural language and accuracy are all better. Tech for Growth Forum💾 View and download the entire reportChristian Ward, the chief data officer of Yext, the digital experience platform, says the fact that generative AI can understand human language has helped. He says that when internet search evolved, users learnt to “speak keywords . . . bending their behaviour to computers”. With generative AI people no longer have to be tech-savvy despite its advanced technology. AI is “human-savvy” and allows us to communicate with it naturally, making it more accessible. “It used to be that computer-savvy humans had an advantage,” Ward says. “Now that computers are human-savvy, that advantage is being democratised. That is absolutely one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in technology in a very long time.” He adds that once search functions reach the point where we use them by speaking to them as if they are human, “that construct [opens up] in a way we’ve not experienced before”.Commercial potentialMichael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at Oxford university, calls 2023 a “watershed year” for generative AI. He says the technology will be as transformative as the microprocessor, which made possible the personal computer, the web and smartphones.

Estimates of the value it could add to the global economy vary from the 7 per cent of gross domestic product ($7tn) over 10 years predicted by Joseph Briggs, a Goldman Sachs economist to the $2.6tn to $4.4tn a year forecast by McKinsey’s (as a comparison UK GDP in 2022 was $2.7tn). Banking, life sciences and high tech could be the sectors that experience the greatest gains. Marketing, sales and customer experience will all be profoundly affected. AI’s use of natural language means that its large language-based versions are especially well suited to creative endeavours. Today’s tools can help to produce text, audio, video, music, code, images and design. For instance, based on models that draw on troves of online data, generative AI has sufficient grasp of the variety of directions in which a sentence can go that it appears to be able to create entirely original work an infinite number of times. Besides the written word, generative AI will create images from textual descriptions. These are more realistic than thought possible and can even incorporate 3D perspective and shadows. In audio and music the potential for new work that features existing artists — without their involvement — is well documented. AI-generated output has led to copyright concerns but then, given allegations of plagiarism especially in the music industry, there is doubt that humans create original work every time.Arguably the applications for generative AI are greater in the creative field than in science (think research and engineering) where accuracy and reliability are more critical. This upends the expectation of a few years ago when machines were slated to add most value in heavy or rote tasks. It had been predicted that they would augment humans’ physical capabilities or analyse data at greater speeds than we could ever process. Creativity was expected to remain the preserve of humans: some people said it was the defining essence of what it meant to be human. With its unexpected creative capability, generative AI can take on jobs once considered untouchable by technology. Goldman Sachs estimates that a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe could be automated by generative AI. At the upper end of its potential, more than 40 per cent of tasks in administration and the legal profession could be automated. This compares with less than one-tenth of tasks in physically intensive professions such as construction and maintenance. What is generative AI?Generative AI is a set of algorithms based on foundation models, a term that the Stanford Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence says “underlines their critically central yet incomplete character”. Such models are “trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks”. The data behind generative AI programs such as ChatGPT and Google Bard are sourced from across the internet. It is a huge set of training information. One example is Dall·E 2, the text to image generator from OpenAI, which was trained on 650 million images.A White House white paper gives this summary: “The power of AI comes from its use of machine learning, a branch of computational statistics that focuses on designing algorithms that can automatically and iteratively build analytical models from new data without explicitly programming the solution. It is a tool of prediction in the statistical sense, taking information you have and using it to fill in information you do not have.”What can it do? Based on the training data, generative AI can “create” content by autocompletion based on predictive sequencing or probability. In the same way that it uses likely word sequences to build sentences, generative AI employs pattern recognition and reproduction to create images, video and audio. In the case of image generation, given a text description it predicts the most relevant image. It can also summarise and answer questions about data, including text.How can it be adapted? By augmenting the training data with narrower or specialised inputs, generative AI can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. It can create marketing content in a given style or be adapted to suit an individual recipient. It can collate swaths of information and distil these into recommendations based on a specific input, for instance travel itineraries or consumer products. It can analyse data and come up with novel conclusions.What can it not do? AI cannot reason — and due to its “autocomplete” nature, users can never be sure of its factuality. It is a statistical beast and not a database. Ward says: “[The models] are just piecing words together and then using statistics to pick the next words off of that string — but it really depends on what you ask it, how you phrase it and that changes the outcome.” Ask how British company Dyson is dealing with the space vacuum — or even what time a particular shop opens — and there is a high chance that, in its current state, you will receive a confident but nonsense answer unsupported by facts.How does AI work: an easy to understand explanation Who is in the field?In its analysis of the generative AI market, Acumen Research and Consulting lists D-ID, Genie AI and Rephrase.ai among the leading players, together with more recognisable names such as Amazon Web Services, Adobe, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Besides these heavyweights, applications have mushroomed to serve specific industries such as marketing or to perfect functions including video or audio generation. In the chatbot arena ChatGPT and Bing Chat, both based on OpenAI’s large language models, compete with Google Bard. Although the technology is relatively new it has spawned lots of applications in the creative industries. For instance there are tools to supercharge communications and marketing. These include Jasper and Signum.ai, which itself provides a list of other players such as Phrasee and Clarifai. CB Insights has listed more than 360 companies that specialise in generative AI and that number will only grow. The market intelligence provider says that in the first half of 2023 investment into generative AI start-ups went up 5-fold, from the $2.5bn invested for all of 2022 to $14bn. Even excluding the $10bn raised by OpenAI, the inflows are still considerable, as is the start-up activity. Conviction, a new AI venture capital firm, received more than 1,000 applications for 13 places on Embed, its start-up accelerator programme that began in early September.Get with the strategyEven though it is early days for generative AI, BCG, the consulting group, believes that “to be an industry leader in five years, you need a clear and compelling generative AI strategy today”. This is no exaggeration. Already, there are universal corporate functions, for instance knowledge-sharing, communications and recruitment, that can be enhanced and made more efficient with generative AI. As the use of generic tools becomes more common, the way to keep a competitive advantage will be to develop specialised, in-house tools trained on significant quantities of proprietary data. Deloitte says that data-rich industries will integrate AI faster than those that rely on judgment. It says companies that build vertical-use cases and industry solutions will be able to add more value than those using general purpose models. As with platform models, such solutions could either be deployed in-house or provide new revenue streams from external licensing. All that said, ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School, London, said in the FT report on supply chains that companies should first identify the problem or goal to which a technology is suited rather than adopt a technology then look for a use. With generative AI, Gartner advises that “end users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve”. The risk is that the necessity for human validation can offset any efficiencies gained.Modify or build?There is no straightforward answer to the question “modify or build?”. Tweaking the general model to create a niche application is at least not too costly. According to BCG, fine-tuning (providing a curated data set on top of the original training data) can be cost effective. The consultancy highlights a 2022 experiment in which Snorkel AI spent less than $8,000 to fine-tune a large language model to complete a legal classification. Designing questions to extract relevant information, a technique known as prompt engineering, is another way to refine outputs.Wooldridge stresses that while there is “a huge range of opportunities” in fine-tuning, it comes with “one big caveat: you have got no clue what data went into that”. An organisation cannot be certain that an off-the-shelf model reflects its values. Wooldridge says: “You ought to be very concerned about the data this thing has been fed on . . . it will have absorbed the whole of Reddit and the whole of Twitter and every toxic and vile opinion out there . . . so it’s not a complete solution, being able to fine-tune things.” An alternative to fine-tuning is to build a model based on proprietary data that is stored on-site. This can be more secure and flexible but Ward advises against it. The requirements for clean and legally compliant data that feed such a model are huge, he says. The data, resources and time needed make it an expensive endeavour, too. BCG estimates that costs could run into millions of dollars.Whatever the approach, companies have to be certain that any valuable proprietary data is protected and secure as well as clean and legally obtained. When it comes to output, Ward and Wooldridge agree that human oversight is essential.Generative AI is already producing a greater volume of more varied output than humans can achieve alone. Because of the risk of errors, however, human oversight and quality control are essential.Use cases• Consumer facingMarketing content and strategiesAmplifying or creating marketing content and strategies can work well where experimentation (or even AI hallucinations) is a creative bonus and where accuracy is not critical. Through fine-tuning based on a company’s content, marketing materials can be generated at scale in a tone that maintains brand and message consistency. These can also be easily translated into numerous languages. Such communications can be personalised by using customer data. Content can be text, image or video based.Strategies can be tested and tweaked for optimisation based on engagement and conversion data. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30 per cent of large corporations’ marketing messages will be generated by AI.Customer service and supportAI can provide chatbot responses to customer queries in natural language. Human interaction can come later for more complex queries. AI can also help with retrieval of client data and internal enterprise knowledge, both to anticipate queries and customise responses. Film and videoSarah Guo, the founder of Conviction, believes that video content is a noteworthy growth opportunity. “High quality video at lower cost means there will be more of it,” she says. “Any story you want to publish you could have it described by an avatar and in any language.” The cheapness and ease with which video can be created from text prompts will facilitate the creation of short films for anything from advertising to internal information dissemination. On the big screen, Gartner predicts that by 2030 we will see a blockbuster film that is 90 per cent created by AI.TeachingAI is excellent at explaining things. It will produce different iterations to find an answer that resonates most with a learner. It can then create personalised lesson plans to match the learner’s style as well as help with broader course design. Duolingo, the language learning app, uses AI to create responsive dialogues and explainers that enhance the learning experience.Search functions Searches that use AI can provide comprehensive answers on anything from product comparisons, which increasingly come with references to aid fact checking, to suggestions for travel itineraries and recipes. JournalismAI’s first forays into the creation of news content have been unsuccessful. Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, California, has pointed out the drawbacks of using generative AI for reporting. By ChatGPT’s own admission the technology cannot tell the difference between fact and fiction — it simply makes informed guesses about plausibility. In addition, there is a recency issue: large language models are trained to a cut-off date, so they are unlikely to be able to find current news. If given the facts with which to produce an article, AI could, however, do a credible job at simulating an author.• InternalHype about generative AI generally outruns implementation. Plenty of company managements talk about it but few offer evidence of having used it. Ultimately businesses may gain more value from experimenting with AI internally than in a consumer-facing area. For the early movers the goal is not simply efficiency gains or cost-cutting. A McKinsey survey found that organisations that employ generative AI were more likely to be using it to create new businesses and increase revenue streams. BrainstormingGenerative AI can create numerous suggestions based on limited input. Wooldridge says that in-person brainstorming “is a terribly difficult thing”. He says: “One of the cool things about this technology is it will brainstorm for you. You can feed it some rough drafts of ideas and then keep pressing a button. ‘Give me another idea’ and it maybe gives you 10 ideas, but you have one that grabs your attention.” Particularly in science, where marrying ideas and techniques across disciplines can take a leap of imagination, generative AI is likely to offer new insights.Product designGiven enough prompts, generative AI can design new products or personalise existing ones based on customer data. For example, Under Armour and Nike, the trainer/sneaker makers, have both experimented with AI for design. In time, generative AI may inspire or come up with novel products, processes or services ideas. Writing softwareAI can write a first draft of a code based on natural language prompts (“I’d like software that does this”) or edit and help to find bugs in current software. It can also run and test programs to ensure that they achieve the intended outcome or to optimise code. It is important to have realistic expectations. Wooldridge says: “My experience is that it’s very good writing short, routine programs at the moment”, which is “an awful lot of what programmers do”. He adds, however, that it is far from “superhuman” and that its output needs human oversight.Medical innovationsImportant breakthroughs in medicine are likely to be accelerated by AI. Already the technology can identify candidate molecules for therapies, a technique especially suited to proteins. There is also the potential for it to consider symptoms and find a connection with an illness that has been missed by a human. AI can identify the best candidates for drug trials and accurately match treatments to patients. The first AI-designed drugs are on their way.Internal knowledge banksLarge quantities of textual or numerical data can be collected, collated and summarised using AI, which will also translate the results at speed. Notable applications range from summarising manuals to locating corporate knowledge and creating knowledge repositories. Ward believes knowledge banks could be transformational for company intranets. “Most people that start at new companies, especially in a distributed workforce, don’t know who to reach out to ask for guidance — but this thing will know, based on what it knows about the inside of the company. “I think intranets, which have historically been horrific in terms of usability, are going to skyrocket in use because of this type of access.”Data analysisGiven any set of data, generative AI can create charts and find trends that a human analyst might not think to look for. Presentation creationA variety of AI programs can already put together slides based on a basic text brief and information gleaned from the internet, or from uploads of more complex documents or data.• Sector specificAcademic and research papersStudents’ use of ChatGPT to write university essays has been well documented. The intention is not necessarily malicious. Wooldridge has sympathy with those who simply wish to improve their writing. “We’d all love to read better-written scientific papers [given that] the average standard of scientific paper is dull beyond imagining,” he says.Papers so doctored, however, come with a health warning given the propensity for generative AI to make things up. “We know that this technology hallucinates and gets things wrong and it introduces that possibility. I’d rather have a paper where I was confident that I was listening to what the author said,” Wooldridge added. Legal professionAI can speedily analyse and condense screeds of documents from contracts to case law. As such it is likely to be of great value in the legal profession and it is already deployed by numerous firms. It can help with drafting, standardising and rationalising contracts, performing due diligence, drafting and compliance. In March PwC UK, the professional services group, entered a deal to develop generative AI with OpenAI’s Harvey. In a similar vein non-law firms can use generative AI to create requests for proposals and analyse which contracts and services generate the most revenue. Note though that using AI to create a legal case without checking is generally regarded as a bad idea.  FinanceGenerative AI is already being deployed for financial analysis. Guo mentions a company that has built an app to understand the earnings reports, interviews and stock exchange filings of competitors. By using generative AI “they can grasp a lot of information for their company’s use”, she says.  Guo expects that fund managers will also develop apps to screen for certain criteria in reports and accounts, or to analyse internal research memos and subsequent investment decisions. This would help them to find new companies and replicate previous successes. For internal use, generative AI can extract and summarise information from documents, helping with “non-standardised book-keeping”. • DrawbacksProne to errorsWhile generative AI programs have advanced rapidly and results from ChatGPT4 have already surpassed those from the initial release, the content that large language models are designed to produce is what is statistically probable rather than factually correct. Wooldridge says that while it is a good tool, companies would be “criminally negligent” to let loose AI-generated software code without checking it. “That would be an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do, not because I think it would destroy the world but it might trash your employer’s hard drives,” he says. Reputational risk is also high. McKinsey’s survey finds that the proportion of companies that are aware of this is far higher than that trying to mitigate it.  Public perceptionIpsos data show that consumer distrust is high and rising but this may improve as use of the technology becomes more common. Data from Pew suggest that in industries where exposure is higher, the understanding is greater and anxiety is lower. Research from KPMG shows that the young, the university educated and managers generally hold more positive attitudes towards AI, as do those in emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa, where the benefits are perceived to outweigh the risks. Skills obsolescenceOne side-effect of generative AI’s ease of use is that the skills required to develop technology more generally are likely to change. For instance the demand for quality control and human oversight of AI-generated content will grow, while that for humans who can originate content is likely to fall. The landscape is changing so quickly that even prompt engineers — the programmers who optimise questions to get the best response from foundation models — could soon be obsolete. In addition workers who currently help non-technical people understand computers will be redundant. Generative AI can of course help to devise retraining courses. Critical thinking will be an increasingly valuable tool.IP and copyright concernsThe issue of intellectual property will be increasingly important for “created content”, especially with generative AI being able to write or draw “in the style of”. Authors are ever more vocal about copyright infringement over the use of their works in the training data set. They also fear risks to their livelihood from the artificial generation of works. In September writers including Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and George RR Martin added their names to the list suing OpenAI for unauthorised use of their work. A five-month writers’ strike in Hollywood was resolved in September with a deal which included guidelines on the use of AI.Microsoft has sufficient confidence in its guardrails against any infringement that it has pledged to provide legal protection for users sued for copyright breach.MisuseAs well as the drawbacks above, generative AI has the potential for misuse. Wrongdoers can use it for anything from disinformation at the state level, including creating and spreading deepfakes, to honing phishing scams at an individual level. Actions that used to be limited by money or time are now achievable with generative AI. A UK parliamentary committee on large language models noted that the cost of election tampering had fallen from about $10mn to a few thousand dollars.Cyber and data security is increasingly problematic and Ward cautions that “there can be a lot of issues with letting this thing run around on your data”. Problems range from potential leakage of proprietary information to falling foul of privacy laws.Regulation may be one way to counter some of these aspects. Wooldridge says that even if governments establish some sort of authenticating body to ratify models, any tests they use must be credible, new each time . . . and something the machine will never read on the internet. Allowing Big Tech to self regulate is not a safe solution.What next?With such a new and fast developing technology it is almost impossible to anticipate what comes next. The generation that grows up with generative AI may devise entirely new uses for it, similar to the way in which the digital native generation has reimagined how and what can be sold via channels such as social media and YouTube. One thing is certain though: business managements will need to keep up with developments to know when and how they may be able to use generative AI. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

Since the public release in November 2022 of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s large language-based chatbot, the number of people who have experimented with generative AI has grown rapidly. In its first five days the platform had more than one million users.

Insider Intelligence, the research and insights provider, forecasts that by the end of 2023, 25 per cent of internet users in the US, nearly 80mn people, will deploy generative AI at least monthly, up from 8 per cent at the end of 2022. It says that proportion will rise to 33 per cent in 2024. Most people will experiment with AI in the office, Insider Intelligence says. Unlike many new technologies more users are aged 55 to 64 than aged 12 to 17 as usage is concentrated in the workplace.

The AI phenomenon is not limited to America. A Salesforce survey of 4,000 people in the US, UK, Australia and India found that half of them had used generative AI. India was the leader with nearly three-quarters of respondents having tried the technology. Since the public release, the functionality of generative AI models has improved. Their understanding, reproduction of natural language and accuracy are all better.

Christian Ward, the chief data officer of Yext, the digital experience platform, says the fact that generative AI can understand human language has helped. He says that when internet search evolved, users learnt to “speak keywords . . . bending their behaviour to computers”. With generative AI people no longer have to be tech-savvy despite its advanced technology. AI is “human-savvy” and allows us to communicate with it naturally, making it more accessible.

“It used to be that computer-savvy humans had an advantage,” Ward says. “Now that computers are human-savvy, that advantage is being democratised. That is absolutely one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in technology in a very long time.”

He adds that once search functions reach the point where we use them by speaking to them as if they are human, “that construct [opens up] in a way we’ve not experienced before”.

Commercial potential

Michael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at Oxford university, calls 2023 a “watershed year” for generative AI. He says the technology will be as transformative as the microprocessor, which made possible the personal computer, the web and smartphones. While those took months or years to catch on, the pace of development of generative AI is exceptional and it is hard to envisage its full effect.

Despite the technology’s youth it has already penetrated the commercial sphere. Estimates of the value it could add to the global economy vary from the 7 per cent of gross domestic product ($7tn) over 10 years predicted by Joseph Briggs, a Goldman Sachs economist to the $2.6tn to $4.4tn a year forecast by McKinsey’s (as a comparison UK GDP in 2022 was $2.7tn). Banking, life sciences and high tech could be the sectors that experience the greatest gains. Marketing, sales and customer experience will all be profoundly affected.

AI’s use of natural language means that its large language-based versions are especially well suited to creative endeavours. Today’s tools can help to produce text, audio, video, music, code, images and design. For instance, based on models that draw on troves of online data, generative AI has sufficient grasp of the variety of directions in which a sentence can go that it appears to be able to create entirely original work an infinite number of times.

Besides the written word, generative AI will create images from textual descriptions. These are more realistic than thought possible and can even incorporate 3D perspective and shadows. In audio and music the potential for new work that features existing artists — without their involvement — is well documented. AI-generated output has led to copyright concerns but then, given allegations of plagiarism especially in the music industry, there is doubt that humans create original work every time.

Arguably the applications for generative AI are greater in the creative field than in science (think research and engineering) where accuracy and reliability are more critical. This upends the expectation of a few years ago when machines were slated to add most value in heavy or rote tasks. It had been predicted that they would augment humans’ physical capabilities or analyse data at greater speeds than we could ever process. Creativity was expected to remain the preserve of humans: some people said it was the defining essence of what it meant to be human.

With its unexpected creative capability, generative AI can take on jobs once considered untouchable by technology. Goldman Sachs estimates that a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe could be automated by generative AI. At the upper end of its potential, more than 40 per cent of tasks in administration and the legal profession could be automated. This compares with less than one-tenth of tasks in physically intensive professions such as construction and maintenance.

Who is in the field?

In its analysis of the generative AI market, Acumen Research and Consulting lists D-ID, Genie AI and Rephrase.ai among the leading players, together with more recognisable names such as Amazon Web Services, Adobe, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Besides these heavyweights, applications have mushroomed to serve specific industries such as marketing or to perfect functions including video or audio generation.

In the chatbot arena ChatGPT and Bing Chat, both based on OpenAI’s large language models, compete with Google Bard. Although the technology is relatively new it has spawned lots of applications in the creative industries. For instance there are tools to supercharge communications and marketing. These include Jasper and Signum.ai, which itself provides a list of other players such as Phrasee and Clarifai.

CB Insights has listed more than 360 companies that specialise in generative AI and that number will only grow. The market intelligence provider says that in the first half of 2023 investment into generative AI start-ups went up 5-fold, from the $2.5bn invested for all of 2022 to $14bn. Even excluding the $10bn raised by OpenAI, the inflows are still considerable, as is the start-up activity. Conviction, a new AI venture capital firm, received more than 1,000 applications for 13 places on Embed, its start-up accelerator programme that began in early September.

Get with the strategy

Even though it is early days for generative AI, BCG, the consulting group, believes that “to be an industry leader in five years, you need a clear and compelling generative AI strategy today”.

This is no exaggeration. Already, there are universal corporate functions, for instance knowledge-sharing, communications and recruitment, that can be enhanced and made more efficient with generative AI. As the use of generic tools becomes more common, the way to keep a competitive advantage will be to develop specialised, in-house tools trained on significant quantities of proprietary data.

Deloitte says that data-rich industries will integrate AI faster than those that rely on judgment. It says companies that build vertical-use cases and industry solutions will be able to add more value than those using general purpose models. As with platform models, such solutions could either be deployed in-house or provide new revenue streams from external licensing.

All that said, ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School, London, said in the FT report on supply chains that companies should first identify the problem or goal to which a technology is suited rather than adopt a technology then look for a use. With generative AI, Gartner advises that “end users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve”. The risk is that the necessity for human validation can offset any efficiencies gained.

Modify or build?

There is no straightforward answer to the question “modify or build?”. Tweaking the general model to create a niche application is at least not too costly. According to BCG, fine-tuning (providing a curated data set on top of the original training data) can be cost effective. The consultancy highlights a 2022 experiment in which Snorkel AI spent less than $8,000 to fine-tune a large language model to complete a legal classification. Designing questions to extract relevant information, a technique known as prompt engineering, is another way to refine outputs.

Wooldridge stresses that while there is “a huge range of opportunities” in fine-tuning, it comes with “one big caveat: you have got no clue what data went into that”. An organisation cannot be certain that an off-the-shelf model reflects its values. Wooldridge says: “You ought to be very concerned about the data this thing has been fed on . . . it will have absorbed the whole of Reddit and the whole of Twitter and every toxic and vile opinion out there . . . so it’s not a complete solution, being able to fine-tune things.”

An alternative to fine-tuning is to build a model based on proprietary data that is stored on-site. This can be more secure and flexible but Ward advises against it. The requirements for clean and legally compliant data that feed such a model are huge, he says. The data, resources and time needed make it an expensive endeavour, too. BCG estimates that costs could run into millions of dollars.

Whatever the approach, companies have to be certain that any valuable proprietary data is protected and secure as well as clean and legally obtained. When it comes to output, Ward and Wooldridge agree that human oversight is essential.

Generative AI is already producing a greater volume of more varied output than humans can achieve alone. Because of the risk of errors, however, human oversight and quality control are essential.

• Consumer facing

Amplifying or creating marketing content and strategies can work well where experimentation (or even AI hallucinations) is a creative bonus and where accuracy is not critical.

Through fine-tuning based on a company’s content, marketing materials can be generated at scale in a tone that maintains brand and message consistency. These can also be easily translated into numerous languages. Such communications can be personalised by using customer data. Content can be text, image or video based.

Strategies can be tested and tweaked for optimisation based on engagement and conversion data. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30 per cent of large corporations’ marketing messages will be generated by AI.

AI can provide chatbot responses to customer queries in natural language. Human interaction can come later for more complex queries. AI can also help with retrieval of client data and internal enterprise knowledge, both to anticipate queries and customise responses.

Sarah Guo, the founder of Conviction, believes that video content is a noteworthy growth opportunity. “High quality video at lower cost means there will be more of it,” she says. “Any story you want to publish you could have it described by an avatar and in any language.”

The cheapness and ease with which video can be created from text prompts will facilitate the creation of short films for anything from advertising to internal information dissemination. On the big screen, Gartner predicts that by 2030 we will see a blockbuster film that is 90 per cent created by AI.

AI is excellent at explaining things. It will produce different iterations to find an answer that resonates most with a learner. It can then create personalised lesson plans to match the learner’s style as well as help with broader course design. Duolingo, the language learning app, uses AI to create responsive dialogues and explainers that enhance the learning experience.

Searches that use AI can provide comprehensive answers on anything from product comparisons, which increasingly come with references to aid fact checking, to suggestions for travel itineraries and recipes.

AI’s first forays into the creation of news content have been unsuccessful.

Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, California, has pointed out the drawbacks of using generative AI for reporting.

By ChatGPT’s own admission the technology cannot tell the difference between fact and fiction — it simply makes informed guesses about plausibility. In addition, there is a recency issue: large language models are trained to a cut-off date, so they are unlikely to be able to find current news. If given the facts with which to produce an article, AI could, however, do a credible job at simulating an author.

• Internal

Hype about generative AI generally outruns implementation. Plenty of company managements talk about it but few offer evidence of having used it. Ultimately businesses may gain more value from experimenting with AI internally than in a consumer-facing area.

For the early movers the goal is not simply efficiency gains or cost-cutting. A McKinsey survey found that organisations that employ generative AI were more likely to be using it to create new businesses and increase revenue streams.

Generative AI can create numerous suggestions based on limited input. Wooldridge says that in-person brainstorming “is a terribly difficult thing”.

He says: “One of the cool things about this technology is it will brainstorm for you. You can feed it some rough drafts of ideas and then keep pressing a button. ‘Give me another idea’ and it maybe gives you 10 ideas, but you have one that grabs your attention.”

Particularly in science, where marrying ideas and techniques across disciplines can take a leap of imagination, generative AI is likely to offer new insights.

Given enough prompts, generative AI can design new products or personalise existing ones based on customer data. For example, Under Armour and Nike, the trainer/sneaker makers, have both experimented with AI for design. In time, generative AI may inspire or come up with novel products, processes or services ideas.

AI can write a first draft of a code based on natural language prompts (“I’d like software that does this”) or edit and help to find bugs in current software. It can also run and test programs to ensure that they achieve the intended outcome or to optimise code.

It is important to have realistic expectations. Wooldridge says: “My experience is that it’s very good writing short, routine programs at the moment”, which is “an awful lot of what programmers do”. He adds, however, that it is far from “superhuman” and that its output needs human oversight.

Important breakthroughs in medicine are likely to be accelerated by AI. Already the technology can identify candidate molecules for therapies, a technique especially suited to proteins. There is also the potential for it to consider symptoms and find a connection with an illness that has been missed by a human. AI can identify the best candidates for drug trials and accurately match treatments to patients. The first AI-designed drugs are on their way.

Large quantities of textual or numerical data can be collected, collated and summarised using AI, which will also translate the results at speed. Notable applications range from summarising manuals to locating corporate knowledge and creating knowledge repositories.

Ward believes knowledge banks could be transformational for company intranets. “Most people that start at new companies, especially in a distributed workforce, don’t know who to reach out to ask for guidance — but this thing will know, based on what it knows about the inside of the company.

“I think intranets, which have historically been horrific in terms of usability, are going to skyrocket in use because of this type of access.”

Given any set of data, generative AI can create charts and find trends that a human analyst might not think to look for.

A variety of AI programs can already put together slides based on a basic text brief and information gleaned from the internet, or from uploads of more complex documents or data.

• Sector specific

Students’ use of ChatGPT to write university essays has been well documented. The intention is not necessarily malicious. Wooldridge has sympathy with those who simply wish to improve their writing. “We’d all love to read better-written scientific papers [given that] the average standard of scientific paper is dull beyond imagining,” he says.

Papers so doctored, however, come with a health warning given the propensity for generative AI to make things up. “We know that this technology hallucinates and gets things wrong and it introduces that possibility. I’d rather have a paper where I was confident that I was listening to what the author said,” Wooldridge added.

AI can speedily analyse and condense screeds of documents from contracts to case law. As such it is likely to be of great value in the legal profession and it is already deployed by numerous firms. It can help with drafting, standardising and rationalising contracts, performing due diligence, drafting and compliance.

In March PwC UK, the professional services group, entered a deal to develop generative AI with OpenAI’s Harvey. In a similar vein non-law firms can use generative AI to create requests for proposals and analyse which contracts and services generate the most revenue. Note though that using AI to create a legal case without checking is generally regarded as a bad idea.

Generative AI is already being deployed for financial analysis. Guo mentions a company that has built an app to understand the earnings reports, interviews and stock exchange filings of competitors. By using generative AI “they can grasp a lot of information for their company’s use”, she says.

Guo expects that fund managers will also develop apps to screen for certain criteria in reports and accounts, or to analyse internal research memos and subsequent investment decisions. This would help them to find new companies and replicate previous successes. For internal use, generative AI can extract and summarise information from documents, helping with “non-standardised book-keeping”.

• Drawbacks

While generative AI programs have advanced rapidly and results from ChatGPT4 have already surpassed those from the initial release, the content that large language models are designed to produce is what is statistically probable rather than factually correct.

Wooldridge says that while it is a good tool, companies would be “criminally negligent” to let loose AI-generated software code without checking it. “That would be an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do, not because I think it would destroy the world but it might trash your employer’s hard drives,” he says.

Reputational risk is also high. McKinsey’s survey finds that the proportion of companies that are aware of this is far higher than that trying to mitigate it.

Ipsos data show that consumer distrust is high and rising but this may improve as use of the technology becomes more common. Data from Pew suggest that in industries where exposure is higher, the understanding is greater and anxiety is lower.

Research from KPMG shows that the young, the university educated and managers generally hold more positive attitudes towards AI, as do those in emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China and South Africa, where the benefits are perceived to outweigh the risks.

One side-effect of generative AI’s ease of use is that the skills required to develop technology more generally are likely to change. For instance the demand for quality control and human oversight of AI-generated content will grow, while that for humans who can originate content is likely to fall.

The landscape is changing so quickly that even prompt engineers — the programmers who optimise questions to get the best response from foundation models — could soon be obsolete. In addition workers who currently help non-technical people understand computers will be redundant.

Generative AI can of course help to devise retraining courses. Critical thinking will be an increasingly valuable tool.

The issue of intellectual property will be increasingly important for “created content”, especially with generative AI being able to write or draw “in the style of”.

Authors are ever more vocal about copyright infringement over the use of their works in the training data set. They also fear risks to their livelihood from the artificial generation of works. In September writers including Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and George RR Martin added their names to the list suing OpenAI for unauthorised use of their work. A five-month writers’ strike in Hollywood was resolved in September with a deal which included guidelines on the use of AI.

Microsoft has sufficient confidence in its guardrails against any infringement that it has pledged to provide legal protection for users sued for copyright breach.

As well as the drawbacks above, generative AI has the potential for misuse. Wrongdoers can use it for anything from disinformation at the state level, including creating and spreading deepfakes, to honing phishing scams at an individual level. Actions that used to be limited by money or time are now achievable with generative AI. A UK parliamentary committee on large language models noted that the cost of election tampering had fallen from about $10mn to a few thousand dollars.

Cyber and data security is increasingly problematic and Ward cautions that “there can be a lot of issues with letting this thing run around on your data”. Problems range from potential leakage of proprietary information to falling foul of privacy laws.

Regulation may be one way to counter some of these aspects. Wooldridge says that even if governments establish some sort of authenticating body to ratify models, any tests they use must be credible, new each time . . . and something the machine will never read on the internet. Allowing Big Tech to self regulate is not a safe solution.

With such a new and fast developing technology it is almost impossible to anticipate what comes next. The generation that grows up with generative AI may devise entirely new uses for it, similar to the way in which the digital native generation has reimagined how and what can be sold via channels such as social media and YouTube.

One thing is certain though: business managements will need to keep up with developments to know when and how they may be able to use generative AI.",,,,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financial Times', 'productID': 'ft.com:free'}",,,,,,,3695.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>It presents the findings from a research survey and a series of interviews conducted by the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) on behalf of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).</p>

<h2 id=""use-in-actuarial-work"">Use in actuarial work</h2>

<p>‘The use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in UK actuarial work’ explores the growing importance of AI/ML in actuarial work. It examines how these techniques are being used and where, and what risks are arising from this.</p>

<p>The report was written by GAD actuaries Sam Davies and Chris Paterson, and Senior Analyst Sam Kinshuck, supported by a wider team in GAD.</p>

<p>The research was carried out in the first 6 months of 2023 and first involved an online survey completed by over 100 respondents across different fields. This was followed by more in-depth interviews with 37 interviewees.</p>

<h2 id=""survey-results"">Survey results</h2>

<p>The survey results indicated that the largest area of use of AI/ML techniques in UK actuarial work cover a wide range of applications within General Insurance pricing, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining claims risk for policyholders</li>
  <li>forecasting price-elasticity of demand for policyholder groups</li>
  <li>informing the ‘front-end’ process for customers and policyholders</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as ‘traditional’ actuarial fields of Pensions, General Insurance, Life Insurance and Finance &amp; Investment, the research also showed AI/ML being used by actuaries who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>analyse the impact of public health interventions</li>
  <li>assist pharmaceutical companies with patient profiling</li>
  <li>develop long term economic projections</li>
</ul>

<p>The research indicated that they apply more advanced techniques to more diverse use cases.</p>

<p>Survey results indicated the use of AI/ML techniques in actuarial work was limited but increasing rapidly.</p>

<p>Researchers found that during the 6 months duration of the survey, awareness of ChatGPT (a Large Language Model, or ‘LLM’, developed by OpenAI) grew significantly. Initial responses did not mention it, however from March to June 2023 it was raised by almost all interviewees as a discussion topic.</p>

<p>The survey responses indicated that some organisations were using LLMs in a variety of ways including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping to aid efficiency of some processes</li>
  <li>to assist programming</li>

  <li>summarising large volumes of text</li>
  <li>developing bespoke in-house LLMs to build financial models</li>
</ul>

<p>Sam Davies, one of the report’s authors said: “Our report highlights the established and growing importance of AI/ML in UK actuarial work.</p>

<p>“It presents various risks, but the profession is generally aware of these and well-positioned to implement appropriate mitigations.”</p>

Generative AI: Connecting insight to (inter)action 














Over the past decade, AI has enabled banks to derive insights from vast information troves and the value of analytics has shifted from historical insight to prediction, leading to better decisions.




 

Generative AI is the latest evolution in the AI paradigm shift from automation to intelligence to creation and is bridging the gap between insight and action.
When generative AI systems and large language models (LLMs) can both draw insight from large data sets, as well as understand, interpret, and generate human language, the time and effort required to act on insights is drastically shortened. And with LLMs we can unlock previously impracticable insights and manage the documentation to boot.
With this combination of forward insight and creative capabilities, the financial services sector is ripe for novel innovation, from customer services improvements through to credit risk understanding. A recent report on AI in the finance sector by The Alan Turing Institute found that: “AI has been used only for implementing ‘small benefits' such as cost reduction and process optimisation.” Now with generative AI, we can connect insight to action and even to interaction leading to highly personalised financial advice and much improved customer experience.
One example is compliance with Consumer Duty regulations, which requires lenders to ensure consumer understanding. This can be challenging for automated and self-service processes, but generative AI can help by creating materials for different levels of understanding and language comprehension, improving customer care and connecting analytics to conversational capabilities.
Generative AI has been shown to improve outcomes on a range of high-value tasks, for example producing drafts for internal and external financial reporting, which will save considerable time during month and quarter end. It could also be used to automate activities like reconciliations, journal entries, and financial consolidation. The diagram below from a recent CGI article shows the varying impact of AI tools across many financial services operational areas.

More generally, a recent Harvard study on management consultants showed that support in the form of ChatGPT raised all workers to the top tiers of performance. A Cornell University study on potential labour market impacts, found broad applicability of generative AI to work tasks. Starting off, about 80% of people could do 10% of their tasks better and or faster; but once LLMs are integrated in the tools we use daily, everyone will eventually see half their work tasks supported by AI.
Even though AI has much to contribute, it’s important to understand its shortcomings. Human oversight and collaboration are still essential for ensuring the quality and appropriateness of generated responses, but that work is offset by the efficiencies gained. As Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCunn said: “Large language models are prone to hallucinations, and have no concept of how the world works, no capacity to plan, and no ability to complete tasks.” Financial institutions should also have a clear and well-defined policy for the use of LLMs outlining the risks and benefits of using them, as well as the steps that will be taken to mitigate the risks.
As generative AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see it being used in even more innovative ways. We do however need to acknowledge the current limitations and consider how we could use a multi-model approach to create the most value. Using a mix of AI, financial institutions can gain access to insights to help them take action to better manage risk, optimise operations, and gain operating savings - all while improving both customer and employee experience.

 Today (Oct. 26) the employment site published a report evaluating the jobs most exposed to (or impacted by) generative AI—and how artificial intelligence could change, rather than kill, careers. The report collected over 15 million job postings to evaluate the skills that employers commonly include—more than 2,000 in total—along with which could be performed or assisted by ChatGPT.


Among the findings: Women are marginally more exposed to generative AI than men. Of racial and ethnic groups,  Asian American and Pacific Islanders have the highest exposure to generative AI, while Hispanics  are least exposed. 

That brings up an important distinction: Indeed’s study stresses that race and gender aren’t the main drivers of AI exposure; instead, it’s the occupations that certain demographics tend to be concentrated in that impact these groups. Women are slightly more likely to see AI change their jobs, for example, because they’re more likely to be employed in high-exposure industries like education and administration. And Asian American and Pacific Islanders tend to work in sectors with the highest exposure to generative AI, like mathematics and computer science, as Hispanics are represented in sectors with the least exposure.

There are differences, too, when it comes down to job title or location. Managers have a higher exposure to AI than non-managers, and remote jobs are more exposed than ones on an in-person or hybrid schedule. And in contrast to some narratives, the report posits that jobs that usually require physical skills are least affected by artificial intelligence.

Why generative AI may not be coming for your job

Stahle said the study’s purpose is to see every job where generative AI could possibly be used. Even in physical jobs—say, the warehouse runner or the classroom custodian—might need ChatGPT for email communications. But he’s skeptical that generative AI is coming for any job, even in roles that face automation like grocery store checkouts and driverless cars.


“There are still the human aspects in the jobs that are hard to replicate by Gen AI, or it’s hard to get people to accept and use,” said Stahle. “We’re so early in this Gen AI movement that it’s hard to know what the overall impact would be. That’s why we’re measuring by exposure rather than the nitty-gritty trends.” 

It’s worth adding that only 0.05% of the millions of Indeed job postings this August asked for generative AI skills. 1.7% of the job postings asked for broader technological skills from fields like machine learning or data science. Those are pretty small numbers, Stahle said.

But while the shares remain small, Stale said, it’s worth picking up experience with AI applications like ChatGPT now—because every industry will eventually use them in some way. 

“It’s not likely that people are going to lose their jobs. What is more likely is that people will be displaced by people who have these AI tool skillsets,” said Stahle. “Job seekers of all ages and groups should look to embrace these technologies—it can  unlock the ability to move forward and unleash the potential workers can have.”

But employees who love them are finding ways to discreetly backchannel.,,,"The employees secretly using AI at work24 October 2023ShareAlex ChristianFeatures correspondentShareWoman with green glassesSome employers are either tacitly or outright banning access to generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But employees who love them are finding ways to discreetly backchannel.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, companies have scrambled to keep its workplace use under control.Many organisations are concerned their data will be leaked – not only unintentionally training OpenAI algorithms with sensitive information, but also potentially surfacing corporate secrets to competitors' prompts, says Simon Johnson, head of the global economics and management group at MIT Sloan School of Management, in Massachusetts, US.Yet many workers love the technology, and have come to desire, even depend on it.""These are practical tools that make life easier, such as content aggregation – rather than look through several sources to find an obscure organisational policy, ChatGPT can provide a useful first draft in moments,"" says Bryan Hancock, partner at McKinsey & Co, based in Washington, DC. ""They can also aid with technical tasks, like coding, and complete routine tasks that lighten employees' cognitive load and schedules."" Berlin-based business consultant Matt and his colleague were among the first at their workplace to discover ChatGPT, mere weeks after its release. He says the chatbot transformed their workdays overnight. ""It was like discovering a video game cheat,"" says Matt. ""I asked a really technical question from my PhD thesis, and it provided an answer that no one would be able to find without consulting people with very specific expertise. I knew it would be a game changer.""Day-to-day tasks in his fast-paced environment – such as researching scientific topics, gathering sources and producing thorough presentations to clients – suddenly became a breeze. The only catch: Matt and his colleague had to keep their use of ChatGPT a closely guarded secret. They accessed the tool covertly, mostly on working-from-home days. ""We had a significant competitive advantage against our colleagues – our output was so much faster and they couldn't comprehend how. Our manager was very impressed and spoke about our performance with senior management,"" he says.AlamyWorkers are finding ways to access the technology in secret, whether by simply blocking their screens from view or employing higher-tech solutions (Credit: Alamy)Whether the technology is explicitly banned, highly frowned upon or giving some workers a covert leg up, some employees are searching for ways to keep using generative AI tools discreetly. The technology is increasingly becoming an employee backchannel: in a February 2023 study by professional social network Fishbowl, 68% of 5,067 respondents who used AI at work said they don't disclose usage to their bosses.Even in instances without workplace bans, employees may still want to keep their use of AI hidden, or at least guarded, from peers. ""We don't have norms established around AI yet – it can initially look like you're conceding you're not actually that good at your job if the machine is doing many of your tasks,"" says Johnson. ""It's natural that people would want to conceal that.""As a result, forums are popping up for workers to swap strategies for keeping a low profile. In communities like Reddit, many people seek methods of secretly circumventing workplace bans, either through high-tech solutions (integrating ChatGPT into a native app disguised as a workplace tool) or rudimentary ones to obscure usage (adding a privacy screen, or discreetly accessing the technology on their personal phone at their desk).And an increasing number of workers who've come to depend on AI may have to start looking for ways to avoid attention. According to an August 2023 BlackBerry survey of 2,000 global IT decision makers, 75% are currently considering or implementing bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI applications in the workplace, with 61% saying the measures are intended to be long-term or permanent.While these bans may help companies keep sensitive information out of the wrong hands, Hancock says keeping generative AI away from workers, particularly on a longer-term basis, can backfire. ""AI tools are set to become part of the employee experience, so restricting access to them without providing a vision of when and how they'll be adopted – such as following the introduction of guardrails – could create frustration,"" he says. ""And that could lead to folks thinking of working somewhere with access to the tools they need."" As for Matt, he's found a workaround to keep a step ahead. He and his colleague have begun covertly using the search engine platform Perplexity. Like ChatGPT, it's a generative AI tool that returns complex written answers to basic prompts in an instant. Matt likes Perplexity even more than ChatGPT: it features real-time information and cites sources that can be quickly checked, ideal when his presentations require in-depth, up-to-date knowledge. He queries it hundreds of times a day on his work laptop, often working remotely, and uses it more than Google.He hopes he can keep using his latest AI tool in secret, for as long as possible. For him, it's worth the minor inconvenience of occasionally having to dim his laptop screen in the office – and not sharing resources with his wider team. ""I prefer keeping the competitive advantage,"" he says.Work cultureHow we workFeatures",https://schema.org,,NewsArticle,,['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gm2hff.jpg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alex Christian', 'url': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",The employees secretly using AI at work,2023-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,2023-11-03T16:13:53.475Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

October 25, 2023 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 25, 2023 · 6 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Generative AI is one of the biggest talking points today. It promises to transform how work is done across multiple sectors, and legal work is a particularly rich area of opportunity.  Many firms and legal departments are already switched on to Generative AI, and there is no avoiding it. We spoke to Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute about the potential and pitfalls of the technology, and to separate fact from fiction – including a question about notorious generative AI ‘hallucinations’.  Zach Warren leads technology and innovation content for the Thomson Reuters Institute. Zach has been writing and speaking on tech and innovation for more than a decade, and with Thomson Reuters, charts the future of professional services industries, including legal, tax, and risk & fraud, through writing, podcasts, speaking engagements, and more. Zach was also the lead author of TRI’s Generative AI in the Law Firm Report, among other technology-centric reports. Before coming to Thomson Reuters, Zach was the editor-in-chief of ALM’s Legaltech News and featured on Law.com, The American Lawyer and ALM events such as Legalweek. Jump to:How has Generative AI landed in legal so far? Who should be overseeing the adoption of Generative AI?Can you describe some of the impacts it will have on legal practice?How does the cost of implementing generative AI in law firms compare to other technology investments commonly made in the legal industry?Will things really change for junior legal professionals?Can you explain what Generative AI hallucinations are?How should the legal industry approach Generative AI in the short term? How has Generative AI landed in legal so far? Warren: With surprising enthusiasm. Legal has something of a reputation for slow uptake of tech, which we’ve seen recently with the cautious adoption of cloud and some types of AI. That may be because lawyers and firms have preferred to do things the way they’ve always been done.   But with Generative AI it’s been a different story. Thomson Reuters conducted a survey only a few months after ChatGPT was launched, and it found that firms were already playing around with it. Interestingly, 82% of survey respondents said Generative AI could be used for legal tasks, and 51% said it should be used. However, that’s on a hypothetical level – at the time in April, only 3% had actually adopted Generative AI. And even now, the vast majority of legal professionals are in “wait and see” mode.  Who should be overseeing the adoption of Generative AI? Warren: At the moment it’s primarily CIOs, IT directors, and CTOs who have been tasked to be at the forefront of technology adoption. But Generative AI will be the most transformative tech in legal, so partners and managing partners should be learning more about it now.  In fact, everyone should have a stake in it to some extent, because Generative AI is intended to be democratized – so we will see it being used in everything from onboarding new employees to day-to-day transactional work.  Can you describe some of the impacts it will have on legal practice? Warren: Speed, efficiency, consistency in research, document reviews, and many repetitive tasks are some of the many promised benefits. However, there is uncertainty around who realizes the value of Generative AI. One of the biggest questions for partners will be, ‘What is chargeable now?’ Firms bill in six-minute increments, which requires great transparency – will clients insist firms cut billable hours now that work can be done much faster with Generative AI, or even done by the clients themselves? Going back to the survey I mentioned, 80% of corporate clients actually want their firms to use Generative AI – but they also want firms to add value and skills above and beyond the tech. So, firms will really need to prove the value that they’re providing in this new era, which puts the emphasis on more experienced lawyers.  How does the cost of implementing generative AI in law firms compare to other technology investments commonly made in the legal industry? Warren: It’s a bit higher right now, but that’s for generative AI across the board. Generative AI requires a lot of data to work, which means a lot of processing power to run the searches. There just aren’t enough servers to make generative AI as widespread as the technology deserves right now, but there are a lot of smart people working on that problem.  Will things really change for junior legal professionals? Warren: Absolutely. Manual work like research and document or contract drafting – obvious use cases for Generative AI – is typically the domain of first- and second-year associates. I heard a good quote recently: “All the writing you learn in law school will become editing”.  That’s because Generative AI is so good at producing first drafts. We’re seeing lots of interest in firms and departments hiring prompt engineers – and this is a skill which could soon become part of every new lawyer’s training.   Can you explain what Generative AI hallucinations are? Warren: This is one of the biggest concerns surrounding the technology currently. Hallucinations are basically errors that pop up in the output of Generative AI, presented as fact, and which it can’t recognize as wrong. The reason for this is that Generative AI is not actually “intelligent” – it predicts the next possible word in a sentence, giving the most likely answer based on previous results.  Even OpenAI’s GPT-4 is around 85-90% factually accurate on multiple choice questions – that level of accuracy is obviously not where you want to be in legal. However, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models can take feedback about the accuracy of answers and fold that back in, so things could improve quickly.  How should the legal industry approach Generative AI in the short term? Warren: At the moment, Generative AI – particularly public, open-source tools – is not a good fit beyond general question-and-answer tasks. Firms and departments need to create guidelines around proper usage. And the applications of Generative AI should for now be restricted to internal work, or work where you can afford to be wrong – and someone always needs to check the output. For the immediate future, most usage of Generative AI will be through new features baked into pre-existing tools from trusted technology providers. However, some of the very biggest firms are hiring data scientists and developing their own knowledge models. We’re going to see a hybrid of these approaches, with legal technology vendors keeping in-house data behind a wall but checking it against publicly available datasets. This means the results will be both accurate and up to date.   Zach Warren spoke on a recent webcast in which generative AI and its impact on legal was discussed in even greater detail.

Spiceworks delves into the latest findings from Aberdeen Strategy & Research’s Generative AI study completed in March 2023.
The study delves into opinions on advanced generative AI tools such as ChatGPT broken down across three age groups. 

About 65% of users believe AI tools will replace traditional web search engines as the faster alternative for online search, according to the Aberdeen Generative AI study conducted in March 2023 by Aberdeen Strategy & ResearchOpens a new window .
“In a likely future where more people use chatbots to find answers, there will likely be less of a need to click through to ad-supported websites for more information,” noted Peter Tsai, the head of technology insights at Spiceworks Ziff Davis (Aberdeen is owned by Spiceworks’ parent company Ziff Davis).
“I don’t think anyone will miss wading through half a dozen distracting ads and  autoplay videos while scrolling past someone’s overly SEO-optimized life story just to find a recipe for mac and cheese at the bottom of a long page. Currently, with a chatbot, you simply ask your question, then a recipe and ingredients list comes back within seconds.”
It has been over a year since OpenAI released the text-to-image tool DALL E and more than six months since the AI chatbot, ChatGPT, amazed audiences with quick and accurate responses. The latter, in particular, has taken netizens by storm, garnering over one million users in just five days and over 100 million users in two months of launch. For comparison, TikTok took nine months, Instagram 30 months, and Netflix 10 years.
In fact, 59% of respondents from the Aberdeen study had extensively or casually used generative AI tools as of March 2023. Besides online search, 41% of respondents believe AI tools will help create long-form documents as soon as two years from now, while 58% said generative-AI-based long-form document creation would take five years.
Beyond searches and document creation, AI is also expected in content creation, streamlining business processes, improving customer experience, concocting a symphony or at least a jingle (with MusicLM), graphics and illustrations (with Midjourney), and more.
“There are many intriguing aspects of this technological future that deserve further thought and comment,” noted Christopher D. Manning, a Thomas M. Siebel professor in machine learning at the School of Engineering; professor of linguistics and computer science at Stanford University; director of Stanford AI Lab; and associate director of Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence or Stanford HAI.
“We’re still in the early days of figuring out what new models of normal business practice are and aren’t possible. In nearly all cases, the AI system will help humans to get work done. As such, it continues the story of new technologies and automation making things easier and improving quality of life.”
And if that’s not enough, 74% of power users (i.e., those with advanced computing skills) and 56% of casual users who responded to the Aberdeen Generative AI study believe that the development of advanced AI will be as important as the creation of the internet. Clearly, generative AI tools are a winner, despite technologists calling for a cessation of unchecked development of advanced AI capabilities.
Fei-Fei Li, Sequoia Capital professor in the Computer Science Department; Denning co-director of Stanford HAI, noted, “The progress in a machine’s capability to generate content is very exciting, as is the potential to explore AI’s ability to see what humans are not able. But we need to be attentive to howthese capabilities will disrupt our everyday lives, our communities, and our role as world citizens.”

More than that, corporations are now engaged in a rat race to upend one another to gain a competitive edge. Generative AI can augment operations for some businesses and professions, while some can be automated. For others, generative AI is an existential threat.
While AI’s measurable impact is yet to be gauged on the operations, users and potential customers may not necessarily jump the gun and adopt AI-powered products. According to Aberdeen’s findings, only 20% of respondents are more likely to use an advanced AI-powered product.
On the other hand, unsure or neutral in their likelihood of 21% of respondents are less likely, and as much as 59% of respondents are unsure or neutral in their likelihood of using said products.
However, the numbers vary across different age groups. A higher number of millennial professionals and the younger generation are more likely to use products with advanced AI compared to Gen X and baby boomer professionals.

Similarly, millennial professionals are more likely to pay for generative AI for professional use compared to Gen X and baby boomers.
The Aberdeen Generative AI study quantifies several such opinions that help professionals in the three aforementioned age groups. Let us look at what these are.

What Millenials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers Think of AI
The three generations of professionals were asked about the potential impact of AI on work.

62% of millennials and younger generation professionals said they expect the impact of AI on work to be positive, 28% said they’re neutral or don’t know, while 10% said they expect it to be negative.
45% of Gen Xers are positive, 35% are neutral or don’t know, and 19% expect negative effects.
An even low 38% of baby boomers are optimistic about AI in work, 33% are neutral, whole 29% harbor negative opinions about the tech.

Here’s how the numbers look on the prospects of the future of AI by generations:




Sentiment on the Future of AI

Hopeful
Not Sure
Worried


Millennials and Younger
43%
17%

40%




Gen X

17%
18%
43%


Baby Boomers
40%
24%

49%




Consequently, millennials and younger generations leverage generative AI in more business use cases than their peers. For instance, more millennials (in percentage terms) are using AI to search for information online than Gen X and baby boomers combined.
Some other business tasks millennials are fulfilling through AI are email creation and response, data processing and analysis, writing long-form documents, troubleshooting complex problems, and more.

“These technologies have the potential to speed up the rate of innovation itself by facilitating invention, design, and creativity. Thus they may not only increase the level of productivity but also accelerate its rate of change,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki professor at Stanford HAI; director of Stanford Digital Economy Lab, wrote.
As such, Li called on for a prudent approach to developing AI by assessing people’s needs first.

Fashion is a form of self-expression. Whether it’s Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showing up in a hoodie for a meeting to signal he doesn’t need to dress up, someone wearing a bright red blazer to stand out from a sea of gray jackets at a job interview, or a teenager picking out a trendy outfit to wear to school to boost their popularity, what someone wears says a lot about who they are and how they want to be seen.
But how does the retail industry predict what trends will be popular ahead of the start of the season?
It turns out many of today’s leading fast-fashion companies, like H&M and Zara, are turning to artificial intelligence to help them predict tomorrow’s trends to stay ahead of the curve, track inventory levels, analyze historical data, and understand what customer demand will look like in the future. AI technologies and AI-powered solutions are becoming increasingly popular as a method for understanding sales data and even cutting down on operational costs.
What Is Fast Fashion and the Fast Fashion Supply Chain?

If you want the look for less, you want fast fashion. Examples of fast fashion include H&M, Zara, Old Navy, Urban Outfitters, Topshop, Mango, and Uniqlo. Fast fashion is, typically speaking, the trendy pieces of clothing and accessories that you can purchase inexpensively. 
The styles are often found from demand forecasting, market trends, and what’s recently been on the runways, and fast fashion companies then create cheaper alternatives.
“Inexpensive” is, of course, a relative term. Many fast fashion stores create pricing strategies that involve bargain-basement prices for clothing for younger shoppers seeking a look that won’t be in style beyond the season, as well as higher price point looks for shoppers who are looking for outfits that are still considered affordable by the middle class but are more professional looking or made from better materials.
The word “fast” comes into play because these of-the-moment looks are often ripped from the catwalks and from celebrity culture and then found in brick-and-mortar stores shortly thereafter. This means their production cycle is compressed as much as possible so brands can capitalize on trends before their customers declare them passé.
How Fast-Fashion Retail Industry Finds Trends

Image credit: Shutterstock/studio382.net
How can a retailer predict a trend if the very nature of a trend is that it’s a short-lived fad? In the past, fast fashion brands have looked at what high fashion designers are doing during Fashion Week and emulated their looks. As well, they’ve looked to see what celebrities are wearing and even what streetwear looks like in cities like Paris and London.
Fashion labels also look to history. By and large, fashion is cyclical. What goes around, comes around. ’90s kids could be found wearing ’60s and ’70s bell bottoms along with their baggy JNCOs, and now Millennials and Gen Y are rocking the slip dresses and combat boots of the ’90s. As such, the fashion industry looks to the 20-year rule for inspiration.
Social media trends 
They also look at current events. The hemline index theory proves that when the economy is booming, women’s skirts get shorter. Meanwhile, the lipstick effect suggests that when the economy slumps, women look to little luxuries like new lipstick to brighten up their styles.
With the rise of social media platforms like Instagram, influencers are posting their OOTD — outfit of the day. On the one hand, it allows the fashion industry to quickly capture trends through SEO and algorithms. On the other hand, it means trends may have shorter cycles, as everyone is looking for the next big thing instead of repeating looks. 
Today, though, the fast fashion industry has artificial intelligence at its disposal. Although customer behavior has changed when it comes to shopping, machine learning is helping companies understand customer sentiment and new patterns.
What Is Artificial Intelligence?

When a machine seems to have the uncanny ability to be able to make decisions, that’s essentially artificial intelligence at work.
At its broadest definition, artificial intelligence (AI) uses computer science to simulate human, or natural, intelligence in machines. Algorithms enable machines to problem solve. Not just that, the algorithms allow the machines to learn. An AI-powered system can accept user queries and provide instant responses, all while learning how to better respond and provide better solutions.
Along with these abilities, AI can perform automated planning and scheduling, support supply chain operations, and store data. AI algorithms can work quickly to determine patterns, solve problems, and predict future demand for retail companies. 
When it comes to AI in retail, it’s remarkable what this tech can do to exceed brand expectations, assist with inventory management, and better the customer experience as a whole.
How Fast Fashion Applies Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence tools, natural language processing, and computer vision are transforming supply chain management, customer experience, and more across the retail landscape.
There are a number of roles that AI can play in the supply chain. Chatbots could handle purchase requests, smart warehouses could deal with inventory management, and autonomous vehicles could help with shipping. It can optimize inventory levels and keep track of what’s available in stores, in warehouses, and currently in production.
AI technology can also analyze customer feedback and thus improve customer satisfaction, help with the returns process (and reduce it), and work through virtual assistants to partake in customer relations. 
For trend forecasting and demand forecasting
In 2019, a McKinsey survey found that most companies that are leveraging AI increased their revenue: “In supply-chain management, respondents often cite sales and demand forecasting and spend analytics as use cases that generate revenue.” 
In 2021, global AI in the retail industry was valued at USD $2,938.20 million. It’s expected to reach $17,086.54 million by 2028.
This demand forecasting, or predictive analytics, is used throughout the fashion supply chain.
In the past to predict demand, fast fashion had to gather insight from across the fashion world, taking into account the colors, patterns, materials, and cuts showcased on the runways in Paris, the streets of Berlin, the red carpet in Hollywood, and the dive bars of Brooklyn. 
It ran the risk of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, in which a fashion buyer’s brain experiences selective attention and confirmation bias. Today, computers and AI in retail can gather and group information much more efficiently.
And more effectively: “In a recent Gallup study centered on predicting consumer demand, data was provided on NASDAQ, product and brand searches, underemployment, and standard-of-living indices. By combining these data sources, Gallup was able to create a predictive model that outperformed their client’s previous consumer demand model by more than 150%.”
This then allows stores to work out competitive prices and nail down the brand loyalty customers have for them. It’s also an interesting way to explore new revenue streams and figure out customer sentiment when they purchase online or in person.
How AI is used for analyzing customer data and understanding customer preferences
AI technologies are able to analyze customer data, which can provide a more detailed look at browsing behavior and even offer personalized recommendations to shoppers. Customer engagement is extremely important for sales and AI in retail is capable of improving the customer experience. AI algorithms can also store browsing and purchase history, as well as transaction data, which is useful for both parties.
AI tools are also brilliant in helping enhance customer service. It can liaise with the brand and customer, figure out the problem with the item, initiate an exchange or return, and then analyze customer feedback afterwards. The retail sector is often riddled with customer service questions and returns, especially in fast fashion, so having AI tools to handle the issues that arise can be game-changing. 
Another way this shows up in the retail industry for the consumer is directly while they’re shopping. Even the most mundane store fixtures have received AI upgrades. With the use of objects like smart shelves, customers simply scan barcodes to get suggested products or learn more about the items they’re interested in.
How AI used in automated inventory management
Using AI in retail inventory management is another way in which this technology comes into play.
Inventory management can be tricky, especially when massive quantities of clothing and accessories are being produced, shipped, and purchased. It’s also burdensome for small teams to tackle on their own.
AI-powered machines can automate repetitive tasks, optimize inventory levels, and keep track of what’s out of stock, what isn’t selling, and what’s continually selling out. Inventory management is often a beast, but with the right machine learning tools, it’s possible to streamline. 
How H&M Uses Artificial Intelligence to Predict Trends
The Swedish fashion empire H&M employs AI algorithms and more than 200 data scientists to predict and analyze trends. Its AI algorithms obtain fashion trend data by capturing information on search engines and blogs. This information informs everything from how much they buy, when they buy, and where it should be placed in its stores.
Importantly, retail AI not only forecasts new trends the company’s buyers should be aware of but also informs them of whether they should restock currently popular merchandise and if it will only be suiting one customer’s preferences or a whole segment. As Thomas has previously reported, H&M’s artificial intelligence therefore helps the company reduce waste and make more sustainable decisions.
Head of the H&M Club Samuel Holst said, “Knowing our customers — having this insight, knowing where, how and when they shop, knowing what they like — that is an important piece in how we will be able to predict trends.” 
In 2019, then-CEO Karl-Johan Persson reported that H&M’s venture into artificial intelligence had already helped the company predict trends. When companies like this are able to analyze customer behavior and purchasing habits alongside societal shifts, it’s easier to get trends right, increase customer loyalty, and boost revenue streams.

How Zara Uses Artificial Intelligence to Find Trends and Track Customer Satisfaction
Like its competitor, the Spanish fashion outfitter Zara has turned to artificial intelligence to further its goals. The company uses it in a number of ways, including employing AI robots to fetch requested orders for customers using its Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store (BOPIS) or Click and Collect options.
Unlike H&M, which relies heavily on outsourcing to speed its production, Zara’s use of outsourcing is minimal. As Thomas has previously reported, one of the advantages of this tactic is that “Zara controls everything from design to display to shipping, allowing it to gather valuable data at every stage. This data can then be analyzed to identify inefficiencies, pinpoint areas of success, and create accurate forecasting.” 
Having access to all of these prongs of a business, including historical sales data, insight into customer engagement, and how the supply chain operations are functioning, Zara can glean a lot from its AI software.
To further augment this, the company hired Tyco to install microchips into its clothing’s security tags so that they can identify where within the supply chain a particular style and size is located. This allows the company to have full visibility over the inventory it can sell, thereby informing its forecasting analytics.
Zara also has an initiative with Jetlore, a consumer behavior prediction platform that uses artificial intelligence. Founded by computer scientists from Stanford in 2011, the company was bought by PayPal in 2018. Crunchbase explains its use in fast fashion: 
“Jetlore’s AI-powered platform maps consumer behavior into structured predictive attributes, like size, color, fit, or style preferences, making it the only customer data platform for B2C businesses in the market. This structured data allows top tier retailers and large hospitality and media companies to optimize content and communication for the consumers, make better merchandising decisions, optimize search, and empower the next generation of customer service.”

AI Is Influencing Fashion, Inventory Management, and More
The irony is that artificial intelligence is doing more than just predicting trends. It’s also influencing them in the retail industry.
AI tracks shoppers’ behavior patterns online so it can offer a personalized shopping experience. Machine learning gathers data on what a shopper likes and when and how often they make certain purchases. While AI solutions are helpful in-store, online retailers are of course making the most of it, too.
Its predictive technology then allows it to anticipate a shopper’s needs and desires so it can offer them similar products. It even learns when online shoppers are more likely to be open to trying out a new brand.
In this way, leveraging AI in retail has many advantages. AI algorithms and AI-powered chatbots and software can be used to introduce shoppers to new brands and styles, push bulging inventory, and drive trends.

A disruptive new industry has arrived on the scene...artificial intelligence. Or is it really new? AI has technically been in existence since the 1950s when it was discovered and coined, and we have been using it in some way or another for various technology-controlled aspects of our lives.


However, since the advent of ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been an unprecedented interest and excitement across multiple sectors that have been affected, in some ways comparable to technology booms in the past.

Millions of jobs have—and are predicted to be—created, with the McKinsey Global Institute forecasting the creation of up to 50 million new jobs across sectors globally by 2030. Upwork saw an over 1,000% increase in AI job postings in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, while demand for roles mentioning AI or generative AI on LinkedIn has doubled over the past year.

PROMOTED
Some roles that are now available include postings for AI research scientists, AI ethics consultants, machine learning engineers, AI engineers, AI product managers, and even AI management consultants, boasting salaries starting from $104,000, with an average salary of $151,668 according to current figures at Salary.com. With artificial intelligence impacting several sectors and industries, automating millions of jobs, boosting economies, and creating new jobs that previously were unheard of, there has never been a better time to consider securing your job future in AI, especially if you're concerned it might impact your job.

Here are five steps to securing a role within the industry while it is at its peak of growth:

Obtain Specific Technical Knowledge
To land a role working with AI, it is important to understand the technology behind it. The specifics will vary, of course, depending on which role you plan to pursue, but generally, you'll need a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, programming, and data science, which you can usually gain through a degree. A few of the technical skills that are in demand include programming languages such as Python, R, Java, Scala, TypeScript, and C++; machine learning algorithms and frameworks, for example KNN, linear regression, Naive Bayes, Keras, PyTorch, and Theano; data engineering, processing, warehousing, and database modeling; and any AI-specific knowledge of applications, for example, IUI (Intelligent User Interfaces).

Dave McKean: Generative AI Creates “Stuff” (Not Art) 



Emily M. Reigart

Senior EditorNAB Amplify


























TL;DR

“Prompt: Conversations With AI” is illustrator and director Dave McKean’s response, in the form of graphic stories, to learning that his work had been fed into AI learning data sets.
McKean is very concerned about AI’s impact on society at large and its influence on creativity in particular. He believes that effort and process are crucial to making art. 
While he has many problems with how generative AI has been developed and is being used, McKean has and continues to experiment with gen AI as a tool for his work, understanding that it will not be going away in the future but rather become ubiquitous.






Many creatives have been struggling with our feelings about generative artificial intelligence. Illustrator and director Dave McKean went one step further as he grappled with AI: He wrote a 96-page book as he processed how this technology would change his work… and our society. 
Prompt: Conversations With AI is McKean’s response, in the form of graphic stories, to learning that his work had been fed into generative AI data sets.  
“I’m just an individual human being, trying to make sense, to work out what the hell’s going on, mostly by making marks on paper,” McKean told an audience at Film and Media Exchange, where he was invited to share his thoughts on AI. (Watch the full keynote and Q&A below.)



His initial reaction was along the lines of… not good.
“I did about 10 minutes’ research on what Midjourney was and what artificial intelligence image creation was. And then I spent a day in a fetal position on the floor of my studio,” McKean said. 
McKean’s feelings have evolved, but he still maintains strong reservations about AI’s use in creative endeavors.
“I’m very much a critic of this. But a critic who wants to understand it,” McKean said.


AI Explorations and Experiments
After his initial panic, McKean determined he’d need to explore AI’s capabilities, so he began to experiment with Night Cafe, a free tool. 
“I fed lines from Roadside Picnic into the bot, and it spat out a few raw materials,” McKean said. But ultimately, he “found it quite hard work to get anything out of it that I liked in any way.” 
Later, McKean tried another tack: using it as a shortcut to design an album cover for a friend. “I didn’t really have a firm idea of what it was … so I typed eight words into Midjourney.” He said the image generated “looks like my work, so I used it” and liked it. (His friend’s band ultimately did not.) 

However, that initial result also freaked him out and caused McKean to reach out to a neighbor (who happens to be an expert in AI) to understand how the bot was able to recreate his style with such a general prompt. “I just wrote some very bland words in that I thought might put it in a certain kind of image, but I didn’t use my name at all,” McKean recalls. “And she said, ‘Well, it probably knows your IP address.’” (An unsettling idea!)
His next endeavor involved translating the Epic of Gilgamesh into images using AI. He wondered, “Would anything of the story survive that weird conversation?” The end result was that some of the plotlines were discernible to someone unfamiliar with the myth (as tested on McKean’s wife).
McKean also experimented with feeding newspaper headlines into the bot as a way “to see how AI sees us.” He did this over the course of a month, which also happened to be the time frame when Blake Lemoine was fired because he was worried about chatbot sentience, as well as the month of the Uvalde, Texas, massacre. 
“All kinds of strange images came out of this,” McKean said.



Strange and at times disturbing. McKean ultimately did not include the AI-generated description of the school shooting, the only image he “censored” from inclusion in the book. “What I took from that is that AI has no feelings to hurt, doesn’t care about hurting our feelings,” he said. 
His final experiment was to feed his questions about AI…into the AI. He also included photographs that he’d take on his daily walks (which he’d use to create his AI musings), and created renderings combining the images and questions. After enough re-renderings, “Everything started to look like my work,” he said.

Art Vs. Stuff
McKean thinks that generative AI has created “ethical black holes” that “are obviously really pressing.” 
Beyond the legality and issues like copyright, he is concerned about more philosophical aspects, like: “What is the nature now of art and creativity, if all that is happening is somebody’s tapping away?” and “Where do any of us fit into this anymore? And is this the future we want?”
McKean has answered some of these questions, for himself, anyway.
First, he said, “I don’t call it AI art. It’s AI stuff. It’s a great generator of stuff, an endless plane of stuff.” 
While that sounds rather derisive, he also admits, “It remains a powerful tool for generating curious and surprising stuff. And that stuff when curated by interesting prompters like my friends, Mario Cavalli, and Ryan Hughes, for example, can be genuinely engaging. It can be used as raw material for further collage or physical media work, and can therefore be part of the creative process.”
He said, “The images that it coughs up are genuinely surprising. And surprise is a big part of creativity. It’s a big part of what we hope to get in our own work.” 
Nonetheless, when it comes to creativity, McKean said, “It’s the challenge that’s important. And it’s in the doing of it. And for it not to be easy, and to do things that surprise yourself, and to find things along the way that you would never have discovered about yourself, or about the thing that you end up doing.”
McKean explains, “The AI equivalent of going for a walk is just a teleport to the final destination. Well, that’s not a walk, is it? That gives you nothing of what you want to go on a walk for. It doesn’t get blood pumping, or air in your lungs, or it doesn’t get you — allow you — to try a path that you wouldn’t have come across if you hadn’t gone on that walk or that journey. That’s creativity.” 
Even worse, McKean said, “There’s no magic involved with Midjourney. It’s boring and tedious.” 
As an artist, he said, “I don’t want to spend my life tapping away on a keyboard. This is so boring. I like making things and getting my hands dirty. So I’ll play with it until I’m bored with it, which is 10 minutes.”
Legal and Ethical Challenges
“Even though I don’t think there’s any chance of returning any or many of the contents to Pandora’s box, I do think the total lack of any forethought on the part of the radical tech fundamentalists has to be called out,” McKean said. “The argument that it is just a tool remains hopelessly naive. It is a tool, but not just a tool. We are racing to keep up with the implications of how it will change society.”
“There are lots of people trying to take these people to court trying to get some sort of opt out, trying to get some sort of royalties paid whenever your name is coughed up. I honestly don’t hold out much hope that things are going to change,” McKean said.
So that means “It’s down to us, again, to form our own ethical boundaries for dealing with this stuff,” he said.
One of his own bright lines is not using AI to copy another creative’s style directly. “Putting a prompt into Midjourney using another artist’s name, as far as I’m concerned, is obviously wrong. I’ve never done it. And I hope none of you have either,” McKean told the audience.
He also scoffs at the idea that AI programmers can’t solve some of the problems we’ve already been presented with. 
For example, McKean said, “If it is possible to blockchain an image to prove its ownership no matter what turbulence happens to it online, then it must be possible to watermark AI activity to at least prove beyond doubt, and conspiracy theorists that the photo realistic image of a beloved television news anchor in sexual congress with a koala bear is fiction.”

But the company is now preparing its response and plans to develop features for its full range of devices. Also: The future of the Mac comes into focus, a cheaper Apple Pencil debuts, and the Vision Pro gets closer.Last week in Power On: Apple renews its top ranks with a wave of executive promotions. Paid subscribers learned the latest on the Apple car and whether the Quest 3 will affect development of the Vision Pro. The StartersExpandSiri and HomePod in-store advertisement.Photographer: Hollie Adams/BloombergOne of the most intense and widespread endeavors at Apple Inc. right now is its effort to respond to the AI frenzy sweeping the technology industry.The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI’s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users’ queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry’s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time. “There’s a lot of anxiety about this and it’s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.ExpandApple AI boss John Giannandrea.Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergApple’s senior vice presidents in charge of AI and software engineering, John Giannandrea and Craig Federighi, are spearheading the effort. On Cook’s team, they’re referred to as the “executive sponsors” of the generative AI push. Eddy Cue, the head of services, is also involved, I’m told. The trio are now on course to spend about $1 billion per year on the undertaking.Giannandrea is overseeing development of the underlying technology for a new AI system, and his team is revamping Siri in a way that will deeply implement it. This smarter version of Siri could be ready as soon as next year, but there are still concerns about the technology and it may take longer for Apple’s AI features to spread across its product line. Federighi’s software engineering group, meanwhile, is adding AI to the next version of iOS. There’s an edict to fill it with features running on the company’s large language model, or LLM, which uses a flood of data to hone AI capabilities. The new features should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences, mirroring recent changes to competing services.Apple’s software engineering teams are also looking at integrating generative AI into development tools like Xcode, a move that could help app developers write new applications more quickly. That would bring it in line with services like Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, which offers auto-complete suggestions to developers while they write code.And Cue’s organization is pushing to add AI to as many apps as possible. The group is exploring new features for Apple Music, including auto-generated playlists (this is something Spotify rolled out earlier this year in partnership with OpenAI), as well as the company’s productivity apps.ExpandCraig Federighi and Eddy Cue.Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergCue’s team is examining how generative AI can be used to help people write in apps like Pages or auto-create slide decks in Keynote. Again, this is similar to what Microsoft has already launched for its Word and PowerPoint apps. Apple is also testing generative AI for internal customer service apps within its AppleCare group, I’ve previously reported. One debate going on internally is how to deploy generative AI: as a completely on-device experience, a cloud-based setup or something in between. An on-device approach would work faster and help safeguard privacy, but deploying Apple’s LLMs via the cloud would allow for more advanced operations.The on-device strategy also makes it harder for Apple to update its technology and adapt to a fast-changing industry. With that in mind, I wouldn’t be surprised if the company adopts a combined approach: using on-device processing for some features and the cloud for more advanced tasks. When it comes to getting this right, the stakes are high. Generative AI has quickly become much more than a buzzword and will be central to the next several decades of computing. Apple knows it can’t afford to take a back seat.

The BenchExpandTim Cook with the latest MacBook Air.Photographer: Philip Pacheco/BloombergApple’s iMacs and MacBook Pros are in short supply ahead of planned launch at end of month. Apple last updated the iMac in April 2021, introducing a version of its iconic all-in-one computer with an M1 chip. Since then, news about a follow-up model has been as  elusive as a PowerBook G5. In an era of in-house Apple chips, it’s rare for a Mac to go this long without an upgrade. Fans of the iMac have waited more than 900 days since the last model debuted.This was never the plan. Apple had aimed to release a larger, pro-focused iMac soon after the 24-inch iMac launched. Under the original road map, you would have seen the M1 24-inch iMac, then an M2-based iMac Pro and, finally, a 24-inch iMac refresh.I’m told that the company tabled the iMac Pro plan a while ago due to cost concerns. So Apple has had to adjust. That’s included positioning the Mac Studio and Studio Display combination as a high-end iMac replacement. But any passionate iMac user knows that’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.Fortunately, a new iMac is finally on the way. As I reported in March, the company has been readying the updated 24-inch iMac — a model that could be out soon. How soon? Well, I’m told that Apple is planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month. That could be its chance to announce this model.Another clue: Apple retail stores are in short supply of the iMac, as well as the 13-inch MacBook Pro and high-end MacBook Pro — two other models that may be due for a refresh. If you try to order the products from Apple’s website, several configurations won’t arrive until mid-November. That several-week delay is a clear sign that something is about to happen.I believe the Mac announcement will take place on either the 30th or 31st of this month. Apple is holding earnings on Nov. 2. It will be the first time since 2018 that the company posts its quarterly results in November (usually it occurs in late October). The last time this happened, the earnings followed an iPad and Mac event on Oct. 30.I recently reported that while next-generation MacBook Air models with M3 chips won’t launch until 2024, the company has made headway on new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. You’ll recall that Apple just released MacBook Pros in January, so an additional update the same year would be unusual, but not inconceivable.Back to the iMac: It’s worth noting that the pro version was tabled but never canceled. This larger model is still poised to follow the 24-inch one, coming in either late 2024 or 2025. It will have a 32-inch display, making it the biggest iMac in Apple’s history. It’s something I’m watching closely. After all, the iMac, which turned 25 this year, was what got me interested in Apple in the first place.ExpandThe Apple Vision Pro.Photographer: Philip Pacheco/BloombergApple will begin training retail employees on the Vision Pro in “first months” of 2024. The release of the Vision Pro is approaching, with Apple beginning to prepare retail employees for the device to go on sale next year. The company has sent a memo out to retail employees asking them to apply for a secretive “product training event” in Cupertino, California. The gathering will take place in the early months of 2024. This event is, of course, to teach retail employees about the Vision Pro and train them on the complex sales procedures involved. “Selected team members will travel and participate in an event in Cupertino, California, at some point in the first months of 2024. Upon returning to their home store, they’ll deliver training and ongoing support to store team members,” the memo says. “This is a group opportunity for those who have a deep passion for demonstrating Apple products and teaching others.” Those who want in will need to pass an application and interview process.In other words, Apple wants to bring in a couple people from each retail store in the US to train them on the Vision Pro and then send them back home to teach their colleagues about it. What does this tell us about the Vision Pro launch timing? Not much, perhaps. The memo doesn’t say when the product will go on sale or how long the training will run. But it’s probably a further signal that the device won’t be ready at the very beginning of the new year. Apple has only said that the Vision Pro is arriving in “early” 2024, wording that gives it plenty of wiggle room. The rollout of the Vision Pro is expected to be the most complicated in the company’s history. Flagship Apple retail locations will be adding dedicated hands-on areas, with other stores getting one or two demo units apiece. The company is also planning to assemble the Vision Pros for customers in-store — like it does with the Apple Watch — embedding proper bands, light seals and optional prescription lenses.ExpandiPad Air with Apple Pencil.Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/BloombergApple debuts a new low-end Apple Pencil ahead of fresh iPads in the spring. Apple isn't planning to launch new iPads until around next March, I'm told. In the meantime, we got something a bit less exciting: a new low-end Apple Pencil. This device is a successor to the original Pencil from 2015, adding USB-C charging to fit in with Apple’s current lineup. The new model lacks the pressure sensitivity of the first Pencil, but it gains most of the benefits of the second-generation version: design changes, matte finish and the magnetic attachment feature. At $79 (or $69 on the Apple education store), it's a pretty good deal and a strong competitor to styluses from the likes of Logitech.I anticipate that Apple will eventually discontinue the first-generation Pencil and only offer low-end and high-end versions. But that may not happen until the low-end iPad with a Lightning connection is discontinued. After all, customers will probably want a Lightning Pencil to go with their Lightning iPad.For now, having three Pencils only underscores how cluttered the iPad offerings are. There’s a confusing array of models and generations, and it’s not clear why consumers should buy one versus another.That probably won’t change anytime soon, but Apple will at least update the lineup with new hardware in 2024. I’ve written that the company has been working on a slew of models, including versions of the iPad Air, entry-level iPad and iPad mini with bumped-up specifications. There’s also a revamped iPad Pro in the works. I’m told that Apple is currently planning to release at least the more minor iPad refreshes in March.The ScheduleExpandAn Apple retail store in New York City.Photographer: Gabby Jones/BloombergNov. 2: Apple announces quarterly results. Apple is set to report fourth-quarter earnings at the start of November, capping its fiscal 2023. This is a critical report: We’ll get our first slice of data on how the latest iPhone 15 models have performed and insight into how the company is feeling about its all-important holiday period. The fourth quarter includes a little over a week of iPhone 15 sales, so we should get a pretty good idea of early momentum for the device and color from executives on how it’s selling. One big question is how it’s doing in China, where early sales indications have been weak.

This serves to inspire them to come up with their own startup venures. Quite often, customer service representatives and data-entry keyers come up in the list. Indeed, generative AI has plenty of potential to automate many aspects of customer service. And other areas of AI, such as computer vision combined with natural language processing, can take over data entry substantially. AI is changing the nature of work—but that isn’t always bad.Recently, JPMorgan’s CEO predicted a 3.5-day workweek in the future, owing to AI. The more we get machines to work for us, the more time we get back for ourselves.Machine learning, which is a branch of AI and increasingly being used interchangeably with it, is about teaching machines to learn to behave like human beings—and even outperform them in certain tasks. I have been teaching the subject to graduate and undergraduate students at San Jose State University for the past five years, using my flipped classroom videos, and motivating them in a number of ways, such as asking them to interview subject matter experts from the industry; ask questions that I use in “Ask Me Anything,” a series with renowned researchers; and implement challenging course projects. The students explore the math behind the methods and design interesting machine learning applications.Most of us already use machine learning in our day-to-day lives, knowingly or unknowingly. Whenever we converse with Siri or Alexa, unlock our mobile phones using facial recognition or laptops using fingerprints, take recommendations from Netflix, or search the internet, we are using machine learning. In several recent and upcoming inventions such as the self-driving car or generative-AI-based ChatGPT, machine learning has the real potential to replace human beings.States like California have already passed multiple bills limiting the use of AI. I agree that artificial intelligence poses risks, but the opportunities are too compelling to be ignored.With automation, economies of scale quickly add up, resulting in accelerated progress. Automation already helps with blue-collar jobs such as the bank teller or dishwasher. Artificial intelligence can help in white-collar jobs with data-based decision-making made possible by machine-learning-based data analytics. In that sense, AI is capable of substituting at least partly for our very expensive human intuition.Jeetu Patel, chief product officer at Box, said recently that AI will impact half a billion white-collar jobs. Given that machines have some amazing qualities, like tirelessness and lack of other human fallibilities, the prospects of AI are huge. Human intelligence has millions of years of evolution behind it. Many paradigms have not yet been considered in the 50 or 60 years that artificial intelligence has been in existence. It can easily be said that we have hardly scraped the full potential of AI.However, all the above-discussed advantages of AI will not have the desired effect if they work only to fill the coffers of the C-suite and a few others at higher echelons. If the corporate culture does not practice giving back to its employees, their families, their alma maters, and the society at large, all the accelerated efforts will simply be siphoned off into an endless well of corporate greed. Governments and enterprises should strike a delicate balance between the two.Vishnu S.

And according to McKinsey’s Global Survey of AI from 2022, the buzz is real: AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017. As AI increases in the workplace, 53 percent of workers say they’re more concerned about their jobs being replaced by robots than immigration and outsourcing, per Gallup data.

Yet, there’s a paradoxical shift. According to Gallup, the focus is actually on people and transforming HR — the role of HR rather than changing technology. While it may sound ironic as generative AI increases in the workplace and workers may be concerned about job replacement, more specifically for purposes of this piece through the lens of HR professionals, it can also be equated to job freedom. AI can take on monotonous, rote tasks, and in turn, as technology handles mundane responsibilities, human workers can become more indispensable and get further immersed in deep-thinking and strategizing work.

For example, if transaction forms need to be issued for internal employee transfers, rather than an HR employee preparing the forms, they can have Gen AI handle that task while instead, the professional conducts goal-setting sessions with the transferring employee to set goals and expectations for the new role.

PROMOTED
Jill Goldstein, managing partner, talent transformation consulting at IBM, underscores this point in her recent blog post as to how HR organizations can prioritize people.

Goldstein wrote, “Invest in the talent and skills of your people. Create a culture of continuous learning. Success in the new AI era requires you to put people, instead of technology, at the center of your strategy. Your human workforce is integral to the success of this digital transformation. Their expertise gives them unique insights into where automation and AI could augment performance. Foster an open communication forum for them to provide direct input and insights.”

Ian Clawson, cofounder of BraveCore and coauthor of Brave Together: Lead by Design, Spark Creativity, and Shape the Future with the Power of Co-Creation, said, “As AI emerges in our work life, wise leaders have a massive opportunity to unleash the creative voice of their people. Creativity will become the fuel for shaping the future in how we connect, collaborate, and build together. It is the definitive skill for supercharging companies looking to lead and grow.”

The best way, Clawson, said to elevate work with creative skills involves relying on “those moments where your work excites you. Remove distractions. Ride the wave of creative bursts….  We can develop creative skills by leaning into questions more than answers. To stay curious and be anchored in the wrestle between possibilities and our power to build—together.

Inviting every perspective into brave conversations, challenging how we’ve done things, and treating our work like an exploration. The more we use our creative muscles, ideas start to stack, and we can start to make a difference in the lives of others.”
Particularly within human resources, as an example, that can be a year-end strategy session with the compensation teams and human resources business partners (HRBPs) to think about its workforce who increasingly want remote work. They can discuss topics such as what the hours look like, the compensation while they’re working remotely, and how their work can be positively impacted by these changes. It can look like brainstorming ways to boost morale along lines of business and productivity and rewarding employees with bonuses throughout the year — both monetarily, but perhaps “awards ceremonies” as well as their creativity sparks fresh ideas and new perspectives.
By stacking these ideas while collaborating with colleagues as HR organizations encourage and celebrate deep-thinking work, this excitement can fuel momentum for even more creativity within the HR engine as it accepts and embraces new technologies.
Chris Deaver, coauthor of Brave Together, indicated that leaders who avoided the internet, cell phones, and robots “led their companies into the dead-ends of history. Countless other inventions have proven to be new beginnings, not the end of everything. AI won’t eliminate all our work. It will just eliminate the boring work. The stuff we don’t enjoy. The things that hold us back from getting into creative flow.”
As HR teams focus on creativity, the ebb and flow of ideas, brainstorming, a-ha moments, and trying new and different ways of working for high touch, the creative muscle continues to be flexed. This includes hopefully better and more efficient ways of doing things, but may also include the occasional failure and figuring out what doesn’t work while celebrating the process, the journey, and the creative sparks rather than only focusing on the outcome.
“Nothing can replace imagination and human connection,” said Deaver. “Those who embrace AI will amplify a future filled with possibilities. Shifting our busy work from ‘to do’ lists to ‘what could be’ blueprints of a better future. Empowering us to go deeper into our creative voice, then expanding with others to solve some of the greatest challenges we’ve ever faced. Together.”
As HR organizations rely on AI to augment performance rather than replace all human work, a critical solution involves developing and honing a highly coveted skill that taps the expertise and minds of engaged workers: creativity. Original sparks of ideas, thoughts, and meaningful new creations are key.

The human problem with generative AI in HR


Generative AI's integration into HR software and processes presents both internal and external challenges, with concerns ranging from technology errors to human complacency.

Much can go wrong with generative AI in HR, ranging from errors in the technology to mistakes by humans operating these systems. The problems can come from two different directions: internal and external.







Generative AI requires human oversight, but experts say attention might fall away as workers become too complacent and trusting of the technology. Generative AI's ability to give wrong answers convincingly and its bias potential are also part of the risk of AI in HR.
Generative AI might also deliver external threats to HR. Job seekers can use large language models (LLMs), such as those that underpin ChatGPT, to craft resumes and cover letters with the right experience, words and phrases to be selected by an AI-enabled applicant screening system. That can make more work for recruiters in verifying various claims.
Nonetheless, HR managers are feeling pressure to adopt generative AI. In Gartner surveys, 76% of HR leaders have reported that ""if they don't adopt [generative AI] within the next one or two years, they'll be lagging,"" said Eser Rizaoglu, a Gartner analyst speaking at the company's ReimagineHR Conference in Orlando on Monday.
Using Gartner's hype cycle methodology, which it contends represents the typical path of new technologies, Rizaoglu said generative AI interest has reached the ""peak of inflated expectations."" Following rising expectations is the ""trough of disillusionment,"" which may have some users giving up on the technology.






Rizaoglu believes it will take two to three years for generative AI to start to demonstrate maturity -- the final stage of Gartner's five-phase hype cycle.
But there will be pitfalls to HR's adoption of AI, including the risk of putting too much trust in AI recommendations, said Balaji Padmanabhan, professor of decision, operations and information technologies at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
The complacency risk ""will never go away,"" Padmanabhan said. ""And once the comfort level increases, that risk may actually increase in time.""

The risk of too much trust
One of the initial generative AI applications is writing job descriptions. Here, Padmanabhan can see how complacency might take over. He said employees might stop checking future job description outputs once the AI system correctly constructs the first 10 job descriptions.
Padmanabhan said other generative AI risks include the ""huge problem"" of incorrect answers. LLMs don't understand the underlying knowledge in their data; instead, they learn how to connect words. ""They're learning the structure of language, which is what they're meant to do,"" he said.
Padmanabhan said generative AI needs verification systems to double-check any outputs. One model might be verification as a service, where humans with expertise in benefits, for instance, review an LLM's responses.
John Farley, managing director of the cyber liability practice at Gallagher, a risk management and HR and benefits consulting firm in Chicago, believes enthusiasm about new technologies pushes aside discussions of risk.
""All too often as a society, we tend not to think about the things that can go wrong,"" Farley said. ""We gravitate toward efficiencies and get excited about the potential that new technology brings to an organization.""
To protect themselves from such risks, employers will need to take several steps, such as having contracts with vendors that address liability on issues such as intellectual property protection, according to Farley. They'll also need strong data governance programs to ensure that AI systems are used correctly by employees, he said.

Gartner

Gartner says new technologies start off with inflated expectations, illustrated by the path of blockchain and metaverse technologies, which are seeing declining interest. Right now, interest in generative AI is high.







Good governance key to AI in HR
Job applicants who use generative AI also complicate HR's work, said Trevor Bogan, regional director Americas at Top Employers Institute, a global HR certification provider based in Amsterdam.
Bogan said that candidates use generative AI to enhance their resumes, which may lead to over-reliance on superlatives and produce inaccurate and misleading information.



As humans, we try to find signs of consciousness in almost anything.


Flavio VillanustreVice president of technology and global chief information security officer, LexisNexis Risk Solutions




Recruiters will ""have to do a little bit more research to make sure that this person is who they say they are,"" Bogan said.
Christopher Hojnowski, vice president of technology and cyber product head at Hiscox, a global business insurance provider, said that as ""much as AI can go wrong, AI can do right,"" he said.
But Hojnowski recommended that employers have strong policies governing how employees use generative AI systems. For instance, they might establish that employees only post an AI-generated job description after human review.
""It's going to be up to the companies to write strong guidelines around how AI can be used,"" Hojnowski said. That includes setting expectations that employees ""can't be complacent.""
But employees could still become too trusting of AI systems, said Flavio Villanustre, vice president of technology and global chief information security officer at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
There is a risk of misuse because some employees may naturally assign too much trust to the model, leading to problems later, he said. They might look for human characteristics in AI systems or believe that the system has a personality or even human-like reasoning, also known as artificial general intelligence.
""As humans, we try to find signs of consciousness in almost anything,"" Villanustre said.

Eventually, it can ruin future models of AI art platforms like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, removing its ability to create images.Nightshade adds invisible changes to pixels in a piece of digital art. When the work is ingested by a model for training, the “poison” exploits a security vulnerability that confuses the model, so it will no longer read an image of a car as a car and come up with a cow instead. The MIT Technology Review reported that Ben Zhao, a professor at the University of Chicago and one of the creators of Nightshade, hopes to tilt the balance away from AI companies that have taken copyrighted data to train their models. The Nightshade research paper said training data used in text-to-image AI models are vulnerable to the type of attack the tool unleashes. “Surprisingly, we show that a moderate number of Nightshade attacks can destabilize general features in a text-to-image generative model, effectively disabling its ability to generate meaningful images,” the paper said. Artists vengeful enough to go this route can upload their work into Glaze, a tool made by Nightshade’s creators that masks their art style, for example, making a normally realistic drawing into something cubist, perhaps. Nightshade will be integrated into Glaze, letting users choose if they want to use the poison pill or be satisfied that the model can’t mimic their art style. Nightshade’s creators proposed in its paper that the tool and similar ones should be used as “a last defense for content creators against web scrapers” that do not recognize opt-out rules. Copyright issues around AI-generated content and training data remain a gray area in the absence of regulation. Many of the lawsuits fighting against copyright infringement are still making their way through the courts. Meanwhile, methods to prevent web crawlers from taking data without permission have been limited to blocking access to scrapers. Companies like Adobe plan to use a mark to flag if something was AI-generated but also show who owns the image. Some of the first lawsuits against generative AI platforms focused on copyrighted material making its way to training data for models, especially by text-to-image platforms. Three artists sued Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and the art website DeviantArt in January, alleging that its models took their art without permission. Getty Images also filed a lawsuit against Stable Diffusion before building its own AI image generator trained on its licensed images. Google and Microsoft have said they are willing to take the legal heat if some customers are sued for copyright infringement while using their generative AI products. However, the majority of these products are text-based. Comments9 Comments / 9 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

Artificial intelligence is already disrupting operations across swaths of industries, and HR is no exception.
AI’s use cases in the HR space are evolving rapidly, from filtering and tracking job candidates to generating internal communications and analyzing facial expressions during video interviews. But it’s the use of AI in hiring that is drawing particular attention from regulators.
In 2023, New York City passed the nation’s first-ever law requiring employers to conduct annual bias audits of automated employment decision-making tools. Months later, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued guidance for employers about how to audit AI for employment discrimination.
Here we track the states, cities and other jurisdictions that have passed laws on the use of AI and other automated decision-making tools in the hiring process. We’ll offer a brief description of each law’s requirements, its effective date and a link to the original law, along with any relevant coverage from our journalists.
Readers may sort through the laws using the field on the left side of this page. The categories by which readers may sort include state name and area of jurisdiction (statewide vs. locality only).

Effective date: Feb. 1, 2026
Employers affected: All employers
Employers that deploy “high-risk artificial intelligence systems” for purposes such as the provision or denial of job opportunities must take “reasonable care” to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination.
Employers must create AI risk management policies and programs. They also must complete impact assessments for all AI systems both annually as well as within 90 days after any modifications are made. Consumers must be notified about the AI’s deployment, and deployers must publish statements disclosing the AI systems they deploy and the information those systems collect.
Employers must provide consumers opportunities to correct any incorrect personal data processed by an AI and appeal adverse consequential decisions made by an AI. In the event that a deployer discovers algorithmic discrimination has occurred, it must report the discovery to the state attorney general within 90 days.
Some of the law’s requirements do not apply when the deployer employs fewer than 50 full-time employees and does not use its own data to train the AI; the AI system meets certain exemption criteria; and the deployer makes an impact assessment of the AI available to consumers.

Effective date: Jan. 1, 2020
Employers affected: All employers
Employers that ask candidates to record video interviews and conduct analysis of applicant-submitted videos using AI must, prior to the interview, notify applicants that AI may be used, provide information explaining how the AI works and what general characteristics it will use to evaluate applicants, and obtain candidates’ consent to be evaluated by the AI.
Employers may not share applicant videos with anyone other than those persons whose expertise or technology is necessary to evaluate a candidate’s fitness for the position.
Employers must, within 30 days after receiving a deletion request from a candidate, delete video interviews and instruct any persons who received copies of such interviews to delete them, including any electronically generated backup copies.
Employers that rely solely upon AI analysis of video interviews to determine whether applicants will be selected for in-person interviews must collect and report the race and ethnicity data of all applicants who are selected for in-person interviews following an AI analysis, those who are not selected following an AI analysis and those who are ultimately hired. This data must be reported annually to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

Employers affected: All employers
Employers may not use facial recognition services for the purpose of creating a facial template — i.e., the machine-interpretable pattern of facial features extracted from one or more images of an individual by such services — during an applicant’s interview for employment, unless the applicant consents to this by signing a waiver. The waiver must state the applicant’s name, the date of the interview, that the applicant consented to the use of facial recognition during the interview and whether the applicant read the consent waiver.

Employers affected: All employers
Employers must conduct bias audits on automated employment decision tools, including those that utilize AI and similar technologies. The results of such audits must be posted, or linked, to the employer’s website, and the results must disclose selection or scoring rates across gender and race or ethnicity categories.
Employers may not continue to use automated employment decision tools that have not been audited in more than one year.
Employers also must provide certain notices about such tools at least 10 days prior to their use to employees or job candidates who reside in the city, and they must provide candidates the opportunity to request an alternative selection process or accommodation. New York City began enforcement of the law on July 5, 2023.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. This is accomplished by software that attempts to replicate a human process. While artificial intelligence can entail very sophisticated applications, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (which can converse with users) or autonomous driving applications, artificial intelligence encompasses a very wide range of applications. One term often associated with financial market artificial intelligence is algorithms, which refers to a set of programmed instructions that provides results from the data analyzed by the program. Artificial intelligence in investing and finance takes many forms, some of which are relatively straightforward. 


 Hedge funds and other trading operations utilize artificial intelligence at a very high level to, as an example, gain the slightest advantages in fast-moving markets. But artificial intelligence is also widely used in finance and investing because of its ability to process and analyze information from very large data sets. Further, artificial intelligence can be used to help choose stocks, make predictions on market movement, optimize portfolios, manage risk, obtain personalized investment advice, manage trade entry and exit strategies, and automatically build a customized portfolio that meets specific investor criteria like risk tolerances. We will discuss a variety of ways any investor can incorporate artificial intelligence into their investing. 


  How to Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Portfolio   
 Here are some ways regular investors can utilize artificial intelligence in their portfolios.


  Stock Picking  
 All of the companies that trade on U.S. stock markets have many data points that investors can use to determine what stocks they want to buy or sell. Artificial intelligence allows investors to efficiently sort through this data to identify stocks that meet their criteria. Stock screeners are sophisticated tools that allow investors to filter stocks on criteria that can include fundamental and technical data points, such as accounting ratios, market capitalization, trading volume, and moving averages, to name just a few of the literally hundreds of data points available. If you’re looking to get started with a stock screener, consider learning how to use these platforms by starting with one of the many free versions that are available, like ZACKS (NASDAQ).




  Automated Portfolio Building  
 Robo-advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment automate the traditional process of working with an advisor to outline investing goals, time horizons, and risk tolerances in order to create a portfolio that meets the needs of the investor. Automated portfolios guide the user through a questionnaire that then scores to a model portfolio that meets the criteria of the investor. In addition to the questionnaire and the scoring of models, these platforms also use artificial intelligence to determine the optimal mix of individual stocks for the portfolio. Further, automated portfolios are also set to automatically rebalance if the target allocations in the portfolio drift too far from the selected portfolio. 


  Trading and Trade Management   
 The ability to trade markets in near-instantaneous time, and strong computing power, has resulted in brokerage companies providing customers with very sophisticated order entry tools that allow computers to monitor trade entry and exit. This order management can be very sophisticated, but an example would be using tools to purchase a stock if it meets one or multiple criteria set by the user, then manage an exit strategy that could entail a conditional order such as using a stop or profitable level to exit a position based on what the market does. The diligent use of AI for trading and trade management, if used properly, can greatly reduce the emotional aspect of trading. This article on trading psychology discusses why dealing with your emotions is important for traders and investors alike. 


  Portfolio Optimization  
 AI is a good tool for portfolio optimization. It enables investors to identify a portfolio that fits their specific needs relative to risk tolerance and time horizon. Further, once a portfolio has been selected, AI can be used in conjunction with modern portfolio theory to craft a portfolio of stocks that falls on the efficient frontier, which increases returns relative to risk.


  Data Interpretation and Predictions  
 The idea is to develop AI algorithms that allow a prediction about where a stock or other security will go for the purpose of making a profit. While many develop algorithms using AI to make trading or investment decisions, not all models are correct. Active money managers are trying to outperform the general market indexes, and some do, while others do not. If you believe that cycles repeat, for example, you might utilize AI tools  to identify these cycles. Order entry based on a technical analysis tool is another possible area where AI could help make automatic entries and exits. 


  Risk Management  
 Various risk management techniques have been discussed, such as using AI in conjunction with modern portfolio theory and the efficient frontier, and using sophisticated order options to manage risk on active trades. However, AI can also be used to reduce over-exposure to individual stocks in a portfolio (such as when multiple managers all have the same stock in different asset classes in the same portfolio), or to establish automated options strategies to assist with risk management.1


  How Robo-Advisors Use Artificial Intelligence  
 Through automated portfolio building, robo-advisors automate the traditional process of working with an advisor to outline investing goals, time horizons, and risk tolerances in order to create a portfolio that meets the needs of the investor. Automated portfolios guide the user through a questionnaire that then scores to a model portfolio that meets the criteria of the investor. In addition to the questionnaire and the scoring of models, artificial intelligence is also used by these platforms in order to determine the optimal mix of individual stocks for the portfolio, which is often accomplished using modern portfolio theory. Further, automated portfolios are also set to automatically rebalance if the target allocations in the portfolio drift too far from the selected portfolio. 


  Steps Needed to Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Investing   
 As we have illustrated, AI in investing encompasses a lot of tools that can be used by professional and individual investors and traders. If you want to incorporate the use of AI into your investing or trading, you may consider taking the steps that follow.


  Step 1: Understand Your Financial Goals  
 The first step is the same for every investor, which is to understand your financial goals so you can move forward with an investment strategy that fits your needs.


  Step 2: Choose Your Investing Method  
 Next, you need to determine whether you will be using a robo-advisor that does much of the work, or investing on your own. If you go with a robo-advisor, the advisor’s AI technology will be doing most of the heavy lifting. This entails the questionnaire, model proposal, and the management of the portfolio. 


  Step 3: Select an Investing Strategy  
 Those making their own investment decisions should determine their investing strategy to understand the types of stocks they want in their portfolio. Investors could also utilize suggested models from robo-advisors, often available for free, to help determine the mix of asset classes for their portfolio. This is using AI to help set a strategy that will be individually managed.


  Step 4: Identify Your Investing Tools  
 For those making their own investment decisions, stocks screeners would likely be helpful AI tools when choosing the individual stocks for your portfolio. Stock screeners often have pre-set screens to help get the user started in filtering for stocks to consider.


  Step 5: Start Managing Your Portfolio  
 Once the portfolio is up and running, investors may want to utilize automated tools to help manage their positions for entry and exit points. They may also want to consider further refining their stock screen searches and learning how they can use the efficient frontier to craft a portfolio built for both favorable returns for the lowest level of risk possible. 


 What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the use of machines to simulate human intelligence. AI is accomplished by computers and software, and uses data analysis and rules-based algorithms. It can entail very sophisticated applications and encompass a very wide range of applications.2 Artificial intelligence in investing and finance takes many forms, but the tremendous amount of data available on financial markets and financial market prices provides many opportunities to apply AI to investing and trading. 


 What Kind of Financial Data Is Analyzed by AI?
Just about any financial information can be analyzed by AI. This includes fundamental data, such as a company’s earnings, cash flow, and any other data that may impact the stock’s price. This article, What are Stock Fundamentals?, provides more information on what fundamental data is and how it is used. Artificial intelligence is also used in technical analysis tools, which include data related to the number of shares traded, and other mathematical criteria related to past price activity. 


 Is Investing With AI Suitable for Beginners?
Absolutely, AI is suitable for beginners! Robo-advisors are often the first step for beginning investors, and these platforms are heavily reliant on AI. While some artificial intelligence represents cutting-edge technology and the ability to understand and process language, plenty of it is much more intuitive. In investing, such as stock selection, AI allows investors to filter stocks that meet their criteria much more simply through stock screeners. These screeners apply the same intelligence as an individual would, but they can do so much more quickly, efficiently, and accurately than a human. Any investor, even a beginner, would benefit from these powerful and easy-to-use stock screeners, as well as other AI investing tools. 


 Is Investing With AI Safe?
It is safe to use AI, but AI applications for financial markets are only as good as both the quality of the AI application and the ability of the individual to use the application. AI tools for financial markets can be used to identify risky or safe stocks, so the relative safety is a function of the choices the investor makes related to risk and reward of different stocks. Using modern portfolio theory to find a portfolio of stocks that maximizes gains while minimizing risk is another safe tool to use in making investing decisions. Faulty algorithms, and the potential for moves related to large numbers of investors using the same AI-generated information, are potential risks with using AI for investing.


  The Bottom Line  
 Whether you know it or not, the link between AI and investing is here to stay. Even if you are not directly using AI yourself, portfolio and fund managers all utilize AI in multiple ways, and your investment advisor is likely also using the same tools robo-advisors use to help determine risk tolerances and the best portfolio for their clients. Fortunately, AI tools for investing are now widely available to individuals.


 If you are a hands-on, active investor, you will be using AI in more than one way to manage your portfolio, make decisions on purchases and sales, and manage trading positions, so it is important to understand and keep abreast of developments in the AI and investing space. Investors should, therefore, look at the various investing tools that use AI on their existing platform to ensure that they are sufficient for their needs. If not, investors may want to consider either a different broker with more robust AI investing tools, or supplementing their broker platform with third-party AI investing software; an example would be using a separate stock screener for choosing stocks.

         — 
    


            When you read “artificial intelligence,” you might think of new innovations such as Chat GPT, but AI has been used in video games since the 1950s.
    

            From Pacman’s trademark ghosts to autonomous decision-making in “The Sims,” AI is essential for things like creating adaptive characters and storylines.
    

            Now, the rapid development of generative AI is opening up a new frontier for video games: endless open worlds, unique content, autonomous characters, and the potential for faster game development.

        Act natural


Generative AI – artificial intelligence that creates text, images and audio in response to a prompt – is set to shake up one of the signature components of video games: non-playable characters, known as NPCs. These characters typically have a set pattern of behavior, and their mannerisms and speech are often stilted and unnatural.

            “When we think about those NPCs, they look a bit weird,” says Alexis Rolland, development director of La Forge China, the Chinese branch of video games publisher Ubisoft’s research and development unit. “You can tell there is something off about what you’re seeing or hearing.”

            Enter generative AI. Earlier this year, La Forge launched Ghostwriter, a text-generating AI tool designed to help writers create a greater variety of original dialogue for NPCs, and in 2022, it tested a new technology that helps to generate more realistic and natural gestures in NPCs that matches the tone and mood of their speech.
    

            “It takes speech as input and generates body gesture as output, so we can imagine those NPCs expressing themselves with non-scripted dialogues, having almost natural body animation, synthesized from speech,” says Rolland.
    

            Combining generative AI elements like dialogue and animation could create “a fully fledged, AI-powered NPC that might have a little bit more natural and unpredictable behavior,” says Rolland.

            Jitao Zhou, a student at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, is doing just that to generate more realistic NPCs that are smarter and less predictable.
    

            “This NPC, using deep learning, does not have a fixed pattern, so can have a greater variety of movements,” says Zhou, adding that smarter NPCs will make games more entertaining and challenging.

Artificial intelligence could help work out the best diet for every individual




            Some publishers are already employing generative AI in NPCs to make conversations more realistic. Chinese gaming company NetEase uses ChatGPT to generate NPC dialogue in its recently released “Justice” mobile game, while Replica Studios recently introduced “AI-powered smart NPCs” for game engine giant Unreal Engine, which allows game developers to use AI to read NPC dialogue, rather than hiring a human voice actor.
    

            However, one risk of using AI-generated NPCs is that game designers could lose control of the game narrative, says Julian Togelius, an associate professor at New York University, where he conducts research on AI and games. “(NPCs) may say stuff that is game-breaking or rude or breaks immersion,” he explains.

            Creating “good” AI-generated NPCs that help the player is also far more difficult than creating enemies that fight against you, Togelius adds. “We haven’t seen that much advancement in the artificial intelligence that powers the other characters in the games, or that tries to model the player, or tries to generate the world — so we’re going to see a lot of advancement along these directions.”
    

        Open worlds


            Open-world games, like “Grand Theft Auto,” “Skyrim,” and “Elden Ring,” approach gameplay with non-linear quests and stories. That offers another opportunity for generative AI to reshape the gaming experience.
    

            Togelius envisions a “huge open game” with infinite opportunities, new cities, landscapes, and people, each with its own backstory and interactive elements. By using data about the player gathered from previous gameplay, generative AI could create unique storylines and tailor-made quests for players pitched at just the right level – “like a personalized dungeon master,” he adds.
    






""No Man's Sky"" uses procedurally generated content to create almost unlimited worlds for players to explore.

No Man's Sky



            Some research is already being done in this area. Takehiko Hoshino, also a student at Rikkyo University, has created an AI tool that he’s teaching to generate its own mazes and dungeons one square at a time, based on previous ones that it has encountered.
    

            It’s still in the early stages of development, but Hoshino says the next step is to embellish the maze with features including “treasure chests, enemy characters, and other game-like features, such as traps and other tiles.”
    

            Near-infinite open worlds are already possible to some degree: “No Man’s Sky” (2016) is a “virtually endless game,” says Togelius, that uses a technique called procedurally generated content to create customized fauna, flora, geology, and atmospheric conditions for its planets — of which there are 18 quintillion unique variations.
    

            To the average person, procedural content generation looks a lot like generative AI, says Togelius. But it uses algorithms that generate content based on predefined rules, based on data input by the game developer.
    

            While the developers retain control over procedurally generated content, generative AI has the potential to develop unplayable levels, or deviate in unintended ways from the game’s narrative. “Games have functional constraints such that levels need to be completable and NPCs should not lie about the game world,” Togelius adds.
    






In the future, Maxis says artificial intelligence could help character behavior, and is open to exploring the technology.

Maxis/EA Games



            But generative AI could impact the game world in other ways.
    

            Players are already adapting gameplay to their own preferences and needs with user-generated content (UGC), which is a key component of many games, including “Fortnite,” “Minecraft” and “The Sims.” Generative AI could make the production of UGC easier and more accessible for players, as well as raise the quality of content.
    

            “Generative AI has the potential to allow for a much broader and more emergent set of personalized and reactive player experiences,” a spokesperson from Maxis, the developer behind “The Sims,” told CNN in an email.
    

            “Player customization today is limited by the complexity of tools and user experience that we can expose players to, but some of the new models can make it easier for the game to interpret and respond to what the player wants to do,” says Maxis.
    

        An additional tool


            While gamers are excited about the potential for gameplay, generative AI is likely to impact development before it alters the user experience.
    

            Maxis is developing generative AI tools, currently in varying stages of maturity, that can support game designers, eliminating repetitive tasks and enabling developers to work on more interesting problems, according to a spokesperson.
    

            At La Forge, generative AI tools like Ghostwriter or ZooBuilder, a 3D animator that animates four-legged animals based on videos, could help designers “accelerate the most tedious part of their process, so that they can really focus on the more creative and interesting parts,” says Rolland.
    

            Creatives across all kinds of industries have raised concerns about generative AI taking their jobs but Rolland is quick to add that this new technology won’t replace human game developers. Animators faced a similar existential threat with the advent of motion capture, which Rolland says did not actually impact jobs but became a tool to create better graphics.







Tools like ZooBuilder could allow animators to create more natural movements for animal characters.

From Ubisoft La Forge



            “We’ve never had as many animators as we have today, and we still need more. Motion capture really became part of their workflow as an additional tool,” says Rolland. “I think with generative AI, it’s essentially the same thing – or at least, we’re approaching it with the exact same mindset here at Ubisoft.”  However, there are still a lot of unanswered “legal and ethical aspects” to using generative AI, including artists’ copyright, he adds.










Stella Terra, here on a roadtrip through Marocco, is the world's first off-road solar-powered car. Developed by the student team Solar Team Eindhoven, Stella Terra is the first solar car that is robust and efficient enough to go off the beaten path. With this, the students take another step towards a sustainable future, inspiring both society and the current market to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.

            La Forge is eager to explore the opportunities, such as the potential to increase iteration speed, and independent game designers are going to benefit from that too, he adds. “This technology becoming increasingly accessible is going to empower a lot of the smaller studios to produce games and scale their productions, and maybe reach higher quality than what they would have had without generative AI.”
    

            The generative AI Ghostwriter and speech-to-gesture animation have “passed the simple prototype stage,” says Rolland, and La Forge is now exploring how these technologies would work in the development pipeline.
    

            “Video games are in for quite a trip in the next decade or two,” says Togelius. “It requires us to change the way we’re thinking when it comes to game design, but I think that when it happens, games are just going to get so much better.”

These characters typically have a set pattern of behavior, and their mannerisms and speech are often stilted and unnatural. “When we think about those NPCs, they look a bit weird,” says Alexis Rolland, development director of La Forge China, the Chinese branch of video games publisher Ubisoft’s research and development unit. “You can tell there is something off about what you’re seeing or hearing.” Enter generative AI. Earlier this year, La Forge launched Ghostwriter, a text-generating AI tool designed to help writers create a greater variety of original dialogue for NPCs, and in 2022, it tested a new technology that helps to generate more realistic and natural gestures in NPCs that matches the tone and mood of their speech. “It takes speech as input and generates body gesture as output, so we can imagine those NPCs expressing themselves with non-scripted dialogues, having almost natural body animation, synthesized from speech,” says Rolland. Combining generative AI elements like dialogue and animation could create “a fully fledged, AI-powered NPC that might have a little bit more natural and unpredictable behavior,” says Rolland. Jitao Zhou, a student at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, is doing just that to generate more realistic NPCs that are smarter and less predictable. “This NPC, using deep learning, does not have a fixed pattern, so can have a greater variety of movements,” says Zhou, adding that smarter NPCs will make games more entertaining and challenging. Some publishers are already employing generative AI in NPCs to make conversations more realistic. Chinese gaming company NetEase uses ChatGPT to generate NPC dialogue in its recently released “Justice” mobile game, while Replica Studios recently introduced “AI-powered smart NPCs” for game engine giant Unreal Engine, which allows game developers to use AI to read NPC dialogue, rather than hiring a human voice actor. However, one risk of using AI-generated NPCs is that game designers could lose control of the game narrative, says Julian Togelius, an associate professor at New York University, where he conducts research on AI and games. “(NPCs) may say stuff that is game-breaking or rude or breaks immersion,” he explains. Creating “good” AI-generated NPCs that help the player is also far more difficult than creating enemies that fight against you, Togelius adds. “We haven’t seen that much advancement in the artificial intelligence that powers the other characters in the games, or that tries to model the player, or tries to generate the world — so we’re going to see a lot of advancement along these directions.” Open worlds Open-world games, like “Grand Theft Auto,” “Skyrim,” and “Elden Ring,” approach gameplay with non-linear quests and stories. That offers another opportunity for generative AI to reshape the gaming experience. Togelius envisions a “huge open game” with infinite opportunities, new cities, landscapes, and people, each with its own backstory and interactive elements. By using data about the player gathered from previous gameplay, generative AI could create unique storylines and tailor-made quests for players pitched at just the right level – “like a personalized dungeon master,” he adds. Some research is already being done in this area. Takehiko Hoshino, also a student at Rikkyo University, has created an AI tool that he’s teaching to generate its own mazes and dungeons one square at a time, based on previous ones that it has encountered. It’s still in the early stages of development, but Hoshino says the next step is to embellish the maze with features including “treasure chests, enemy characters, and other game-like features, such as traps and other tiles.” Near-infinite open worlds are already possible to some degree: “No Man’s Sky” (2016) is a “virtually endless game,” says Togelius, that uses a technique called procedurally generated content to create customized fauna, flora, geology, and atmospheric conditions for its planets — of which there are 18 quintillion unique variations. To the average person, procedural content generation looks a lot like generative AI, says Togelius. But it uses algorithms that generate content based on predefined rules, based on data input by the game developer. While the developers retain control over procedurally generated content, generative AI has the potential to develop unplayable levels, or deviate in unintended ways from the game’s narrative. “Games have functional constraints such that levels need to be completable and NPCs should not lie about the game world,” Togelius adds. But generative AI could impact the game world in other ways. Players are already adapting gameplay to their own preferences and needs with user-generated content (UGC), which is a key component of many games, including “Fortnite,” “Minecraft” and “The Sims.” Generative AI could make the production of UGC easier and more accessible for players, as well as raise the quality of content. “Generative AI has the potential to allow for a much broader and more emergent set of personalized and reactive player experiences,” a spokesperson from Maxis, the developer behind “The Sims,” told CNN in an email. “Player customization today is limited by the complexity of tools and user experience that we can expose players to, but some of the new models can make it easier for the game to interpret and respond to what the player wants to do,” says Maxis. An additional tool While gamers are excited about the potential for gameplay, generative AI is likely to impact development before it alters the user experience. Maxis is developing generative AI tools, currently in varying stages of maturity, that can support game designers, eliminating repetitive tasks and enabling developers to work on more interesting problems, according to a spokesperson. At La Forge, generative AI tools like Ghostwriter or ZooBuilder, a 3D animator that animates four-legged animals based on videos, could help designers “accelerate the most tedious part of their process, so that they can really focus on the more creative and interesting parts,” says Rolland. Creatives across all kinds of industries have raised concerns about generative AI taking their jobs but Rolland is quick to add that this new technology won’t replace human game developers. Animators faced a similar existential threat with the advent of motion capture, which Rolland says did not actually impact jobs but became a tool to create better graphics. “We’ve never had as many animators as we have today, and we still need more. Motion capture really became part of their workflow as an additional tool,” says Rolland. “I think with generative AI, it’s essentially the same thing – or at least, we’re approaching it with the exact same mindset here at Ubisoft.”  However, there are still a lot of unanswered “legal and ethical aspects” to using generative AI, including artists’ copyright, he adds. La Forge is eager to explore the opportunities, such as the potential to increase iteration speed, and independent game designers are going to benefit from that too, he adds. “This technology becoming increasingly accessible is going to empower a lot of the smaller studios to produce games and scale their productions, and maybe reach higher quality than what they would have had without generative AI.” The generative AI Ghostwriter and speech-to-gesture animation have “passed the simple prototype stage,” says Rolland, and La Forge is now exploring how these technologies would work in the development pipeline. “Video games are in for quite a trip in the next decade or two,” says Togelius. “It requires us to change the way we’re thinking when it comes to game design, but I think that when it happens, games are just going to get so much better.”",,,,,,,,,,,,1343.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H5M58S,,,,,

What you need to knowApple could potentially explore the generative AI craze.A new job listing posted by the company highlights several tasks, roles, and duties that are generative AI-focused.The company will reportedly make $1 billion in investments yearly to facilitate its AI advances. The generative AI craze has completely taken off in the tech industry. Microsoft, in particular, was among the top corporations to embrace the technology, making a multi-billion dollar investment. Other corporations like Slack and Amazon followed suit, incorporating the technology into their services and workflow, but not Apple, which has mysteriously remained quiet in the midst of these developments.However, the company is now picking up the slack, at least according to its latest job listings. The positions advertised are generative AI-inclined, as reported by TechCrunch. To secure a position in Apple's App Store platform, you must have skills that will allow you to effectively work on a ""generative AI-based developer experience platform for internal use.""In another instance, a potential employee in Apple's Retail department is required to leverage a “conversational AI platform (voice and chat)” while interacting with clients. The job listing also outlines “long-form text generation, summarization, question-answering” as part of the job description. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping ToolsBuilding on this, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a credible source when it comes to Apple rumors and leaks, recently disclosed that the company will set aside $1 billion annually to further its advances in generative AI as far as its products, features, and services are concerned. LATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentralWindows CentralIs it the right time for Apple to explore generative AI?READ MORE>iPhone of Artificial Intelligence>Apple is listed by the EU as a gatekeeper>Apple's Vision Pro might be a flopThis isn't the first time generative AI and Apple have been mentioned in the same sentence. In July, our Senior Editor Zac Bowden reported that Apple is venturing into the AI space with a ChatGPT-like iteration, codenamed Ajax, built on Google Jax. It is essentially used internally to help Apple prototype products.So, it might not be entirely farfetched that Apple is looking into the technology and could eventually hop onto the bandwagon. But if Microsoft's ventures and advances are anything to go by, Apple should consider treading carefully before getting into this technology face-first. Because the technology is capital-intensive and users have seemingly lost interest, it should be enough for Apple to hit the brakes on AI. Besides, a source with close affiliations to Apple indicated that the company has reservations about venturing into the tech owing to the fact that it's “a pretty big miss internally.” Not forgetting its negative impact on the environment.Get the Windows Central NewsletterAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Do you think embracing AI is the right move for Apple right now?

Artists vs. Artificial Intelligence



by Emi Knape | published Oct. 24th, 2023

Artists are constantly ripped off of their authentic work, from museum robberies to non-fungible tokens and, now, art generated by artificial intelligence (AI). It is no secret that the creative industry is competitive and pays next to nothing, so why are artists being targeted? While many people are excited about the development of AI art, others are scared about what it means for the future of their careers.AI AnalysisAs worried as artists are about AI, some are eagerly researching its applications and trying to discover everything it has in store. James ""Jim"" Porto, an RIT alum and assistant professor in the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences, talked about what he has discovered through his experimentation with AI. “If all that mattered was the result ... it’s a good result,” he started. “Working with it, though, is profoundly unsatisfying.” With over 30 years of experience using manipulated photography, Porto knows how much hard work goes into creating great artwork and how AI takes all of that away.“AI does what I was doing so much quicker, so much better ... but you don’t have as much control,"" Porto said. ""I’m really glad I’m not competing as a photo illustrator right now.”Wil Gross, a third year New Media Design student, had a similar thought.“I think art for the sake of art is garbage ... there is no human impression, and that’s what art is about,” Gross stated.Rip-off or Resourceful?Artists, professors and students alike are all navigating the balance between when and how to use AI, and if it should even be used at all. The consensus is that AI can be a great tool for artists to use during the creative process, such as for ideation and inspiration. In fact, many AI-powered tools are integrated into Illustrator, Photoshop and other editing programs.For instance, the ""Retype (Beta)"" tool in Illustrator allows editors to paste an image with typography and provides the closest font match. Another example is the ""Remove"" tool in Photoshop, which lets users brush over unwanted content with a similar replacement.""Art has meaning behind it,"" noted Sam Cazer, a second year New Media Design student. ""Only a human can create art, but AI will be another tool that artists or designers use.""Many students have already begun to explore and experiment with this new piece of technology, finding ways that it could help them, instead of hurt them.  “I prefer to use AI to enhance my projects,” said Alexa Contreras, a third year New Media Design student. “I think it can be used as a resource to take your work a step further or to think of new opportunities that you hadn’t thought of before. You can reference a lot of things that you might not have thought about.""Fear of the FutureImplementing AI as a tool proves resourceful when trying to make workflow more efficient, but this becomes controversial when using it in place of the work. This is where the fear of AI replacing artists' jobs starts. Porto and Cazer both mentioned how there was fear historically with the advent of photography. Painters were scared that photographers were going to take over their industry, but that never happened. Instead, painting and photography became their separate mediums, which is what Porto believes will happen with AI.""It's going to be its own medium,"" he stated. ""It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators."" Using AI as a tool proves to be resourceful when trying to make a workflow more efficient, but using it in place of the work is where controversy can arise Using AI as a tool proves to be resourceful when trying to make a workflow more efficient, but using it in place of the work is where controversy can arise This is where the fear of AI replacing people’s jobs stems from.  Porto and Cazer both expressed how this behavior happens historically with photography. Painters were scared that it was going to take over their industry. It didn’t. Instead, painting and photography became their own separate mediums, which is what Porto believes will happen with AI.“It’s going to be its own medium,” he stated. “It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators.” “It’s going to be its own medium,” he stated. “It's going to have the same market share, though. [AI] steps on the toes of photo illustrators.” This gets into what makes people afraid — how far is too far? AI is quick and efficient, and if it can create the same type of work photo illustrators and designers make, why hire someone else to do the work? The result lacks authenticity, but that is not a concern for corporations. Companies may be able to save time and money using AI, but the software lacks the fine-tuning that artists can achieve.Although it can be helpful, many artists are facing the reality of what their future careers may look like with the integration of AI. Jennifer Zhang, a fourth year Graphic Design student, talked about her fears with AI.“As a graphic design major, I’m worried about AI taking over and there are not as many jobs,"" Zhang said. ""Using [AI] will be super easy to do and the positions for a company might be taken by [it].” Silver Linings Ahead?With all that said, people are finding ways to make really cool, unique art with AI. Artists on Instagram, including Tim Tadder (@timtadder) and Joshua Vermillion (@joshuavermillion), are exploring the world — or “medium” — of AI and integrating their own style to create incredible work. They curate their inputs and prompts to replicate the style of work they did previous to AI. For some pieces, it is hard to tell the difference.So what does this mean? Are the creations they have made with AI truly their work? It is really hard to say, and as of now, numerous legal issues are projected to arise if AI were to be implemented commercially. But with the growing popularity of AI, we may start to see an increase in traditional art forms, such as photography and illustration. Despite the ease and accessibility of AI, it cannot create the same value of work that a human can, no matter how advanced it is. AI cannot capture the real moments, nor can it create the physical texture that oil paintings and charcoal drawings have.People still care and appreciate the hard work that artists do to express their craft, and with the inauthenticity of AI artwork, that appreciation and value is just going to increase. Although realistic, AI simply cannot match the human element of artwork.As Porto stated, “there’s a deadness to it, there’s a lack of soul, something off about it ... but it’s amazing.”

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace.How Far Has AI Come?We all understand and believe in the game-changing nature of artificial intelligence that has permeated every aspect of our personal and professional lives. To quantify this understanding, PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study has highlighted the immense potential of AI, with a projected $15.7 trillion contribution to the global economy by 2030. This impact will also be translated into a 26% boost in GDP for local economies. Improvement in labor productivity and product enhancements are set to drive economic gains and stimulate consumer demand with increased personalization. China and North America are expected to lead with a contribution of $10.7 trillion, nearly 70% of the global impact. With this overwhelming potential, it was inevitable for artificial intelligence to have a role in the disruption of employment and jobs around the world.Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s recent Work Trend Index report based on interviews with 31,000 individuals across different markets, has highlighted the urgency of acquiring artificial intelligence skills. The report reveals that AI aptitude is critical for staying relevant in the workforce. Notably, 82% of business leaders believe employees must upskill to adapt to the AI age, but 60% of workers currently lack these necessary capabilities.In terms of the company’s developments in AI, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s new AI assistant, Microsoft 365 Copilot, is set to become available to users starting on November 1st. This assistant will summarize meetings in Microsoft Teams for those who choose not to attend and create documents and presentations. It uses technology similar to ChatGPT, which Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested in through OpenAI. Copilot costs $30 per month and operates online. While it's expected to improve productivity, some critics express concerns about potential job disruptions and over-reliance on AI tools. To read more about AI disruption, check our article about the industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) allows users to generate images and written drafts from text prompts. This development will transform content creation by offering new tools for generating visual and written content. While Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is taking responsible steps to ensure its tools adhere to policies and guidelines, these AI-driven features can potentially disrupt and change creative and content-related professions. Story continuesThe disruption of AI is not just limited to jobs. In fact, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI is optimizing traffic lights in multiple cities, reducing wait times and emissions. Preliminary results indicate that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI has reduced stops by up to 30% and emissions by 10% for 30 million vehicles monthly. This AI development addresses a long-standing issue and makes urban life more sustainable.Future of the Ultimate Transition to Artificial IntelligenceRecent research reveals that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI development may soon consume an alarming amount of electricity, potentially rivaling the energy consumption of entire countries like Argentina, the Netherlands, or Sweden by 2027. The  research estimates that if Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) transitioned its entire search business to AI, it could use as much electricity as Ireland, reaching 29.3 terawatt-hours annually. However, this scenario assumes full-scale AI adoption using current hardware and software, which is faced by challenges like a limited supply of powerful GPUs. How Many Jobs will AI Replace By 2030?While the exact number of jobs AI will replace by 2030 may not be known but there are projections about the impact it will create. According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute study, nearly 12 million American workers may have to transition to new occupations by 2030, owing to the proliferation of AI with an aging population and the expansion of e-commerce. The study identifies that ai technologies could automate up to 30% of work hours in the US by 2030 and will affect roles in office support, customer service, and food services. It is also worth noting that positions in customer service and data entry are among the jobs already replaced by AI. Moreover, with the advent of self-checkouts, jobs in retail stores as cashiers have also been largely reduced. To read more about jobs AI will replace in the future, check our article Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.AI has evolved in several ways in recent years, with the industry now valued at over $100 billion. Heavyweights like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and OpenAI are in fierce competition, leading to the rapid development of sophisticated large language models. These models can outperform humans in different tasks, from strategy games to diagnosing cancers and composing music. However, they have not reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point where AI possesses human-like cognitive abilities. AGI is still a goal as AI has limitations in creativity and emotional awareness. It is due to this very limitation that we have several jobs that artificial intelligence can not replace.20 Jobs that Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace A contractor working on home repairs, perfecting the details of a homeowner's dream. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9MethodologyTo list jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace, we identified 3 common qualities that can make jobs resistant to AI. Firstly, jobs that involve complex and nuanced human interactions, like therapy and counseling, are far from being replaced by AI. Secondly, jobs that rely on creativity, innovation, and artistic expression, like artists, fashion designers, and chefs, are challenging for AI to replicate as they involve original thinking and personal expression. Lastly, jobs that demand specialized physical skills, dexterity, and expertise, such as surgeons, are generally less susceptible to AI replacement as they require precision and real-time decision-making with adaptability. To rank these jobs in order, we have scored these jobs out of a total score of 60 based on the representation of these three features on the basis of consensus from Reddit threads. A higher score indicates a lesser likelihood for the job being replaced by AI. The list is presented in ascending order. 20. Event PlannersIM Score: 20Event planners require human creativity and interpersonal skills to meet unique client needs and handle unforeseen circumstances. AI may assist with logistical tasks but can't replicate (even if it simulates) the emotional intelligence, intuition, and personal touch necessary for successful event planning.19. TeachersIM Score: 22While AI can provide information and assist in education or training, human teachers offer emotional support, adaptability to individual learning styles, and valuable mentorship. Teachers, especially vocational training teachers, foster creativity and precision, which AI cannot offer. It is one of the jobs least likely to be replaced by AI. 18. PlumbersIM Score: 24Plumbers deal with different and unstandardized plumbing systems, requiring problem-solving and adaptability. They must assess unique situations, account for local regulations, and consider the nuances of individual homes. AI lacks the human judgment necessary for plumbing tasks.17. ElectriciansIM Score:  26AI can't fully replace electricians because their job requires adapting to complex and unpredictable electrical systems, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring safety. Electricians also need to interact with clients, making interpersonal skills and judgment vital areas where AI struggles.16. Welder and MouldersIM Score: 28These professionals work on different projects with varying materials, thicknesses, and shapes, demanding precise control and expertise. They must make real-time adjustments based on visual and tactile feedback, which AI currently struggles to replicate accurately. Welding and molding also require creativity and innovation in problem-solving for complex, non-standard projects. It is worth mentioning that underwater welders have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. 15. Agricultural Equipment OperatorsIM Score: 30Agriculture often involves intricate decision-making based on weather conditions, soil quality, and crop maturity, requiring human judgment. Moreover, agriculture often involves working in unstructured, dynamic environments where AI rarely performs reliably. Reinforcement learning is one technique used to train AI models on such tasks and the technique is rife with challenges, namely, getting the model to learn optimal behavior.14. Clergy and Religious LeadersIM Score: 34Artificial intelligence lacks the human qualities of ""spirituality"" and moral judgment that are essential for clergy and religious leaders. These roles involve personal and emotional connections, guiding individuals through faith and life's complexities. It is one of the jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace. 13. NursesIM Score: 35Nurses offer emotional support, administer medication for patients, and make swift, ethical decisions. Since human touch and intuition are vital in nursing, AI can't fully replicate these capabilities. Besides, when one is sick, the warmth of human support becomes essential. Thus, nursing is one of the jobs AI will probably never replace. 12. Personal Shoppers and StylistsIM Score: 39Personal shoppers and stylists involve intricate human understanding of fashion trends and personal preferences. AI may assist with suggestions but can't grasp unique individual styles, emotions, and cultural nuances. It is one of the jobs AI can’t replace, not even chatGPT. 11. Chefs and Culinary ExpertsIM Score: 40Artificial intelligence can never replace culinary experts owing to the nuanced artistry, innovation, and sensory experiences of these professionals, which AI can not achieve. It can assist in recipe generation and optimization but can't match their holistic culinary expertise.10. Fashion DesignerIM Score: 42Artificial intelligence in fashion design lacks the intuition and cultural awareness that human designers possess. It can analyze data and generate designs but can't add the artistic flair and trend-setting oomph that make fashion designers uniquely creative and adaptable to ever-changing styles and tastes.9. Emergency RespondersIM Score: 44AI cannot replace emergency responders like firefighters because their roles demand quick physical responses to rapidly changing, life-threatening situations. Firefighters require complex decision-making and physical strength, mostly under unpredictable circumstances. It is one of the jobs that artificial intelligence can’t replace. 8. MusiciansIM Score: 46The job of artists like musicians is unlikely to be fully replaced by AI because creativity, emotion, and the ability to convey relatable human experiences are integral to art. For example, AI can compose music, but it can't infuse it with the personal experiences and emotions that make it truly meaningful.7. Social WorkersIM Score: 47AI can't fully replace social workers due to their role's deeply human and emotionally sensitive aspects. Social work entails understanding and addressing complex, personal, and often traumatic situations. It is one of the jobs that won't be automated by AI. 6. CarpentersIM Score: 48Carpenters create custom woodwork and structures, demanding creativity, craftsmanship, and adaptability.

Guardians of Genius: Securing Tomorrow’s Generative AI via Copyright Protection


By Swati Sharma & Nityesh Dadhich on October 23, 2023
Posted in Copyright




         

   
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

Gen-AI tools and the Copyright violation of an Unprecedented Scale
Data is the new oil of the 21st century. We all generate data in our daily lives, and their misuse by AI developers have often been criticised. Firstly, the AI developers have been criticized of unauthorised “web scarping” i.e. taking users’ data without their consent.[4] It is alleged that OpenAI scarped over 300 billion words from the internet, including “articles, websites, books, posts, including personal information obtained without users’ consent”[5] to train their software. In USA, the courts have recognized data as a ‘property’, therefore, such scarping raises allegations of data misappropriation and theft.[6]
Secondly, even if we upload a picture or any other data over the internet for public access such as on our blog or social media profile, we still maintain a reasonable expectation of ensuring our data to be safe and secure. In KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court recognised right to privacy as a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. If our data is used for training AI software without our specific consent then such negligent act results in the breach of trust, and it is an intrusion upon our privacy.[8]
Thirdly, the data generated by children and their privacy concerns stand at a separate pedestal. They stand at higher risk of abuse, discrimination, and exploitation. Unfortunately, AI lacks sufficient tools to prevent children from accessing their portal. In USA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) forbids monitoring, collecting data or using information from children unless valid parents’/guardian consent is obtained. Unfortunately, such provisions are missing in India, with self-reporting as the only check available, which is not effective.[9]
Fourthly, AI software(s) have also produced false or inaccurate paragraphs when they are asked to cite a specific author’s work, such as a poem. Such false result causes misinformation to the public, and it also hampers the moral rights of the authors by distorting their works.[10] The subsequent section shall answer how the Courts are addressing these concerns, thereby, giving a direction to the future course of copyright jurisprudence.
Judicial Intelligence to address the conundrum of Generative Artificial Intelligence
“Machine learning is no excuse to break the law…the data used to improve algorithms must be lawfully collected and lawfully retained”[11]
OpenAI claims that the data fed for AI training and execution is covered under the fair-use exception.[12] For instance, Section 52 of India’s Copyright Act, 1957 lays down certain fair usage exceptions such as “reading or recitation in public of reasonable extracts from a published literary or dramatic work” when extended to digital context[13]; or “the reproduction, for the purpose of research”[14], inter alia. Similarly, the US Jurisprudence determines fair usage based upon the following four factors[15]:  

Firstly, the purpose and character of the usage, whether it is commercial or educational. In Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music, the Court held that the protection would strengthen if the work is “transformative” i.e. if it supersedes the original creation, or adds something new, rather than merely being “expressive”.[16]
Secondly, the substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. For instance, OpenAI has claimed that the training material is not made public, rather it is the new content developed upon such material that is made available. Hence, they claim that the program is transformative.
Thirdly, the effect of the use upon the relevant market, or the value of the product within the relevant market. For instance, OpenAI claims that since the data set is consumed by the machines without presenting it to the humans, the authors would not lose any potential audience. However, New York Times, inter alia, is considering a legal action against OpenAI as the AI tool has “greatly diminished the need to visit the publisher’s website”.[17]
Fourthly, the determination involves consideration of the nature of the copyrighted work as well[18]. For instance, in Andy Warhol v. Goldsmith, the court held that if the secondary work shares the same or highly similar purpose, and if the secondary work is used for commercial purpose, then the justification of fair-use becomes especially difficult unless compelling reasons exist.[19]

Now, once the user’s query has generated an output, the US Courts then rely upon a two-pronged test to determine any copyright infringement in the result. The burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that, firstly, the software had “access to their works” to indicate the actual copying of the underlying work; and secondly, the software created a “substantially” similar output. Here, the second aspect is difficult to determine as it involves the consideration of various factors such as “similar concept and feel” or “overall look and feel” or the inability of an ordinary/ reasonable person to differentiate between the two works.[20] This is a subjective determination for each output produced by the AI software in response to the user’s query.
This suggests that both the AI user (whose search query generated the infringing content) and the AI company (which provided such platform) could be potentially liable for the copyright infringement. OpenAI argues that their AI systems “generally do not regenerate unaltered data from any particular work in their training corpus”[21]. Yet, despite OpenAI’s best claim, they may still be liable under “vicarious liability” if they failed to prevent an infringement.[22]
Moving on, the next section deals with the issues concerning the authorship of AI-generated texts, and it brings out clarity regarding the developing Indian jurisprudence. 
Indian Jurisprudence on GenAI – Past, Present and the Future
The US Copyright Office only recognises the work “created by humans” as eligible for protection.[23] The initial ownership goes to the creator of the work, and non-human authors have been denied copyright protection.[24] Broadly, a similar position ensues in India. Section 2(d) of the Copyright Act, 1957 defines an “author” in relation to computer generated work as any “person” who causes the work to be generated. Section 13 requires that such work must be “original”, however, the word “original” is not defined in the statute. The Indian Copyright Office has been uncertain about extending the protection to AI generated content. It has earlier issued a withdrawal notice where AI was a co-author with a natural person.[25]
The 161st Parliamentary Standing Committee Report found that the Copyright Act, 1957 is “not well equipped to facilitate authorship and ownership by Artificial Intelligence”.[26] For instance, Section 16 of the Act specifically provides that “no person” shall be entitled to the copyright protection, except in accordance to the provisions of this Act. However, the Report suggested that ‘patent protection’ should be extended to AI-generated works to “incentivize innovation and R&D”.[27] We suggest that this reasoning should be further extended to copyright protection for AI-generated content to encourage creativity and to enhance AI-based expressions.
Furthermore, Section 12 of India’s recent Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 dated 11th August 2023, lays down the “right to be forgotten”. It mandates the removal of the user’s personal data upon his/her request. This can act as an easy mechanism for removal of the copyright infringing material. However, practical concerns arise as once the AI-software is trained on a data set, it cannot “unlearn” itself.[28] For instance, ChatGPT’s opt-out function from data collection would only turn off the chat history. It means old data continues to be a part of the training, and only the new content is not used for “training purposes”. It does not provide any method to remove the previously fed data.[29] This is especially concerning as AI-tools are now being integrated on several platforms such as web-browsers, etc., enabling real time information upon each click.
The Indian Courts have been proactive in restraining the misuse of AI tools for copyright infringement. In Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life India[30], the Court issued injunction against the use of Artificial Intelligence to create fake, morphed content, especially for commercial purposes. It aimed to protect the personality rights of the individual. In Mareta v. Google Inc[31], the US District Court held that remedial measures such as to prevent copyright infringement and privacy protection must be construed broadly to include “new technologies”. This underlying idea for rapid evolution has been accepted by the Indian Courts as well. However, as the 161st Parliamentary Report suggested “there is a need to review the provisions of [the Copyright Act] on a priority basis”.[32]
Conclusion and Recommendation
AI-generated content is a reality, and it is penetrating deeper into our lives with each passing moment. This creates an urgent need to bring up comprehensive discussions on the elephant in the room. We reiterate the suggestions of the 161st Parliamentary Report to “create a separate category of rights for AI and AI related works”.[33] Furthermore, discussion must be initiated on the feasibility of the following suggestions:  firstly, to establish an independent AI Council for approval/ rejection of AI-platforms. Such body would be a ‘“Certification Board” for AI platforms, evaluating them on pre-defined standards. Secondly, to create and implement accountability platforms. AI Platforms such as GPT-4 are monetised, and any copyright infringement must involve monetary compensation for violation of rights, while adhering to our ethical principles. Thirdly, there is a need for effective transparency and cybersecurity protocols involving disclosure of data, and ensuring the right to erasure, in light of Section 12 of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.  Fourthly, to set up an AI Fund for immediate redressal of any future infringement, and to ensure penal provision to prevent the misuse of children’s data, and to protect the Right to Privacy granted under Article 21.[34]

Generative AI – those large language models that can create new content based on a prompt from a user – has been in widespread use for nearly a year, since the release of ChatGPT.  Legal professionals have taken a particular interest, according to Zach Warren. Warren is the manager of Technology and Innovation at the Thomson Reuters Institute. On the recent webcast “Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionals,” he noted that a full 82 percent of legal professionals believe generative AI can be used for legal work. That’s a significant number for a profession that sometimes moves slowly with new technology.  Warren was joined on the webcast by Zena Applebaum, VP of Product Marketing for Thomson Reuters, and Andrew Fletcher, Director of AI Strategy & Partnerships for Thomson Reuters Labs. Zena Applebaum, VP, Product Marketing, Thomson ReutersAndrew Fletcher, Director, AI Strategy and Partnerships, Thomson Reuters LabsZach Warren, Manager, Technology and Innovation, Thomson Reuters Institute      What is generative AI? Generative AI refers to a subset of AI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate new data, text, images, and even videos that mimic the characteristics of human-generated content. Applebaum noted that, “You can ask a question as though there were someone in the room with you, and the tech will generate new content – like a summary of bulleted list overview of a document.” ChatGPT, Bard, and CoPilot are examples of open model tools available now.   How does generative AI support legal work? Fletcher noted the distinction between automation- taking the human out of the task – and augmentation – humans using a tool to complete a task.  “Automation is done with caution because when you’re dealing with wanting to focus on accuracy and outcomes being correct, you need to be pretty confident the automation is going to deliver what it is that you need,” he said. “It’s appropriate for low-value repetitive tasks.” Augmentation, on the other hand, puts tools in the hands of experts who make decisions based on what the tools tell them. He and Applebaum agreed that the tools on the market now can help augment legal work – you just don’t want to rely on their output without verifying it. “These tools don’t replace lawyers. They augment them and help them be more efficient. You can get to a first draft faster – but output from AI will not be your final document.” Warren concurred: “These are tools, not independent entities,” he said.  For legal professionals just getting started with generative AI, Applebaum offered three main skills that will help them: Curiosity, prompting skills, and the ability to validate the responses. Watch the webcast to learn more about these skills. Risks and how to overcome them Privacy and hallucinations are two of the main risks associated with the tools that are widely available now.  Regarding privacy, it is sometimes the case that once you enter text – say, asking to summarize a document – the tool owns that content. It can learn from it or resurface it in other responses. This can cause real problems when you’re inputting your own work product or a client’s confidential information. Hallucinations are instances where the tool returns a plausible but completely made-up response, including made-up cases and facts.  To overcome both these risks, choose tools that guarantee the confidentiality of your data and that show you where their answers are coming from. Fletcher noted that instead of a typical “black box model” of AI, Thomson Reuters uses a retrieval augmented generator (RAG) that shows users where the answers come from, so they can validate them.   Thomson Reuters’ plans for generative AI in the legal industryApplebaum is certain the legal industry will adopt generative AI tools. “No lawyer types documents on a typewriter, and most of us carry previously unimaginable computing power in our pockets,” she said. She also noted that workers from Gen Z will expect the tools they use in their personal lives to be available professionally. They believe that AI will increase the value of their skills. Generative AI will certainly help legal professionals work more efficiently and with even more confidence. What will it mean for job security? There’s good news, Fletcher said: “The people who embrace the change will get to focus on more interesting work.” The webcast “Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionals,” is available on-demand.Watch it here.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceInnovationLegal Topics",http://schema.org,,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,"['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]",http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article is part of WorkLife’s special edition, which examines how the jobs and careers of Generation Z professionals will be reshaped and evolve in the AI-informed era. More from the series →
Generative-AI whiplash is fast becoming a standard response to the dizzying speed at which the technology is evolving. 
Its capabilities and flaws are puzzling leaders at schools and universities as many try to ban or regulate its use among students. Meanwhile companies are either embracing the tools and creating their own proprietary large language models (LLMs), or still evaluating how to best incorporate AI into their operations.
One cohort in particular is keen to experiment and learn exactly what these tools are capable of: Generation Z. Born between 1997 and 2012, this digital-first generation is open to harnessing the tools that will reshape how they perform their jobs over the course of their careers. 
Their openness however is stirring up an array of misconceptions. Here are some key myths about Gen Z workers and their use of generative AI in school, the workplace and their personal lives.
Myth: Gen Z workers are experts in AI and won’t need training

Gen Z workers are arguably more comfortable with the introduction of transformative new technology than those in other generations who grew up without advancements like smartphones and the internet. But that doesn’t mean Gen Zers know exactly how AI works. Many have interacted with predictive AI tools by way of personalized music and video recommendations, though their experience with newer generative AI tools is limited.
“It’s the start of a whole new era, a whole new ecosystem, and you cannot upfront be proficient with it,” said Alexey Korotich, vp of product at Wrike, a collaborative work management platform. “Additional skills are going to be required and people do not get those skills at birth,” he added.

Prompt engineering — the skill of knowing exactly what to put in ChatGPT and other generative AI tools to elicit the best, desired output which doesn’t sound generic — is seeing growing demand from employers, though it takes a decent amount of practice and time using the tools to truly understand and master. “Becoming AI experts will require extensive training,” said Jay Shankar, vp of global talent acquisition at Amazon Web Services.
Not only will Gen Zers need extensive training to master AI tools but they’ll also need to be taught in a way that’s tailored to them specifically and considers their unique experiences with technology. “Even though it may seem easy to use generative AI tools by entering a prompt and then getting a response, generative AI is a very sophisticated and complex technology,” Shankar said.
Best practices when it comes to prompt engineering — but even more so when it comes to responsible and ethical use of the tools — are paramount for Gen Z employees to fully grasp. 
“You need to understand the limitations of this technology, and you need to understand where it is helpful to use it, versus going to be actually misleading or harmful,” Korotich said. 
Harmful outputs are most often those that are inaccurate or biased – two key flaws with today’s AI tools. 
Myth: Gen Z workers aren’t reckless with AI
While Gen Z workers are more willing and eager to experiment with AI and learn exactly how it works, they still haven’t had enough professional experience to understand the implications of using it in a work setting. 
One major generational difference already posing a problem when it comes to AI is differing attitudes toward sharing information online or through other public channels. Younger workers who grew up with social media and few protections around their online privacy are accustomed to accepting cookies and typing in their birthdates to enter a web page — much unlike those in Generation X, or Baby Boomers.
They’re equally open to sharing information with LLMs like ChatGPT — including private company information.







            “We have worked with many organizations where people have taken Excel spreadsheets, uploaded them to public chatGPT to get something done, and have exposed companies data in that manner. And almost always, it's been Gen Z's that have been there and done that.""        


 

                Jason Averbook, senior partner and global leader of digital HR strategy, consulting firm Mercer.            







“We have worked with many organizations where people have taken Excel spreadsheets, uploaded them to public ChatGPT to get something done, and have exposed companies’ data in that manner,” said Jason Averbook, a senior partner and global leader of digital HR strategy at consulting firm Mercer. “And almost always, it’s been Gen Zs that have been there and done that,” Averbook added.
Their limited professional experience means they also have limited knowledge around safeguarding enterprise data, he said. “Gen Z needs to understand the ethics and governance that goes into generative AI in organizations before they just start using it the same way they would use it when they’re writing their thesis paper or things like that,” he said.
Myth: AI will make Gen Z workers lazy
A major myth about generative AI is that it encourages laziness, and in schools, that it’s a form of cheating. And laziness is an attribute Gen Z often gets labeled with (headlines range from it being a generation of quiet quitters, to fans of “Lazy Girl” jobs and bare minimum Mondays). 
But when it comes to AI, so-called laziness may result in higher efficiency. “Laziness is not necessarily a bad thing — it actually provokes the search for the tools that can do your job more effectively,” Korotich said.
The prevailing theme from experts is that AI will take over more mundane tasks and allow workers to perform more satisfying, engaging and higher-level work. AI tools currently are also helpful as a copilot or mentor for younger workers looking for a sounding board or expert to answer questions through tools like ChatGPT. 
“AI is not meant to do the work for you, but it’s there to help you save a ton of time on various tasks,” said Oliver Pour, an account executive at Luminance, an AI software for those in the legal field. 
And a human teamed up with AI can do much more than a human on their own. “This is not a new idea, a human plus the internet could do a lot more than just a human without the internet,” said Graham Glass, founder and CEO of Cypher Learning, an AI-powered platform designed to help educators generate curriculum and learning materials.







            “If you're in a good work environment, they're not going to allow you to be lazy because they're going to expect more.""         


 

                Graham Glass, CEO of Cypher Learning, an AI powered platform to help educators generate learning materials.            







Accordingly, the way we perform most jobs will change as the assumption they’re being done with AI becomes more commonplace. “If you’re in a good work environment, they’re not going to allow you to be lazy because they’re going to expect more,” said Glass.
Myth: AI will replace Gen Z workers
Gen Z isn’t the first generation expected to be replaced by new technology. Jobs have been made obsolete by technological innovation for more than a century. The introduction of computers led many to fear their jobs would become defunct. But computers, the internet, email, and other innovations “were built to improve our productivity, and generative AI has the potential to follow suit,” Shankar said. 
Accordingly, AI is expected to widely augment the way everyone does their jobs in the future. 
Many of the jobs that generative AI assists with are administrative. As such, tasks that would typically always have been assigned to a junior in a desk-based workplace, are now at risk of being carried out within minutes, rather than days, by AI tools as older workers realize they can get faster results this way. But that doesn’t mean Gen Z workers will be replaced, simply that their roles will evolve. 
Plus, all jobs are at risk of generative-AI driven change, not just Gen Z’s, according to an Indeed analysis of skills listed in over 55 million job postings. About 20% of jobs face high levels of potential exposure, and the higher the odds are that a job can be done remotely, the greater its potential exposure is, that report found.
“Some jobs are not necessarily going to be replaced, they’re going to be augmented, they’re going to be adapted to these new technologies so that people will continue to do the job but focus on the things where they can drive value,” Korotich said. 
“It can be a threat in a way that it can replace what you do today,” Korotich said. “But it can also be a huge opportunity that can truly get your productivity, and your level of impact that you, as an individual bring, to the next level,” he said.

On Friday, Professor Scott Galloway released ProfG.ai, a “digital twin” trained on his writing and capable of answering questions in his voice.  
That’s just one of many experiments with different models on how generative AI can impact the future of work.  
A few weeks ago, BCG released the results of a fascinating Harvard-led study that researched how more than 750 BCG consultants worldwide use GPT-4.  
BCG found that generative AI adoption was a “double-edged sword.”  There was high variability depending on how generative AI was used by consultants and type of task.  In creative product innovation, GPT-4 boosted performance by an average of 40%.  In business problem solving, GPT-4 dropped performance by 23%.  
What’s more, consultants don’t appear to have a sense of when GPT-4 is helping or hurting.  As BCG put it:
“People seem to mistrust the technology in areas where it can contribute massive value and to trust it too much in areas where the technology isn’t competent.”
BCG also found a “creativity trap” even when consultants used GPT-4 for tasks that showed the greatest performance gains.  Despite individual improvement, collective creativity was lower.  The homogenous output of GPT-4 reduced “diversity of thought” by 41%. 
A bigger potential risk is what the lead Harvard researcher in the study, Fabrizio Dell’Acqua, described as “falling asleep at the wheel.”  He said that people using AI tend to “switch off their brains” and “outsource their judgement to AI.”  This could lead to atrophying skills: 70% of the BCG consultants in the study worried that using GPT-4 would “stifle their creative abilities over time.”  
As one BCG consultant put it:
“Like any technology, people can rely on it too much. GPS helped navigation immensely when it was first released, but today people can’t even drive without a GPS. As people rely on a technology too much, they lose abilities they once had.”
There are two emerging models to adopting generative AI at work: the Centaur and the Cyborg.  The Centaur model draws a clear line between human and machine work for different tasks.  The Cyborg model integrates human and machine tasks throughout.
It’s hard to believe it’s only been ten-and-a-half months since OpenAI released ChatGPT.  It will take time and experimentation to figure out the best ways for organizations to adapt.  
One of my favorite quotes from Scott Brinker holds true in this age of AI and the future of work:
“Technology changes exponentially; organizations change logarithmically.”
Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:

KEY TAKEAWAYS
One-thirds of respondents to McKinsey’s survey said that their companies are using generative AI in at least one business function. More businesses are now looking to incorporate generative AI tools to reduce costs, optimize operations and find new revenue streams. The impact on job markets are inevitable.




Generative artificial intelligence is changing the business world. More businesses are now looking to incorporate generative AI tools to reduce costs, optimize operations, as well as find new revenue streams.
The growing popularity comes less than a year since the majority of generative AI tools, including text generator ChatGPT and image creator Midjourney, were introduced in 2022.
Generative AI is artificial intelligence technology that enables users to generate texts, images, sounds, animations, and other types of data based on a variety of inputs.
According to a 2023 survey by consulting firm McKinsey, one-third of survey respondents said their companies are using generative AI (GAI) in at least one business function.
There is so much hype around AI technology that 40% of the survey respondents said that their companies will increase their investments in overall AI.
Technology heavyweights like Google, Adobe, and Meta have released several GAI tools in the past year. Google has incorporated the technology to help users write emails and edit photos. Adobe launched image-generating tools to compete with front runners such as Midjourney. Meta rolled out a generative AI tool to help advertisers to generate several versions of their advertisements.Advertisements




Google CEO Sundar Pichai is so convinced about the AI revolution that he said that “AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes” and spoke of Google pivoting to an “AI-first company.”
Key Takeaways


The 2023 generative AI survey by McKinsey found that one-third of respondents stated that their companies are using generative AI in at least one business function.
40% of survey respondents said that their companies plan to increase their investments in overall AI.
Generative AI is expected to automate 60 to 70 percent of work activities, according to McKinsey, although this doesn’t necessarily mean the automation of entire job roles.
The service operations sector is expected to be the most impacted by the growth of generative AI, potentially leading to a decrease in the workforce in customer care and back-office support.


Are Jobs Safe From Generative AI?
Let’s talk about a worrying theme that everyone associates with the growth of AI: job losses.
Which industries are the most vulnerable to AI-related job losses, and which job markets will come out relatively unscathed?
Most Impacted
According to McKinsey, the emergence of generative AI is expected to automate 60 to 70 percent of work activities. However, the consulting firm said that “this doesn’t necessarily translate into the automation of an entire role.”
Jobs in the service operations sector is expected to be the one most affected by the growth of generative AI. The world will likely see a decrease in workforce in customer care and back-office support as humans are replaced by AI.
McKinsey’s survey revealed that marketing, sales, product development, and software engineering are the most likely to use generative AI tools. Thus, job markets in technology and financial services sectors are expected to see disruptive change from gen AI.
“Industries relying most heavily on knowledge work are likely to see more disruption—and potentially reap more value,” said McKinsey.
Least Impacted
Job markets in manufacturing-based industries such as aerospace, automotives, and advanced electronics are expected to be least impacted by the emergence of GAI.
“This stands in contrast to the impact of previous technology waves that affected manufacturing the most and is due to gen AI’s strengths in language-based activities, as opposed to those requiring physical labor,” wrote McKinsey.
Generative AI Use Cases in The Office
Here are the most popular use cases of GAI, according to 1,684 participants from different regions, industries, companies, and specialties surveyed by McKinsey:

Crafting first drafts of text documents
Personalized marketing
Summarizing text documents
Identifying trends in customer needs
Drafting technical documents
Creating new product designs
Use of chatbots for customer service
Forecasting service trends
Business opportunities in generative AI

Corporations see AI technology as the biggest disruption to come since the internet. Many are using AI to cut costs, while front runners are looking to create new markets to reap rewards from.
McKinsey’s survey showed that only 23 percent of respondent said AI contribute to at least 5 percent of their company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The data suggests that AI technology is still in its early innings and has enormous room to capture value.
Companies that are leading the AI revolution are playing the long game and are prioritizing the creation of new revenue sources over cost reduction. McKinsey refers to them as “AI high performers.”
These companies are creating new AI-based products, revamping existing products with AI capabilities, using AI in product development, supply chain management, product-development-cycle optimization, and human resource performance management.
“We continue to see a set of AI high performers that are building out the foundations and capabilities that allow them to generate value.
One way to interpret this is that “the rich are getting richer” when it comes to extracting value from AI. We’ll be interested in seeing whether the great interest in generative AI opens the door to higher overall adoption of AI going forward,” said Michael Chui, Partner at McKinsey Global Institute.
Risks Related to Generative AI
Inaccuracy was the most cited risk among survey respondents with regards to generative AI adoption. Cybersecurity risks and intellectual property infringement were among the top three risks.
McKinsey’s survey also indicated that most companies were not fully prepared to deal with risks related to GAI adoption. Only 21 percent of respondents said that their companies had established policies that govern an employee’s use of GAI at work.
While less than 40% said their organizations were actively working to mitigate risks related to inaccuracy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property infringement arising from generative AI.
In order to unlock the full potential of generative AI technology, there is a rising need for companies to place governance and operating model for AI use, learn how to best manage third parties, and find balance between short-term gains and long-term growth.
“The real trap, however, is that companies look at the risk too narrowly. There is a significant range of risks—social, humanitarian, sustainability—that companies need to pay attention to as well. In fact, the unintended consequences of generative AI are more likely to create issues for the world than the doomsday scenarios that some people espouse,” said Alexander Sukharevsky, Senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.
The Bottom Line
The wave of generative AI is a transformative force with vast potential for businesses, but it also presents challenges.
As industries increasingly adopt these technologies, it is essential to strike a balance between automation and human expertise, ensure ethical use, and prioritize ongoing education and reskilling to harness the full potential of generative AI while mitigating its drawbacks.

The US Space Force has decided that generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) and large-language models can't be used by employees of the space service.As Bloomberg reports, an internal memo written by by Dr. Lisa A. Costa, first permanent Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of the US Space Force, was sent to the ""Guardian Workforce"" on Sept. 29. The memo explains how a temporary ban is now in place on such tools and until further notice. A spokesperson for Space Force referred to it as a ""strategic pause."" As to why a ban is required, Costa points to concerns over cybersecurity, data handling, and procurement requirements within the space service when relying on external/web-based AI tools. The ban is temporary because Costa admits generative AI ""will undoubtedly revolutionize our workforce and enhance Guardian’s ability to operate at speed,"" but needs to be used responsibly. That suggests some kind of phased introduction with strict rules around the use of AI tools is required, and that's going to take time to plan and implement. However, it's an unusual decision when you consider at least 500 people at Space Force were using Ask Sage, which is a ""secure and extensible"" GPT platform catering to government and corporate teams created by former US Air Force chief software engineer Nicolas Chaillan.

If we want to achieve the net zero target by 2050, we need to transform our economy into one that works in tandem with the principle of sustainability. Fortunately, we can already see glimpses of these transformations in our global economy.

The green transition alone is estimated to create 30 million jobs in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emission technologies by 2030. If you look at the top ten fastest-growing roles on Linkedin over the last four years, they include jobs you might not have even heard of before - sustainability analysts, sustainability managers, power engineers, and so on.

Artificial Intelligence and Climate Battle

There are already many ways in which experts have imagined the role that artificial intelligence can play in our climate battle in the form of AI Innovations.&nbsp;

Transport management: The potential for AI in the mobility sector is almost limitless, ranging from changing traffic flow based on particulate matter emissions to making the public transport system more robust and efficient - thereby reducing the amount of carbon emissions.

Energy consumption regulation: AI predictions can help in grid management and smartly regulate energy consumption inside homes, offices and even SMEs by using smart metres that can make vital and real-time decisions based on the needs of the space.

Agriculture and smart food management: AI can also be used to upskill our workforce working in the food systems. Farmers can be skilled to help provide a path towards a more sustainable farming practice. Using drones or even smartphone and images captured, AI can help to monitor and measure crop and soil health. Farmers could be taught how to create an automated water distribution system, access soil health, and even predict weather changes in real&ndash;time and give information so that farmers can act accordingly.

Climate change: The United Nations Environment Programme is already using AI to analyse complex datasets to accurately predict carbon concentration in the atmosphere, monitor glaciers, and measure sea level rises.

The new reality: The combination of AI along with Metaverse can actually render the virtual realm as a more immersive and engaging reality. Can you imagine how much we could reduce our carbon emissions if leaders and executives around the world didn&rsquo;t have to travel for every conference? It is estimated that transitioning from in-person to virtual conferencing can actually reduce our carbon footprint by 94 per cent and energy use by 90 per cent.

But, these are just the most logistical and immediate ways in which the forces of AI are going to empower us for the climate battle. What about the workforce that is going to create these green solutions,&nbsp; and run these green technologies.

If we want the green economy to truly thrive, then sustainability needs to be taught horizontally across all subjects and professions as a core principle.

Our green workforce cannot just become an added layer of expertise, but a foundation that cuts across every single worker. We need energy-conscious engineers, environmental lawyers and eco-friendly businessmen. And for too long, our education system has been struggling to inculcate a more personalised learning journey.&nbsp;

Personalised learning paths: AI can be used to create and deploy personalised learning paths to impart green skills in a more effective manner. Its ability to collect, analyse, and learn from vast amounts of data allows AI-powered educational platforms to create highly personalised learning paths for each learner.

Simulation models: Not only can sustainability be taught in a more fun and immersive manner, but by using both immersive learning technologies like AR/VR and AI, simulation training models can train workers on how to assemble a windmill or repair a solar panel or even give a shop floor experience of servicing or repairing electric cars. Learners can get hands-on experience and build newer skills even when they&rsquo;re just sitting in their classrooms. And even our manufacturing workforce can be trained to use better machinery through simulation models.

Language and location agnostic: What&rsquo;s perhaps most crucial in a context like India is that these learning models can easily be deployed in any language and any location with minimal infrastructure cost and travel.

Despite all its promises, AI cannot solve the climate crisis in isolation. We have to think of it as one of the many tools in our arsenal of weapons in this battle against climate change, and deploy it thoughtfully. What we also need to do is develop a highly skilled green workforce to fuel the green economy. At this moment, India has the potential to become the global green hub if we can effectively upskill our workforce into a green workforce.

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in State Government


Oct. 16, 2023

Commentary
Webinars 



















On September 6, 2023, the NGA Center for Best Practices hosted a virtual event, “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence in State Government,” co-organized with the Center for Scientific Evidence in Public Issues at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS EPI Center).
The event aimed to provide state leaders with foundational knowledge about AI technologies and applications in state government. National experts and state leaders discussed both the potential and risks of AI applications and policies to help ensure its responsible use in the public sector.
The Latest In Washington, D.C., On AI


Sean Gallagher, Deputy Director for Government Affairs at AAAS, provided an overview of what the federal government and Congress are doing to regulate and oversee this technology. To date, there are no overarching federal regulations on the responsible development and use of AI. In practice, states are leading the way on new AI guidance. Much of the current focus at the federal level is about the impact of AI on jobs and the economy, equity in AI and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge.


In practice, states are leading the way on new AI guidance.


Gallagher described these recent federal-level activities:

White House: In October 2022, the White House released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights around principles that people should be able to expect from automated systems such as requiring entities to disclose when they use AI, giving individuals the ability to opt out, putting into place legal protections where the use of AI may cause someone harm, and ensuring individuals have agency over how their data is used and how it may affect equity.
Commerce/NIST: The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) influences and sets standards for AI use in the federal government. In 2019, NIST issued the first tools for mitigating bias. In January 2023, the agency released a voluntary AI Risk Management Framework with a focus on governance and consideration of the entire AI life cycle when measuring, mapping and managing risks.
FTC, CFPB, DOJ, EEOC: In April 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) jointly issued a statement on enforcement efforts against discrimination and bias in automated systems. In 2023, the FTC began new investigations into inaccuracies stemming from the use of generative AI.
Congress: U.S. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York is leading a bipartisan effort called the Safe Innovation Framework for AI with three other senators. First announced in June 2023, the bipartisan AI framework has five themes for AI legislation: safety, innovation, accountability, alignment with democratic values, and transparency.

Gallagher noted that AI is getting a lot of attention on Capitol Hill now, with many legislative efforts focused on AI. To date, AI has not fallen neatly along partisan lines. AI will be a cross-jurisdictional issue because it affects everything from healthcare to transportation and education.

Why Generative AI has Grabbed the World’s Attention Since Late 2022
Ellie Pavlick, Brown University Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Linguistics, compared traditional AI with generative AI. Professor Pavlick noted that we’ve been using AI systems in different capacities, such as predicting the weather, for the past several decades. Traditional AI models were often based on tabular data that was understood and yielded “yes or no” type outputs and predictions, such as answers to questions about whether it might rain or not. AI models of all types have received more attention recently as they’ve been used in high-impact applications such as hiring.


Pavlick noted generative AI is a new type of AI with open-ended outputs that aren’t yes or no decisions, and that they work like neural networks that learn associations such as common word pairs for a vocal language model. The model is first trained to predict the next word in a sentence and then sequences of words through a Google-like search of the Internet.


Now is a good time to begin using and understanding the technology within safe or “sandboxed” domains so we are ready to adapt quickly in response to progress.


She noted three major risks with generative AI: “hallucination,” thwarted technical guardrails and bias:

Hallucination: Generative AI models don’t know what they don’t know, so they may make up answers, whether true or not, when they do not have access to a database to ground the model in reality. For example, when Pavlik asked a generative AI system to create a biography of her, it made up awards she had never received. This is referred to as “hallucination.”
Technical issues: OpenAI and Google have worked to prevent generative AI models from, for example, generating false news stories or giving instructions on how to make a bomb. However, AI researchers have shown that it is easy to bypass technical guardrails through the same guess-and-check methods used by legitimate AI researchers.
Bias: With both traditional and generative AI, the relationship between inputs and outputs results from a statistical algorithm which is subject to unfair bias and other risks. Generative AI models, however, work in an unstructured way. The inputs are essentially a black box (pulled from the world wide web), and the associations that are made by the AI model can be hard to inspect. Compared to traditional AI, which benefits from decades of research, generative AI is too new to have recommended solutions to bias yet. As an example, Pavlick noted generative AI will most likely display pictures of white males when asked to create or display a picture of a surgeon.

She noted that large language models and generative AI, in general, open up exciting possibilities, but currently there are more questions than answers. Over the next 3-5 years we will likely see rapid advances in our understanding of the risk landscape.
While AI has enormous potential to make predictions or to help with decision-making and automating routine tasks, its risks should be weighed carefully. She told the audience that now is a good time to begin using and understanding the technology within safe or “sandboxed” domains so we are ready to adapt quickly in response to progress.

How States are Using AI
State speakers at the event included:

Washington Chief Technology Officer Nick Stowe
Ohio Chief Information Officer & Assistant Director of the Administrative Services Department Katrina Flory
Utah Chief Information Officer, Department of Technology Services Alan Fuller

The state speakers discussed ways their states are using AI to increase productivity and efficiencies creatively. They shared examples of AI use in everything from fraud detection to chat bots to identifying cattle brands. States are also implementing policies and related activities to explore the risks of AI, putting out guidelines on the uses of generative AI by government staff, standing up advisory committees and study centers, and implementing procurement guides based on principles of responsible and safe AI use. In addition, they addressed their challenges and concerns about working with AI at this time.
You can watch each of the state speakers’ presentations at this link, or below. A summary of key points made by each state are presented here:

Washington state is applying computer vision and pattern recognition for detecting and preventing wildfires. The state is also using generative AI for software code development through an application called Copilot; since it’s a relatively new application for the state, they are taking a cautious and purposeful approach. In terms of AI policies, the state is applying its existing privacy principles. The Washington state privacy officer co-chairs the state AI committee. Washington published interim guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI in state government. Washington also developed procurement guidelines (heavily drawn from the NIST Risk Management Framework) to ensure new AI tools are aligned with state principles.
The state of Ohio is using AI for chat bots on the state website, OHIO.gov, and for predicting fraud in unemployment insurance. InnovateOhio, an organization founded by Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, led recent AI Forums in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus that focused on using AI as a tool for productivity, education, customer service and quality of life. All three forums reached capacity within hours of being announced. The Lieutenant Governor assembled AI thought leaders from the education, business and technology fields to help lead the discussions. Attendees included K-12, higher education and workforce development professionals, technology and business leaders, and state and local elected officials.
Utah is using AI for threat detection in cybersecurity. Its Department of Agriculture is using AI to identify livestock brands using computer vision, saving significant time from the prior manual process. The state is currently drafting a policy on the use of generative AI, which generally encourages its use but advises caution. The state also created a Center of Excellence in AI. Utah is taking an enterprise approach to AI where any AI use is taking place within the state’s internal enterprise system, not on the open web. This allows the state to make sure that any data entered via a prompt won’t be made public, helping to ensure quality outputs from any AI models.


State AI Resources
The NGA Center for Best Practices has compiled a state resource list on artificial intelligence that currently provides links to federal-level activities, state executive branch activities, state legislative actions, local-level activities, and resources for technical assistance. As additional items are identified, the resource list will be expanded.
Governors’ offices and other policy experts and stakeholders are encouraged to contact NGA to share input on the resource list or offer suggestions of specific AI topics the NGA Center and the AAAS EPI Center can address in future events. NGA’s intended audience includes Governors’ advisors and staff, state policymakers and executive leaders, state procurement officials, state chief information and technology officers, state offices that oversee automated systems such as public benefits distribution, government hiring, fraud detection or other systems.
The AAAS EPI Center also has AI resources to share on the EPI Center website which includes, for example, Foundational Issues in AI and Glossary of AI Terms and other useful resources.

AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are based on large language models that are fed a lot of information.
They're also trained by humans who guide the system to spit out appropriate and accurate responses.
Computer science experts explained to Insider how the bots determine what to say next.

ChatGPT and other chatbots driven by artificial intelligence can speak in fluent, grammatically sound sentences that may even have a natural rhythm to them.But don't be lulled into mistaking that well-executed speech for thought, emotion, or even intent, experts say. A chatbot is, in essence, no more than a machine performing mathematical calculations and statistical analysis to call up the right words and sentences. Bots like ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text, which allows them to interact with human users in a natural way. There's also a lot of training done by humans, who help smooth out any wrinkles.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, says on its website that its models are instructed on information from a range of sources, including from its users and material it has licensed.

Here's how AI chatbots workAI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are based on large language models, or LLMs, which are programs trained on volumes of text obtained from published writing and information online, which is generally produced by humans. The systems are trained on series of words and learn the importance of words in those series, experts said. So all of that imbibed knowledge not only trains large language models on factual information, but it helps them divine patterns of speech and how words are typically used and grouped together. Chatbots are further trained by humans on how to provide appropriate responses and limit harmful messages. One AI data trainer who works at Invisible Technologies, a company contracted to train ChatGPT, previously told Insider they are tasked with identifying factual inaccuracies; spelling and grammar errors; and harassment when testing the chatbot's responses.

""You can say, 'This is toxic, this is too political, this is opinion,' and frame it not to generate those things,"" said Kristian Hammond, a computer science professor at Northwestern University. Hammond is also the director of the university's Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence.When you ask a chatbot to answer a simple factual question, the recall process can be straightforward: It is deploying a set of algorithms to choose the most likely sentence to respond with. It selects the best possible responses within milliseconds, and of those top choices, presents one at random. That's why asking the same question repeatedly can generate slightly different answers.Chatbots can also break down questions into multiple parts and answer each part in sequence, as if thinking through the question.Say you asked the bot to name a US president who shares the first name of the male lead actor of the movie ""Camelot."" The bot might answer first that the actor in question is Richard Harris. It will then use that answer to give you Richard Nixon as the answer to your original question, Hammond said.

Chatbots aren't perfect — and they can get stuff wrongAI chatbots run into the most trouble when asked questions they don't have the answer to. They simply don't know what they don't know, so instead of refusing to answer, they extrapolate, based on what they do know, and make a guess. The issue is that they don't tell you they're guessing — they may simply present information as fact. When a chatbot invents information that it presents to a user as factual, it's called a ""hallucination.""The possibility of ChatGPT spitting out a hallucination is, in part, why some tech experts warn chatbot users to be careful. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study, researchers found that people using ChatGPT at work can actually perform worse on certain tasks if they take the chatbot's outputs at face value and don't screen them for errors.""This is what we call knowledge of knowledge or metacognition,"" said William Wang, an associate professor teaching computer science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He's also a co-director of the university's natural language processing group.

""The model doesn't really understand the known unknowns very well,"" he said.

However, experts who have researched GAI for decades advise people not to allow robots to take over before guardrails have been built through legislation and norms of use. It's possible that GAI won't result in job losses, but there's no denying that HR specialists who use it will be in more demand than those who don't. By June 2024, 58% of firms, according to Mercer, plan to implement GAI in HR. Although 76% believe it will increase efficiency, the strategy goes beyond simple cost-cutting.Using cues, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), may produce text, images, and even music. It produces output by combining algorithms and deep learning models with patterns and data that it has been trained on. According to a recent WEF study, industry transformation, including using artificial intelligence and other text, picture, and speech processing technologies, will result in a 23% change in worldwide employment over the next five years.Utilising generative AI carries several risks, biases, and errors, and employees often lack the knowledge and abilities necessary to optimise the advantages and reduce the risks. In this article, let&rsquo;s explore the prospects and risks associated with the use of Generative AI in HR, and find out its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats through SWOT analysis.Saving time with GenAIWith its unmatched efficiency and accuracy, generative AI can automate regular HR processes like reviewing resumes, responding to frequently requested queries, and setting up interviews. This automation not only reduces the chance of human error, which improves the fairness and accuracy of these processes, but it also frees up HR experts' time.While it has the ability to save HR departments a lot of time by automating repetitive processes and helping with tasks like answering common employee questions, HR leaders must make sure they're embracing solutions that won't put their businesses at risk. Collecting and analysing vast amounts of employee data raises privacy concerns. Leaders should create ethical procurement guidelines for screening vendors and test any AI technology before implementing it. HR departments must navigate the delicate balance between collecting data for insights and respecting employees' privacy.Does GenAI put creativity at risk? With the ability to provide fresh ideas or solutions that humans would not have thought of, generative AI has the potential to stimulate creativity and innovation. Through the democratisation of information and creativity, GAI promotes creativity, innovation, and the ability to solve challenging problems. AI models can sometimes generate content that raises ethical questions. For example, they can generate essays, art, or music that closely resembles the work of human creators, potentially leading to intellectual property disputes. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to approach the use of generative AI with caution and ethical considerations. Could GenAI be a tool of misinformation?For better decision-making, generative AI is a powerful tool. It can produce actionable insights to help HR decision-makers make more informed choices by examining patterns and forecasting trends. A generative AI solution, for instance, may help identify which candidates are most likely to succeed in particular roles or flag workers who may be about to look for new possibilities.Gartner predicts that by 2027, 80% of business marketers will create a specific unit to handle content authenticity in order to counteract false information.In HR, for instance, this can imply that an AI system unintentionally spreads inaccurate or out-of-date information about a company's policies or job positions, causing a chain reaction of confusion and possibly serious legal issues.SWOT Analysis for aligning GenAI with human needs and limitationsWhile all the above aspects are common, it becomes crucial for every organisation to go through its own set of compliances, opportunities, and risks associated with GenAI implementation in HR.Conducting a SWOT Analysis will help you determine what are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with your GenAI software for your organisation&rsquo;s human resources:Here's a breakdown of a SWOT analysis for GenAI software:    AI software has significant strengths, such as automation, data processing, and predictive analytics, which can benefit various industries. However, it also faces challenges related to complexity, bias, and ethical concerns, as well as regulatory and security risks. Understanding the SWOT analysis of AI software is essential for organisations and individuals looking to harness its potential while mitigating its weaknesses and threats.In conclusion, the integration of generative AI into HR processes offers several advantages in terms of efficiency, personalisation, diversity, and data-driven decision-making. However, these benefits come with potential risks related to bias, privacy, job displacement, data security, and ethical considerations.

SUNY Chancellor John B. King, Jr. said, “SUNY is at the forefront of the wave of development and application of artificial intelligence into higher education and the workforce through research and scholarship, and is proud of our role in supporting Governor Hochul’s vision for leading the nation on AI. SUNY’s AI Research Group brings together top experts and practitioners to cement SUNY as a global leader in AI-focused education, research, and workforce development. I would like to thank Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature for their ongoing investment in AI and, in particular, their investment in the first-ever New York State endowment matching fund, which will spur significant research, including into AI, at our university centers.”
The UAlbany and IBM $20 million collaboration forms the Center for Emerging Artificial Intelligence Systems (CEAIS), which will power new AI research projects with the help of advanced cloud computing and emerging hardware out of the IBM Research AI Hardware Center. The announcement was made from SUNY’s inaugural AI Symposium at UAlbany.
The center is the next evolution in UAlbany’s  AI Plus initiative, which is integrating teaching and learning about AI across the university’s research and academic enterprise, from data science and semiconductor design to philosophy and the arts.
University at Albany President Havidán Rodríguez said, “Researchers across UAlbany’s nine schools and colleges are employing artificial intelligence to power new discoveries about our world, and we are committed to giving them the best tools to develop critical new knowledge and advance the state of the art in their fields. The Center for Emerging Artificial Intelligence Systems will significantly expand UAlbany researchers’ access to AI supercomputing resources and make our University a leading academic test bed for some of the latest computing technology developed by IBM.”

Activate your Online Access NowArticle contentThe goal is “to continue the important fact-finding work to inform copyright policy in an era where content, including content that seems creative and original, can be routinely generated by an AI system.”The National Post reported earlier this month that the federal government doesn’t know how Canadian copyright law applies to systems like ChatGPT, and is following multiple lawsuits in the United States. Court cases from comedian Sarah Silverman, a group of artists, Getty Images, and authors including John Grisham and George R.R. Martin, among others, allege generative artificial intelligence systems infringe on copyright by using copyrighted works without permission.“These systems can generate novel creative content in a wide variety of forms and even of quality comparable to works created by talented human artists,” said the consultation document released Thursday.Generative artificial intelligence like Open AI’s ChatGPT uses existing material to train the systems, which can produce text, audio or video in response to prompts. The rapid emergence of the technology in the past year has left governments grappling with how to regulate it, including in terms of copyright.Advertisement 3Story continues belowArticle contentOn one side are the rights holders and creators who want protections against the use of their works for training AI, and who are likely to urge the government to keep a human element to copyright authorship, the government outlined in an earlier document obtained through access to information. On the other, tech companies argue that using protected works to train AI systems isn’t an infringement of copyright, and are likely to support copyright protection for AI-generated content.The government indicated in the consultation it wants to balance the two perspectives. It said it wants to support innovation and investment in both AI and Canada’s creative industries.It’s seeking input on how copyright law should deal with the use of copyrighted material for training generative AI systems, as well as whether it should change the copyright and authorship regimes to account for AI-generated content. Comments are due Dec. 4.“AI can now create content that is difficult to distinguish from content created by human persons,” the consultation noted. “Over the years, AI systems’ capacity to independently generate works or other subject matter has increased and that is only expected to continue. There are now a number of AI applications that can write movie scripts, software, and music with little human input beyond the development of the AI itself.”The consultation paper outlined different options, including clarifying that copyright protection only applies to works created by humans, or attributing authorship to the person who set up the AI-generated work to be created, an approach that could “mean that AI-generated works receive similar copyright protection as works created by humans.”Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

Artificial Intelligence and work: How will it affect the future of work?  Telefónica Follow          Communication Team04/10/2023 Reading time: 4 min  Listen  Artificial intelligence, AI, involves a process of automation focused on mimicking human capabilities, such as reasoning or learning, to perform repetitive tasks. But what is the relationship between artificial intelligence and work?This technology has been considered the first technological development capable of altering the human workforce, as a study by OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania confirms that 80 % of the US workforce could be affected.While this is only a prediction, work will undoubtedly be one of the social domains most altered by AI. This reaffirms previous analyses such as that of technology consultancy Gartner, which already in 2019 indicated that 85% of interactions with customers will not require human representatives.How will artificial intelligence affect employment? The answer will take time to see which jobs will disappear and what new needs will emerge in the labour market.What are the areas of application of artificial intelligence in the workplace?The workplace is one of the main fields of application of AI. Thanks to this technology, companies can optimise production processes. In addition, they can improve productivity and increase the safety and efficiency of workflows. In addition, automation makes it possible to obtain customer data during the sales process in order to analyse their movements and develop personalised strategies.According to an Accenture analysis, almost 73% of companies worldwide are prioritising AI over other digital investments to improve their operational resilience.

But what is the relationship between artificial intelligence and work?\n\n\n\nThis technology has been considered the first technological development capable of altering the human workforce, as a study by OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania confirms that 80 % of the US workforce could be affected.\n\n\n\nWhile this is only a prediction, work will undoubtedly be one of the social domains most altered by AI. This reaffirms previous analyses such as that of technology consultancy Gartner, which already in 2019 indicated that 85% of interactions with customers will not require human representatives.\n\n\n\nHow will artificial intelligence affect employment? The answer will take time to see which jobs will disappear and what new needs will emerge in the labour market.\n\n\n\nWhat are the areas of application of artificial intelligence in the workplace?\n\n\n\nThe workplace is one of the main fields of application of AI. Thanks to this technology, companies can optimise production processes. In addition, they can improve productivity and increase the safety and efficiency of workflows. In addition, automation makes it possible to obtain customer data during the sales process in order to analyse their movements and develop personalised strategies.\n\n\n\nAccording to an Accenture analysis, almost 73% of companies worldwide are prioritising AI over other digital investments to improve their operational resilience. This technological development is set to have a major impact and benefit in the services sector, most notably in finance and customer experience, as it is expected to be very useful in resolving repetitive and frequent issues.\n\n\n\nHuman capital management can also be transformed by the application of automation.

There’s an understandable nervousness among any workforce when you start talking about automation.
It’s actually been 10 years since Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne released their seminal paper ‘The Future of Employment’, which contained a list of occupations with an automation probability score. It was a moment that launched a spate of headlines claiming robots were coming for our jobs.
For field services teams, this has been a slow burn. As the paper suggests, “the manual tasks of service occupations are less susceptible to computerisation, as they require a higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability.” And yet, the workforce is under pressure, not so much from automation but from the fact that it is ageing.
To compound the problem, not enough millennials and ‘Gen Zers’ are seeing the profession as an attractive career option.
According to research, almost three-quarters of companies (73 per cent) identify an ageing workforce as a potential threat to their field service operations. Meanwhile, over two-thirds (67 per cent) of businesses feel that technology plays a key role in attracting new talent. The challenge is which technologies and to what extent an organisation commits.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that AI and automation are going to play a significant role in field service operations. Generative AI is going to be at the heart of this. ChatGPT, a product of US-based not-for-profit organisation OpenAI, believes it has the ability ‘to limit the impact of a shrinking and ageing field service workforce in several ways.’
Overcoming a major issue
Field service has a major workforce recruitment and retention problem. The majority of the workforce is nearing retirement which means that we are losing their expertise, their knowledge and their ability to complete work.
It also leaves a void that is not being filled by new entrants, who are not as interested in the type of work being done in field service. This is where the capabilities of ChatGPT can be transformational. 
However, the outgoing workforce isn’t really where the potential lies. The real value lies in the next-generation workforce.
ChatGPT can help organisations capture and organise the unstructured knowledge and experience of the workforce and make it accessible in a format that is desirable for the next generation of employees.
As opposed to viewing paper manuals, calling a friend, and completing countless forms to close out a service job, consider an experience where an engineer has access to relevant and contextual information via a query, with work instructions overlayed visually via Augmented Reality, and work summarised and documented via generative AI.
While it might seem futuristic, it’s the type of vision for field service that organisations must have to create a marketable product for the next generation workforce. These potential entrants are digitally native, they’ve grown up on the tools of today and are constantly tinkering with the likes of ChatGPT.
Organisations must be able to provide these technologically-savant workers with the tools, information, and working models that they are already familiar with to make the profession of field service more relevant.
If they can provide them with a way to engage with the experience and knowledge of former generations to become more proficient in the craft, open up new opportunities for learning and growth, and create working opportunities that could be remote-first or data-focused, then it changes the profile of what a career in field service looks like.  
The point is that automation can enable field engineers to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively.
By automating mundane tasks and improving asset intelligence, field service teams can optimise work schedules, parts ordering and parts delivery times. This reduces unnecessary truck rolls and improves customer satisfaction through more accurate and efficient maintenance work.
Collaboration between support teams and engineers on a common platform and using real-time asset data also helps to identify opportunities for new contracts or device upgrades.
There are, of course, some things technology cannot replace, such as engineer experience, but this is about how to use technology to manage skills gaps, attract new engineers and even unretire some of the older ones. The technology is there to make the job easier and more effective. Regardless of age, that must be a good thing.

SILICON Valley’s feverish embrace of large language models (LLMs) shows no sign of letting up. Google is integrating its chatbot Bard into every one of its services, while OpenAI is imbuing its own offering, ChatGPT, with new senses, such as the ability to “see” and “speak”, envisaging a new kind of personal assistant. But deep mysteries remain about how these tools function: what is really going on behind their shiny interfaces, which tasks are they truly good at and how might they fail? Should we really be betting the house on technology with so many unknowns?
There are still large…

Everyone is worried about Artificial Intelligence. From writers in Hollywood to computer programmers, recent advances in technology are causing concern about what Generative AI is going to mean for the future of work, our society and the wider world.  Is there nothing machines will not be able to do?

We have spent a decade researching the impacts of AI. Ten years ago, we wrote a paper estimating that some 47% of US-based jobs could be automated in principle, as AI and mobile robotics expanded the scope of tasks that computers can do.
Our estimates were based on the premise that, while computers might eventually be able to do most tasks, humans would continue to hold the comparative advantage in three key domains: creativity, complex social interactions, and interaction with unstructured environments (such as your home).
However, it is important to acknowledge there has been meaningful progress in these domains, with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4, capable of producing human-like text responses to a very wide range of queries. In the age of Generative AI, a machine might even write your love letters.
Yet if GPT4 does write your love letters, your in-person dates will become even more important. The bottom line is, as virtual social interactions are increasingly aided by algorithms, the premium on in-person interactions, which cannot be replicated by machines, will become even greater.
As virtual social interactions are increasingly aided by algorithms, the premium on in-person interactions, which cannot be replicated by machines, will become even greater
Second, although AI can produce a letter in the style of Shakespeare, this is only because Shakespeare’s works already exist, and on which an AI can be trained. AI is generally good at tasks which have clear data and a clear goal, such as maximizing the score in a video game, or the similarity to the language of Shakespeare. But if you want to create something genuinely new, rather than rehashing existing ideas, for what should you optimise? Answering the question of the true goal is where much human creativity resides.
Third, as we noted in our 2013 paper, there are many jobs that can be automated, but Generative AI – a subfield of the broader field of AI – is not yet an automation technology. It needs prompting from a human, and it needs a human to select, fact-check and edit the output.
Finally, Generative AI generates content that mirrors the quality of its training data – ‘garbage in results in garbage out’. And these algorithms require training on expansive datasets, such as extensive segments of the internet, as opposed to smaller, refined datasets developed by experts. Consequently, LLMs are inclined to create text that aligns with the average, rather than the extraordinary, portions of the internet. Average input yields average output.

What implications does this hold for the future of employment? For one thing, the latest generation of AI will persist in necessitating human intervention. What is more, workers with less specialised skills stand to gain disproportionately, as they can now generate content that aligns with the ‘average’ benchmark.

Could the hurdles outlined above be overcome shortly, paving the way for widespread automation also of creative and social tasks? In the absence of a major breakthrough, we think it is unlikely. Firstly, the data already ingested by LLMs is likely to comprise a considerable fraction of the internet, making it unlikely that training data can be significantly expanded to power further progress. Furthermore, there are legitimate grounds to expect a surge of inferior AI-crafted content on the Web, progressively degrading its quality as a source of training data.
Second, while we have become accustomed to Moore's Law - the observational law that declares the quantity of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles approximately every two years - many anticipate this trend will lose momentum, owing to physical constraints, around 2025.
Third, it is estimated that the energy to create GPT4 cost a large fraction of its $100 million training cost – even before the price of energy went up. With the climate challenge looming large, there are questions over whether this approach can continue.
Many jobs will be automated, but not because of the latest wave of Generative AI
What is needed, in other words, is AI that is capable of learning from smaller, curated datasets, drawing upon expert samples, rather than the average population. But when such innovation will come is notoriously hard to predict. What we can do is create better incentives for data-saving innovation.
Consider this: around the turn of the 20th century, there was a genuine contest - would electric vehicles or the combustion engine prevail in the burgeoning car industry? At first, both contenders were on a par, but massive oil discoveries tipped the balance in favour of the combustion engine. Now imagine that we leveraged a tax on oil back then: we might have shifted the balance in favour of the electric car, sparing us plenty of carbon emissions. In similar fashion, a tax on data would create incentives for innovation to make AI less data-intensive.
Going forward, as we have argued elsewhere, many jobs will be automated, but not because of the latest wave of Generative AI. In the absence of major breakthroughs, we expect the bottlenecks we outlined in our 2013 paper to continue to constrain automation possibilities for the foreseeable future.

The launch of generative AI represents an era-defining moment. Never before have so many people become so excited by a technology program. Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in November 2022, more than 1 million people (including me) had logged on to try it out. If financial investments are a predictor of growth, then the $12 billion invested in generative AI in the first five months of 2023 shows the depth of commitment. 
To get a sense of current momentum and direction, I ran a research webinar last month on the impact of generative AI on the workplace. Some 260 executives from organizations in Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States joined me to describe their current use of generative AI in human capital domains. What I heard is that generative AI is a top priority for many CEOs, experiments abound alongside ambiguity, and organizations are already beginning to use artificial intelligence to augment their human capital strategies. I’ll share more details about those findings in a moment.

I wanted to hear directly from practitioners because it seems to me that, as with the previous era-defining event — the COVID-19 pandemic — and its impact on the workplace, imagining what is ahead with this new technology is a tough call. As with the emergence of hybrid work and work-from-home initiatives in response to the pandemic, figuring out the right approaches to generative AI is a process replete with ambiguity, experiments, and changes of mind. In other words, it is a learning process driven both by the initiative of individuals and the strategies of organizations. 
Like the response to the pandemic, debate and action around gen AI are moving fast. 


					Figuring out the right approaches to generative AI is a process replete with ambiguity, experiments, and changes of mind.
					
Two facts are emerging. First, this is a rapidly developing technology. The size of investment gives a sense of this. So, too, does the volume of experimentation: One executive told me, “We have created a head of generative AI with a role simply to moderate and make sense of the hundreds of experiments we have running on any day.” Second, unlike previous workplace technologies, generative AI is not being positioned as a substitute for routine tasks — either analytical tasks, like keeping records or providing repetitive customer-oriented services, or manual tasks, like picking and sorting products or performing routine assembly. Instead, it’s a technology with the potential to hit at the heart of nonroutine analytical work. This is knowledge work, such as forming a hypothesis, creating content, recommending medical diagnostics, or making a sales pitch. The source of this impact is generative AI’s growing capacity to understand natural language. Around 25% of the total work time of knowledge workers is spent on the kinds of creative tasks that generative AI is beginning to get good at.
Yet, like during the early days of the pandemic and hybrid work, much is currently conjecture. There will certainly be pushback, changes of direction, and believers and resisters, just as there has been throughout the ongoing debate about hybrid work. There will be many experiments before leaders begin to develop their own narratives about how best to support their workers in these complex and ambiguous times.









Experiments, Projections, and the Great Ambiguity
The potential for generative AI to very quickly have a real impact in the workplace is fueling the attention it’s getting. Consider the McKinsey report on generative AI published in June 2023. McKinsey asked a group of technology experts at what point they believed generative AI would substitute for a number of human tasks. It then compared those estimates with pre-gen AI projections made in 2017 about when human performance might be achievable by technology. What is striking is the extent to which their estimated timelines have contracted. For one work task, for example — “coordination with multiple agents” — the experts in 2017 estimated a timeline of substitution that ranged from 2035 to 2058. Today, they estimate that happening from 2023 to 2035. That feels very soon. As important, in 2017, the estimate for when we’d see technology achieve human-level performance for the task of “creativity” was 2030 to 2045; today, the projection is from 2025 to 2030. These dates are for tasks where technology performance is expected to match median human performance. For top-quartile human performance, the timelines are pushed out somewhat. 
How do we make sense of this? What I learned from observing the impact of the pandemic on work is that watching closely and asking questions of people in the field about their current lived reality is a useful practice. So my Sept. 19 webinar was essentially a listening process. Many executives came from human capital functions, so their interest was primarily in the people side of their business. 
I began by asking where generative AI currently sits on the leadership agenda. Over half of attendees (52%) agreed with the statement “It is a CEO priority where leadership teams are discussing impact.” Only 13% said “It is not yet on the agenda in any meaningful way.” This is a topic that is definitely consuming bandwidth at the top levels of organizations across the world. 


					A useful practice is to watch closely and ask questions of people in the field about their current lived reality.
					
Generative AI is at the top of leaders’ agendas — but what about the scope of debate? What issues are coming forward as people talk through its consequences? For the webinar, I focused on a central aspect of this question: machines and creativity. The technologists in the McKinsey panel estimated that human creativity will be achieved by generative AI within the time span of 2025 to 2030, but what did this group of leaders believe? This, for me, is an important question because the McKinsey panelists are technology experts. I have a hunch that people like them will overestimate technological progress, whereas people like me (psychologists) will overestimate human progress. 
What is fascinating is the lack of agreement among webinar attendees about whether they think human creativity at the top quartile will be achieved by gen AI from 2023 to 2030: Just 10% strongly agreed, while 34% agreed, 22% neither agreed or disagreed, 30% disagreed, and 4% strongly disagreed. I ran a Menti (a quick survey at the website Mentimeter) to collect participants’ real-time thoughts and asked why they had come to their conclusions. Within seconds, more than 80 comments had emerged: Those who agreed pointed out that creativity can be broken down into logical steps; that creativity sits on a lot of data; that prompts will be more important than AI; and that use cases, such as songs, already demonstrate creativity. Those who disagreed described how generative AI would augment, not substitute for, creative people and asserted that creativity was about empathy and vulnerability, that humans can generate new ideas, while AI pulls from the past, and that governments will provide regulation. Those who did not know said there are simply too many unknown unknowns. 
For me, the takeaway here is the sheer richness of conversation and variance in opinions about generative AI. These are debates we need to be open about and continue to have.  
I wondered, of course, how generative AI is currently being experimented with and used. My interest is in the human capital agenda and how generative AI will impact the everyday experiences of workers. One of the “promises” of AI, according to the McKinsey report, is a productivity boost from the automation of a wide variety of activities. For knowledge workers, this will come by technology either substituting for or augmenting tasks such as creating connections, retrieving stored data, personalizing content, automating activities, increasing the speed of response, and collaborating.
I asked about the current velocity of the use of generative AI in three human capital domains: talent development (like recruitment, induction, and career management), productivity (like skills training and managing collaboration), and change management (like internal knowledge management). I was interested in the current use of generative AI in each domain and the use cases. Of course, the data set of attendees comprised self-selected people who had an interest in generative AI, but still, what is clear is that there are many, many experiments currently underway.

The human capital domain with the greatest reported use of generative AI right now is “internal knowledge management.” Forty-six percent of attendees said they are experimenting in this sphere, with use cases such as creating communications, conducting market research analysis, finding resources and competencies, and engaging in employee listening. Almost as many attendees (44%) reported using gen AI for recruitment, with use cases such as creating job advertisements, developing simple approval flows, and onboarding new hires. About a third of attendees (34%) said they’re using gen AI for skills training, with use cases that include self-directed learning, the creation of learning content, and virtual reality-based training. And 23% said they’re using the technology for assessment and feedback, with use cases such as developing bespoke assessments, improving performance feedback, designing career paths, and creating chatbots for employees.
I feel that what I captured in this research webinar is a sense of the sheer depth of conversation and experimentation taking place right now across the world. How to think about and use generative AI is being debated in the C-suite as use cases are being created and tough questions (like the relationship between machines and creativity) are being debated. For organizations to be aligned with this emerging narrative, it is imperative that they experiment freely and observe closely.

White & Case Tech Newsflash

You are likely already familiar with two US recent decisions that have addressed the copyrightability of AI-generated works:
(a) On August 18, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) in Thaler v. Perlmutter, D.D.C., No. 1:22-cv-01564 (Thaler Decision), confirming that a work generated by an artificial system absent human involvement is not eligible for copyright protection under US copyright law.
(b) On September 5, 2023, the USCO's Copyright Review Board (Board) affirmed the USCO's refusal to register a work containing ""more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence"" where the author refused to disclaim such AI-generated content in the registration application for such work (Allen Decision).
In this Tech Newsflash, we outline five practical considerations given these recent developments:
1. So far, humans are indispensable.
Human creators have the ability to convey a proprietary interest in what they create. If you wish to use generative AI to create content, copyright law (as it currently stands in US), provides limited protection with respect to such content. Accordingly, human authors, artists, coders and other creators still have an edge, because their creative expression, assuming it meets the basic copyright requirements, is protectable under US copyright law. When using generative AI tools, consider whether, and to what extent, you wish to rely upon copyright law (or even patent law) to protect your creations, or whether other forms of protection may be available – see point 5 below.
2. Users of generative AI should consider whether they can agree to customary IP terms.
If you are using generative AI technology within your business, including in performing services for others, consider whether you can represent and warrant ownership of AI-generated deliverables or assets, or whether you can assign or transfer ownership of such deliverables or assets. Services or license agreements typically address ownership of deliverables or licensed items, and similarly, in certain corporate transactions, targets are typically required to make representations and warranties regarding ownership of IP and technology. When using generative AI tools, you should carefully assess whether you can honor your contractual commitments. Companies also often use work made for hire constructs under the Copyright Act to acquire copyright ownership of works upon creation. However, as noted in the Thaler Decision, where the work never had valid or eligible copyright, the ""work made for hire"" doctrine cannot be implicated as no property rights exist to transfer in the first instance.
3. Parts of AI-assisted works may be copyrightable.
Neither the Thaler Decision nor the Allen Decision foreclose the copyrightability of AI-developed or generated works. As clarified in the USCO's Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence (which we previously discussed), works containing AI-generated materials may be protectable where, for example, humans have selected or arranged the materials in a sufficiently creative way, or humans have modified the materials to such a degree that there is a sufficient amount of original authorship. Indeed, the USCO has granted limited copyright registration for the text and overall selection, coordination, and arrangement of written and visual elements of a comic book created in part using Midjourney's AI-powered text-to-image generator (which we also previously discussed). However, where such a work contains more than a de minimis amount of AI-generated content, per the USCO's current guidance, such content must be disclaimed in the registration application.
4. Trademark, trade secret and contractual protections may provide other avenues of protection.
In order to secure and maintain rights to AI-generated works, as creators or ""owners"" of such works, you may be able to seek protections under areas of law other than copyright, for example, protecting such outputs as trade secrets (likely more relevant to generative AI outputs such as code than images or media), imposing restrictions on disclosure and use of such works under contract and/or applying trademarks or establishing trademark protection (depending on how this is done, this is unlikely to protect the underlying work unless it comprises the trademark itself).
5. AI generated works may still infringe third party copyrights.
While US copyright law does not currently protect AI-generated works without human input, your creation and use of such works, and/or the training of an AI model that produces such works still may infringe a third party's copyrights. We have previously reported on ongoing, yet to be decided, class action lawsuits about the latter. Therefore, when using AI and AI-generated works, you cannot automatically assume that such outputs cannot infringe third-party IP rights. Indeed, over the last few months, various tech companies have made public commitments to indemnify certain customers for copyright infringement relating to use of their AI tools.
This area of law is still evolving. As noted in the Thaler Decision: ""Undoubtedly, we are approaching new frontiers in copyright as artists put AI in their toolbox to be used in the generation of new visual and other artistic works. The increased attenuation of human creativity from the actual generation of the final work will prompt challenging questions regarding how much human input is necessary to qualify the user of an AI system as an ""author"" of a generated work, the scope of the protection obtained over the resultant image, how to assess the originality of AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained on unknown pre-existing works, how copyright might best be used to incentivize creative works involving AI, and more.""
Shortly after the Thaler Decision, the USCO published a notice of inquiry seeking public comments by October 18, 2023, including on using copyrighted works to train AI models, levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to such use and training, the copyrightability and legal status of AI-generated outputs, and the treatment of AI-generated outputs that mimic personal attributes of human artists. Accordingly, we are undoubtedly going to have updates in this regard, so watch this space!

Experts have suggestions for how to manage all these unknownsBy Lauren Leffer leremy/Getty ImagesCreativityIt’s logical for humans to feel anxious about artificial intelligence. After all, the news is constantly reeling off job after job at which the technology seems to outperform us. But humans aren’t yet headed for all-out replacement. And if you do suffer from so-called AI anxiety, there are ways to alleviate your fears and even reframe them into a motivating force for good.In one recent example of generative AI’s achievements, AI programs outscored the average human in tasks requiring originality, as judged by human reviewers. For a study published this month in Scientific Reports, researchers gave 256 online participants 30 seconds to come up with imaginative uses for four commonplace objects: a box, a rope, a pencil and a candle. For example, a box might serve as a cat playhouse, a miniature theater or a time capsule. The researchers then gave the same task to three different large language models. To assess the creativity of these responses, the team used two methods: an automated program that assessed “semantic distance,” or relatedness between words and concepts, and six human reviewers that were trained to rank responses on their originality.In both assessments, the highest-rated human ideas edged out the best of the AI responses—but the middle ground told a different story. The mean AI scores were significantly higher than the mean human scores. For instance, both the automated and human assessments ranked the response “cat playhouse” as less creative than a similar AI-generated response from GPT-4, “cat amusement park.” And people graded the lowest-scoring human answers as far less creative than the worst of the AI generations.Headlines ensued, proclaiming that “AI chatbots already surpass average human in creativity” and “AI is already more creative than YOU.” The new study is the latest in a growing body of research that seems to portend generative AI outpacing the average human in many artistic and analytical realms—from photography competitions to scientific hypotheses.It’s news such as this that has fed Kat Lyons’s fears about AI. Lyons is a Los Angeles–based background artist who works in animation and creates immersive settings for TV shows including Futurama and Disenchantment. In many ways, it’s their dream job—a paid outlet for their passion and skill in visual art, which they’ve been cultivating since age four. But some aspects of the dream have begun to sour: the rise of visual generative AI tools such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (and the entertainment industry’s eagerness to use them) has left Lyons discouraged, frustrated and anxious about their future in animation—and about artistic work in general. For instance, they were disheartened when Marvel and Disney decided to use an AI-generated, animated intro sequence made by the visual effects company Method Studios for the show Secret Invasion, which premiered in June. “It feels really scary,” Lyons says. “I honestly hate it.” Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, and Method Studios did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Like many professional creatives, Lyons now worries about AI models—which need to train themselves on vast swaths of Internet content—stealing and rehashing their artistic work for others’ profit. And then there’s the corresponding loss of employment opportunities. More broadly, Lyons fears for the future of art itself in an era when honing a craft and a personal voice are no longer prerequisites for producing seemingly original and appealing projects. “I worked so hard for my artistic dreams. I’ve been drawing since I was in preschool,” they say. “This is always what I’ve wanted to do, but we might be entering a world where I have to give that up as my full-time job—where I have to go back to waiting tables or serving coffee.”Lyons isn’t alone. Many people have found themselves newly anxious about the rapid rise of generative AI, says Mary Alvord, a practicing psychologist in the Washington, D.C., area. Alvord says her clients of all ages express concerns about artificial intelligence. Specific worries include a lack of protection for online data privacy, the prospect of job loss, the opportunity for students to cheat and even the possibility of overall human obsolescence.AI’s advance has triggered a vague but pervasive sense of general public unease, and for some individuals, it has become a significant source of stress.Curated by Our EditorsAlgorithms Are Making Important Decisions. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?AnanyaWhat the Luddites Can Teach Us about AISophie Bushwick & Elah FederChatGPT Can Get Good Grades. What Should Educators Do about It?Lauren LefferGames Rule the World—And Always HaveJen SchwartzAs with any anxiety, it’s important to manage the emotion and avoid becoming overwhelmed. “A certain amount of anxiety helps motivate, but then too much anxiety paralyzes,” Alvord says. “There’s a balance to strike.” Here’s how some psychologists and other experts suggest tackling our AI fears.First off, context is key, says Sanae Okamoto, a psychologist and behavioral scientist at the United Nations University–Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology in the Netherlands. She suggests keeping in mind that the present moment is far from the first time people have feared the rise of an unfamiliar technology. “Computer anxiety” and “technostress” date backdecades, Okamoto notes. Before that, there was rampant worry over industrial automation. Past technological advances have led to big societal and economic shifts. Some fears materialized, and some jobs did disappear, but many of the worst sci-fi predictions did not come true.“It’s natural and historical that we are afraid of any new technology,” says Jerri Lynn Hogg, a media psychologist and former president of the American Psychological Association’s Society for Media Psychology and Technology. But understanding the benefits of a new tech, learning how it works and getting training in how to use it productively can help—and that means going beyond the headlines.Simone Grassini, one of the researchers of the new study and a psychologist at Norway’s University of Bergen, is quick to point out that “performing one specific task that is related to creative behavior doesn’t automatically translate to ‘AI can do creative jobs.’” The current technology is not truly producing new things but rather imitating or simulating what people can do, Grassini says. AI’s “cognitive architecture and our cognitive architecture are substantially different.” In the study, it’s possible the AI won high creativity ratings because its answers simply copied verbatim parts of a human creation contained somewhere in its training set, he explains. The AI was also competing against human volunteers who had no particular motivation to excel at their creative task and had never necessarily completed such an assignment before. Participants were recruited online and paid only about $2.50 for an estimated 13 minutes of work.Confronting fears of generative AI by actually trying out the tools, seeing where and how they can be useful, reading up on how they work and understanding their limitations can turn the tech from a boogeyman into a potential asset, Hogg says. A deeper understanding can empower someone to advocate for meaningful job protections or policies that rein in potential downsides.Alvord also emphasizes the importance of addressing the problem directly. “We talk about what actions you can take instead of sticking your head in the sand,” she says. Maybe that means gaining new skills to prepare for a career change or learning about ongoing efforts to regulate AI. Or maybe it means building a coalition with colleagues at work. Lyons says being involved with their union, the Animation Guild, has been crucial to helping them feel more secure and hopeful about the future. In this way, remedies for AI anxiety may be akin to ones for another major, burgeoning societal fear: climate anxiety.Though there are obvious differences between the two phenomena (AI clearly offers some significant possible benefits), there are also apparent similarities. In tackling the biggest concerns about AI and in confronting the climate crisis, “we’re all in this challenge together,” Okamoto says. Just as with climate activism, she explains, meaningfully confronting fears over AI might begin with building solidarity, finding community and coming up with collective solutions.Another way to feel better about AI is to avoid overly fixating on it, Okamoto adds. There is more to life than algorithms and screens. Taking breaks from technology to reconnect with nature or loved ones in the physical world is critical for mental health, she notes. Stepping away from tech can also provide a reminder of all the ways that humans are distinct from the chatbots or image generators that might threaten a person’s career or self-image. Humans, unlike AI, can experience the world directly and connect with one another about it.When people create something, it’s often in response to their environment. Each word or brushstroke can carry meaning. For Lyons, human creativity is a “feral, primitive drive to make something because you can’t not make it.” So far, all AI can do is mimic that ability and creative motivation, says Sean Kelly, a Harvard University philosophy professor who has been examining the relationship between human creativity and AI for years. When an AI model generates something, Kelly says, “it’s not doing what the original artist did, which was trying to say something that they felt needed to be said.”To Kelly, the real societal fear shouldn’t be that AI will get better or produce ever more interesting content. Instead he’s afraid “that we’ll give up on ourselves” and “just become satisfied” with what AI generators can provide.Perhaps the better, and more characteristically human, response is to use our AI anxiety to propel us forward. Mastering a craft—be it drawing, writing, programming, translating, playing an instrument or composing mathematical proofs—and using that skill to create something new is “the most rewarding thing that we can possibly do,” Kelly says. So why not let AI motivate more creation instead of replace it? If the technology spits out something compelling, we can build on it. And if it doesn’t, then why worry about it at all?Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

  The automation of blue-collar and office jobs using digital technologies has been an important driver of the rise in inequality since the 1980s. A new CEPR Policy Insight argues that a ‘human-complementary’ path for artificial intelligence could contribute more to productivity growth and help reduce economic inequality. The authors suggest five potential elements for policy attention to help move the US, Europe, and other economies onto this human-complementary path.

We’ve seen how anyone can use tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney to express their ideas with words or pictures. And the way we create and listen to music is about to be turned on its head, too.
Generative AI Is Revolutionizing Music: Loudly's Vision For Democratizing CreationAdobe Stock

In recent years, we have seen a plethora of AI music platforms emerge, including Meta’s Audiocraft, OpenAI’s MuseNet, Soundful, Soundraw, Boomy, Amper and Loudly, among others. These allow anybody to create and customize music.

Recently, I was joined by Loudly founder and CEO Rory Kenny for my podcast, covering a number of topics that I personally find fascinating.

Does AI threaten human creativity by ushering in a future where all of our art and entertainment is conjured up from digital data by super-smart computers?

PROMOTED
Or does it allow us to augment and enhance our inherent human creativity in new and exciting ways, breaking down social and technological barriers to creativity and enabling us to express ourselves in new ways?
This was just one of the questions that Kenny and I hoped to get to the root of—while also taking an overview of the fascinating technology and the business model behind the platform.

Different platforms are emerging, each with its unique capabilities and focus. For example, Soundful offers a straightforward approach, providing producers with more control over basic musical parameters, making it ideal for those requiring more than just a finished AI-generated song. Aiva, in operation since 2016, targets individuals and businesses aiming to craft soundtracks for different media, allowing for customization and versatility. Beatbot distinguishes itself by using text prompts to generate short songs, focusing on enabling users to be a part of the music creation, particularly within the hip-hop and rap genres. Each of these platforms caters to a unique need in the market, showcasing the expanding horizons of AI in music.

As for Loudly, it is an advanced AI-driven music creation platform with an extensive training set of 10 million songs and a sound bank containing 200,000 human-generated recordings. It empowers users to produce royalty-free music tailored to their needs using simple natural-language prompts, allowing them to specify the style, tempo, mood, and even individual instruments. Embracing the concept of ""music as code,"" Loudly enables deep interaction with music at a micro-level, facilitating the creation of a myriad of unique sounds. Notably, the platform holds the copyrights to all the music it's been trained on, ensuring no concerns of copyright infringements or artists feeling their original works have been misused.
AI And The Democratization Of Music Creation
Kenny strongly believes that the integration of AI into various creative tools is inevitable. He points out that AI is already influencing image generation and predicts that music creation will follow suit. Kenny anticipates that tools used for video creation and digital audio workstations will also incorporate AI features, improving user accessibility and enhancing the output.
Such advancements will provide an avenue for countless individuals who have a passion for music but might not possess the technical skills. It's an opportunity for them to express their creativity. This is a significant move in the music industry, mirroring the transformation brought about by streaming services. These platforms, such as Spotify and Soundcloud, have made music distribution accessible to everyone. As a result, a vast number of songs are being uploaded daily.
Kenny describes the forthcoming phase as the ""era of mass creativity,"" which has already commenced. He wonders about the future of this era and its implications for traditional artists. He introduces the term ""AI-first artists"" to describe the new generation of creatives who will leverage AI's capabilities. These artists can use AI-based music creation tools to produce music, design synthetic artist profiles, and even fabricate their entire career narrative. With emerging technologies like mixed reality, they might also host live performances.
AI-Powered Superstars
So, while that may give us mere mortals a chance to live out our dreams of becoming synthetic pop stars, what about actual artists who already have the technical skills to create music but want to supercharge them with AI?
Kenny illustrates the potential here with an example from the past—when Bob Dylan famously went against convention by playing an electric guitar at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. For his attempts to innovate, he was jeered and booed by conventionalists. But the occasion is now celebrated as a pioneering moment in the history of popular music.
Kenny remarks that the artist's decision was contentious. By stepping away from traditional methods and embracing new technology, the artist yielded to the allure of innovation and creativity. This move allowed him to tap into a new genre, reach a broader audience, and employ an enhanced toolkit. It also enabled him to refine his story and musical legacy, which, according to Kenny, enriched our musical history.
The theory encapsulates Kenny’s ideas about how music—and creativity in general—will evolve as new tools and technology come onto the scene. It’s what’s happened throughout history, after all. So it makes sense that AI, perhaps the most revolutionary new “toolkit” of all time, will have a similarly transformative effect. Right?
Unintended Consequences
Of course, despite the hype, excitement and optimism, we certainly shouldn’t ignore the fact that there are many people out there who are concerned that AI might impact music and creativity in less positive ways.
This is hardly surprising as the emergence of AI, and generative AI in particular, has prompted fears ranging from a decline in demand for humans in creative jobs to a “dumbing down” effect on culture stemming from a surge of AI-generated art.
Kenny speculates that the willingness to use AI tools could be influenced by age. He references surveys indicating that younger individuals, particularly those aged 16 to 25, are more inclined to use AI as an initial point of interaction to understand processes, such as identifying high-quality writing or determining the structure of a well-crafted song.
For those who might be hesitant, potentially from older generations, Kenny's main advice is not to shy away. Instead of fearing or avoiding the technology, he suggests embracing challenges and venturing into the unknown. By actively exploring, they can demystify AI for themselves.
He says, “Be like Bob Dylan, you know, pick up that electric guitar and plug it into your amplifier to hear what your music sounds like.”

The buzz around artificial intelligence (A.I.) continues to rise. But is that buzz translating into a huge A.I. job market? That’s a big question for software engineers, software developers, and anyone else who’s interested in how the increasing adoption of A.I. will impact the job market in the months and years to come.

For tech professionals, the future of work might involve using A.I.-based tools to generate and test code, analyze data, and even market new products. From financial services to manufacturing and retail, artificial intelligence will play an increasingly bigger role. 

Which A.I.-related jobs are generating the most job postings at the moment? According to new data on Dice.com, it’s the following: 

Some of these jobs (such as data scientist and software engineer) are increasingly A.I.-centric, hence their inclusion on the list. For example, data scientists rely on machine learning and automation to crunch through huge, sometimes messy datasets for crucial insights. Meanwhile, software development could hinge more and more on a new generation of low- and no-code tools, along with generative A.I. products that can write and debug code. 

Aside from common tech jobs increasingly depending on A.I. tools, the number of actual postings for A.I. jobs such as machine learning researcher or entry-level A.I. analyst is still relatively small, especially in comparison to well-established tech skills such as programming. As part of its monthly jobs report, CompTIA has a breakdown of the states with the most A.I.-related job postings—and the actual number is relatively miniscule even in gargantuan tech hubs:

While the number of A.I.-related jobs is small, these roles are absolutely critical to organizations that see “smart” apps and services as a vital part of their long-term roadmap. That’s one big reason why jobs that utilize A.I. skills pay so much. O’Reilly estimates the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. Average compensation was highest in California ($176,000), home to big tech companies that are vacuuming up the best of the best A.I. talent out there. 

Moreover, the number of A.I.-related jobs will only rise. According to Burning Glass, for example, jobs that heavily involve machine learning (a critical subset of A.I.) are predicted to grow 76.3 percent over the next 10 years. A recent study of A.I. use-cases showed many companies using artificial intelligence and machine learning in sales, CRM, chatbots, cybersecurity, and marketing automation—all of which touch on millions of technologists’ jobs. If you’re involved in tech, chances are good you’ll use A.I. to do anything from writing code to forecasting trends to problem solving. 

In other words, keep an eye on how the artificial intelligence market evolves over the next few years. The technology could end up impacting your current job much sooner than you think. Artificial intelligence in employment is definitely here to stay.

From writing software code to optimizing business operations, generative AI is driving innovation and efficiency across the business world. This transformative technology comes with a steep learning curve for some businesses, which face a number of decisions. These include deciding whether to build or buy, gauging how much to spend, and considering generative AI trust and guardrails issue.
Generative AI creates completely new data from existing datasets. This data can be in a variety of formats, including text, images, music and even code—and it can produce results that weren’t in the original input. This versatility allows for an impressive range of creative problem-solving and efficiency-boosting applications.
Let’s look at five things every business leader needs to understand about generative AI to maximize their return on investment:
1) Generative AI is Revolutionizing Business and Job Functions
Generative AI is driving business innovation and efficiency. The technology’s ability to generate new data from an input  allows for an impressive range of applications.
Generative AI in the workplace isn’t merely about harnessing data or driving efficiency — it’s about fundamentally reshaping the approach to work. Yes, generative AI can make work faster and easier, but it also opens up entirely new possibilities for innovation and creativity.
What’s key about generative AI technology is its potential to be tailored to the needs of each business. Every business has its own unique or priority datasets.
By identifying their specific needs , businesses can use generative AI to gain a competitive edge. For instance, applied in healthcare, generative AI can help analyze patient data, create a summary of the key points, and then use this summary to draft an action plan for delivering better care.

2) Build vs. Buy
One critical business decision that enterprises face when implementing artificial intelligence is whether to build or buy the software. There are several factors to consider, including:

Unique data and domain expertise: Custom generative AI becomes valuable when businesses own unique data or specific domain expertise and aim to use  that data effectively.
Availability of talent: The skills required to build AI tools are specialized and in high demand. Enterprises need to consider whether they have access to this talent and whether they’re more familiar with open-source software or commercial offerings.
Project timeline: Building AI tools takes time. If an enterprise needs AI functionality ready quickly, buying it is the best bet. If the time frame is more flexible, building it might be the more practical option.
Integration with existing software: It’s crucial to consider whether the vendors an enterprise works with can integrate the AI tools under consideration. Understanding the organization’s procurement process and allowing enough time for it can save the project from unexpected delays.
Cost-effectiveness: While it may initially appear more affordable to develop AI tools internally, it’s essential to factor in expenses related to team building, software acquisition and long-term maintenance. If the tool serves as a crucial competitive advantage for the business, it may justify ongoing costs. However, if similar functionality is already available through a tool the company is currently paying for, it doesn’t make financial sense to build and maintain redundant software.

3) Identify the Industry Use Case
Generative AI has a wide range of applications across a variety of industries. Common ones include text generation for crafting captivating marketing copy, summarization for condensing extensive news articles and emails, and image generation for developing unique brand visuals or gaming characters.
AI-powered chatbots are enhancing customer service with intelligent, real-time responses in almost every industry, while translation capabilities are making information accessible across languages. In the coding world, generative AI boosts efficiency by dynamically generating comments and functions.
Healthcare is using generative AI to reduce drug discovery timelines. Game developers are using it to create dynamic game characters. The financial sector is using it to bolster security against transaction fraud and for algorithmic trading. Retail is using generative AI for automatic price optimization.
Businesses find success most quickly when they have an initial project that aligns with their unique needs. For help getting started, ask technology providers for examples they can share from companies with similar project requirements.

4) Investing in Generative AI
Implementing generative AI requires substantial financial investment. It involves procuring high-end infrastructure, hiring skilled talent, assembling the necessary software components and gathering the needed data.
That said, not every enterprise needs to invest in generative AI from scratch. Many are using pre-trained models, or foundation models, which are more cost-effective to train because businesses only have to augment the model with their own data and apply guardrails associated with their brand.
While the cost of implementing generative AI can be high, the investment return of increased efficiency, innovation and competitive advantage can make it worthwhile.
5) Ensuring Trust and Safety in Generative AI Models
As generative AI grows more advanced and widespread, guaranteeing the safety and responsible use of AI models becomes increasingly paramount. Large language model guardrail tools — software applications that keep generative AI models from deviating from their intended purpose — can help developers set boundaries on AI models. These can be set in three areas:

Topical guardrails: These prevent AI models from veering into undesired areas of use. For example, a customer service assistant powered by generative AI could be prevented from answering questions about the weather if that function isn’t within its designated scope.
Safety guardrails: These ensure that AI models provide accurate and appropriate responses. They can filter out unwanted language and make sure that references are made only to credible sources.
Security guardrails: These restrict the AI model’s connections to only known, safe external third-party applications.

Harnessing the Power of Enterprise Generative AI
Generative AI is poised to transform the world, offering vast opportunities for companies to innovate, improve efficiency and solve complex problems. As business leaders, understanding and using the power of generative AI will be vital to staying competitive in the rapidly evolving business landscape.
Following the five principles above will help businesses stay ahead of the curve and reap the rewards that this AI technology has to offer.

October 2, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 2, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Let’s separate fact from fiction, and look to the futureA recent survey determined that a large majority of lawyers believe that generative AI can be readily applied to legal work, even if they disagree on whether it should be. But what do paralegals think? For many, the transformative nature of AI leaves some feeling uneasy. However, others see AI becoming a critical part of their professional toolkit. Jump to:  Fact: AI can augment the work of paralegals  Fact: Human expertise cannot be replaced  Fiction: Paralegals will become obsolete  Fiction: Job losses are guaranteed  Future: Lean in Fact:  AI can augment the work of paralegals  The work of paralegals can be both routine and strategic. For the most time-consuming tasks such as research, document review, and data entry, AI can be a powerful tool to get paralegals to high-value tasks faster. The payoff with AI is in volume. A paralegal is skilled at quickly analyzing a document to extract pertinent information. But when that paralegal needs to analyze a large number of documents, AI can accomplish this in minutes or seconds.  Few paralegals complain of a lack of work to fill their day – just the opposite is true. So, when AI can handle routine drafting and information extraction, paralegals can focus their brainpower on legal analysis, client communication, and critical thinking.  Fact: Human expertise cannot be replaced If volume is a characteristic of artificial intelligence, nuanced decision-making is not. Its output needs a human eye to review and is most often done by paralegals. While it may extract hard-to-find cases through a prompted query, a trained professional needs to review those cases to ensure they apply to the matter at hand. Paralegals also play a nuanced role in client communication. They are often a client’s daily contact, handling sensitive and personal information. While AI can initiate and organize a client intake form, it can’t console a divorce applicant or listen to a widow describe her estate wishes. These are genuinely human interactions.    Fiction: Paralegals will become obsolete The paralegal profession has never been a static one. Prior to the mid-70s, paralegals poured through law books digging for answers to prepare legal briefs. With the introduction of Westlaw, the hours they spent in the law library were converted to higher tasks. Legal document automation tools made paralegals even more efficient by simplifying the drafting process, again, freeing time to focus on analysis and case management. In neither case were paralegals deemed obsolete. In fact, they were empowered to do more. For those who embrace it, the same can be true with artificial intelligence.  An important consideration with artificial intelligence, particularly with generative AI, is trust. Do lawyers trust its output? At this point in the development of AI, most lawyers do not. However, the trust relationship between a lawyer and a paralegal is paramount. Lawyers who depend on the accurate, relevant work a paralegal provides will want to keep that professional on their team.  Fiction: Job losses are guaranteed   That some legal positions will change, shift, or be cut may be true with the adoption of AI. That’s not a new dynamic for organizations that look to improve profits by increasing efficiency and productivity in all areas. With a service that’s based on billable hours, every gain in production helps the bottom line. However, experts do not predict that AI will cause massive layoffs of the approximately 300,000 US paralegals in the foreseeable future. As legal departments embrace the technology and learn to apply it in their legal routines, efficiency gains will be welcomed.    Future: Lean in Paralegals are often tasked with testing and evaluating new technology. They should embrace this role with generative AI. Rather than viewing it as a threat, paralegals can welcome it as a valuable assistant. The more educated paralegals are in the use of AI, the better they can take advantage of its benefits. AI will continue to get “smarter,” as data scientists further develop the technology, and users provide more experiences to train it. Paralegals can be the front line of adoption – and the lawyers they work with will benefit.  AI is not the enemy of paralegals, it’s the future.  Will AI take over lawyer jobs?Here are 3 reasons to object.Read blog post   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceBusiness DevelopmentInnovationTechnology",http://schema.org,,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,"['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]",http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This framing neglects another part of the equation, according to Yunhao Zhang, SM ’20, PhD ’23, a postdoctoral fellow at the Psychology of Technology Institute. “This is the supply side of the equation, but there has been very little discussion about the demand side,” he said. “Ultimately, the work that AI does will be judged by whether or not consumers like it.”
With this in mind, Zhang and MIT Sloan senior lecturer and research scientistRenee Richardson Gosline studied how people perceive work created by generative AI, humans, or some combination of the two. These findings are detailed in a new paper, “Human Favoritism, Not AI Aversion.”
They found that when people knew a product’s source, they expressed a positive bias toward content created by humans. Yet at the same time, and contrary to the traditional idea of “algorithmic aversion,” people expressed no aversion toward AI-generated content when they knew how it was created. In fact, when respondents were not told how content was created, they preferred AI-generated content.
For the study, the researchers created two tasks: writing marketing copy for five retail products, and drafting persuasive content for five uncontroversial campaigns (“eat less junk food,” for instance). They tackled these tasks in four different ways:
For the human-only approach, they enlisted professional content creators from Accenture Research to draft the marketing copy and campaign goals.
The augmented human approach first used AI (GPT-4) to generate ideas. Human consultants then shaped them into final products.
The augmented AI approach worked the other way, with humans creating drafts and generative AI being used to mold them into final products.
The AI-only approach had GPT-4 complete the task on its own.
Participants in the experiment were recruited to evaluate the quality of this work and were split into three groups. One group knew nothing about the content creation process. A second group knew about the four different approaches but was told nothing more. The third group knew which approach was responsible for each piece of content they viewed.
This nuanced method was essential to creating an accurate picture of the world, Gosline said. While many studies compare the work of humans against the work of AI, “in reality, our everyday experiences reflect a much more subtle gradation, where we have human decision-making shaped by algorithms or algorithms in which people are in the loop,” she said. “We wanted to get a fine-grained understanding of the various ways in which humans and AI can collaborate and, from that, get a better sense of what kinds of biases people hold.”
Two key insights emerged. First, when people had no information about the source of the marketing or campaign copy, they preferred the results generated by AI. “Generative AI is showing that it can be as good as or better than humans at these kinds of persuasive tasks,” Zhang said.

But when people were told the source of the content, their estimation of work in which humans were involved went up — they expressed “human favoritism,” as the researchers put it. Their assessment of content created by AI, though, didn’t change, undermining the notion that people harbor a form of algorithmic aversion.
“The most direct implication is that consumers really don’t mind content that’s produced by AI. They’re generally OK with it,” Zhang said. “At the same time, there’s great benefit in knowing that humans are involved somewhere along the line — that their fingerprint is present. Companies shouldn’t be looking to fully automate people out of the process.”
These findings should encourage firms to run genuine experiments on consumer perceptions of AI, the researchers said. Had Zhang and Gosline simply surveyed people about their thoughts, “they may have said something very different than what we actually observed,” Gosline said. These experiments provide a much clearer understanding of actual behavior.
This research also applies to an ever broadening part of the market as generative AI becomes increasingly easy to access and apply.
With the 2024 U.S. presidential election on the horizon, “questions of political persuasion feel very relevant, but so do applications in education, marketing, medicine, and so on,” Gosline said. “If you ask in what area information like this would be relevant, I would say I’m hard-pressed to think of an area that isn’t touched by this kind of thing. We ought to try to understand as much as we can about the ways people think about AI, given how quickly everything is moving.”

Sales teams at Google, Twilio, and others say productivity is spiking.PHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: ANJALI NAIR; GETTY IMAGESSave this storySaveSave this storySaveWining and dining, wooing clients with creative offers, and cashing big bonuses provide the glamor to sales work. Drafting answers to hundreds of dull questions posed by a prospective customer’s request for proposals? That’s just drudgery. Mercifully for workers, after months of speculation about ChatGPT-style AI taking over white-collar work, the corporate chore of responding to RFPs is one of the first that generative AI is disrupting.In April, communications software maker Twilio introduced RFP Genie, a generative AI tool that digests an RFP, scours thousands of internal files for relevant information, and uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 to generate a suitable response. The company’s sales staff simply copy and paste the text over into a formal document and make a few adjustments.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTRFPs that once occupied a pair of staffers for two weeks or more are now done in minutes. Twilio, whose cloud tools enable companies to chat with customers, expects to be able to make more and better sales pitches, and isn’t planning job cuts. “This will free up our solutions engineers to focus on more complex problems that demand not just reasoning, but human contextualization,” says Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson of the RFP bot, which has not previously been reported.Featured VideoChatGPT Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsLawson’s sales team isn’t the only one enjoying a sudden windfall of free time. Generative AI RFP response bots also have launched for sales teams at Google’s cloud unit, ad-buying agency EssenceMediacom, and DataRobot, a startup developing software to manage AI programs. In August at IBM, an RFP bot was selected by CEO Arvind Krishna as the winner of an internal AI hackathon called the Watsonx challenge, beating a field of over 12,000 entries. It used a large language model from IBM’s Watsonx.ai service to write answers in a tenth of the time compared to solely by hand, and the company is studying how to adopt the system. Consulting giants such as Bain and Deloitte have been pitching clients on the RFP idea, and makers of RFP management software are trying to build in generative AI.Google expects its AI RFP tool to save its salespeople tens of thousands of hours annuallyRFPs with tedious questions asking for information such as a cloud service’s uptime or its support for multifactor authentication are an unavoidable stage in all sorts of sales processes, from software deals to light bulbs. Customers get a book of jargon, statistics, and promises to justify an eventual purchase and use in any future dispute. But no one enjoys writing or answering the questions, which in tech pulls top engineers away from more important projects. Everyone involved openly jokes—or perhaps secretly fears—that no one reads the responses before tapping the Buy button anyway.Generative AI’s arrival has brought welcome relief to many workers trapped in RFP hell—and potentially offers a counterpoint to the anxiety that AI writers will replace humans. At the same time it’s prompting questions over how much longer humans will be involved in some business admin practices. As more RFP responses are crafted by AI, bots will inevitably start writing the questions too. Before long, other bots may be scoring proposals and recommending winners, leaving humans to just do a brief double check. “The AI RFP is a baby step toward replacing the RFP with something better,” says Peter Bonney, CEO of Vendorful, which recently started selling a tool similar to that used inside Twilio.Ask the GenieWhen Lawson laid off 11 percent of Twilio’s several thousand employees in September 2022 and an additional 17 percent in February, he said the company had to become more efficient. Generative AI is a central pillar of his plan to boost productivity. He started toying with the technology during nights and weekends in 2020, using text generators to brainstorm and to compile silly dinner recipes. When OpenAI began selling access to GPT-4, the large language model powering the paid version of ChatGPT, Lawson asked his staff to work on tools to streamline Twilio’s operations.To create the RFP bot, a handful of data scientists and a solutions engineer at Twilio began experimenting with augmenting GPT-4’s inherent vocabulary, which comes from scraping the text of websites and books. They devised a method that pairs a program that retrieves snippets relevant to the questions in an RFP from technical documentation and other sources inside in the company with a system that directs GPT-4 to summarize those snippets in a clear and professional tone. GPT-4 proved capable of generating extremely accurate responses—though solutions engineers and technical experts still review or edit every answer before sending them off to a prospective client.The tech industry has begun calling systems like Twilio’s retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Browse, a new option in paid ChatGPT, functions similarly by summarizing search results from Microsoft Bing to help answer users’ questions. It cuts down on large language models’ so-called hallucinations, where they make up information when there are gaps in their knowledge. Jay Schuren, chief customer officer at DataRobot, compares RAG to handing someone a cue card with some facts listed and asking them to make a speech. “The language model tells a coherent story, but it sticks to the script,” he says. The RAG approach is also, in many cases, much cheaper than training or fine-tuning a large language model to a specific task.I don't have personal preferences or feelingsTwilio's bot for responding to RFPs sticks to businessTwilio’s RFP Genie, as it’s unofficially known internally, operates globally and in multiple languages. Account executives can now solicit more business because they can respond to RFPs they would have previously lacked time to pick up. By Twilio’s estimate, the bot handles about 80 percent of an RFP and staff fill in the rest while reporting and categorizing their corrections. “We’re not reducing these roles, because with the time saved these teams can address more RFPs and spend more time interacting with and helping more customers than before,” company spokesperson Miya Shitama says.The company is working on having the tool automatically improve based on staffers’ edits to AI-generated answers. It also hopes to give the tool some more character. When asked by a company staffer about its favorite question to answer, the bot dryly replied, “I don't have personal preferences or feelings” before noting, “I particularly excel at answering questions related to Twilio's features, customer stories, and use cases.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyTwilio developed similar chatbots—details of which could not be learned—to help other teams in its salesforce gather information about the company’s offerings.

But perhaps the widest-reaching and most consequential update came in two sentences slipped in at the end: “DALL-E 3 is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist. Creators can now also opt their images out from training of our future image generation models.”The language is a tacit response to hundreds of pages of litigation and countless articles accusing tech firms of stealing artists’ work to train their AI software, and provides a window into the next stage of the battle between creators and AI companies. The second sentence, in particular, cuts to the core of debates over whether tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta should be allowed to use human-made work to train AI models without the creator’s permission—models that, artists say, are stealing their ideas and work opportunities.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

Generative AI is reshaping the enterprise technology estate, sparking discussions around adoption strategy, raising architectural issues and pushing IT leadership in new directions.







Those shifts are happening at shocking speed. While cloud computing adoption unfolded at a brisk pace, the uptake of generative AI is still happening faster. Most organizations are either evaluating or actively deploying the technology, which became readily accessible starting in late 2022.
An August 2023 report from TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found 54% of the 600-plus organizations it polled will have adopted generative AI in the next 12 months. Likewise, 59% of business executives PwC surveyed cited ""embedding new technologies in their business model"" as the No. 1 strategic priority over the next three to five years; 46% of the respondents specifically identified generative AI.
""With generative AI, this is something that's brand new,"" said Neil Dhar, U.S. vice chair and consulting co-leader at PwC, speaking at an online presentation. ""Every company in every sector is doing an inward analysis of how generative AI impacts their companies. It's clear that no one has run away from the pack here. And we're all figuring this out together, including ourselves.""

GenAI and adoption strategies

Make vs. buy
Walmart, which tops the Fortune 500 list with more than $600 billion in revenue, is among the enterprises navigating generative AI. The retailer launched a GenAI Playground in June and released a generative AI tool, My Assistant, to some 50,000 campus associates in August.
David Glick, senior vice president of enterprise business services at Walmart, views generative AI as a ""transformative technology."" Its sudden arrival prompted a make-versus-buy decision at the retailer. Walmart has traditionally been a buy shop but shifted to making its own technology with the arrival of CTO Suresh Kumar in 2019. The company's GoLocal service delivery platform and relaunch of Walmart.com's digital storefront were both in-house efforts, for example.
Generative AI, however, calls for a best-of-both-worlds approach, according to Glick. The plan: Use the best of the available large language models (LLMs) and add its own customization layer.
""It's hard to train the LLM from the ground up,"" he said, noting that OpenAI and other companies in the AI sector have already done the foundational work.
""If they can do all the heavy lifting and the plumbing and the scaffolding, and we can build things that delight our customers -- either associate customers or [external] customers -- I think that's the sweet spot for us,"" Glick said.



More than half of the business and technology executives surveyed will have adopted generative AI within 12 months.





Walmart aims to add its own data to fine tune the tech providers' LLMs. Glick pointed to the company's internal benefits help desk and its 300-page benefits guide, which agents may struggle to memorize. Incorporating that document into an LLM could augment a help desk agent's employee interactions, boosting efficiency and increasing accuracy.
This buy-and-customize method tracks with how the company has tailored ERP and HR products to suit its needs, Glick noted.
Industry executives anticipate most enterprises will follow the route of tuning publicly available LLMs rather than building their own.
""I think the level of effort and scale that it takes to build those becomes cost prohibitive, and there's already so much innovation going on,"" said Merim Becirovic, global CTO of Accenture's IT organization.
Vikrant Karnik, cloud and technology services leader at Genpact, a professional services firm based in New York, said the meteoric rise of generative AI has captivated corporate boards and sparked discussions on whether it's better to build AI infrastructure or tap what's available. The latter choice is winning out, even among organizations pushing generative AI's cutting edge -- about 5% of Genpact's customer base.
""Even in those cases, they are depending on models that already exist,"" Karnik said.



Enterprises see generative AI influencing their operations with the cloud serving as an onramp.





The case for speed
While emerging technologies often inspire caution and gradual adoption, industry executives believe speed is important when it comes to generative AI.
""I think now is the time and we all know that we have to experiment, we have to pilot,"" said Chris Bedi, chief digital information officer at ServiceNow. ""The sooner we get started on it, the sooner we're going to realize material business outcomes from it. Waiting on the sidelines for this one, which is what a lot of people did -- and maybe rightfully, with things like the metaverse and blockchain -- doesn't feel like the right answer.""
The difference between those other hot-then-not technologies and generative AI revolves around the latter's obvious and plentiful practical applications.
""I think blockchain and metaverse often became a solution in search of a problem versus generative AI, where use cases just jump off the page,"" Bedi said.
ServiceNow, which is creating its own generative AI models, has deployed the technology in a dozen in-house use cases.
Key use cases include those that simplify the task of finding information. ServiceNow houses much content in several different places.
""We have knowledge bases,"" Bedi said. ""Many companies around the world have invested in knowledge bases and content stores. It's still hard to find stuff.""
Generative AI, however, makes it possible to focus on content ""in a very human-readily way and not get a 10-page document but the one paragraph you are interested in,"" he added.


Generative AI in the IT shop
Generative AI can support a wide range of enterprise functions, including IT.
Bedi cited developer productivity as one immediate opportunity for generative AI within the technology function. ""How much more can you increase developer productivity -- which, by the way, is the labor pool that's the hardest to find,"" he said.
ServiceNow found its internal use of text-to-code technology has resulted in about a 20% productivity improvement among its software engineers. Bedi said this use of generative AI raises budgeting questions: For example, if the IT department had planned to write 1 million story points of code in 2024, will it now aim, with generative AI, to write 1.2 million story points of code with the same number of developers or generate that amount of code with 20% fewer developers?


Becirovic also supports rapid adoption of generative AI.
""I think speed is paramount,"" he said. ""I'm a big fan of hands-on-keyboard, as fast as possible, because it gives people perspective and understanding. They're not spending years analyzing.""
Becirovic also advocated for speed in cloud adoption, helping quickly grow the technology's penetration at Accenture. He believes widespread cloud deployment will now facilitate fast-paced generative AI uptake. Generative AI services live in the cloud. Cloud qualities such as elasticity and rapid innovation play into the new capabilities arising from generative AI, he noted.
""Cloud is a high-performance engine, and generative AI is your gas pedal,"" Becirovic said.
A September 2023 report from HCLTech, a technology company offering digital business services, provides another data point. Of the 500 business and technology leaders it surveyed, 85% said they recognized ""the cloud's role in enabling generative AI and agree it can only be deployed with the right cloud strategy.""

GenAI and IT architecture
New patterns ahead
Enterprises opting for existing models in their accelerated pursuit of generative must determine how best to access such offerings.
Becirovic framed the question as, ""How can they make sure they've got the right architecture patterns internally to connect with and consume all the different components and services?""
Organizations must decide how to consume a service and make it available in a centralized catalog for companywide availability, he noted. Other service considerations include privacy, security, cost and internal use. He said the overarching task of understanding a service may be viewed as a certification process or governance certification.
""Every organization should be thinking about [certification] in this new world,"" Becirovic said. ""Because today's the slowest day it's ever going to be. There's only going to be more services, more capability.""
Decisions on architecture patterns stem from the certification process, he added. At this point, business and technology leaders decide where generative AI will fit in their organizations -- employee enablement, infrastructure automation or help desk operations, for example.
Structuring for scale
At ServiceNow, Bedi said his last quarterly business review covered the AI architecture topic.
""We actually spent a chunk of time on what is our AI architecture, including generative,"" he said. ""What does that look like? What's the same, and what's different?""
Bedi said the meeting also brought up the need for a concept of ""LLMOps"" along the lines of machine learning operations. MLOps provides practices and tools for managing machine learning in organizations.
Interaction among LLMs is another aspect of creating an architecture.
""You're going to think about having large language models talk to other large language models directly,"" Bedi said. ""What does that architecture look like? What does that security look like? What does that data protection look like?""
As for AI governance, technology adopters need to consider issues such as model drift and bias, he noted. In Bedi's opinion, organizations don't have to dig into architecture and governance as they experiment with generative AI. But those elements will become necessary when it's time to expand beyond pilots.
""If you're preparing to go from experiment to scale pretty quickly, you're looking at the architecture. There are a few building blocks that have to go in place; LLMOps [is] one of them,"" he said.


Cloud providers vie to build AI infrastructure
Cloud providers are bulking up their AI infrastructures to deliver advanced compute for customers.
Forrester Research's ""The Future of Cloud"" report, published in July 2023, cited that trend as the ""next horizon of innovation"" for cloud platforms moving beyond commodity infrastructure. Hyperscalers are competing to scale their pricier AI infrastructures, Forrester Research reported, with high-performance computing (HPC) workloads becoming a priority.
""HPC will be part of a broader push around specialized workloads,"" said Lee Sustar, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Cloud providers are putting considerable effort into acquiring GPUs to run those workloads, he noted. In addition, hyperscalers are working to ensure they can deliver specialized services in the regions customers request while also meeting country-specific data sovereignty requirements. He said the task is more challenging for cloud providers than delivering more generalized x86 or Arm-based workloads.




GenAI and IT leadership
Enabling business users
While IT leaders puzzle over how to harness generative AI, they have also begun to think about how their roles might change because of the technology.
Keyur Ajmera, CIO at ICIMS, a talent acquisition platform company, envisions a ""shift up"" approach when it comes to managing enterprise IT. Where the concept of shifting left refers to moving technology closer to external customers, shifting up brings technology closer to internal business users, he said.
Emerging technologies such as generative AI will provide a catalyst.
""Generative AI is a game changer, as more vendors come out with their own versions of [Microsoft] Copilot or embedded generative AI capabilities,"" Ajmera said. ""These will be enabling technologies that business users and anyone in the organization can leverage to drive a lot of the technical innovation for the company. That frees up tech and IT teams to focus on governance, security, frameworks and establishing a really good cadence around how you use technology.""
Essentially, shifting up changes the IT department's role from doing things for users to enabling them to take on more technical tasks. At ICIMS, Ajmera began exploring this approach in data and analytics, which are among the IT fields where tech talent is hard to find.
""I can't hire 30 business intelligence analysts,"" Ajmera said. ""But what I can do is train up various operations folks and folks within the business who have technology savvy to effectively do some of this work.""
Shifting up lets the business side take control of activities such as creating data visualizations -- without depending on IT, he noted.
Karnik said the trend toward pushing more technology power to business users has been going on for a while, citing visualization and low-code/no-code platforms as examples.
""That process was already happening,"" he said. ""Generative AI is just one more step in that process.""
Karnik doesn't anticipate the IT department evolving into a strictly governance function that hands out tools to business users. Security and data protection will remain a critical function, he said, citing the potential for data leakage. Users must enter data to obtain insight from a generative AI tool. But if they provide sensitive data, they could be giving away an organization's proprietary knowledge.
It's up to tech leaders to inform business users on how to properly use generative AI, according to Karnik. ""The responsibility of the IT department becomes heightened and sharpened.""
Widening the scope of responsibility
That responsibility also becomes highly distributed, as the effects of generative AI ripple across enterprises.
""We're created a generative AI roadmap for each department in the company,"" Bedi noted.
He's worked with ServiceNow's HR leadership to consider how generative AI could reimagine the recruiting functions. ""It's everything from improving job descriptions to generating tailored interview guides,"" he noted.
Marketing is exploring how generative AI could provide intelligence that might have taken hours for people calling on customers to collate on their own. In cybersecurity, generative AI could scan through event logs to ""find the needles in the haystack,"" Bedi said.
The application of generative AI could see a dual role in the CFO's office. On the one hand, the task is determining what can generative AI do for the finance function, ""but it's also, 'How do we think about bending the cost curve in certain departments?'"" he added.
Ajmera also pointed to the CIO's broad responsibility for generative AI diffusion. He believes gaps could emerge within organizations, as some pockets of employees engage with generative AI and others don't.
""It's up to every CIO to bring the organization along on this journey,"" he said.

HR vendors agree: Generative AI isn't hype


The generative AI race is on as major HR vendors discuss how they plan to integrate the tech into their applications and make it available to customers in the coming year.

SAP SuccessFactors and Ceridian are holding user conferences this week, and like the just-concluded Workday conference, generative AI will be a topic of discussion. Coming into sharp focus among HR vendors is how they plan to use the technology.







Over the next 12 months, major HR vendors are planning to release generative AI-based tools to make HR applications more conversational. Features will include summarizing and creating content, such as writing job descriptions; helping conduct performance reviews; and personalizing learning materials.
As SAP illustrated last week with a planned product, conversational user interfaces will be one of the most noticeable changes ushered in by generative AI.
SAP SuccessConnect conference attendees will likely hear about Joule, a generative AI assistant that will act as a conversational AI interface. Joule will be integrated into SAP's cloud product portfolio, including SuccessFactors, and will pull enterprise data to answer plain-language queries as well as suggest ways to improve or fix something. SAP has yet to roll out Joule but said it plans to start with SuccessFactors later this year.
Similar to SAP, Workday is planning conversational AI interfaces. Oracle has outlined generative AI plans, as has UKG. Ceridian will outline its plans at its Insights conference, which started Monday.
In detailing Joule, SAP said generative AI is past its initial hype, a comment asserted by other HR vendors.
Generative AI is ""one of the biggest technology changes we've seen in our industry in my lifetime,"" said Joe Korngiebel, Ceridian's chief product and technology officer. ""It's rival to the cloud and the push to the cloud; it's rival to the PC era.""
There have been many ""big shifts"" in technology, ""but this one is different,"" said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and co-CEO of Workday. He told attendees at last week's Workday Rising that AI ""certainly feels like the most important shift since the emergence of the cloud.""

Deliver unexpected results
Sayan Chakraborty, Workday co-president who leads its product and technology organization, told Rising attendees that generative AI can deliver unexpected results and have conversations ""that feel very natural, unlike previous AI-powered assistants.""

""This is truly a moment that we'll remember with a before-and-after,"" Chakraborty said, comparing it to the arrival of the smartphone, cloud computing and even electricity.
The vendors contend generative AI will increase productivity, but they make the claim before the technology has been deployed. That may be why Workday invited Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, to present at its user conference.
Brynjolfsson was one of the researchers who looked at generative AI's use in a system used by 5,000 call center agents.
The study found that the ""least experienced operators got the biggest benefit,"" with a 35% gain in productivity in two to three months, Brynjolfsson said at Workday's conference. But most skilled workers ""didn't get nearly as big a benefit as the less-skilled workers because most of them already knew how to solve the problem,"" he said.

Asana Intelligence, powered by the Work Graph®, drives greater clarity, impact, and scale for executives, departments, and entire organizations

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 3, 2023--
Today Asana, Inc. (NYSE: ASAN) (LTSE: ASAN), a leading enterprise work management solution, announced new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that drive greater clarity, impact, and scale for executives, departments, and entire organizations. Through Asana’s Work Graph®, these new enterprise-grade AI capabilities empower leaders to steer their organizations toward reaching goals and driving outcomes faster.



“We stand at the precipice of a new golden age of innovation, where humans and AI together can achieve more than ever,” says Dustin Moskovitz, Asana CEO. “Yet, so many leaders still find themselves without the right tools to save time and resources, drive impact, and hit their goals. With our new AI capabilities – powered by Asana’s Work Graph – our customers can now harness AI at work to drive greater clarity and accountability, and maximize impact at scale. Asana brings AI and human innovation together to help leaders understand how work gets done within their organizations in real-time and find ways to work more efficiently.”


Asana’s latest AI innovations offer leaders:



A smarter way to maximize impact



(Starting today) Smart fields: Organize projects to support cross-functional collaboration with auto-generated custom fields.



(Starting today) Smart editor: Write clearer, more compelling drafts that strike the appropriate tone (for example, polite vs. direct or concise vs. detailed).



(Starting today) Smart summaries: Surface highlights from task descriptions and comments, along with key action items. In the future, make video calls actionable by turning meeting transcripts from calls into summaries and action items.



(What’s ahead) Smart workflows: Create workflows with simple, natural language instructions that are optimized over time to match specific goals and best practices.



(What’s ahead) Smart digests: See project updates with a feed that tracks recent changes or what may require priority attention.




A smarter way to drive clarity and accountability



(Winter 2023) Smart status: Create more comprehensive status updates faster with AI, pulling from real-time work data to identify risks, open questions, and roadblocks standing in the way of hitting goals.



(Winter 2023) Smart answers: Use natural language to ask Asana questions, and get timely answers and insights about projects, identify blockers, and determine next steps.



(Summer 2024) Smart goals: Write more effective goals by starting with a plain description of what to achieve and let AI draft it based on previous goals and performance.



(What’s ahead) Smart planning: Visualize potential outcomes with scenario planning based on timelines, resource allocations, and approved budgets.



(What’s ahead) Smart workload: Monitor and adjust team resourcing based on historical and future capacity to meet changing goals.




A smarter way to scale



(What’s ahead) Smart search: Use natural language to search and pull relevant information from Asana’s Work Graph data (for example, “show tasks assigned to me in the last month”).



Asana AI Technology Partner network: Leverage leading foundation models from OpenAI and Anthropic, tailored for the enterprise in a trusted, secure, and ethical way. Asana also integrates with services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) AppFabric to improve collaboration at scale.



Asana AI Channel Partner network: Support customers at scale in AI implementation through leading global solutions and systems integrator experts, like Slalom, CPrime, and West Monroe.



Enterprise security & control: Keep data safe, secure, and compliant with enterprise-grade security and permissions, while providing admins with controls over the role of AI at work.




Asana’s new AI capabilities are designed to help entire organizations – individuals, departments, and leaders – work smarter and drive outcomes faster. From marketing executives wanting to drive clarity around annual planning and goals; to operations leaders looking to maximize impact by scaling strategic initiatives across departments; and IT executives eager to standardize work management on one enterprise-grade platform that is trusted, secure, and uses AI in a transparent way, Asana’s new AI capabilities help enterprises around the world work smarter.



“At IPG Mediabrands, we use technology to empower all 18,000 of our employees across more than 130 countries. Asana has been instrumental in helping our teams work smarter,” says Jarrod Martin, CEO at KINESSO (IPG Mediabrands’ global performance marketing agency). “It has freed up time for employees to focus on innovation and strategic thinking, helped us understand where our processes can be improved, and reduced the amount of joyless work we do – the work that impacts our bottom line and the happiness of our people and clients. We are excited by the potential of AI to further reduce joyless work and enhance productivity.”


Asana’s Work Innovation Score


Asana also launched The Work Innovation Score, a proprietary, first-of-its-kind AI-driven benchmark developed by its Work Innovation Lab. The Work Innovation Score, which is now available to Asana’s enterprise customers, enables companies to benchmark their performance against industry peers across four key metrics: cohesion (how well employees work together), velocity (how quickly work moves forward), resilience (stability during employee turnover), and capacity (employee bandwidth). The Work Innovation Score shows how effectively teams are working together within an organization and suggests ways to improve collaboration, accelerate productivity, maximize employee impact, and increase competitive advantage. Developed by industry-leading experts on the science of work, the score is powered by Asana’s Work Graph®, state-of-the-art neural networks, and predictive AI. Because the Work Graph connects data across the whole enterprise – work, functions, teams, and people – Asana’s Work Innovation Score is uniquely able to assess innovation potential.



“Asana’s Work Innovation Score provides a lens into how teams work together, predicting challenges in how employees are collaborating in order to proactively address them. At AWS and through our joint research with Asana’s Work Innovation Lab, we’ve seen that employees are struggling with ‘collaboration overload,’ which comes at the cost of productivity,” says Federico Torreti, head of product for AWS AppFabric at AWS. “With The Work Innovation Score and services like AWS AppFabric—which connects multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for better security, management, and productivity—companies have new visibility into how to streamline collaboration and productivity to drive employee impact and gain a competitive advantage.”

Artificial intelligence has helped some people in their roles at work. 
The chief economist of LinkedIn said employers want people to be AI literate, not necessarily experts.
Other experts told Insider it's important to embrace the technology as it becomes more pervasive.

Employers want their employees to know how to use artificial intelligence. Since ChatGPT took the web by storm last year, the pervasiveness of AI has ballooned as a pop culture fascination and a powerful workplace tool. Financial markets, too, have taken notice, with mentions of AI on earnings calls surging 366% from this year's first quarter to the second quarter, according to a study by WallStreetZen.

Karin Kimbrough, chief economist of LinkedIn, said at a fireside chat on Monday that there's not a lot of job talent who are considered AI proficient.""It's not that employers want everyone to become an AI expert,"" Kimbrough said at the event. ""They just want people to become AI literate.""

Kimbrough told Insider in an interview that AI literacy means ""the ability to make use of tools to help you do your job better.""That could mean ""shedding some of the routine tasks that prevent you from doing more interesting work,"" she said, or it could mean using generative AI to help with summarizing information. It could also mean understanding when human judgment should come into play, she said.Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, said this week companies must lean into the technology or risk getting left behind. To that point, Sinclair Schuller, the co-founder of Nuvalence, a consulting firm that uses generative AI, said the nascent technology is on the fast-track to widespread adoption in the workplace. Hiring managers and bosses across sectors, he told Insider, are going to soon expect employees to embrace it.

""The bottom line is that having an AI-centric mindset — by considering AI as a collaborator, and hiring and upskilling accordingly — is the key to getting the most value out of these tools,"" Schuller said.But even as employers rush to adopt AI tool, there are deep concerns over the impact AI might ultimately have on society. An analysis from Pew Research Center said 52% of US adults are feeling ""more concerned than excited about the increased use of artificial intelligence"" based on a survey done this past summer.

A 2022 survey from Pew shows mixed results from US workers on whether they think AI will help or hurt them in the workplace over the next 20 years. ""I think the biggest shift for I think people in thinking about the impact on jobs of generative AI compared to all of the other AI that exists is that it is primarily people who thought their jobs were safer from AI that are more anxious today than ever before,"" Chris Hyams, chief executive officer of Indeed, told Insider.

Over the last year, the labor market has remained surprisingly resilient amid the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. Unemployment held steady at 3.8% in September, and there were still about 1.5 job openings per unemployed person as of August. Hyams said the jobs where face-to-face interaction isn't needed or where a worker doesn't have to engage in much physical activity, for instance, are the ones where artificial intelligence and especially generative AI are ""capable of doing a larger part of the job that you're doing right now."" He clarified that this doesn't mean these jobs are necessarily more likely to vanish, but they could be susceptible to big changes.""Imagine having unlimited, on-demand access to nearly infinite business knowledge,"" Schuller added. ""Your team could use it to do anything from automating mundane tasks to streamlining processes, even developing new, intelligent insights. Used in the right way, AI could enable a 500-person company to achieve the output of 1000 employees.""

His agents gave generic responses to clients’ issues. Faced with difficult problems, they often sounded stumped, he said.But when Shah saw that ChatGPT could respond to questions with intricate, lifelike responses, he knew it could fix the customer service hotline of his India-based e-commerce platform, Dukaan.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeShah used the software to improve his in-house customer service chatbot Lina, training it largely on his company’s help center content. In December 2022, he let the ChatGPT-powered bot field nearly all messages and found his customers were largely happy.By June, he had fired 27 of his customer service agents and replaced them with Lina.Story continues below advertisement“It was [a] no-brainer for me to replace the entire team with a bot,” he said in an interview, “which is like 100 times smarter, who is instant, and who cost me like 100th of what I used to pay to the support team.”ChatGPT took their jobs. Now they walk dogs and fix air conditioners.Call centers, which started becoming popular in the late 1990s, provide cheap offshore labor to handle mundane corporate tasks for Western companies. Now, amid a larger wave of automation, this work is being outsourced once again: to artificial intelligence.AdvertisementBacked by advanced technology, chatbots can interact directly with customers and solve problems independently — no human necessary.💻Follow TechnologyFollowStart-ups, banks and consumer goods corporations say the technology can help them cut costly customer service costs while providing clients with personalized service. They argue AI will give remaining call center workers more support, helping them feel fulfilled in their jobs.Story continues below advertisementBut economists and workforce development experts say the shift could have a profound effect on economies across the world, especially in countries like India and the Philippines, where call centers provide millions of people with modest-paying work and where surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete. The change is sparking a debate in the Global South about what, if anything, they can do to prevent a mass workforce disruption.Advertisement“You will … end up seeing a lot of jobs be eviscerated,” said Sharad Sharma, co-founder of the iSPIRT Foundation, an Indian nonprofit technology think tank. “And the fewer jobs that will remain will be different kinds of jobs.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextWhat to know about the Democratic convention now that Biden’s out of raceMany Democrats endorsed Vice President Harris, but they must make a formal nomination.

She noted an Oxford Economics and Cisco study, which estimated that digital automation could render 1.1 million jobs in her country obsolete by 2028.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend,” she said in a news release, “and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down.”In India, companies are already testing out how to replace customer service workers and call center agents with large language models, said Sharma, though he declined to disclose which companies he was aware of that were doing these kinds of tests.He noted that with agents using AI to augment their work, the amount of workers needed to handle the same volume of calls will dwindle.The effect to the economy will be undeniable, he said, and Indian outsourcing companies will need to adapt artificial intelligence into their operations quickly if they seek to keep jobs from going elsewhere. “India has to embrace augmentation faster than any other country,” Sharma said. “That is the conversation that is taking place.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut AI and labor rights experts are torn on the impacts.Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, said automation could be a boon to the industry. As part of his research on AI’s impact on call centers, he found that many companies are augmenting their agents’ jobs with AI software instead of fully automating them.Brynjolfsson said a suite of AI software tools help call center workers do their jobs better: transcription software analyzes call conversations in real-time and provides agents with ideal solutions; other tools identify angry customers and provides techniques to calm them down.This support allows workers to tackle difficult problems with far more ease, he said, leading to higher customer satisfaction and lower worker turnover. In his study surveying more than 5,000 call center agents using artificial intelligence software, access to the tools increased productivity by 14 percent, with novice workers seeing the largest gains and highly experienced workers finding negligible improvement.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe said companies should take note of these findings. “Don’t look first to automate,” he added. “Think about where you can augment things.”ChatGPT ‘hallucinates.’ Some researchers worry it isn’t fixable.Virginia L. Doellgast, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, argued the technology will make jobs more difficult: Easy customer service problems will be handled by artificial intelligence chatbots, leaving more complicated issues for humans to deal with.Remaining workers will deal with more difficult tasks that take longer to solve. If corporate compensation structures are tied to metrics, such as shorter call volume, they could be financially penalized.If artificial intelligence makes it easier for novice workers to perform better, she said, that could also justify companies hiring less expensive, less experienced talent, leading to wage deflation across the industry and less satisfying customer service.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Why would you need to hire a really experienced center worker who costs more money for their skills when you could get the same performance out of a less experienced one,” she said.But for entrepreneurs like Shah, cost matters above all. After the success of his Dukaan chatbot, he created a spinoff product that allows others to transition to an all-AI-powered hotline.Not every customer service employee should worry about being replaced, but those who simply copy and paste responses are no longer safe, according to Shah.“That job is gone,” he said. “100 percent.”Share427 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

As HR turns to generative AI, 2 ways to mitigate the risks



By Dawn Kawamoto

October 3, 2023 

Generative AI’s game-changing capabilities stand to offer transformational benefits for HR leaders; however, the technology does bring real dangers that HR needs first to address, experts warn.

HR uses generative AI for everything from drafting job postings to tackling the laborious task of matching employees’ skills to open positions. While only 5% of HR leaders say their function is currently using generative AI, 9% are conducting pilot tests and more than half are exploring how to use it in the future, according to a Gartner report that surveyed more than 100 HR leaders.
But, like with any transformational tech, generative AI can pose a threat, such as inserting bias in hiring and promotions, which can derail an employer’s efforts to expand diversity among its workforce. Amazon in 2018, for example, nixed using an AI tool for recruiting because it showed a bias against women.
Aneel Bhusri, Workday
“Is there truth to some of these claims about the dangers of AI? I believe, yes, those are true if the technologies are not used in an ethical and responsible way,” said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and co-CEO of Workday, at the company’s Workday Rising conference last week.
In addition to potentially introducing bias into processes, AI can deliver incorrect data that may appear correct on the surface, or AI hallucinations, warns Sayan Chakraborty, co-president at Workday. According to a report by NBC, such instances may come from the technology trying to connect dots when information is too sparse. If HR uses generative AI to draw insights from a small employee survey, for example, incorrect analysis can create big problems for people strategy.
2 ways to minimize hazards when using generative AI
Despite these dangers, Bhusri and Chakraborty say HR can harness the power of the technology if they take steps to reduce the risks.
Chakraborty says one approach calls for feeding high-quality data gleaned from “enterprise allies” into an employer’s generative AI. This type of data comes from a known source and adheres to regulatory, privacy and security requirements, compared to harvesting data straight from the internet, he says.
Sayan Chakraborty, Workday
“We’re mostly aware of these very large language models with billions or even trillions of parameters like GPT, which are trained on massive amounts of data straight from the internet and built in an opaque way. We don’t really know what training and fine-tuning went into these models,” Chakraborty says. “And, inevitably, these models reflect all the good and all the bad things on the internet, which can be a great place where you can get things done but also a dark place for misinformation.”
Instead of populating their gen AI tools with data from the internet, Workday clients, for instance, can rely on the firm’s own data set—built from 65 million users who are under contract and using the same version of its software to generate over 600 billion transactions, says Bhusri. “It’s a very clear, clean and coherent data set,” he notes.
A second step HR teams and employers can take is the uncommon approach of keeping humans involved when using generative AI.

“Humans are the ultimate decision-makers anywhere AI is applied,” Bhusri says. It’s uncommon because many organizations are looking to use the technology to fully automate tasks for speed and cost reduction without human involvement.
However, lawmakers are increasingly becoming concerned about generative AI without human oversight. For example, New York requires employers that use AI in the hiring process to undergo a bias audit within a year of launching the technology.
Despite concerns about generative AI’s potential for harm, its potential for transforming how organizations, including HR functions, perform their work is prompting employers to run toward the technology.
“I’ve been around the technology industry for a long time and there’s been a lot of big shifts. But this one is different,” Bhusri says. “It certainly feels like the most important shift since the emergence of the cloud.”

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Asana is weaving generative AI into Work Graph, its data model for work management organization, to bring workflow insights to customers faster.
The project management platform vendor on Tuesday released and unveiled a series of new capabilities to help businesses generate content and also extract more information about project management efficiency.








Bringing AI to Work Graph
The aim of Work Graph technology is to capture patterns in and information about work processes within an organizations.
By merging Work Graph with generative AI, Asana can potentially sharpen its work pattern capture capabilities, said Chris Marsh, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""Rather than just making individual task management more efficient, [AI] should give a boost to how work can be conceived of, planned and managed,"" Marsh said.
Generative AI is an apt addition to Asana's toolbox because it can better unearth specific problems and determine concrete ways in which teams can address them, he added.
""The [Work] Graph has needed AI to make it tangibly useful and many of the things Asana is announcing show that it is ready to play a more prominent role in Asana's overall value proposition,"" Marsh said.


Status updates and project blockers
Asana also unveiled a few generative AI tools to help teams create more accurate status updates and identify steps to stay on track.
Asana's Smart Status uses real-time work data to pinpoint possible risks and roadblocks the project team could face in pursuit of the goal. Similarly, another new tool named Smart Answers lets users type questions for specific insights about projects' progress and determine the best next steps.
Smart Answers can also help project managers identify where their assistance would be most useful by reducing the need for emails or text messages with team members that could lead to micromanaging, Asana chief product officer Alex Hood said. Instead, project managers can ask the data directly.
""You can interrogate the underlying project data or portfolio and get good answers,"" Hood said.
Smart Status and Smart Answers will be generally available next month, Hood said.

Asana's generative AI Smart Answers tool can quickly answer questions about projects' roadblocks and next best steps.







Text generation and summarization
In addition, the vendor released some new generative AI tools that are now generally available. These tools mainly focus on text generation.
One tool, Smart Editor, helps users draft content with a particular tone, with prompt descriptors that range from polite or direct to concise or detailed.
Another tool, Smart Summaries, collects the most essentials details from comments, key tasks and task descriptions and compiles them for quicker interpretation. In the future, Asana also plans to extend this capability to video calls by applying the tool to call transcripts.


Entering an AI-heavy market
Many project management vendors of all sizes are incorporating generative AI into their offerings. Asana must make intentional decisions about how they wield AI will be helpful to customers, Marsh said, especially as generative AI technology is still in its relative infancy.

""They need to begin to show more strategic kinds of implementation from their larger enterprise customers,"" Marsh said of Asana.
He observed that many project management vendors have had to redirect their efforts toward enterprise customers because other markets are becoming too crowded.
For example, Smartsheet last month unveiled scalable offerings and released its own generative AI capabilities. Other project management platform vendors include Wrike, Trello and Monday.com.
""With the lower end of the market beginning to look saturated and the middle more competitive, the focus from Asana and its core competition has had to shift to the enterprise,"" Marsh said. ""Strategic implementations there -- where the benefit from its investments in its Graph infrastructure and AI -- now needs to become more visible.""

      Key Takeaways    



        A recent report by LinkedIn found a 2.2X increase in global job postings related to artificial intelligence and generative AI between July 2021 and July 2023. 
      


        LinkedIn's report also reveals 17% higher growth in postings that mention AI or generative AI.
      









    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

With the emergence and widespread use of artificial intelligence over the past year, questions loom over how the technology will impact the job market — but according to a new report, it already has.A recent report from the job and networking platform LinkedIn found a significant surge in job postings worldwide that reference AI or generative AI. In fact, between July 2021 and July 2023, such job listings more than doubled globally.Moreover, the increase of AI-related roles isn't industry-specific, but rather spans a myriad of sectors, Olivier Sabella, vice president of talent solutions at LinkedIn, told CNBC.



""These job posts vary from roles where professionals will directly work on AI development, such as AI engineer, to job postings where AI is listed as a required skill — for example, a digital product manager or cyber security consultant,"" Sabella told the outlet.The report also found that it's not just employers warming up to the implementation of AI, but the new tech is also piquing job seekers' interest.Related: Netflix is Hiring an AI-Focused Role—and the Starting Salary is up to $900,000Job postings that mention AI or generative AI have seen 17% ""greater application growth"" over the past two years.""As for the popularity of job posts mentioning AI, candidates are savvy,"" Erin Scruggs, vice president of global talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said in the report. ""They're showing they want to go where opportunities are.""And some companies are willing to shell out big bucks for those who fit the bill.


A report by ResumeBuilder earlier this year found that of 1,187 business leaders in the U.S., 92% are hiring, and 91% are looking for ChatGPT experience. One in four is willing to offer starting salaries exceeding $200,000, and 17% of respondents said they'd surpass a $300,000 salary for AI ""prompt engineers.""Related: Hiring Managers Are Looking for ChatGPT Experience — And Some Are Willing to Pay Up to $800,000 For It

    Listen to this article    0:00 / 5:22 1X  BeyondWords Since the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), the issue of AI technologies-related job displacement is receiving renewed economic impact scrutiny.     For example, in March 2023, technology firm OpenAI released a report that found at least 80% of the U.S. labor force could have at least 10% of their work-related tasks affected by the introduction of GPT, while another 19% of employees may see at least 50% of these work-related tasks impacted. While GPT influence impacts all wage levels, the higher-income jobs potentially face the greatest exposure, concludes OpenAI. Also in March 2023, researchers at investment banker Goldman Sachs, after collecting data on occupationally-oriented tasks in Europe and the U.S., found that roughly two-thirds of current occupations are exposed to varying degrees of generative AI automation (such as found in ChatGPT), and that AI could substitute for nearly one-fourth of current work performed.  Pew Research found that ""jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus."" (iStock)  In July 2023, the McKinsey Global Institute issued a report estimating that without generative AI, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5% of the hours worked in the U,S. economy by 2030; but with generative AI, that share increased to 29.5%.   WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  Also in July 2023, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported that ""when considering all automation technologies including AI, 27% of jobs are in occupations at high-risk of automation."" Later in July 2023, Pew Research reported that ""in 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are the most exposed to AI, in which the most important activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI."" Furthermore, Pew Research found that ""jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus."" These jobs are generally classified as ""professional, scientific and technical services; finance, insurance, and real estate; and public administration.""  How do American workers view AI’s impact on their workplace?  VideoIn an August 2023 poll of 1,000 Americans, The Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State University asked Americans for their feelings on AI job displacement generally and then with their job specifically. ""Generally,"" 79% of Americans are worried about AI displacement – either ""somewhat"" or ""very worried.""   However, when CGO asked whether they are worried about their own job being displaced by AI, 62% of Americans are ""not worried at all,"" and only 15% ""very worried.""     AI JOBS WITH MIND-BLOWING PAYCHECKS OF $375K A YEARThese seemingly contradictory opinion poll results, however, track closely with the results of a 2020 poll conducted by The Center for Growth and Opportunity on the future of work, where three-of-four Americans believed that their job would exist in 30 years.Is AI a ""general purpose technology""? Definitely, as it is a group of technologies that will have widespread effects across industries and sectors, resulting in significant economic, social and public policy impacts.  Video    Will it likely have disproportionate effects on certain occupations? Yes, the above-mentioned studies forecast both negative and positive impacts. But it is important to differentiate whether AI (GPT) will ""eliminate"" - or deeply reduce - the demand for certain occupational skill sets (which it may), or will it ""complement"" many occupations, resulting in occupational productivity increases and organizational cost savings. ""Generative AI’s ability to 1) generate new content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and 2) break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,"" reports Goldman Sachs.  HOW AI TOOLS COULD TURN INTO JOB-KILLING MACHINES  According to Goldman Sachs’ researchers, the combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation (due to the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations), and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of generative AI potentially raising annual U.S. labor productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period following widespread adoption.     Moreover, the McKinsey Global Institute views ""generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright.""  VideoFive years ago, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban warned America of the impending ""Job Terminator"" known as AI: ""Literally, who you work for, how you work, the type of work you do is going to be completely different than your parents within the next 10 to 15 years.""   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONYet, the so-called ""rapid"" adoption of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) by industry has gradually evolved over the last decade. While there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the effects of a potentially ""disruptive"" technology like AI-GPT in the longer term, the projections for near-term widespread ""displacement"" of jobs or occupations will occur are less likely for those employees embracing AI-GPT tools as a complement to their existing skill sets - thus evolving their job scope and opportunities by creating new value-added skill sets.   Americans have successfully embraced similar technological challenges in the past, and they will confidently adapt to this latest occupational challenge.

Some fear that AI will wreak havoc on the job market.A report by Goldman Sachs in March predicted as many as 300 million jobs could be disrupted by the new technology, and the tidal wave of AI advances has left many workers worrying that their jobs could soon be replaced by technology.For some working in art and design this future has alread yarrived.

Artists were among the first to encounter generative AI. Image generators such as Dall-E and Stable Diffusion have also quickly gained traction. As the popularity of these tools grows, some artists say work and opportunities have begun to dry up.

Eva Toorenent has been working as a freelance artist and illustrator since 2019. Late last year, she was shocked to discover that another artist had taken artwork she'd posted on Instagram and used it to ""fine tune"" the AI model Midjourney to produce AI art in her style. The other artist then sold the artwork to a gallery.

""It was hurtful,"" she told Insider. ""My work has been stolen before, but this was a new kind of violating feeling that I haven't felt before.""Since then, she has increasingly encountered generative AI in her work, and says that the technology is being used to cut corners and costs, leaving freelance artists to pay the price.""It's scary to see,"" she said. ""But honestly, it feels inevitable.""

Entry-level jobs vanishingArtists told Insider that it's these freelance and entry-level jobs, particularly in film, TV and gaming, that are increasingly being done by AI.

""I noticed as early as last summer work was starting to dry up a little bit,"" said Reid Southen, a concept artist and illustrator who mainly works in the film industry. He said the downturn was partly due to the worsening economy, but that AI likely played a role too.Reid told Insider that he was aware of production companies turning to AI during the ""blue sky"" period where concept artists are brought on to produce mood boards and flesh out the look of a film.""AI seems to be taking a big chunk of that work,"" he said. ""Companies can use generative AI to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and churn out thousands of concepts in an afternoon.""

Concept artist and professional illustrator Karla Ortiz told Insider she'd been involved in three productions where generative AI had been used at the concept stage.""I'm a freelancer and so I charge by the hour, and these things were used in a way that 100% lessened my hours working on those projects,"" she said. ""It's being adopted quietly in a lot of different productions. It's alarming.""Eva believes that the shift toward AI-generated concept art is likely to hurt smaller artists at the start of their careers.""The beginning jobs are moving away,"" she said. ""If game companies use Midjourney to generate concept art and mood boards, it cuts off opportunities for up-and-coming artists to get noticed.""

Companies using AI to cut costsWhile the debate over AI rages, companies are already including it in layoff announcements and using it as an excuse for downsizing.IBM has paused hiring in roles that could be replaced by AI, and BT announced plans to replace 10,000 cut jobs with AI earlier this year.Something similar is happening in the art world. Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago, told Insider that the explosion in generative AI has sparked a ""race to the bottom"" as companies cut expenses and lay off low-level art roles.""There's a lot of actual replacement going on, but many companies are just using generative AI as a way to argue for downsizing, to try to drive down costs and maximize profits,"" he said.

Reid worries that the economic outlook and the growing presence of AI have created a ""perfect storm"" that is pushing many companies to cut jobs.""I think they're looking at numbers and they're seeing cost saving measures, and they're seeing tools that can aid their businesses without necessarily thinking about the human costs,"" he said.

The vanishing opportunities are especially galling considering that many of the AI image generators artists are losing work to are trained on artwork scraped from the internet.After she first encountered generative AI, Eva used the Have I been Trained tool and found that several of her artworks had been used to train AI models.

It feels like we are being replaced with our own labor.""Artists fear for the futureKarla Ortiz is one of three artists who have launched a lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney over claims the companies violated copyright laws by scraping their work to train AI models.""I'm hoping it'll set a very clear precedent on what actions are ok, and what actions are not ok when developing these technologies,"" Ortiz said.She fears that the uncertainty and concern surrounding generative AI is putting off people from going into careers in the creative industry: ""I don't blame them because I'm worried about my job prospects too.""

                                  Karla Ortiz is suing Midjourney and Stable Diffusion over their use of her works to train AI models.

Zhao is also concerned about how generative AI may impact the next generation. In collaboration with artists, he and his team developed Glaze, a tool that applies a filter to digital artworks that prevent AI models from using it to ""learn"" an artist's style and reproduce it when prompted.Glaze is ""designed to buy time"" for legal and regulatory systems to draft new rules on how to deal with AI, he said.Zhao feared for the future of human creativity: ""It's a really dark thing to contemplate.""Midjourney and Stable Diffusion did not respond to requests for comment from Insider.

Several companies are laying off and plan to let go of their employees due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). 
However, IBM doesn’t foresee the technology impacting its programmers’ jobs. 
Check out what the company’s CEO has to say.

On the one hand, big companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and T-Mobile are laying off people. A few reasons include uncertain economic conditions, reduced revenues and profits, and technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI). On the other hand, another tech giant, IBM, has confirmed that it doesn’t intend to lay off any programmers due to AI. In fact, while some people may lose their jobs, the company plans to hire more people. That said, the company does intend to stop hiring people for jobs that AI can perform.
According to Arvind Krishna, CEO, IBM, rather than costing programmers their jobs, the technology will improve their productivity by 30%. Interestingly, Krishna had said in MayOpens a new window  this year that about 30% (almost 7,800) of jobs at the company could be replaced by AI and automation over five years.
While he now believed that the company could phase out a few back-office HR roles, it may also increase the number of software engineering and sales roles over 3-4 years. According to him, “The increase was like 8,000. The decrease was like 800.” Krishna also believes that while AI may take over 10-20% of “lower level” tasks, it is unlikely to automate a person’s complete job.

Several studies indicate that AI could impact millions of jobs worldwide. For example, a recent studyOpens a new window  by Goldman Sachs predicted that about 300 million jobs could be affected by AI. However, a few other studies indicate otherwise. For example, a study by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) found that AI, specifically generative AI, will more likely augment jobs than destroy them.
What is certain, according to IBM’s recent studyOpens a new window , is that 40% of the global workforce will have to learn new skills over the next three years owing to AI implementation.

The hype is reflecting in job listings across the board. For example, job search engine Adzuna advertised 7.8 million open roles in the US in May and 1,496 of those mentioned generative AI, compared to only 185 listings in January. Only three job postings on Adzuna mentioned AI in May 2022.These postings are popular among job seekers in part thanks to high salaries, with companies across a number of industries offering salaries over $100,000 for jobs related to AI.

In the course of writing this article, we have spoken to numerous election officials and security experts about their apprehensions and ambitions regarding generative artificial intelligence. Within the elections community, many officials have expressed grave concerns about what generative AI might mean for election security. That sentiment aligns with recent media discourse highlighting the dangers posed by AI. An illustrative May 2023 article in the Washington Post described an increase in phishing attacks attributed to AI, noting that such attacks are “just the beginning . . . as attackers use artificial intelligence to write software that can break into . . . networks in novel ways, change appearance and functionality to beat detection, and smuggle data back out through processes that appear normal.”
Other commentaries recount the ways that AI may make it easier to impersonate election officials, offices, and system vendors in order to infiltrate election infrastructure and mislead the public. Meanwhile, some election officials worry that excessive emphasis on AI’s frightening capabilities itself breeds more peril. David Triplett, the elections manager for Ramsey County, Minnesota, wonders if “all this talk about AI’s power is fueling even more paranoia and confusion about the trustworthiness of elections.” Such concerns seem valid given recent sensationalist narratives stoking public fears to propagate baseless claims of AI-driven election rigging.
How much should election offices and vendors worry about the security threats posed by advances in AI, and what steps should they take to prepare for them? This article is the inaugural piece in a series delving into AI’s potential effects on American democracy. It examines generative AI’s capacity to disrupt the security of election offices and election system vendors. Specifically, we look here at how AI changes (and does not change) the cybersecurity situation for election offices and election infrastructure. We also look at the threat that generative AI poses to the ability of election offices to function as authoritative sources of election information and records. We then detail measures that government, the private sector, and the media must take to guard against AI’s risks and build public confidence in the integrity of election outcomes in the AI age. Later pieces in this series will consider, among other issues, AI’s effects on manipulated media in political advertising, election administration, voter suppression efforts, and the public comment process.

As AI and automation usher in a new economic era, every CEO recognizes the need to invest to stay competitive. They need a digital strategy that builds resilience, drives greater efficiency and growth that also provides trust, security and reliability.
Combining AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences, better anticipating their needs and delivering personalization across every unique interaction.
In addition, incorporating AI-enhanced features across the workforce can achieve greater employee satisfaction, improve productivity and decision-making. According to Slack’s State of Work report, Indian desk workers and found that 75% of them have adopted AI in their work to help drive productivity. While company leaders want to embrace generative AI, balancing value and risk is imperative to unlocking its full potential.
Transforming how Work Gets Done
Scheduling meetings, organizing files, managing administrative tasks – automating monotonous tasks will enable teams to be more productive and efficient, freeing up valuable time to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work.
Marketers, for example, are already using generative AI to transform how they connect with their customers by powering more automated and effective campaigns — quickly and at scale. In addition to targeting basics like content creation and writing copy, they’re transforming the way marketers analyze data, personalize messaging content, and optimize SEO strategy.
When it comes to sales teams, consolidating all their organization’s data on a single platform and auto-crafting personalized emails tailored to their customer’s needs is making how they work faster, smarter, and more efficient. Personalization is informed by CRM data, freeing sales reps to focus on building relationships, closing business, and driving revenue.
Generative AI tools are becoming increasingly conversational, too, and taking on the role of super-powered collaborators. They’re delivering intelligence across automations, sharing knowledge, providing conversation summaries and writing email drafts. The real power of this technology is when AI can analyze and act on the most valuable data from a company’s most trusted resource, helping teams work smarter and make informed decisions faster.
Informing Better Business Decisions
In the modern business landscape, data is the cornerstone of success. When it comes to AI, it’s only as good its data. While leaders understand the importance of data, many struggle to harness its power for better decision-making and business results. For some, it’s too complex or not accessible enough; others cite inability to generate impactful insights as an issue across their organizations.
The generative AI revolution will make it exponentially easier for everyone to tap into immense troves of trusted data to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently.
The integration of AI, real-time data and CRM allows for personalized content generation and tailored experiences across sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT. This enables businesses to anticipate customer needs, engage prospects, and optimize their operations, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Take for instance a sales leader who can generate visualizations based on natural language prompts that display real-time progress against their quota, along with recommendations for helping them meet goals. Such insights, based on patterns and trends in data that might be too vast or complex for humans to analyze manually, will give employees invaluable time back to focus on how they employ the results.
All of this will drive impactful outcomes quicker, empower creativity, and boost productivity and success.
The need to put Trust at the Center of AI
Generative AI will transform the way we work, yet its accuracy and quality depend on the data that fuels it. To limit potential for bias, hallucinations, and toxic outputs it’s important that data is pulled from sources that are relevant, representative, and complete. There’s also the need to keep a human in the loop on all customer interactions to validate and ensure accuracy of the data and outputs.
Whether generating a tailored sales email or customer support chat response, training workers to take full advantage of the technology and instilling an ethics-first approach is essential for companies wanting to use generative AI to deliver against growing customer expectations.
By unifying first-party data, leveraging trusted AI innovations to provide data privacy and security, and placing people and their understanding at the forefront of the transformation, companies can ensure they put safety and trust at the center of their customer relationships.

Uzbekistan actively boasts artificial intelligence, which impacts businesses

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant importance in recent years, particularly in the United States and China, with both governments and companies recognizing its potential and investing heavily in its advancement. Popular AI products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and China's state-of-the-art face recognition technology have emerged as a result. Uzbekistan is also among the countries that have integrated AI into their operations.According to Siyovush Muminov, a representative of Alif Holding, AI tools are purposefully designed to boost labor efficiency. As per consulting firms like McKinsey, generative AI could positively impact productivity, contributing between $2.2 to $4.4 trillion annually. PwC also predicts integrating AI technologies could have positive economic effects, potentially reaching $15.7 trillion by 2030.Photo: festival.goviral.kzAI in Uzbekistan: New OpportunitiesUzbekistan, like the United States and China, is closely monitoring the development of AI. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in interest in AI, resulting in various communities, educational courses, and conferences to raise public awareness and interest in this area. The state is actively supporting AI development by introducing the MyID biometric identification system, which remotely identifies customers of various companies. Additionally, Uzbekistan is fostering highly specialized startups, such as those focused on creating large language models specific to the Uzbek language and tools for speech recognition and synthesis in the State language. The number of people interested in AI education and job search is growing in Uzbekistan, as evidenced by the regular recruitment of the Alif artificial intelligence team. Uzbekistan recognizes the enormous potential of AI development and has supported several activities in this field in the past year, with plans to launch a machine learning course. Similarly, Uzbekistan is thoroughly committed to exploring AI's possibilities and continuously seeks new ways to further its development.AI in fintech: transforming the financial worldAI has become a prevalent tool in the fintech industry, owing to the vast data and range of services available. By optimizing costs and increasing revenue, it has proved to be valuable. At Alif, we have implemented a machine learning-powered credit scoring model for our ""Buy now, pay later"" product. This model has automated credit committee processes, decreased default rates, and improved sales by installments. The introduction of ML scoring has resulted in a significant improvement in default rates and a reduction in the decision time for payment requests. This is achieved by analyzing multiple parameters and providing a decision within seconds.Furthermore, we are developing an AI-based chatbot that processes thousands of customer requests. This reduces response time and provides round-the-clock support. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate AI into all processes and products where its effectiveness is proven. This includes recommendatory systems for marketplaces, voice assistants, advertising budget optimization, customer outflow reduction, and fraud prevention.Human AI Challenges Currently, there is a global discussion on the development of artificial intelligence, which raises concerns about its potential adverse effects. One of the primary debates is the fear of increased unemployment, with critics comparing the current AI development to the industrial revolution that led to job losses. The recent surge in generative AI development has only fueled this argument. Although there is some truth to this claim, AI has also created entirely new occupations and better-paid jobs than automated positions.At Alif, we have witnessed this in practice. With ML-scoring and chatbots, routine tasks are now automated and do not require specialized knowledge in any field. However, we still need to employ specialists in the field of AI, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI researchers. The salaries of such employees are significantly higher than those of support and credit committee employees.Automation does not necessarily lead to job losses. Support and loan committee staff are usually given opportunities for growth and development. They can move to positions that require creative skills and expertise, which AI is not yet fully capable of replacing.For those who can adapt to new realities and have great expertise, there is no threat of being replaced by AI. Instead, it should be viewed as an opportunity to increase production efficiency and the creativity of professionals in various fields.Business benefitThanks to recent advancements in technology and communication tools, small and medium-sized enterprises can now enhance their competitiveness by integrating AI into their operations. Previously, this advantage was limited to large corporations such as Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FAANG). Alif's AI development strategy focuses on incorporating AI into all processes, prioritizing areas where current technologies can provide the most significant benefits. Follow Daryo's official Instagram and Twitter pages to keep current on world news.
