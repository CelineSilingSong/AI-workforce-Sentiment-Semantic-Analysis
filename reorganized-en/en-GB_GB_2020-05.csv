The articles were then hosted on Microsoft’s website, with the tech company sharing advertising revenue with the original publishers.Manual curation of news stories also ensured that headlines were clear and appropriate for the format, while encouraging a spread of political opinions and avoiding untrustworthy stories, while highlighting interesting articles from smaller outlets.Some of the journalists now facing redundancy had longstanding experience in the industry, while for others it offered a foot in the door and a job in an industry which has seen wave after wave of cuts. They now face a tough challenge to get jobs elsewhere when the whole industry is looking to cut costs. Other teams around the world are expected to be affected by Microsoft’s decision to automate the curation of its news sites.In common with other news organisations, PA Media is facing tough financial challenges and has had to furlough some staff and ask others to take pay cuts. The company has expanded outside its traditional news agency business, recently buying stock image business Alamy shortly before the pandemic devastated the media industry.A spokesperson for the company said: “We are in the process of winding down the Microsoft team working at PA, and we are doing everything we can to support the individuals concerned. We are proud of the work we have done with Microsoft and know we delivered a high-quality service.”A Microsoft spokesperson said: “Like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis. This can result in increased investment in some places and, from time to time, re-deployment in others. These decisions are not the result of the current pandemic.”Many tech companies are experimenting with uses for Artificial Intelligence in journalism, with the likes of Google funding investment in projects to understand its uses, although efforts to automate the writing of articles have not been adopted widely.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingPress AssociationNewspapers & magazinesNews agenciesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRFK Jr apologises after leaked phone call in which Trump seems to offer dealJack Black puts Tenacious D ‘on hold’ after bandmate’s Trump shooting commentNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNever doubt the instincts of Donald Trump, who just appointed ‘never Trump guy’ as his running mateMarina Hyde",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan began his career as a consultant at Accenture, and has served a variety of business analyst and project management roles in technology and defense. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  We see evidence dating back to 2017 that Johnson & Johnson has been regularly publishing about their investments and initiatives related to artificial intelligence. At present, Johnson & Johnson does not seem to boast any mature, deployed applications with the firm itself, but its AI-related investment initiatives indicate their aspirations. According to an analysis by FiercePharma, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is the largest pharmaceutical firm by revenue, bringing in $82.1 billion in 2019. It’s a global healthcare behemoth with significant investments in life sciences spanning pharmaceuticals, consumer healthcare, and medical devices. However, its pharma group has seen the lions’ share of J&J’s success, outperforming its other units with notable sales expansion in oncology and immunology. J&J claims to be investing in data science competency throughout the firm. Piyush Mathur – Global Head of Workforce Analytics, Data Strategy, and Governance at Johnson & Johnson – summarized these efforts in a 2020 interview with i4cp: Across the enterprise, data science is one area we’ve been focusing on—it impacts every single function. We’ve started an overarching initiative across J&J called the Data Science Council. There are fifteen of us on the council made up of members from supply chain, R&D, finance, HR and the commercial side, all thinking about how to develop this skill within each function. In this article, we’re going to take a look at the known AI-related investments of Johnson & Johnson in the two areas where they seem to be most active today. Drug Development – J&J’s involvement with the Melloddy life science consortium, and their Quickfire emerging tech startup challenge. Robotic Surgery – New services and platforms for automating surgery procedures, which may increasingly be powered by and integrated with artificial intelligence. Drug Development Investments We found 2 examples of Johnson & Johnson’s AI-related investments supporting drug development: Melloddy The Melloddy project — which stands for Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery — is the first initiative we’ve seen that connects data from the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to support drug discovery. Johnson & Johnson is one of 10 pharmaceutical firms forming the research consortium. Each contributed €10m of “in-kind” assets to fund the program. Source: Melloddy Melloddy aims to leverage the world’s largest collection of small molecules with known biochemical or cellular activity to enable more accurate predictive models and increase efficiencies in drug discovery. The group claims to use “federated learning”, a decentralized type of machine learning, to allow partners in the program to enhance predictive machine learning models on decentralized data from each contributor, without exposing their own proprietary information. JLABS Quickfire Challenge Johnson & Johnson’s innovation laboratories (JLABS) is vetting new technologies with a series of what it is calling Quickfire Challenges. According to a recent JLABS press release, the purpose of the Quickfire Challenges is to overcome the adoption and regulation challenges of applying AI, VR/AR, blockchain, and other emerging technologies in healthcare. The program claims to offer access to mentors and experienced health tech innovators to help companies develop solutions ideas. The JLABS site lists 44 Quickfire Challenges, which award winners with grant funding from ~$10,000-$400,000 and can also include mentorship or residency at JLABS. Only one of these events was titled with a specific focus in AI, the 2017 Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery QuickFire Challenge. Three winners were awarded: Source: Johnson & Johnson Innovation Laboratories   Envisagenics highlights the details of its winning Quickfire Challenge entry here:  More recent challenges hosted at global innovation hubs like Boston and Seoul have also given AI top billing among the events’ focus areas. That said, we only found one AI-driven solution among Quickfire Challenge winners since 2019. ImagoWorks, one of two awarded winners of the Seoul Quickfire Challenge, received approximately US$134,000, one year of residency at the Seoul Bio Hub, and one year of mentorship and coaching from JLABS science, technology and commercialization experts. This Seoul-based company aims to improve surgical outcomes by purportedly applying AI and geometrical modeling technology with its 3D medical/dental software platform. The firm remains in the early stages of development. We found the ImagoWorks CEO’s profile on Linkedin, but no company profile, no employees, no website, and no product demos. Robotic Surgery Investments Johnson & Johnson is still in the early stages of developing surgical robotics capabilities that may see widespread use in production. However, its late-2019 acquisition of multiple surgical robotics companies demonstrates a healthy and growing appetite to capitalize on a new paradigm of “digital surgery”. Verb Surgical On Dec 20, 2019, Verb Surgical was acquired by Johnson and Johnson for an undisclosed amount. According to information provided on Verb Surgical’s site, it was founded in 2015 as a joint venture between Google and Johnson & Johnson, with the stated goal of providing new tools for surgeons that will empower improved outcomes, taking them beyond conventional laparoscopy and robotics. Since then, it has received a broad mandate and millions in funding to “democratize surgery.” The company’s stated vision is to create a single, connected platform to replace often-complicated integrations of single-point solutions that don’t provide intelligence. Verb is proposing a new paradigm called “digital surgery”, which is about translating technology and information into actions that have the potential to improve clinical outcomes. If successful, the platform would enable surgeons to prepare for, perform, and follow up on surgery cases in one place, significantly leveling up the amount of actionable information at hand for surgeons. This may include capabilities for sharing procedure data, best practices, and patient data. We found ample evidence of Verb’s grand ambitions as well as strong funding and support for its research. But so far no demos and few details about the specific service functions under development have been published. Per IPqwery, the intellectual property of Verb Surgical includes 61 registered patents primarily in the ‘Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene’ category. Also, in Verb’s most recent press highlight, Ashley McEvoy – EVP and worldwide chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s medical device segment – stated that “both the Auris-I platform and Verb – have conducted end-to-end procedures in multiple different indications in general surgery. We’ve gotten very good feedback from over 30 plus surgeons and we’re going to take the absolute best of all of those as we, in parallel, advance both of those programs.” She also stated that J&J is engaged in active discussions with regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe to advance these technologies. As of today, we found exactly one job opening for a deep learning engineer at Verb Surgical, as well as tens of other research engineering and data science roles among its 399 employee profiles and 21 job listings on Linkedin. If Verb’s vision for digital surgery comes to fruition, its platform could create new space for AI-driven solutions. For example, brand new data-sets could be used to train machine learning systems to improve healthcare outcomes. Also, robotic surgery devices could also be made more adaptable by implementing learning systems to facilitate control of the robotic components themselves. Auris Health Auris Health – also mentioned in McEnvoy’s statement above – received $733.3M in funding before it was acquired by Johnson & Johnson on Feb 13, 2019, for $3.4 billion. The Silicon Valley company was founded in 2017 by Dr. Fred Moll, co-founder of Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Auris received FDA clearance this year for a teleoperated robotic endoscopy system to diagnose lung disease called ARES (Auris Robotic Endoscopy System).  Auris states: The company’s aim is to “diagnose and treat lung cancer in a single setting”. Its “Monarch Platform improves upon existing, minimally invasive techniques by integrating robotics, micro-instrumentation, endoscope design, sensing, and data science into one platform to enable new categories of care.” We found no explicit examples of exactly how Auris is leveraging AI, but – like Verb – we found many full-time data science and machine learning roles among its 556 listed employees on Linkedin. In Summary Johnson & Johnson is in the early stages of a long-term plan for integrating AI with its enterprise. Its recent pattern of investment and acquisitions, as well as its stated goals, hint at a data-driven future for J&J’s drug discovery and robotic surgery businesses, which may prove fertile ground for future growth and integration of AI technologies and services.

They may be discouraged by fears that A.I., with its efficiency, will take away people’s jobs. They may question the ability of machines to be creative. Or they may have a desire to explore A.I.’s uses — but aren’t able to decrypt its terminology.This all reminds me of when people were similarly skeptical of another technology: the camera. In the 19th century, with the advent of modern photography, cameras introduced both challenges and benefits. While some artists embraced the technology, others saw cameras as alien devices that required expertise to operate. Some felt this posed a threat to their jobs.But for those artists willing to explore cameras as tools in their work, the aesthetic possibilities of photography proved inspiring. Indeed cameras, which became more accessible to the average user with advancements in technology, offered another technique and form for artistic endeavors like portrait-making.Art matters because as humans, we all have the ability to be creative. With time, the art we create evolves, and technology plays a crucial role in that process. History has shown that photography, as a novel tool and medium, helped revolutionize the way modern artists create works by expanding the idea of what could be considered art. Photography eventually found its way into museums. Today we know that cameras didn’t kill art; they simply provided people with another way to express themselves visually.This analogy is crucial to understanding the potential for artificial intelligence to influence art in this century.As machine learning becomes an increasing part of our everyday lives — incorporated into everything from the phones we text with to the cars we drive — it’s only natural to ask what the future of art in such an A.I.-dominated society will be. This question becomes even more relevant as machines step into the artistic realm as creators of art. In summer 2019, the Barbican Centre in London presented A.I.-produced pieces in a show called “A.I.: More Than Human.” And in November later that year, over one million people attended an exhibition exploring art and science at the National Museum of China in which many works were created using algorithms.ImageAn illustration depicting Leonardo da Vinci created by Ai-Da.Credit...Niklas Halle'n/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesI founded the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University in 2012. As an A.I. researcher, my main goal is to advance the technology. For me, this requires looking at human creativity to develop algorithms that not only understand our achievements in visual art, music and literature, but also produce or co-produce works in those fields. After all, it is our capacity to expand our creative skills beyond basic problem-solving into artistic expression that uniquely distinguishes us as humans.Human creativity has led to the invention of artificial intelligence, and now machines themselves can be forces of creativity. Naturally we are curious to see what A.I. is capable of and how it can develop. During the past eight years at the lab, our researchers have realized that A.I. has great potential for solving problems in art. For example, as an analytical tool, machine intelligence can help distinguish authentic paintings from forged ones by analyzing individual brush strokes.A.I. can also make sense of art by helping uncover potentially similar influences among artworks from different periods. In one test, machine learning was able to identify works that changed the course of art history and highlight new aspects of how that history evolved.Beyond digesting information, machines have also been able to create novel images — nearly entirely on their own — that viewers are unable to distinguish from works made by human artists. A.I. is even able to compose music that you can listen to on Spotify.Artists have long integrated new technologies into their practices. A.I. is no exception, yet there is a fundamental difference. This time, the machine is its own source of creativity — with the ability to comb through vast amounts of historical and social data, artificial intelligence can produce truly novel and uncanny imagery that is beyond our imagination. This element of surprise is the force that can advance artistic mediums in new directions, with the machines functioning not only as tools for artists, but also as their partners.But can an artificially intelligent machine be an artist in its own right? My answer is no.ImageAi-Da, a humanoid robot, and Aidan Meller, her inventor, present an oil painting in Oxford, England, created by artists based on a sketch by the robot.Credit...Niklas Halle'n/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhile the definition of art is ever-evolving, at its core it is a form of communication among humans. Without a human artist behind the machine, A.I. can do little more than play with form, whether that means manipulating pixels on a screen or notes on a musical ledger. These activities can be engaging and perceptually intriguing, but they lack meaning without interaction between artist and audience.In recent years I’ve been blessed to work with an increasing number of artists interested in exploring A.I. in their practices. I’ve dedicated myself to this work by developing Playform, a platform that allows artists to experiment with artificial intelligence without having to understand or navigate the algorithms and terminology behind the technology.Once such technological barriers are lifted, artists can make amazing things happen. Some of them use the technology to create images for artworks or for virtual reality projects. Many use A.I. to find inspiration. Others feed images of their own into the computer, using machine intelligence like a workshop to better understand their style.I’ve noticed that new technologies are often met first with skepticism before eventually being embraced. I see the same trajectory emerging for artificial intelligence. Like the camera, A.I. offers a means for artists and non-artists alike to express themselves. That makes me confident that smart machines can only help, not hurt, human creativity.

And most practitioners know the huge processing power and energy consumption needed to train pretty much any noteworthy neural network. That is to say, for the field to develop further, a new type of hardware is needed.Some experts consider that the quantum computer is that hardware. But even though it holds great promise, quantum computing is a technology that will take many decades to develop. Physics theories are not yet mature enough to enable the development of useful and cost-efficient devices.Neuromorphic computing, on the other hand, will take less time and resources to develop and will be very useful and cost-efficient, both regarding the cost of device development and the energy costs for processing power.As most readers don’t know what neuromorphic computing is, I will describe this new technology in this article, along with what it will enable us to do, in the “much-nearer-that-quantum” future.

Executive Summary
The drone industry is now in its golden age and its growth promises to be exponential.1 Even though humanitarian aid workers have used this technology for a decade, the expansion of its market as well as the development of technology are pushing more and more organizations to equip themselves with this device. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as remotely piloted aircraft or “drones” are small aircraft that fly by remote control or autonomously.2 This report focuses on the usage of unarmed civilian drones and UAVs. Future reports can explore the impact and development of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles and ground drones.
In 2014, OCHA highlighted in its Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Humanitarian Response policy paper3 the different uses of drones in humanitarian action demonstrating the increasing use of this technology. Additionally, the uses of drones in humanitarian action can be summarized by six categories identified by the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action in its report Drones in Humanitarian Action (2016)4: Mapping; Delivery of essential products to remote or hard-to-reach locations; Search and Rescue (SAR) ; Support for damage assessment; Increased situational awareness; and Monitoring changes (such as urban and camp growth, agricultural use or the construction of roads or infrastructure). This report will shed some light on how AI powered drones are improving and modifying these uses.
Rapid adoption can be explained through a combination of the opportunities modern drones present  and the ever-increasing artificial intelligence (AI)-related capacities they can leverage. On one hand, their use is simplified and empowered through autonomy. On the other hand, the improved performance in visual analytics makes it possible to rely on aerial drone imagery.
This report aims to highlight the extent to which AI increases the capabilities of drones. Thanks to the generalization of deep learning methods, drones are further capturing the environment in which they operate, allowing increasingly complex missions. This technology is also making it possible to significantly improve drone visual recognition as well as  image analysis. Since use of AI algorithms requires high computing power, its application often takes place post flight. This performance will be highlighted through three case studies:

Drones for Emergency Response to wildfires in Northern California (November 2018)


Drones for Emergency Response to Cyclone Idai by UNICEF in Malawi (March 2019)


Drones for Emergency Response to Cyclone Idai by WFP in Mozambique (March 2019)

The report also explores the potential future functionalities of drones. As advances in on-board computing power enable AI algorithms to run during flights, some experts envision further added value for the use of drones in humanitarian missions. Although some of the issues raised by OCHA in 2014 have been addressed, this report highlights the new/exacerbated challenges identified in relation to the use of artificially intelligent drones. These operational and ethical issues are fundamental and the humanitarian community, which has well-established principles, must systematically take them into account. This report is informed by scholarly and news articles, as well as 18 interviews with a diverse range of experts in the AI, UAV and humanitarian fields. They work in different branches of the United Nations, in academia, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, and private sector companies.

The message, which she forwarded to me, was from a handful of corporate Walmart employees calling themselves the “Concerned Home Office Associates.” (Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, is often referred to as the Home Office.) While it’s not unusual for journalists to receive anonymous tips, they don’t usually come with their own slickly produced videos.The employees said they were “past their breaking point” with Everseen, a small artificial intelligence firm based in Cork, Ireland, whose technology Walmart began using in 2017. Walmart uses Everseen in thousands of stores to prevent shoplifting at registers and self-checkout kiosks. But the workers claimed it misidentified innocuous behavior as theft, and often failed to stop actual instances of stealing.They told WIRED they were dismayed that their employer—one of the largest retailers in the world—was relying on AI they believed was flawed. One worker said that the technology was sometimes even referred to internally as “NeverSeen” because of its frequent mistakes. WIRED granted the employees anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.Trending NowWill AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li & Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas ThompsonThe workers said they had been upset about Walmart’s use of Everseen for years, and claimed colleagues had raised concerns about the technology to managers, but were rebuked. They decided to speak to the press, they said, after a June 2019 Business Insider article reported Walmart’s partnership with Everseen publicly for the first time. The story described how Everseen uses AI to analyze footage from surveillance cameras installed in the ceiling, and can detect issues in real time, such as when a customer places an item in their bag without scanning it. When the system spots something, it automatically alerts store associates.“Everseen overcomes human limitations. By using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, computer vision systems, and big data we can detect abnormal activity and other threats,” a promotional video referenced in the story explains. “Our digital eye has perfect vision and it never needs a day off.”In an effort to refute the claims made in the Business Insider piece, the Concerned Home Office Associates created a video, which purports to show Everseen’s technology failing to flag items not being scanned in three different Walmart stores. Set to cheery elevator music, it begins with a person using self-checkout to buy two jumbo packages of Reese’s White Peanut Butter Cups. Because they’re stacked on top of each other, only one is scanned, but both are successfully placed in the bagging area without issue.AdvertisementThe same person then grabs two gallons of milk by their handles, and moves them across the scanner with one hand. Only one is rung up, but both are put in the bagging area. They then put their own cell phone on top of the machine, and an alert pops up saying they need to wait for assistance—a false positive. “Everseen finally alerts! But does so mistakenly. Oops again,” a caption reads. The filmmaker repeats the same process at two more stores, where they fail to scan a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day chocolate box with a puppy on the front and a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. At the end, a caption explains that Everseen failed to stop more than $100 of would-be theft.False PositivesThe video isn’t definitive proof that Everseen’s technology doesn’t work as well as advertised, but its existence speaks to the level of frustration felt by the group of anonymous Walmart employees, and the lengths they went to prove their objections had merit.In interviews, the workers, whose jobs include knowledge of Walmart’s loss prevention programs, said their top concern with Everseen was false positives at self-checkout. The employees believe that the tech frequently misinterprets innocent behavior as potential shoplifting, which frustrates customers and store associates, and leads to longer lines. “It’s like a noisy tech, a fake AI that just pretends to safeguard,” said one worker.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe coronavirus pandemic has given their concerns more urgency. One Concerned Home Office Associate said they worry false positives could be causing Walmart workers to break social distancing guidelines unnecessarily. When Everseen flags an issue, a store associate needs to intervene and determine whether shoplifting or another problem is taking place. In an internal communication from April obtained by WIRED, a corporate Walmart manager expressed strong concern that workers were being put at risk by the additional contact necessitated by false positives, and asked whether the Everseen system should be turned off to protect customers and workers.Before Covid-19, “it wasn’t ideal, it was a poor customer experience,” the worker said. “AI is now creating a public health risk.” (HuffPost reported last week that corporate Walmart employees were concerned about Everseen’s technology putting store associates at risk amid the pandemic.)When Covid-19 reached the US, Americans rushed to stock up on food and household essentials at Walmart, and sales soared. Workers soon began falling sick; at least 20 Walmart associates have now died after contracting the coronavirus, according to United For Respect, a nonprofit that advocates for retail workers and that is crowdsourcing Covid-19 infection rates and working conditions at Walmart stores across the country. Last month, United For Respect said hundreds of Walmart employees participated in a national strike demanding safer working conditions and better benefits.A spokesperson for Walmart said the company has been working diligently to protect customers and its workforce, and believes the rate at which associates have contracted Covid-19 is lower than that of the general US population. They denied that false positives caused by Everseen were a widespread issue, and said the company had not considered turning the system off due to concerns about Covid-19.“We assess our technology regularly, and as evident with the large scale implementation of Everseen across the chain, we have confidence it is currently meeting our standards,” the spokesperson said in an email. Just prior to the start of the pandemic, Walmart said it made significant improvements to its Everseen system, which resulted in fewer alerts overall. The spokesperson declined to answer questions about what the updates may have entailed.The spokesperson also noted that there are a number of different reasons an associate might intervene during a self-checkout transaction, like when a customer has problems with their credit card. The company said it has taken a number of steps to ensure people are protected during these interactions, including regularly cleaning self-checkout kiosks and providing employees with protective equipment. In addition, workers are given handheld devices that allow them to handle most interventions from a distance, the company said.Do you know more about Walmart's use of AI? Email the author Louise Matsakis at louise_matsakis@wired.com.Everseen declined to answer questions about its technology. In a statement, a spokesperson said the company “accurately and effectively identifies potential theft [sic] is why retailers have successfully deployed it at thousands of locations to date, with many more installations planned.” They added that Everseen typically accounts only for less than 10 percent of total interventions at self-service checkouts. In a separate statement, the spokesperson said “Everseen is committed to helping its customers deliver the best possible experience for shoppers and store associates, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-checkout offers the benefits of a generally contactless shopping experience, allowing for proper social distancing and avoiding manned-lanes in busy stores with limited staff available.”But the Concerned Home Office Associates said their worries about Everseen long predate the pandemic. Emails obtained by WIRED show that other corporate employees raised issues about the technology failing to prevent theft in both 2017 and 2018. The employees said they were particularly vexed by Walmart’s continued investment in Everseen because NCR Corporation, which makes the majority of Walmart’s registers, had acquired an Everseen competitor called StopLift. They considered the acquisition an endorsement, and were confused as to why StopLift’s technology wasn’t being further explored.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDWhat’s more, the workers said an internal Walmart research and development group, the Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL), created its own anti-theft software they believed was more accurate than Everseen’s, according to information they were given internally. One Walmart employee said the technology, the existence of which was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, is now being tested in roughly 50 stores.Walmart declined to answer questions about its internal anti-theft software, but did not dispute WIRED’s reporting. “At an enterprise level, there are a number of tests happening at any given time across our footprint of nearly 5,000 stores,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The goal of IRL is to build AI capabilities that can be transferred to additional stores. We regularly test capabilities built internally in a small number of stores.”Rising ShrinkEverseen’s technology was designed in part to help solve a persistent problem with self-checkout. While allowing customers to scan and pay for their own items cuts down on labor costs for retailers, it has also led to more inventory loss, or “shrinkage,” due to shoplifting, employee theft, and other problems. “Theft through self-checkout lanes is exponentially higher than through traditional checkout lanes,” says Christopher Andrews, a sociology professor at Drew University and the author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreIn the past, Walmart and other retailers relied on weight sensors to prevent shoplifting through self-checkout, but those were prone to error and frustrated customers. Some stores are now turning instead to firms like Everseen, which promise to reduce shrink and increase customer satisfaction by relying instead on surveillance cameras and machine vision. Everseen has said that it works with a number of major retailers. Amazon uses similar technology in its Amazon Go convenience stores, where a network of cameras automatically log the products customers take. (Amazon is now licensing its “Just Walk Out” tech to other companies.)During the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, self-checkout may become even more important for stores, as customers look for low-risk ways to shop. NCR corporation said it’s now helping retailers modify its equipment to be as touchless as possible: for example, by reconfiguring machines so that customers can insert a debit or credit card without needing to press the “credit card” payment option. “It is fascinating to see self-checkout become poised as a public health strategy, in addition to things like cashless payment,” says Alexandra Mateescu, a researcher at the nonprofit institute Data & Society, who has written about the effects of new technology on retail workers.“Self-checkout is just one of the ways that we’ve offered customers solutions to get the items they need safely during this time, in addition to other options like delivery, pickup, touchless payment at the register and shopping online,” the Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. “Customers are using this option now, as much as ever, and we will continue to work hard to ensure the in-store experience for our customers is safe, affordable and convenient, as well as safe for our associates.”Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Walmart uses Everseen in thousands of stores to prevent shoplifting at registers and self-checkout kiosks. But the workers claimed it misidentified innocuous behavior as theft, and often failed to stop actual instances of stealing.
They told WIRED they were dismayed that their employer—one of the largest retailers in the world—was relying on AI they believed was flawed. One worker said that the technology was sometimes even referred to internally as “NeverSeen” because of its frequent mistakes. WIRED granted the employees anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.
The workers said they had been upset about Walmart’s use of Everseen for years, and claimed colleagues had raised concerns about the technology to managers, but were rebuked. They decided to speak to the press, they said, after a June 2019 Business Insider article reported Walmart’s partnership with Everseen publicly for the first time. The story described how Everseen uses AI to analyze footage from surveillance cameras installed in the ceiling, and can detect issues in real time, such as when a customer places an item in their bag without scanning it. When the system spots something, it automatically alerts store associates.
“Everseen overcomes human limitations. By using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, computer vision systems, and big data we can detect abnormal activity and other threats,” a promotional video referenced in the story explains. “Our digital eye has perfect vision and it never needs a day off.”
In an effort to refute the claims made in the Business Insider piece, the Concerned Home Office Associates created a video, which purports to show Everseen’s technology failing to flag items not being scanned in three different Walmart stores. Set to cheery elevator music, it begins with a person using self-checkout to buy two jumbo packages of Reese’s White Peanut Butter Cups. Because they’re stacked on top of each other, only one is scanned, but both are successfully placed in the bagging area without issue.
The same person then grabs two gallons of milk by their handles, and moves them across the scanner with one hand. Only one is rung up, but both are put in the bagging area. They then put their own cell phone on top of the machine, and an alert pops up saying they need to wait for assistance—a false positive. “Everseen finally alerts! But does so mistakenly. Oops again,” a caption reads. The filmmaker repeats the same process at two more stores, where they fail to scan a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day chocolate box with a puppy on the front and a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush. At the end, a caption explains that Everseen failed to stop more than $100 of would-be theft.
False Positives
The video isn’t definitive proof that Everseen’s technology doesn’t work as well as advertised, but its existence speaks to the level of frustration felt by the group of anonymous Walmart employees, and the lengths they went to prove their objections had merit.
In interviews, the workers, whose jobs include knowledge of Walmart’s loss prevention programs, said their top concern with Everseen was false positives at self-checkout. The employees believe that the tech frequently misinterprets innocent behavior as potential shoplifting, which frustrates customers and store associates, and leads to longer lines. “It’s like a noisy tech, a fake AI that just pretends to safeguard,” said one worker.
The coronavirus pandemic has given their concerns more urgency. One Concerned Home Office Associate said they worry false positives could be causing Walmart workers to break social distancing guidelines unnecessarily. When Everseen flags an issue, a store associate needs to intervene and determine whether shoplifting or another problem is taking place. In an internal communication from April obtained by WIRED, a corporate Walmart manager expressed strong concern that workers were being put at risk by the additional contact necessitated by false positives, and asked whether the Everseen system should be turned off to protect customers and workers.
Before Covid-19, “it wasn’t ideal, it was a poor customer experience,” the worker said. “AI is now creating a public health risk.” (HuffPost reported last week that corporate Walmart employees were concerned about Everseen’s technology putting store associates at risk amid the pandemic.)
When Covid-19 reached the US, Americans rushed to stock up on food and household essentials at Walmart, and sales soared. Workers soon began falling sick; at least 20 Walmart associates have now died after contracting the coronavirus, according to United For Respect, a nonprofit that advocates for retail workers and that is crowdsourcing Covid-19 infection rates and working conditions at Walmart stores across the country. Last month, United For Respect said hundreds of Walmart employees participated in a national strike demanding safer working conditions and better benefits.
A spokesperson for Walmart said the company has been working diligently to protect customers and its workforce, and believes the rate at which associates have contracted Covid-19 is lower than that of the general US population. They denied that false positives caused by Everseen were a widespread issue, and said the company had not considered turning the system off due to concerns about Covid-19.
“We assess our technology regularly, and as evident with the large scale implementation of Everseen across the chain, we have confidence it is currently meeting our standards,” the spokesperson said in an email. Just prior to the start of the pandemic, Walmart said it made significant improvements to its Everseen system, which resulted in fewer alerts overall. The spokesperson declined to answer questions about what the updates may have entailed.
The spokesperson also noted that there are a number of different reasons an associate might intervene during a self-checkout transaction, like when a customer has problems with their credit card. The company said it has taken a number of steps to ensure people are protected during these interactions, including regularly cleaning self-checkout kiosks and providing employees with protective equipment. In addition, workers are given handheld devices that allow them to handle most interventions from a distance, the company said.
Everseen declined to answer questions about its technology. In a statement, a spokesperson said the company “accurately and effectively identifies potential theft [sic] is why retailers have successfully deployed it at thousands of locations to date, with many more installations planned.” They added that Everseen typically accounts only for less than 10 percent of total interventions at self-service checkouts. In a separate statement, the spokesperson said “Everseen is committed to helping its customers deliver the best possible experience for shoppers and store associates, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-checkout offers the benefits of a generally contactless shopping experience, allowing for proper social distancing and avoiding manned-lanes in busy stores with limited staff available.”
But the Concerned Home Office Associates said their worries about Everseen long predate the pandemic. Emails obtained by WIRED show that other corporate employees raised issues about the technology failing to prevent theft in both 2017 and 2018. The employees said they were particularly vexed by Walmart’s continued investment in Everseen because NCR Corporation, which makes the majority of Walmart’s registers, had acquired an Everseen competitor called StopLift. They considered the acquisition an endorsement, and were confused as to why StopLift’s technology wasn’t being further explored.
What’s more, the workers said an internal Walmart research and development group, the Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL), created its own anti-theft software they believed was more accurate than Everseen’s, according to information they were given internally. One Walmart employee said the technology, the existence of which was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, is now being tested in roughly 50 stores.
Walmart declined to answer questions about its internal anti-theft software, but did not dispute WIRED’s reporting. “At an enterprise level, there are a number of tests happening at any given time across our footprint of nearly 5,000 stores,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The goal of IRL is to build AI capabilities that can be transferred to additional stores. We regularly test capabilities built internally in a small number of stores.”
Rising Shrink
Everseen’s technology was designed in part to help solve a persistent problem with self-checkout. While allowing customers to scan and pay for their own items cuts down on labor costs for retailers, it has also led to more inventory loss, or “shrinkage,” due to shoplifting, employee theft, and other problems. “Theft through self-checkout lanes is exponentially higher than through traditional checkout lanes,” says Christopher Andrews, a sociology professor at Drew University and the author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.
In the past, Walmart and other retailers relied on weight sensors to prevent shoplifting through self-checkout, but those were prone to error and frustrated customers. Some stores are now turning instead to firms like Everseen, which promise to reduce shrink and increase customer satisfaction by relying instead on surveillance cameras and machine vision. Everseen has said that it works with a number of major retailers. Amazon uses similar technology in its Amazon Go convenience stores, where a network of cameras automatically log the products customers take. (Amazon is now licensing its “Just Walk Out” tech to other companies.)
During the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, self-checkout may become even more important for stores, as customers look for low-risk ways to shop. NCR corporation said it’s now helping retailers modify its equipment to be as touchless as possible: for example, by reconfiguring machines so that customers can insert a debit or credit card without needing to press the “credit card” payment option. “It is fascinating to see self-checkout become poised as a public health strategy, in addition to things like cashless payment,” says Alexandra Mateescu, a researcher at the nonprofit institute Data & Society, who has written about the effects of new technology on retail workers.
“Self-checkout is just one of the ways that we’ve offered customers solutions to get the items they need safely during this time, in addition to other options like delivery, pickup, touchless payment at the register and shopping online,” the Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. “Customers are using this option now, as much as ever, and we will continue to work hard to ensure the in-store experience for our customers is safe, affordable and convenient, as well as safe for our associates.”

 Portrait of Napoleon I created with the help of artificial intelligence © Bas Uterwijk



An astonishingly “life-like” image of Napoleon appeared on social networks this week. It was created with the help of artificial intelligence by dutch photographer Bas Uterwijk. Napoleon.org wanted to find out more about how the artist created this image and we are delighted to share with you the answers he kindly provided.
See the portrait in high definition
Bas Uterwijk: I will tell a little about myself and the procedure I have used:
I am a photographer from Amsterdam with a background in computer graphics, special effects and 3D animation. About a year ago I started (as a hobby) creating images using a neural network. I am working with computer models that are trained on a huge variety of human faces. Through Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning this software [Artbreeder] is able to create near photo-realistic portraits based on my input combined with what it knows about human faces and the way light behaves in photography.
After I did a convincing restoration of Billy the Kid as an experiment, I started to work with inputting different paintings and sculptures to create famous people that lived before the invention of photography. The software I work with is developing fast and although I first tried doing Napoleon last year, the results were nice but not so perfect that I wanted to share it online. This month I picked up that particular project again and produced the image you have seen. The software is very good at some things but not perfect and it doesn’t work automatically so there is a lot of additional work and experimentation involved. I am constantly learning and chances are that this will not be the last version of Napoleon I will do. At the moment I am working simultaneously on several other historical people.

Although I try to keep my personal input to a minimum, the portraits I make are artistic impressions. I try to let the facts I can find about a person’s face weigh in the eventual representation, but I am no scientist and don’t claim any historical accuracy. It also really depends on what material I can find online and how much is known. Because of the many depictions and even photographs of descendants in the case of Napoleon the results will be much closer to the “truth” than an impression of let’s say Jeanne d’Arc or Cleopatra of whom most depictions spring mostly from the mind of artists! Here is a selection of portraits of Napoleon that I used. Some took a prominent role in the process, for others the weight was minimal.
Below is one of many trees that I have made [in Artbreeder] while trying to find Napoleon’s face. A new face gets added when either crossbreeding with another painting or saving an intermediate face after adjustment with sliders. These sliders control physical appearance parameters like hair and eye colour, age, width, height etc. In the end it is the artist that decides which is the “right” direction so the human component is decisive for the end result.

The automotive industry is a key driver and user of artificial intelligence (AI), which is fast percolating to different work areas. Now German major Durr has developed Advanced Analytics, the first market-ready AI application for paint shops. 
This intelligent solution, which combines the latest IT technology and mechanical engineering expertise, identifies sources of defects and determines optimal maintenance schedules. It also tracks previously unknown correlations and uses the knowledge to adapt the algorithm to the plant using the principle of self-learning. Advanced Analytics is the latest module from the DXQanalyze product series. First practical applications are showing that the software from Durr optimises plant availability and the surface quality of painted bodies.
Why do body parts exhibit the same defects with an unusually high frequency? When is the latest that a mixer in the robot can be replaced without causing machine stoppage? Precise answers are important for sustainable economic success. Because every defect or every unnecessary maintenance procedure that can be avoided saves money or improves the product quality. “Before there were very few precise conclusions that would enable the early detection of quality defects or failures. And if there were, they were generally based on a painstaking manual data evaluation or trial-and-error attempts. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes this much more accurate and automatic,” explains Gerhard Alonso Garcia, Vice President MES & Control Systems at Dürr.
The new self-learning Advanced Analytics plant and process monitoring system adds to DXQanalyze. The digital product series from Durr already included the Data Acquisition modules for acquiring production data, Visual Analytics for visualising it, and Streaming Analytics. The latter lets plant operators analyse in close to real time whether there are deviations from previously defined rules or target values in production using a low-code platform.
Durr's AI application Advanced Analytics identifies sources of defects and determines optimal maintenance schedules.
AI application with its own memory
What makes Advanced Analytics special is that the module combines large quantities of data including historical data with machine learning. In the figurative sense, this means that the self-learning AI application has a memory. This means that it can use information from the past to both recognise complex correlations in large quantities of data and predict an event in the future with a high degree of accuracy based on the current condition of a machine. There are multiple applications for this in paint shops, whether at component, process, or plant level.
Durr software reduces plant downtimes through predictive maintenance, repair information.
Reducing plant downtime with predictive maintenance
When it comes to components, Advanced Analytics reduces downtimes through predictive maintenance and repair information, for example by predicting the remaining service life of a mixer. If the component is replaced too early, it increases the spare part costs and repair overhead unnecessarily, while leaving it too long to replace a component can result in quality problems during coating and machine stoppages. Advanced Analytics starts by learning the wear indicators and the temporal pattern of the wear using high-frequency robot data. Since the data is continuously recorded and monitored, the machine learning module individually recognizes aging trends for the respective component based on actual use and calculates the optimum replacement time.
Machine learning simulates continuous temperature curves
Advanced Analytics improves quality at process level by identifying anomalies, for example by simulating the heat-up curve in the oven. Up to now, manufacturers only had data determined by sensors during measurement runs. However, the heat-up curves that are of vital importance for surface quality of the car bodies vary since the oven ages during the intervals between the measurement runs. This wear causes fluctuating ambient conditions, for example, in the strength of the air flow.
“These days, thousands of bodies are produced without us knowing the temperatures to which the individual bodies were heated. Using machine learning, our Advanced Analytics module simulates how the temperature varies under different conditions. This gives our customers a permanent proof of quality for each individual body and lets them identify anomalies,” says Gerhard Alonso Garcia.
Higher first-run rate increases equipment effectiveness
At plant level, the DXQplant.analytics software is used with the Advanced Analytics module to increase overall equipment effectiveness. The artificial intelligence tracks system defects such as recurring quality defects in model types, specific colours, or on individual body parts. This permits conclusions about which step in the production process is responsible for the deviations. Such defect and cause correlations make it possible to increase the first-run rate by allowing intervention at a very early stage.
Plant and digital expertise expertly combined
Developing AI-capable data models is a very complex process. Machine learning does not work by feeding unspecified amounts of data into a 'smart' algorithm, which then spits out an intelligent result. Instead, relevant (sensor) signals must be collected, carefully selected, and supplemented with structured additional information from production. With Advanced Analytics, Durr has developed a piece of software that supports different use scenarios, provides a runtime environment for machine learning models, and initiates model training. “The challenge was there was no generally valid machine learning model and no suitable run-time environment we could have used. To be able to use AI at plant level, we combined our knowledge of mechanical and plant engineering with the knowledge of our experts from the Digital Factory. This resulted in the first AI solution for paint shops,” explains Gerhard Alonso Garcia.
With Artificial Intelligence, systematic errors in the painting process can be detected, thus OEE can be increased by allowing intervention at a very early stage.

Interdisciplinary knowledge pays dividends
Advanced Analytics was developed by an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, computer scientists, and process experts. Durr also entered into cooperation partnerships with several leading automotive manufacturers. This allowed the developers to access real-life production data and beta site environments in production for different application cases. First the algorithms were trained in the lab using a large number of test cases. Next, the algorithms continued learning on-site in real-life operation and autonomously adapted to environment and use conditions. The beta phase was recently successfully completed and showed the potential of AI.

The future of work has always been a popular topic for discussion, especially among HR and payroll practitioners. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown many countries have experienced are fast-tracking discussions towards more practical interventions to prepare the workforce for what will be the new normal.
“Even though many aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the digitalisation of workforces have been theoretical, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic has forced management to rethink their approaches to employees and how they use technology to not only improve productivity but reinvent traditional processes,” says Ian McAlister, GM at CRS Technologies.




More than just technology
Consider artificial intelligence (AI), for example. Globally, 37% of companies have deployed AI solutions – up 270% from four years ago – and with spending on AI only expected to continue growing, some are concerned that this will result in significant job losses.
While it will make certain job roles redundant, McAlister believes it also presents an opportunity to reskill and upskill employees to be better prepared for a digitally-driven work environment. “While AI will see many subtle and not so subtle changes to job roles and skills over the coming years, throughout this the people element will remain critically important.
“Even with all the technological advances that 4IR will deliver, humans will continue to be the fundamental element to ensure its success. Just as with the industrial revolution and even the advent of the Internet, people will be repurposed to deliver on new roles and responsibilities, better reflective of the modern organisation. Automation will empower these workers to deliver more strategic value by taking care of much of the menial administration-intensive components of their daily responsibilities.”
Far from resulting in a massive job cull, the arrival of the ‘robots’ in recent times have not taken work away from people. The world’s unemployment rate last year was 5.4% and has remained between 5% and 6% for the last decade and a half. Consequently, it appears that it is not a lack of work that is the problem, but how employees leverage technology to improve the bottom-line that needs to be refined.
People-centric
“No technology will work successfully without human involvement,” McAlister continues. “Machine-learning delivers an element of automation, but it is still ultimately guided by the insights and experiences of people. Even if there is massive disruption at hand due to the current global crisis and the influx of 4IR technologies, this will likely contribute to an increasing reliance on team-based structures, increasingly virtual workplaces that are geographically agnostic, and the diversity of skills previously unimaginable.”
The lockdown has illustrated how many job functions can still be performed while working remotely. Virtual meetings and online group collaborations have become standard business practice. The resultant flexible work environment will likely continue even post-lockdown with many companies looking at implementing such policies in more direct ways.
“This could have a massive impact on office space, with organisations able to reduce their leases by moving into smaller buildings that cater to workers who have to be on site. A rotation system can also be implemented where employees work at hot desks and swop out with others who might be operating remotely. The spin-off from this could be the introduction of fibre access allowances to employees, given the money the business is saving on rent.”
“With traditional career paths changing so rapidly across the entry-level all the way through to middle management, companies must become more adaptable to this fast-moving environment,” McAlister concludes. “The future of the workforce and even the workplace might be guided by 4IR innovation, but it will still be informed by human experiences and the value individuals bring to the business from an experiential perspective.”

Category: AIMay 19, 2020 Microsoft announces new supercomputer, lays out vision for future AI work

By Jennifer Langston 













Microsoft has built one of the top five publicly disclosed supercomputers in the world, making new infrastructure available in Azure to train extremely large artificial intelligence models, the company is announcing at its Build developers conference.
Built in collaboration with and exclusively for OpenAI, the supercomputer hosted in Azure was designed specifically to train that company’s AI models. It represents a key milestone in a partnership announced last year to jointly create new supercomputing technologies in Azure.
It’s also a first step toward making the next generation of very large AI models and the infrastructure needed to train them available as a platform for other organizations and developers to build upon.
“The exciting thing about these models is the breadth of things they’re going to enable,” said Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Kevin Scott, who said the potential benefits extend far beyond narrow advances in one type of AI model.
“This is about being able to do a hundred exciting things in natural language processing at once and a hundred exciting things in computer vision, and when you start to see combinations of these perceptual domains, you’re going to have new applications that are hard to even imagine right now,” he said.

A new class of multitasking AI models
Machine learning experts have historically built separate, smaller AI models that use many labeled examples to learn a single task such as translating between languages, recognizing objects, reading text to identify key points in an email or recognizing speech well enough to deliver today’s weather report when asked.
A new class of models developed by the AI research community has proven that some of those tasks can be performed better by a single massive model — one that learns from examining billions of pages of publicly available text, for example. This type of model can so deeply absorb the nuances of language, grammar, knowledge, concepts and context that it can excel at multiple tasks: summarizing a lengthy speech, moderating content in live gaming chats, finding relevant passages across thousands of legal files or even generating code from scouring GitHub.
As part of a companywide AI at Scale initiative, Microsoft has developed its own family of large AI models, the Microsoft Turing models, which it has used to improve many different language understanding tasks across Bing, Office, Dynamics and other productivity products.  Earlier this year, it also released to researchers the largest publicly available AI language model in the world, the Microsoft Turing model for natural language generation.
The goal, Microsoft says, is to make its large AI models, training optimization tools and supercomputing resources available through Azure AI services and GitHub so developers, data scientists and business customers can easily leverage the power of AI at Scale.
“By now most people intuitively understand how personal computers are a platform — you buy one and it’s not like everything the computer is ever going to do is built into the device when you pull it out of the box,” Scott said.
“That’s exactly what we mean when we say AI is becoming a platform,” he said. “This is about taking a very broad set of data and training a model that learns to do a general set of things and making that model available for millions of developers to go figure out how to do interesting and creative things with.”
Training massive AI models requires advanced supercomputing infrastructure, or clusters of state-of-the-art hardware connected by high-bandwidth networks. It also needs tools to train the models across these interconnected computers.
The supercomputer developed for OpenAI is a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server. Compared with other machines listed on the TOP500 supercomputers in the world, it ranks in the top five, Microsoft says. Hosted in Azure, the supercomputer also benefits from all the capabilities of a robust modern cloud infrastructure, including rapid deployment, sustainable datacenters and access to Azure services.

This is about being able to do a hundred exciting things in natural language processing at once and a hundred exciting things in computer vision, and when you start to see combinations of these perceptual domains, you’re going to have new applications that are hard to even imagine right now.

“As we’ve learned more and more about what we need and the different limits of all the components that make up a supercomputer, we were really able to say, ‘If we could design our dream system, what would it look like?’” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “And then Microsoft was able to build it.”
OpenAI’s goal is not just to pursue research breakthroughs but also to engineer and develop powerful AI technologies that other people can use, Altman said. The supercomputer developed in partnership with Microsoft was designed to accelerate that cycle.
“We are seeing that larger-scale systems are an important component in training more powerful models,” Altman said.
For customers who want to push their AI ambitions but who don’t require a dedicated supercomputer, Azure AI provides access to powerful compute with the same set of AI accelerators and networks that also power the supercomputer. Microsoft is also making available the tools to train large AI models on these clusters in a distributed and optimized way.
At its Build conference, Microsoft announced that it would soon begin open sourcing its Microsoft Turing models, as well as recipes for training them in Azure Machine Learning. This will give developers access to the same family of powerful language models that the company has used to improve language understanding across its products.
It also unveiled a new version of DeepSpeed, an open source deep learning library for PyTorch that reduces the amount of computing power needed for large distributed model training. The update is significantly more efficient than the version released just three months ago and now allows people to train models more than 15 times larger and 10 times faster than they could without DeepSpeed on the same infrastructure.
Along with the DeepSpeed announcement, Microsoft announced it has added support for distributed training to the ONNX Runtime. The ONNX Runtime is an open source library designed to enable models to be portable across hardware and operating systems. To date, the ONNX Runtime has focused on high-performance inferencing; today’s update adds support for model training, as well as adding the optimizations from the DeepSpeed library, which enable performance improvements of up to 17 times over the current ONNX Runtime.
“We want to be able to build these very advanced AI technologies that ultimately can be easily used by people to help them get their work done and accomplish their goals more quickly,” said Microsoft principal program manager Phil Waymouth. “These large models are going to be an enormous accelerant.”
In “self-supervised” learning, AI models can learn from large amounts of unlabeled data. For example, models can learn deep nuances of language by absorbing large volumes of text and predicting missing words and sentences. Art by Craighton Berman.
Learning the nuances of language
Designing AI models that might one day understand the world more like people do starts with language, a critical component to understanding human intent, making sense of the vast amount of written knowledge in the world and communicating more effortlessly.
Neural network models that can process language, which are roughly inspired by our understanding of the human brain, aren’t new. But these deep learning models are now far more sophisticated than earlier versions and are rapidly escalating in size.
A year ago, the largest models had 1 billion parameters, each loosely equivalent to a synaptic connection in the brain. The Microsoft Turing model for natural language generation now stands as the world’s largest publicly available language AI model with 17 billion parameters.
This new class of models learns differently than supervised learning models that rely on meticulously labeled human-generated data to teach an AI system to recognize a cat or determine whether the answer to a question makes sense.
In what’s known as “self-supervised” learning, these AI models can learn about language by examining billions of pages of publicly available documents on the internet — Wikipedia entries, self-published books, instruction manuals, history lessons, human resources guidelines. In something like a giant game of Mad Libs, words or sentences are removed, and the model has to predict the missing pieces based on the words around it.
As the model does this billions of times, it gets very good at perceiving how words relate to each other. This results in a rich understanding of grammar, concepts, contextual relationships and other building blocks of language. It also allows the same model to transfer lessons learned across many different language tasks, from document understanding to answering questions to creating conversational bots.
“This has enabled things that were seemingly impossible with smaller models,” said Luis Vargas, a Microsoft partner technical advisor who is spearheading the company’s AI at Scale initiative.
The improvements are somewhat like jumping from an elementary reading level to a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of language. But it’s possible to improve accuracy even further by fine tuning these large AI models on a more specific language task or exposing them to material that’s specific to a particular industry or company.
“Because every organization is going to have its own vocabulary, people can now easily fine tune that model to give it a graduate degree in understanding business, healthcare or legal domains,” he said.

AI at Scale
One advantage to the next generation of large AI models is that they only need to be trained once with massive amounts of data and supercomputing resources. A company can take a “pre-trained” model and simply fine tune for different tasks with much smaller datasets and resources.
The Microsoft Turing model for natural language understanding, for instance, has been used across the company to improve a wide range of productivity offerings over the last year. It has significantly advanced caption generation and question answering in Bing, improving answers to search questions in some markets by up to 125 percent.
In Office, the same model has fueled advances in the smart find feature enabling easier searches in Word, the Key Insights feature that extracts important sentences to quickly locate key points in Word and in Outlook’s Suggested replies feature that automatically generates possible responses to an email. Dynamics 365 Sales Insights also uses it to suggest actions to a seller based on interactions with customers.
Microsoft is also exploring large-scale AI models that can learn in a generalized way across text, images and video. That could help with automatic captioning of images for accessibility in Office, for instance, or improve the ways people search Bing by understanding what’s inside images and videos.
To train its own models, Microsoft had to develop its own suite of techniques and optimization tools, many of which are now available in the DeepSpeed PyTorch library and ONNX Runtime. These allow people to train very large AI models across many computing clusters and also to squeeze more computing power from the hardware.
That requires partitioning a large AI model into its many layers and distributing those layers across different machines, a process called model parallelism. In a process called data parallelism, Microsoft’s optimization tools also split the huge amount of training data into batches that are used to train multiple instances of the model across the cluster, which are then periodically averaged to produce a single model.
The efficiencies that Microsoft researchers and engineers have achieved in this kind of distributed training will make using large-scale AI models much more resource efficient and cost-effective for everyone, Microsoft says.
When you’re developing a cloud platform for general use, Scott said, it’s critical to have projects like the OpenAI supercomputing partnership and AI at Scale initiative pushing the cutting edge of performance.
He compares it to the automotive industry developing high-tech innovations for Formula 1 race cars that eventually find their way into the sedans and sport utility vehicles that people drive every day.
“By developing this leading-edge infrastructure for training large AI models, we’re making all of Azure better,” Scott said. “We’re building better computers, better distributed systems, better networks, better datacenters. All of this makes the performance and cost and flexibility of the entire Azure cloud better.”

Lund/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database →ApplicationHuman-computer interactionEnd UserResearchSectorResearchTechnologyMachine learningIn the summer of 2009, the Israeli neuroscientist Henry Markram strode onto the TED stage in Oxford, England, and made an immodest proposal: Within a decade, he said, he and his colleagues would build a complete simulation of the human brain inside a supercomputer. They'd already spent years mapping the cells in the neocortex, the supposed seat of thought and perception. “It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rain forest,” Markram explained. “How many trees does it have? What shapes are the trees?” Now his team would create a virtual rain forest in silicon, from which they hoped artificial intelligence would organically emerge. If all went well, he quipped, perhaps the simulated brain would give a follow-up TED talk, beamed in by hologram.Related StoriesWired Q&AGoogle’s AI Guru Wants Computers to Think More Like BrainsTom SimoniteThe A.I. IssueThe Genius Neuroscientist Who Might Hold the Key to True AIShaun RavivSleep No MoreOne Couple’s Tireless Crusade to Stop a Genetic KillerKelly ClancyMarkram's idea—that we might grasp the nature of biological intelligence by mimicking its forms—was rooted in a long tradition, dating back to the work of the Spanish anatomist and Nobel laureate Santiago Ramón y Cajal. In the late 19th century, Cajal undertook a microscopic study of the brain, which he compared to a forest so dense that “the trunks, branches, and leaves touch everywhere.” By sketching thousands of neurons in exquisite detail, Cajal was able to infer an astonishing amount about how they worked. He saw that they were effectively one-way input-output devices: They received electrochemical messages in treelike structures called dendrites and passed them along through slender tubes called axons, much like “the junctions of electric conductors.”AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTCajal's way of looking at neurons became the lens through which scientists studied brain function. It also inspired major technological advances. In 1943, the psychologist Warren McCulloch and his protégé Walter Pitts, a homeless teenage math prodigy, proposed an elegant framework for how brain cells encode complex thoughts. Each neuron, they theorized, performs a basic logical operation, combining multiple inputs into a single binary output: true or false. These operations, as simple as letters in the alphabet, could be strung together into words, sentences, paragraphs of cognition. McCulloch and Pitts' model turned out not to describe the brain very well, but it became a key part of the architecture of the first modern computer. Eventually, it evolved into the artificial neural networks now commonly employed in deep learning.Trending NowReporting on Brain-to-Brain Interfaces in 3 StepsThese networks might better be called neural-ish. Like the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, they're impressionistic portraits of what goes on in the brain. Suppose you're approached by a yellow Labrador. In order to recognize the dog, your brain must funnel raw data from your retinas through layers of specialized neurons in your cerebral cortex, which pick out the dog's visual features and assemble the final scene. A deep neural network learns to break down the world similarly. The raw data flows from a large array of neurons through several smaller sets of neurons, each pooling inputs from the previous layer in a way that adds complexity to the overall picture: The first layer finds edges and bright spots, which the next combines into textures, which the next assembles into a snout, and so on, until out pops a Labrador.Despite these similarities, most artificial neural networks are decidedly un-brainlike, in part because they learn using mathematical tricks that would be difficult, if not impossible, for biological systems to carry out. Yet brains and AI models do share something fundamental in common: Researchers still don't understand why they work as well as they do.What computer scientists and neuroscientists are after is a universal theory of intelligence—a set of principles that holds true both in tissue and in silicon. What they have instead is a muddle of details. Eleven years and $1.3 billion after Markram proposed his simulated brain, it has contributed no fundamental insights to the study of intelligence.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and morePart of the problem is something the writer Lewis Carroll put his finger on more than a century ago. Carroll imagined a nation so obsessed with cartographic detail that it kept expanding the scale of its maps—6 yards to the mile, 100 yards to the mile, and finally a mile to the mile. A map the size of an entire country is impressive, certainly, but what does it teach you?

In the late 19th century, Cajal undertook a microscopic study of the brain, which he compared to a forest so dense that “the trunks, branches, and leaves touch everywhere.” By sketching thousands of neurons in exquisite detail, Cajal was able to infer an astonishing amount about how they worked. He saw that they were effectively one-way input-output devices: They received electrochemical messages in treelike structures called dendrites and passed them along through slender tubes called axons, much like “the junctions of electric conductors.”
Cajal's way of looking at neurons became the lens through which scientists studied brain function. It also inspired major technological advances. In 1943, the psychologist Warren McCulloch and his protégé Walter Pitts, a homeless teenage math prodigy, proposed an elegant framework for how brain cells encode complex thoughts. Each neuron, they theorized, performs a basic logical operation, combining multiple inputs into a single binary output: true or false. These operations, as simple as letters in the alphabet, could be strung together into words, sentences, paragraphs of cognition. McCulloch and Pitts' model turned out not to describe the brain very well, but it became a key part of the architecture of the first modern computer. Eventually, it evolved into the artificial neural networks now commonly employed in deep learning.
These networks might better be called neural-ish. Like the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, they're impressionistic portraits of what goes on in the brain. Suppose you're approached by a yellow Labrador. In order to recognize the dog, your brain must funnel raw data from your retinas through layers of specialized neurons in your cerebral cortex, which pick out the dog's visual features and assemble the final scene. A deep neural network learns to break down the world similarly. The raw data flows from a large array of neurons through several smaller sets of neurons, each pooling inputs from the previous layer in a way that adds complexity to the overall picture: The first layer finds edges and bright spots, which the next combines into textures, which the next assembles into a snout, and so on, until out pops a Labrador.
Despite these similarities, most artificial neural networks are decidedly un-brainlike, in part because they learn using mathematical tricks that would be difficult, if not impossible, for biological systems to carry out. Yet brains and AI models do share something fundamental in common: Researchers still don't understand why they work as well as they do.
What computer scientists and neuroscientists are after is a universal theory of intelligence—a set of principles that holds true both in tissue and in silicon. What they have instead is a muddle of details. Eleven years and $1.3 billion after Markram proposed his simulated brain, it has contributed no fundamental insights to the study of intelligence.
Part of the problem is something the writer Lewis Carroll put his finger on more than a century ago. Carroll imagined a nation so obsessed with cartographic detail that it kept expanding the scale of its maps—6 yards to the mile, 100 yards to the mile, and finally a mile to the mile. A map the size of an entire country is impressive, certainly, but what does it teach you? Even if neuroscientists can re-create intelligence by faithfully simulating every molecule in the brain, they won't have found the underlying principles of cognition. As the physicist Richard Feynman famously asserted, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” To which Markram and his fellow cartographers might add: “And what I can create, I do not necessarily understand.”

(Mark Lennihan/AP)ShareComment on this storyComment474Add to your saved storiesSaveSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook is joining the permanent work-from-home trend, saying it will start allowing some employees to apply to work remotely for good.Facebook could have about 50 percent of its 45,000-person company working remotely in the next five to 10 years, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a public video announcing the policy Thursday. But the social media giant will also lower paychecks to reflect cheaper costs of living in some cases, depending on location.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFacebook will start “aggressively” opening up hiring for remote workers, Zuckerberg said, including for people living in areas a few hours away from its offices and in new hubs it will establish.Story continues below advertisement“Certainly being able to recruit more broadly, especially across the U.S. and Canada to start, is going to open up a lot of new talent that previously wouldn't have considered moving to a big city,” he said.Twitter employees can work from home foreverTech companies have been the first to move to permanent work-from-home policies after proving the practice works during the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter said last week that it would allow all of its employees to choose to continue working from home long term even after the pandemic ends.AdvertisementThe industry, which relies heavily on positions in which jobs are completed on computers, is better-positioned than many for most remote work. But the companies have long relied on sprawling open campuses that put an emphasis on hallway interactions and collaboration spaces. The coronavirus pandemic, which has sent most employees home, is shifting that. Many expect that even when companies decide it is safe to reopen offices, the spaces and remote work policies will look very different than they did before.Story continues below advertisementFacebook is taking a more measured approach than Twitter. It will begin recruiting hires for remote work outside its usual office hubs, Zuckerberg said, and some existing employees can apply to work remotely. But he said choosing to live in cheaper cities could mean employees’ paychecks would be reduced.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“Our goal here is to enable many existing employees to become remote workers, if you want,” he said.Facebook usage is up amid coronavirusThe company will adjust salaries depending on where employees live — paying less to those who work remotely from cities where the cost of living is lower. Facebook already pays different salaries based on locations, but this means employees who are allowed to work remotely have until Jan. 1 to tell Facebook where they are living and might get a paycheck cut.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“That means if you live in a location where the cost of living is dramatically lower, or the cost of labor is lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower in those places,” Zuckerberg said.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.U.S., Germany foiled Russian plot to assassinate CEO of arms manufacturer, officials saySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Family of teen who died after ‘One Chip Challenge’ sues snack companySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.La Niña is coming.

Here’s what renters should know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Still, lower salaries in smaller cities might not work for all positions, especially for executive-level jobs. Will Hunsinger, CEO of Silicon Valley executive recruiting company Riviera Partners, said companies like Facebook will need to keep executive pay high to compete with rivals. In addition, the company will likely save money on operational expenses such as free food and shuttle services. “They’re going to pay them what it takes to get that talent,"" he said.Story continues below advertisementAn internal company survey found that about 45 percent of employees interested in remote work were “pretty confident” they would move to another location. It also said about 40 percent of employees said they were somewhat, extremely or very interested in remote work. About 60 percent of employees asked for flexibility, or a combination of remote work and office work.AdvertisementFacebook responding to that survey with its new policy could prove a morale booster for the workforce. Some workers have said that a string of scandals, from the Cambridge Analytica data privacy breach to the use of the company’s platform to spread conspiracy theories and false news, has hurt morale there.Big Tech was the first to send workers home. Now it’s in no rush to bring them back.Facebook has already said most employees will work remotely through the end of the year, though it expects its offices will open for a small number of employees starting in July. Initially, offices will only allow about 25 percent capacity because of social distancing guidelines, Zuckerberg said.Story continues below advertisementFacebook’s decision is likely to send ripples across the industry.“It’s going to have a big effect,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington who studies Silicon Valley. “Facebook is big, it hires a lot of people, it’s a big force of recruitment. The landscape of tech right now is so dominated by these five very big companies.”AdvertisementIt will also give the company a recruiting advantage by giving it flexibility geographically, she said.Facebook has the money to keep its Menlo Park campus — something Zuckerberg pledged to do in his Thursday announcement. But the company’s announcement might be even more influential for smaller and midsize tech companies, O’Mara said, which might now seriously consider remote work in part as a way to reduce spending on office space.Story continues below advertisementEngineers at the company with strong performance reviews will be the first group allowed to apply for remote work.With the idea of working from home becoming more appealing as people try to limit exposure to the coronavirus, Zuckerberg’s decision also tracks with other moves in which he has been able to quickly seize on a popular idea or product just gathering momentum in the tech industry. He jumped on cryptocurrency as the idea gained traction, working to launch a digital currency. His move to buy Instagram when the company had just a dozen employees demonstrated an ability to see trends in technology moving toward image-sharing long before others, and his mega-purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion showed an ability to understand the role messaging would play in social networking.AdvertisementBut the offer to allow employees to work from home wherever is also viewed as a potentially powerful recruiting and retention tool. Many Silicon Valley start-ups already have moved to remote work in the short term to compete for talent with tech giants.Story continues below advertisementNow, remote work may become an even more expected part of tech culture.“I think with Facebook doing it… it will be a standard thing now. It won’t even be a perk, it will be an option,"" said David Chie, CEO of Silicon Valley recruiting agency Palo Alto Staffing.The great video chat faceoff: Six apps. Dozens of heads. One came out on top.Facebook has already broadcast it is recruiting 10,000 people this year at a time when Silicon Valley start-ups are laying off thousands of people. This new permanent work-from-home benefit will become a recruiting tool, increasing its leverage as compared to some start-ups.Still, some of Facebook’s contract workers are likely to continue to come into the office, particularly its army of over 15,000 content moderators, whose work reviewing graphic posts is generally considered too sensitive to be done from home.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementZuckerberg emphasized how this policy would help the company build tools for other businesses that support remote work. The company said its new video chat service, Messenger Rooms, would be available for business customers to host work meetings.Facebook also announced Thursday that its Workplace tools for businesses on the social network is now used by 5 million paying customers, up from 2 million in October.“Moving to more remote work I think will give us the opportunity to advance some of the important future technology that we work on,” he said.Heather Kelly contributed to this report.Share474 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

The company will use artificial intelligence to help identify these potential bad actors and provide safety notices to users about messages from shady accounts. This represents the latest example of Facebook employing automation to address its myriad content moderation problems. The company also says it brings Messenger closer to being end-to-end encrypted by default.A key detail of how this new strategy works is that Facebook is trying to limit how much its AI actually reads the content of user messages in order to identify scams. The technology is instead watching for potential abuse based on what accounts are doing.“We may use signals [such as] user reports or reported content to inform the machine learning models,” a Facebook spokesperson told Recode, “but we don’t do so proactively, and we primarily use behavioral signals to determine when to surface a safety notice.”For instance, it might create a notice if an account is trying to use a name that looks like one of your friends, or an account that belongs to an adult is sending a bunch of messages or friend requests to minors. As the moderation tool is not accessing message content, it’s designed to work with full encryption, which Facebook has long said will roll out on Messenger. (Facebook-owned WhatsApp is already end-to-end encrypted.)Notably, Facebook does not automatically block potentially fake or scammy accounts if they’re flagged by this new automated moderation tool. Messenger will now display a safety notice that warns the user and gives them the chance to block the person or read about how to protect themselves from scams. This strategy is not unlike Facebook’s recent move to nudge users who have liked coronavirus hoaxes.Facebook will provide a notice to users when it detects an account that might be an impersonation of another Facebook friend. FacebookThis new tool is attempting to solve a well-documented problem on Messenger. Con artists continue to find creative and convincing ways to impersonate users’ friends and family in order to trick people into giving up their money or financial information. One of Facebook’s new safety messages even specifically warns people to “Refuse requests for money.” And more recently, those ploys have taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic, with scammers promoting fake treatments and charity efforts. The problem got bad enough that the Better Business Bureau issued a public warning about it.If Messenger determines that an account might be associated with spam, it will provide recommendations and tips.Fakes like these are a systemic problem on Facebook’s platform. The company estimates in its own community standards enforcement report that it disabled 1.7 billion fake accounts in the first three months of 2020 alone. Facebook also estimates that about 5 percent of its monthly active users in the last quarter were fake accounts, though the company claims it catches almost all of these accounts with automation before users need to report them.Importantly, however, this latest attempt to address its massive scam problem will not apply to misinformation, which has long festered on Facebook’s platforms. Fake news and conspiracy theories are finding new fertile ground amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Facebook has made several policy changes in order to curb the Covid-19 “infodemic,” as Recode has noted. But again, these new safety notices do not apply to fake news and misinformation, despite its prevalence on private messaging apps like Messenger and WhatsApp.A Facebook spokesperson told Recode in an email that it uses a “forwarded” label in Messenger to indicate when a specific message did not originate from the sender and that the company is “exploring more strict forward limits.” For at least a couple of years, Facebook has gone even further by limiting forwarding on its messaging platforms. The company employed this method to fight fake news after violence in India and Myanmar a few years ago, and more recently claimed that limiting forwarding cut down on the spread of viral messages in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic by 70 percent. It’s unclear if these messages actually contained fake news, however.Related:Coronavirus scammers are flooding social media with fake cures and testsThe new safety notices also represent yet another attempt by Facebook to use automation to curb its toughest content challenges, which are significant. Facebook has already employed AI in its efforts to solve problems as wide-ranging as terrorist propaganda and recruitment to illegal opioid sales, though none of those abuses have completely gone away. And most recently, when the pandemic forced the company’s human reviewers from their offices, Facebook again turned to its AI-powered content moderation technology, though it warned that the technology would be less than ideal.Ultimately, time will tell whether the new safety alerts in Messenger will cut down on scams — and there’s no reason to scoff at the technology’s power to quickly flag large amounts of content to give users a heads up that something might be fishy. Scammers invariably tend to find workarounds, so the technology will continue to evolve. And again, at the end of the day, it’s up to the user to notice the alert and do something about it.The feature has been rolling out on Android devices since March, and Facebook says it has been flagging potentially concerning messages for more than 1 million people a week. Starting next week, the feature will start to be expanded to iOS users.Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

The plan involved chest CTs—three-dimensional scans of lungs displayed in finely detailed slices. By studying thousands of such images, an algorithm would learn to decipher whether a given patient's pneumonia appeared to stem from Covid-19 or something more routine, like influenza.In the US, as the virus spread in February, the idea appeared to hold promise: With conventional tests in short supply, here was a way to get more people screened, fast. Health professionals, however, weren't so sure. Although various diagnostic algorithms have won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration—for wrist fractures, eye diseases, breast cancer—they generally spend months or years in development. They're deployed in different hospitals filled with different kinds of patients, interrogated for flaws and biases, pruned and tested again and again.Related StoriesPublic HealthWhat if Covid-19 Returns Every Year, Like the Common Cold?Gregory BarberOpinionArtificial Intelligence Won't Save Us From Coronavirus Alex EnglerMachine VisionChinese Hospitals Deploy AI to Help Diagnose Covid-19Tom SimoniteWas there enough data on the new virus to truly discern one pneumonia from another?

Commentators have been raising concerns over Twitter's recent hiring of artificial intelligence (AI) star Fei-Fei Li, who has links to the Chinese Communist Party.Twitter appointed Stanford professor and former Google vice president Li to its board as an independent director earlier this month, citing her AI expertise.Li's appointment came after she left her role as chief scientist of AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning) at Google Cloud in October 2018 following a controversy surrounding Google's Project Maven initiative, which helped the Pentagon identify drone targets from blurry video footage.The project prompted an employee revolt at Google, with some 4,000 signing a petition against Project Maven, and some quitting in protest.Li was also instrumental in the setting up of a new Google AI lab in China.Twitter currently uses an AI technique called deep learning to recommend tweets to its users and also uses AI to identify racist content and hate speech, or content from extremist groups.France-based commentator Wang Longmeng said hiring Li to work at Twitter was like hiring a fox to guard the hen-coop.""They seem to have ignored the backstory of Li's previous cooperation with China,"" he said. ""Li Fei-fei ... secretly opposed Google's cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense from a high moral standpoint ... but turned a blind eye to Project Dragonfly, in which Google was planning to help the Chinese Communist Party vet online speech.""Wang said Li also used a slogan closely associated with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a 2017 media interview in China, pledging to help China develop its AI capabilities.""I hope that democratic countries will reflect on this and start plugging the loopholes,"" he said. ""Fei-fei Li is very likely to be one of those loopholes.""Key military technologyLi is also an adviser on AI to China's prestigious Tsinghua University. Its vice president You Zheng has said that the university's AI research has two main purposes, one of which is to meet national defense needs under a ""military-civilian integration policy.""AI has been named as a key military technology under President Xi, who has announced that China plans to become a world leader in the field by 2030.In addition, Li has been linked to a students' association under the aegis of the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department.Mainland media reports listed  her as a guest at China Overseas Talent Exchange Conferences in the southern city of Guangzhou in 2017 and in Beijing in 2018, both of which were hosted by the European and American Alumni Association under the aegis of the United Front Work Department.Li also has ties to the Beijing-based Future Forum for the development of mobile technology with a strong 5G focus. The organization operates under the aegis of the state-run China Association for Science and Technology, and is supported by Beijing's Chaoyang District Government, according to its website.The Forum has been linked with some of the biggest names in Chinese technology, including NetEase founder Ding Lei and Baidu founder Li Yanhong. More interestingly, there are a number of descendants of veteran revolutionaries involved in the organization -- including Zhu Yulai, son of former premier Zhu Rongji, and Liu Lefei, son of former Politburo member Liu Yunshan.Uphold free speechRenee Xia, head of the overseas-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network, called on Twitter to uphold free speech.She said that the company has already issued ""blue tick"" symbols to accounts operated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party regime, including the Chinese foreign ministry, state-run Xinhua news agency, and the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling party.""One of Twitter ’s certification criteria is that [blue-tick accounts] should work for the public good,"" Xia said. ""How can you certify a government agency that monitors people's internet use and suppresses freedom of expression? Twitter needs to do more.""Xia cited the recent detention of former journalist Zhang Jialong, who was tried on public order charges for comments made on social media this month.""The vast majority of the Chinese people cannot use Twitter freely and legally, but Chinese officials can illegally obtain Zhang Jialong's comments on Twitter,"" Xia said.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Zheng Chongsheng for the Mandarin Service.

Cap’FALC Project: the digital tool for an inclusive society by Inria, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and Unapei

In the face of the current health and economic crisis, it is important to be able to provide all citizens with the information they need to understand the situation and find answers. However, as Unapei member associations have pointed out, people with intellectual disabilities do not have access to this multiple and complex information. This is why the Cap’FALC project makes sense with a new digital tool developed thanks to the skills of Inria, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and Unapei.

Cap’FALC aims to significantly advance access to information for all and to facilitate the sustainable participation of people with intellectual disabilities in the life of society.
Access to information: a major societal challenge for people with intellectual disabilities
In this period of crisis, every individual needs to know what to do to protect himself, to understand his rights, to be informed about the reality of this complex situation. And as proof: television news channels are enjoying their highest ratings of the decade. But this information conveyed by the major national media is still very often inaccessible to people with intellectual disabilities.
A truly supportive and inclusive society must enable people with intellectual disabilities to be citizens like others, and in particular to be informed. This is the objective of the FALC method, developed in 2009 by European associations of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. This method makes it possible to make information accessible to all people who have difficulties in understanding. It is based on the expertise of people with disabilities and implies that they are at the heart of the production of written material that is easy to read and understand.
Also, since the beginning of the health crisis, the Unapei member associations have been producing and publishing documents in FALC: validated derogatory travel certificates, information on the coronavirus, explanations of barrier gestures. And today, clarifications on the deconfinement and on the realization of the tests. These documents in FALC relayed on the site https://unisetsolidaires.unapei.org/, by the Government and by certain media have enabled many people with intellectual disabilities to better understand the period of confinement. The Secretary of State for Disabled Persons has also already published two FALC sheets, accessible on www.handicap.gouv.fr, one on the new rules associated with deconfinement and the other designed to help disabled persons to choose between remaining confined or deconfining after 11 May.
Cap’FALC, a digital tool for an inclusive society
To date, many associations, including 15 ESATs (Établissements et services d’aide par le travail) managed by associations of the Unapei movement, have developed an activity of transcription of texts in FALC by workers or volunteers with disabilities. These associations regularly transcribe texts entrusted by companies and administrations to make them accessible to all.
However, the number of writings available in FALC remains insufficient! In view of the absolute necessity to improve access to information for all, it becomes essential to facilitate the work of transcribers in FALC.
Cap’FALC’s objective is to develop an accessible digital tool that meets this precise need by facilitating the production of texts in FALC thanks to a transcription aid algorithm. The research project used to develop the tool is the subject of a thesis supervised by INRIA and Facebook AI Research.
“What I particularly like about this project, in which I am currently working to develop the algorithm that will be used by Unapei, is the fact that it puts cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence at the service of inclusion,” says Louis Martin, PhD student in charge of developing the tool. “It’s motivating to know exactly what my research work will be used for and to be able to make it evolve according to the needs of the people who will use it”.
The Cap’FALC project aims to reduce the isolation and exclusion of people with intellectual disabilities by improving the accessibility of information through the widespread use of Easy to Read and Understand (FALC). This project will be operational in 2021.
“FALC is a kind of universal language that speaks to everyone. Initially designed to enable people with intellectual disabilities to understand certain texts, it is proving to be a formidable driving force in the service of dyslexic and visually impaired people, as well as foreigners with a poor command of a language, illiterate people, the elderly and primary school children. Moreover, Europe has been involved in the FALC since 2009 with the mission of reducing the social divide linked to language,” underlines Sophie Cluzel, Secretary of State for People with Disabilities.
People with intellectual disabilities at the heart of the Cap’FALC project
People with intellectual disabilities are fully involved in the project at all stages of its development. Their experience in transcription and their expertise in its use are indispensable.
“Unapei and its associations have always been pioneers in making information accessible to people with intellectual disabilities. At a time when demand is growing, Cap’FALC will make it possible to meet that demand while capitalizing on the user expertise so essential for people with disabilities in the production of texts in FALC for a more accessible and inclusive society,” said Luc Gateau, President of Unapei.
Antoine Bordes, Director of Facebook AI Research, also adds:
“This is a very important project for the Facebook AI Research teams. In our fundamental research laboratory in artificial intelligence, we seek excellence in our work, but above all, we want these advances to serve the common good and be put to work for everyone. We are delighted to be a founding partner of this unique project and look forward to seeing the first results. Cap’Falc will have a very concrete impact on the daily lives of thousands of people in France”.
The algorithm uses the latest advances in artificial intelligence and language processing for the FALC transcription task. This research work, carried out by Inria and Facebook AI Research, has already resulted in several scientific publications presented at international conferences.
This algorithm will work in a similar way to a spell checker, which finds passages in a text, proposes solutions but does not correct without human validation. Thus, while the tool developed will be a valuable aid for disabled people responsible for transcribing texts into FALC, it will in no way replace their intervention at all stages of the writing process; it is their eyes that validate a text as accessible and easy to read and understand.
The Cap’FALC project is sponsored by the French Secretary of State for Disabled Persons and brings together Unapei, the main French associative movement in the field of intellectual and cognitive disabilities, Inria, the National Research Institute for Digital Sciences, and FAIR, Facebook’s artificial intelligence research laboratory. The project is supported by Malakoff Humanis via the CCAH (Comité national coordination action handicap).

Prevention of violent extremism in India is an important and necessary requirement for the country. Such efforts need multi-dimensional coordination between Armed Forces and various National law enforcement agencies. Today’s asymmetric warfare requires newer tools and techniques to keep pace with the changing times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving as a very effective and well-established technique in counter-terrorism and is the way ahead for Indian Armed Forces to undertake ‘predictive counter-terrorism’ measures so as to prevent violent extremism in hotbeds of terrorism like Northern Command of Army. What is Artificial Intelligence? Broadly, AI refers to the Information Systems capable of performing tasks that resemble human problem-solving abilities, use computer algorithms or rule-sets to do things that would normally require human intelligence. &quot;AI is a tool that carries out functionalities encoded in them, which are inherited from the intelligence of their human programmers. However, with the correct set of data, these AI engines can be trained to learn to identify patterns and information which may be humanly impossible, especially while working with huge digital database moving at a high data rate,&quot; Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert says. AI and Counter-Terrorism For India, terrorism is no new entity and the Nation is familiar with violent activities throughout. It is well established that the terrorists, along with those who inspire them, represents a major transnational challenge, with detection and disruption of such groups always being a priority. The dynamic means of terror financing is one of the key factors in the proliferation of anti-social activities. Along with the changing times, terrorism and its connectivity too has become highly digital and are benefitting from cyber-crime networks. The use of various AI techniques such as Facial Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks and Social Network Analysis are some of the popular tools. “An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a feed-forward back propagation network has been found to establish with a high degree of certainty various deceptive behaviour patterns. Such tools in hands of investigator support system would be valuable in the identification of terrorists. A Social Network Analysis tool is particularly suitable for analyzing terrorist networks since they take relationships into account, rather than only attributes, which are otherwise difficult to obtain for covert networks. Dark-web based investigations are of main interest here, apart from analysis of social media platforms like Facebook, Blogs, Twitter etc,” explains Kulshreshtha, C4I expert. Digital Database for AI Implementation India has established a wide range of surveillance and data gathering advance tools. And, through database-centric schemes like National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID), Network Traffic Analysis System (NETRA) and the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network &amp; Systems (CCTNS), law enforcement agencies have achieved centrally a Lawful Intercept and Monitoring (LIM) system. Post 2008 Mumbai terror attack, these mechanisms got a big boost. Explaining how this will work, Kulshreshtha says, “The AI work may start by collecting information on `lessons learnt’ after each terrorist skirmish in a specified data format. This record shall have the profile of a terrorist and their tactics, while also recording own shortcomings for improvement. In time, with past and subsequent data sets, Indian Defence Forces shall have an institutionalized database on each terrorist activity or engagement which is geotagged and linked to various other factors like weather etc.” “This data, when stored in AI relevant format, is highly useful for training the prediction algorithm and with some iterations shall be able to through results on next likely move of the terrorists based on various circumstances like weather conditions or when cornered inside a building etc. With this, the present human-based experience shall be harnessed within the AI engine and form the basis of predictive counter-terrorism. This shall assist in gaining effective progress against terrorists while ensuring the safety of personnel on Ground Zero.” Make In India Initiative DRDO lab Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is nodal agency for research and development in the areas of AI and Robotics for the Defence Forces. Despite being accredited with certifications like CMMI ML2 or ISO 9001:2015, involvement in resolving field-level solutions for soldiers in high risk areas have been an ever-widening gap. “The NITI Aayog’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence had no mention of Armed Forces or Security forces in the Charter, probably a report driven more by the Industry initiative. With pandemic highlighting various human vulnerabilities, and Prime Minister’s initiative of ‘atmanirbhar’, this can be considered as an opportunity for Defence Forces to undertake their own problem-solving by extending the Financial Powers at GOC level for execution of AI Projects directly with the Industry so as to develop solutions to meet their local requirements, to which only they are well versed when compared to Central Agencies in New Delhi,” he suggests.",,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence/combating-terrorism-through-artificial-intelligence/1963627/'}",en_IN,[],,,,,2024.0,True,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financialexpress', 'productID': 'financialexpress.com:showcase'}",Financial Express,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fe-logo-600.png', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'Financial Express'}",,,,,1961.0,"['https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress', 'https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-financial-express-india', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialexpressonline/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmk6ZFMy1CT80orXca4tKew']",,,,,Business,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/', 'name': 'Business News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/business/', 'name': 'business'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence/', 'name': 'defence'}}]",,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.financialexpress.com?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,The Financial Express,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-09,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/artificial-intelligence.jpg', 'caption': 'The use of various AI techniques such as Facial Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks and Social Network Analysis are some of the popular tools.', 'description': 'artificial intelligence,terrorism,\xa0Indian borders, armed forces, make in india,\xa0Counter Terrorism,\xa0AI Implementation,\xa0Digital Database, defence news', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}",[],[],"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://financialexpress.page.link/fe_app'}",Read to Lead,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': ['https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/']}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': '108'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'en-US', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}",,,,,

The Internet Furry Drama Raising Big Questions About Artificial Intelligence

Much of the fun of internet drama comes from its frivolousness, but sometimes an online shitfest points to something bigger. Last week, the AI-powered furry art site thisfursonadoesnotexist did just that, igniting a fandom firestorm while also highlighting an important debate about digital art. Trained on more than 55,000 images pulled (without permission) from a furry art forum, the algorithm was a simple case of art theft to some. For others, it was a chance to break out the popcorn. But legal scholars who spoke with Gizmodo said the conflict raises thorny questions about ownership in the age of AI—questions that may ultimately have to be answered in court.

Arfa, the programmer behind thisfursonadoesnotexist, says he used the same GAN (generative adversarial network) architecture behind the site thispersondoesnotexist to generate around 186,000 furry portraits. When he posted the project on Twitter last Wednesday, dozens of commenters rushed to weigh in. While many were fascinated by the project, some in the furry community objected to Arfa’s unauthorised use of art from the furry forum e621.net as training data. At least one person tried (and failed) to find proof that the algorithm was copying images from e621.net outright. And within days, the entire site was slapped with a DMCA copyright infringement complaint. (The company whose name the DMCA was issued in, according to Arfa, denied filing the notice and requested it be withdrawn.)
https://twitter.com/a/status/1258344026706599937
Some degree of backlash is understandable. Furry fandom has long been a close-knit community of independent creators supported by individual commissions. A project aimed at mass-producing fursonas—using original art as training material, no less—could be seen as a threat to creators’ livelihood. Some  commenters accused Arfa of disrespect and asked for the choice to opt out of the project. Others complained that their work had been uploaded to e621 without their permission in the first place.
The creator of thisfursonadoesnotexist thinks it would’ve been impossible to contact all the artists involved. Arfa told Gizmodo that he scraped 200,000 images that were then narrowed down to a 55,000-image training set representing approximately 10,000 different artists—creators who may go by different names now or have left the fandom entirely. According to Arfa, he’s more than willing to take an image down from thisfursonadoesnotexist if it clearly copies an original character, but he says he has yet to see credible evidence of that.
In defence of the AI’s originality, the site has produced a collection of mushier fursonas whose delirious weirdness inspired a flurry of memes. “Some of these have designs that are so… specific? Holistic?” a commenter on Hacker News wrote, linking to a fursona with a tail sticking out of her head and an adorably half-formed feline mouse. Do these Cronenberg-esque misfit furries, with their wild-eyed gazes, scream “LOVE ME”or “SAVE ME”? The art world adores liminality—that’s value added right there. 
Furry artists aren’t alone in facing the dilemma of digital manipulation. Just last month, Jay Z filed DMCA takedown notices against a YouTuber who used speech synthesis software to make his voice read the Book of Genesis and cover Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” While experts explained to Gizmodo that Jay Z’s issue isn’t copyright, since copyright doesn’t cover speech patterns, both incidents suggest a future where machine learning art is widespread, even commonplace. In such a future, can an artist’s original work be used as training material? If so, to what end? (In Jay Z’s case, YouTube ultimately allowed the videos to stand.)
The monkey and the camera
One significant hurdle an AI art lawsuit would need to clear is evidence of actual copyright infringement, not just use. To be actionable, an infringing work must be “substantially similar” to the source work—a determination that would be up to the courts to decide. But if an AI does infringe on a copyrighted work, who’s responsible? Art world attorney Nicholas O’Donnell compared the question to those raised when PETA tried to get a copyright on behalf of a monkey that took a viral selfie. A U.S. court dismissed that case, finding that works produced by animals can’t be copyrighted. “One of the things that [decision] spotlighted was the necessity that the author be a person,” O’Donnell said.  But is the AI the monkey or the camera?
It could be a bit of both—and neither. AI itself can’t be held liable for infringement, but unlike a monkey or a camera, you can train AI not to infringe. It’s ultimately up to the programmer to ensure that the training data is broad enough so that the program doesn’t predictably spit out a similar work. “If the program is being used as a tool, then the identity of the alleged infringer is someone who’s using those tools to potentially infringe on a protected work,” O’Donnell said. “And certainly, the narrower the scope of the program’s target, the more one could see that being argued. That if I take a program, and all I put in front of it is one protected work—and then I say, ‘the program [infringed], not me,’ that doesn’t really fly.” When asked whether the  AI-generated image below looks “substantially similar” to images found on e621, O’Donnell said, “I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s not jumping off the page.”
Nick Wilde
“The AI is learning, but it is also copying,” Jon Garon, who teaches intellectual property, cybersecurity, and technology law at Nova Southeastern University, told Gizmodo. To survive a legal challenge, an artistic AI would need to be trained in the same way that an art student learns not to copy a masterwork. If it duplicates a work in its database, then the developer could be held responsible. 
In the case of thisfursonadoesnotexist, Garon said that one possible plaintiff is Disney. Given the amount of fanart that can be found on e621, it’s unsurprising that some of the images on the site look suspiciously like copyrighted corporate characters: Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps from Disney’s Zootopia, even an unholy amalgam of the two; Rouge the Bat from Sonic the Hedgehog; Nala from The Lion King. Because intermediary copiers don’t matter, Garon explained, if someone steals his song and puts it on YouTube, and the song eventually makes it onto a pop star’s album, he could still sue the pop star.
“If [a program] is being shown a million images of Mickey Mouse, the AI will have the potential to create a work that is very different from any of the particular images,” Garon said. “But since all of the images are variations on the same copyrighted Mickey Mouse, it’s going to necessarily copy Mickey Mouse. And then Disney would have a case directly against the programmer of the AI.”
The monkey on a typewriter
The infringement issue flips if an AI randomly generates a nearly identical version of a work that wasn’t used to train its algorithm. If the AI had never seen a version of the work, it cannot infringe upon it.
“If their work was never copied at all, there’s no copyright claim,” Zahr Said, professor at the University of Washington School of Law, explained to Gizmodo. Said pointed to Judge Learned Hand’s famed 1936 statement in a copyright case against Metro-Goldwyn Pictures:

…if by some magic a man who had never known it were to compose anew Keats’s Ode on a Grecian Urn, he would be an “author,” and, if he copyrighted it, others might not copy that poem, though they might of course copy Keats’s.

Hand was referencing the idea of independent creation, when two authors happen to create the same work by chance. “It’s rarely found, but in a hypothetical in which the AI never had the work copied into the sample set, it couldn’t be infringing,” Said said.
But even if the AI did produce a substantially similar image to one in its sample set, Said continued, you’d have to take into account the commonality of elements (in copyright lingo, “scènes à faire”) that are essential to a genre and therefore not copyrightable—elements like large eyes and rounded snouts. “If you’re creating work in a boarding school wizard genre, there will be teachers with witch hats and flying brooms,” Said added. The case gets trickier when you name a student “Harry Potter.”
To what end?
AI is broad, and a copyright case would depend on whether it’s being used for scholarly purposes, in which case courts have tended to rule that AI needs, and can fairly use, training data. The case would be viewed differently if, say, you were selling an AI-generated painting for half a million dollars (which artists have).
Said said that every case depends on the alleged infringer’s purpose, and lawyers often advise defendants to make that clear from the outset. (For his part, Arfa told Gizmodo, “I’m just a guy trying to show people some cool tech.”) Said said that the fact that thisfursonadoesnotexist calls itself a “project,” and, through its URL, references a previous project which was created to show how AI works, a fair use finding is more likely. “If there were facts showing that this programmer was selling ads or downloads from the site that would allow people not to pay licensing fees that they were habitually paying to furry artists—that they’re supplanting demand—the worse it looks for the defendant.”
“You can do a lot of damage to a market even if you’re not charging money for your infringing copy,” he added.
It’ll take more than one AI-generated database to supplant the highly valued artists of the furry fandom, however. Commercial ventures have tried and failed to monetise furries in the past—and will keep trying. Others have taken thisfursonadoesnotexist on its face: a depersonalized bucket of elements, to be recycled as inspiration for improvement and play.

Fundamentally, these questions about authorship and originality aren’t new, stretching back thousands of years to the very beginning of Western art. Like a photocopier, modern technology has simply taken art’s oldest predicaments and made them bigger and blurrier. Unfortunately for us, a cigar-waving Orson Welles isn’t here to pace through the mist in a cape and pontificate on furry forgery. Instead, courts  will have to wade through these issues—giving the rest of us plenty to argue about in the meantime.

The soldier who is a split second quicker on the draw may walk away from a firefight unscathed; the ship that sinks an enemy vessel first may spare itself a volley of missiles. In cases where humans can't keep up with the pace of modern conflict, machines step in. When a rocket-propelled grenade is streaking toward an armored ground vehicle, an automated system onboard the vehicle identifies the threat, tracks it, and fires a countermeasure to intercept it, all before the crew inside is even aware. Similarly, US Navy ships equipped with the Aegis combat system can switch on Auto-Special mode, which automatically swats down incoming warheads according to carefully programmed rules.These kinds of defensive systems have been around for decades, and at least 30 countries now use them. In many ways, they're akin to the automatic braking systems in newer cars, intervening only under specific emergency conditions. But militaries, like automakers, have gradually been giving machines freer rein. In an exercise last year, the United States demonstrated how automation could be used throughout the so-called kill chain: A satellite spotted a mock enemy ship and directed a surveillance plane to fly closer to confirm the identification; the surveillance plane then passed its data to an airborne command-and-control plane, which selected a naval destroyer to carry out an attack. In this scenario, automation bought more time for officers at the end of the kill chain to make an informed decision—whether or not to fire on the enemy ship.Related StoriesArtificial intelligenceAI Is Fueling a New Global Arms RaceTom SimoniteEthics of WarA Tech Group Suggests Limits for the Pentagon’s Use of AITom Simonitetop algorithmThe Pentagon's AI Chief Prepares for BattleElias GrollMilitaries have a compelling reason to keep humans involved in lethal decisions.

5 Reasons Why Artificial Intelligence Really Is Going To Change Our WorldAdobe Stock

Chances are you’ve read a lot about AI in recent years – particularly how it’s going to save the world and/or end civilization as we know it. It’s certainly true that AI attracts a lot of hype and, shall we say, colorful predictions. But, unlike some technology trends, much of the hype surrounding AI is entirely justified. It truly is a transformative technology – one that will dramatically alter our lives in very real ways.

Not quite convinced? Here are five reasons why I believe AI is going to change the world in 2020 and beyond.

1. AI is everywhere

PROMOTED
Ever asked Alexa for the morning weather report, or passed through a public space that uses facial recognition technology, or paid for something using your credit card, or bought a product recommended to you by Amazon, or browsed potential love matches on a dating app? Of course, you have. Most of us have done one or all of these things, probably in the last week. Probably in the last 24 hours.
And, you guessed it, all of these everyday processes are underpinned by AI and data. AI allows your credit card company to determine – in the blink of an eye – that your latest transaction fits your spending pattern and isn’t fraudulent. Mastercard, for example, uses AI algorithms to assess the 75 billion transactions a year processed on its network. So, to put it bluntly, AI is already deeply embedded in your everyday life, and it’s not going anywhere.

2. AI isn’t just infiltrating everyday life, it’s going to transform entire industries
The impact of AI is already being felt in a wide range of industries, from banking and retail to farming and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI is being used to identify (and, in some cases, even predict) disease, helping healthcare providers and their patients make better treatment and lifestyle decisions.

AI systems can even outperform human experts when it comes to identifying disease; in January 2020, clinical trials of AI software developed by Google Health confirmed that the software was better at spotting signs of breast cancer in mammograms than radiologists. The system also flagged fewer “false positive” results than the experts.

3. AI will make us more human, not less
As machines become more intelligent, they can carry out more and more tasks – leading to rising automation across most industries. With this rise in automation comes valid concerns about the impact on human jobs. But, while there’s no doubt that automation will lead to the displacement of many jobs, I believe it will also create new jobs – jobs that value our uniquely human capabilities like creativity and empathy.
AI will also make our working lives better. Journalism is one industry that’s undergoing an AI revolution, and there are many AI tools that help journalists identify and write stories. At Forbes, for example, an AI-driven content management system called Bertie is used to identify real-time trending topics, suggest improvements to headlines, and identify relevant images. This reduces some of the behind-the-scenes legwork for human journalists, leaving them to focus on telling the story.
4. AI is becoming more affordable for the masses
It used to be that to work with AI you’d need expensive technology and a huge team of in-house data scientists. That’s no longer the case. Like many technology solutions, AI is now readily available on an as-a-service basis – with a rapidly growing range of off-the-peg service solutions aimed at businesses of all sizes.
As an example, in 2019, Amazon launched “Personalize,” an AI-based service that helps businesses provide tailored customer recommendations and search results. Incredibly, Amazon says no AI experience is needed to train and deploy the technology.
5. AI fuels other technology trends
Finally, as if we needed any more evidence that AI really is going to change the world, let’s end with this simple fact: AI is the foundation on which many other technology trends are built.
Essentially, this means that, without AI, we wouldn’t have achieved the amazing recent advances seen in areas like virtual reality, chatbots, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and robotics (and that’s just to name a few). Think of almost any recent transformative technology or scientific breakthrough, and, somewhere along the way, AI has played a role. For example, thanks to AI, researchers can now read and sequence genes quickly, and this knowledge can be used to determine which drug therapies will be more effective for individual patients.
AI is just one of 25 technology trends that I believe will transform our society. Read more about these key trends in my new book, Tech Trends in Practice: The 25 Technologies That Are Driving The 4th Industrial Revolution.

Artificial Intelligence: Turbocharging European industry

AI and advanced robotics are opening new horizons in all sectors of industry, in terms of both developing novel manufacturing techniques, as well as overhauling the interaction between human workers and automated tools. This CORDIS Results Pack presents the first innovative results of 13 ongoing (or recently finished) Horizon 2020 projects that are leading the way in embedding AI applications into industry.

‘Industry 5.0’ is a term that has been gathering pace over the past few years, with its broad definition being a major shift within industrial production towards a much closer and intertwining state of cooperation between humans and machines. It promises the creation of a new symbiotic environment between a workforce comprising both human operators and increasingly autonomous and intelligent mechanical colleagues. This transition is being heavily influenced by the phenomenal growth in advanced robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and consequently offers many golden opportunities for Europe.
Harnessing the benefits of AI
Manufacturing and industrial production have remained a constant backbone to Europe’s economic prosperity and growth for more than two centuries. And it’s here on the factory floor where some of the first major AI-based innovations are being pioneered and rolled out. 

The infusion of AI processes into manufacturing offers many positive benefits, such as the development of novel industrial processes for both existing as well as newly-emerging industries, enhancing production efficiencies and redefining the role of human workers as they take on new roles and responsibilities to collaborate with and supervise the (often repetitive) tasks of their AI-powered machine co-workers. Importantly, the use of AI/Augmented Reality techniques in factories promise to make human roles less hazardous, less monotonous and less physically exhausting.
Supporting the spread of AI in European manufacturing
However, there is still much work to be done to completely overhaul and adapt European industry to these new technologies and, by extension, these new opportunities. This is regardless of the fact that Europe is already one of the world’s major leaders in the development of AI. 

Therefore, the European Commission is dedicated to enhancing Europe’s leadership in the field of AI, viewing it as an area of strategic importance and a crucial source of future economic growth. The European Commission has been working hard with Member States to foster a genuinely collaborative AI strategy, embodied in the 2018 Communication ‘Artificial Intelligence for Europe’, which also emphasises the importance of AI in European manufacturing. The Commission has also massively increased its funding of AI research through the Horizon 2020 programme, with EUR 1.5 billion having been pledged for the period 2018-2020, and will keep funding AI research and applications through Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes.
13 pioneering projects
This CORDIS Results Pack showcases 13 projects that have been pioneering the way forward with AI technologies geared towards industry and manufacturing.

Some of the featured projects, such as COROMA  and  MONSOON look into the ways in which the use of AI tools and advanced manufacturing robots, equipped with sensors and capable of adapting to the manufacturing environment, can increase the productivity of production, whilst others including Factory2Fit, MANUWORK and THOMAS, look into the complementarity and interaction potential of human-robot and robot-machine collaboration.

Meanwhile, some projects, such as GO0D MAN and SERENA, also explore the potential of using AI-based tools for optimising the production process in terms of more efficient maintenance (e.g. predictive maintenance in connected industrial work sites) and zero-defect manufacturing. Finally, others, such as ResiBots have focused their work on customised production and even making robots capable of recovery.

People and robots




It wasn’t that long ago that robots and artificial intelligence (AI) were considered a major threat to our workforce. The press was awash with reports that they would take over our jobs and lead to widespread unemployment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously warned that AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don't know how to react, because it seems so ethereal,” he told attendees at the National Governors Association summer meeting in 2017.In just a few short years, opinions have changed considerably. Research conducted by Automation Anywhere in 2019 revealed that our global workforce is eager to adopt AI and automation. In fact, 72% of workers believe that AI and automation will help them do their jobs better, not replace them. This is opposed to just 8% of respondents who strongly feel the opposite.“AI’s greater potential lies in leveraging the technology to enhance collaboration with humans,” says James Wilson, managing director of information technology and business research at Accenture Research, and co-author of Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.  “This dynamic combines human talent and oversight with the nearly limitless capacity of intelligent machines to explore new possibilities.”LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProIn other words, humans and machines have divergent skill sets. “People perform better in complex, unpredictable environments, which is why we’re better at work that involves social interaction, creativity and navigating the physical world,” explains Jeff Grisenthwaite, vice president of product at automation software provider Catalytic.Machines, meanwhile, outperform people when faced with narrowly defined challenges that can be solved through precise repetition or rapid computation. “Robots are good at repetitive tasks – they don’t get bored – and they deliver speed and accuracy,” says Waseem Malik, executive managing director for claims at AXA Insurance.IT Pro Panel: Can AI help CIOs do their jobs better? Machine learning vs AI vs NLP: What are the differences? I thought I didn’t like robots, bot what would I know?Towards a new way of workThis collaborative approach has the potential for new, previously unimagined benefits. Rather than merely streamlining how businesses currently do work, it allows AI systems to serve as an agent for change across organisations, transforming what businesses do and how they do it. “Those companies that successfully facilitate this collaboration will be able to reimagine their organisations from the ground up,” says Wilson. “Human-AI collaboration has the potential to transform the way businesses are structured, the way they design products and even how they hire and train employees.”Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

In retail, for example, online grocery solutions provider Ocado Technology uses robots to process over 80,000 orders every week. A proprietary 4G network acts as ‘air traffic control’ for more than 1,500 bots as they move around the warehouse. “Bringing together the best of human and machine ability is a key component to our technical success, offering a combination that far exceeds the sum of its parts,” Dr Graham Deacon, robotics research fellow at Ocado Technology, tells IT Pro.Ocado Technology is experimenting with a number of systems which combine the best of human and machine intelligence. This includes an augmented reality system for warehouse engineers that overlays information with the physical world and helps them teleoperate complex robotic devices to fix systems in a different part of the world. “This has major benefits in terms of allowing new levels of collaboration,” says Deacon. “One single technician will be able to fix multiple systems not just remotely, but simultaneously, massively amplifying the impact of a single person.”In financial services, meanwhile, global insurance firm AXA uses various named robots to help out in different teams. Harry keeps customer records up to date for household claims. Lenny, Como and Bert do the same for liability claims, commercial motor and commercial property; they attach incoming and outgoing messages to customer files. In the commercial lines intermediary, Clive transfers data between complex systems and spreadsheets. Meanwhile at AXA PPP Healthcare, Poppy texts customers their authorisation code for treatment while they’re on the phone with their human personal advisor. Poppy also helps with customer referrals by taking on much of the copying and pasting involved.Malik believes that AXA’s success is a result of their understanding that there’s a time and a place for robot assistance. “In insurance, you also need the human touch,” he says. “Customers get in touch with us when they have a claim; they need to be reassured and understood. When you’re stranded abroad, or when your car needs to be fixed, you want a person to look after you, not a computer. However, you also want that person to be as efficient as possible – and that’s where machines make the difference.”Collaborative intelligence is facilitating more effective fraud prevention too. Australian firm TrafficGuard, for example, uses machine learning to complement the skills of its analysts and data scientists. “We are capitalising on human expertise by augmenting it with machines to create a solution that neither could achieve on its own,” says Luke Taylor, the firm’s founder and chief operating officer. “Collaborative intelligence is achieved by understanding the values of both machines and people. Using machine learning, we can validate advertising engagements in milliseconds and detection can be based on immense volumes of data.”RELATED RESOURCEThe IT Pro Podcast: Can AI ever be ethical?As AI grows in sophistication, how can we make sure it’s being developed responsibly?FREE DOWNLOADThe manufacturing industry is also benefiting from the combined power of humans and machines. “Agriculture is just one example,” says Nick Grove, founder of social economy platform Peazzy. “In the slow drive towards Industry 4.0, benefits will be made with seed to sale solutions impacting incubation, growing (watering and nutrients), harvesting, production, packaging and shipping direct to end customer. This is providing access to food for certain countries that was previously impossible to achieve.”And this is just the start. “When machines and humans collaborate together they can succeed in areas like medicine, by helping with patient diagnosis through image recognition; accounts payable, by processing thousands of invoices in a shorter amount of time and reducing potential errors on transcriptions; and legal, by reviewing thousands of contracts for specific clauses that may not comply with company policies,” adds Agustin Huerta, vice president of technology for the AI studio at digital transformation enabler Globant.Be aware of the pitfallsBut it’s not all plain sailing. Experts are quick to warn that human-machine collaboration will present a number of risks.Security makes the top of the list. “Connecting an increasing number of technologies opens up the possibility of a global distributed denial-of-service attack. If this were to happen at say the same time as the Coronavirus lockdown, then the world would be held to ransom within minutes. With the advancement of technology and machines comes huge responsibility,” says Grove.Employers also need to ensure they prepare their workforce appropriately. By bringing in machines, employees might have new responsibilities within an existing role, or an entirely new job function. Those in existing non-technical roles will need to upskill to take on those that require critical thinking and learn to harness AI-assisted technologies for increased efficiency and quality. Meanwhile, workers performing routine tasks will need to cross-skill and prepare for roles that depend on uniquely human traits. “As these changes are implemented, it is important that leaders work with their HR teams to ensure that workers feel empowered, rather than threatened, by future AI developments,” says Wilson.This is a challenge that AXA has already had to address. “At the beginning, some employees were worried that automation might destroy their jobs,” says Malik. “However, we’ve always said it is not about replacing people, but about freeing up their time so they can do what they’re good at and add real value. That can be about customer service, broker relations or anything that requires good old human intuition. The way we overcame initial worries was to engage with the teams and listen to their ideas.”Success here depends on fostering the right culture. “A good understanding of employees’ needs and how to create a culture that embraces this new way of collaboration is what makes these programmes successful,” says Huerta. “We have seen tides change when we have been allowed to create a proper culture that fosters this kind of collaboration and works on reducing uncertainty and fear of the unknown.”James Manderson, general manager for EMEA at customer engagement firm Braze likens this to when commercial flights first started. “A pilot’s job was very manual from take-off to landing. Today, the process of flying is mostly automated so that pilots can focus on making sure the flight is optimised and safe. The parallel with AI and machine learning is clear – innovation always pushes humans to adapt and improve. The benefits should be explained to employees in this way.”It’s not just employees who need to be educated, it’s the whole population – and this is where the media has a crucial role to play. While in the west we often see scare stories about automation, it’s very different in Asia. “The narrative in countries such as Japan is much more positive, and often highlights the benefits of the integration of robots,” says Héctor González-Jiménez, professor at ESCP Business School. “The media should offer a more balanced narrative, which would then help firms manage this shift.”Building a better futureBreakthroughs in areas like natural language interfaces and task understanding will also lead to a better acceptance of collaborative robots and will enable them to be used in a more natural way.“This is an important building block that will contribute to the emergence of true collaboration between humans and cobots,” says Ocado Technology’s Deacon.To this end, Ocado Technology is working as a project coordinator as part of the EU Horizon 2020 SecondHands Consortium to pioneer the development of a collaborative robot which can proactively offer useful support and assistance to humans in maintenance tasks. This ‘cobot’ is trained in task-understanding, to predict when and how it can usefully provide help. Safety and efficiency are clearly key drivers here. “Eventually these collaborative robots will be key for solving many societal challenges - both as assistive robots in industry, and out in the wider world such as robots for healthcare and assisted living in the home,” Deacon says.Advances in conversational AI - the capability to truly understand what someone has said and what that means – will also expedite advances in human-machine collaboration. “Conversational AI is only now becoming really achievable, and a key part of collaborative intelligence,” says Al Cook, vice president and general manager of artificial intelligence at cloud communications firm Twilio. “Chatbots are just the tip of the iceberg of what this technology can do. It’s a good starting point for most companies, but there’s a lot more to come.”Ultimately, Grisenthwaite believes that firms that fail to adopt these new technologies are risking their very survival. “Companies that do not fully embrace these technologies and push aggressively toward wide-scale adoption will inevitably lose to competitors,” he says. “The productivity gains of collaborative intelligence are exponential, rather than incremental, which puts early adopters at an insurmountable advantage.

AI-powered background checks could stand in the way.,,Tons of people are looking for work. AI-powered background checks could stand in the way.,,,,"TechnologyBeware of these futuristic background checksTons of people are looking for work. AI-powered background checks could stand in the way.by  Rebecca HeilweilMay 11, 2020, 7:00 AM EDTFacebookLink James Bareham for Vox/RecodeRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.FacebookLinkUnemployment in May reached its highest levels since the Great Depression, but companies like Postmates and Uber have continued to hire new workers during the pandemic. If you’re interested in this kind of gig, however, there’s a good chance you’ll need to pass an AI-powered background check from a company like Checkr. This might not be as easy as it sounds.Checkr is on the forefront of a new and potentially problematic kind of hiring, one that’s powered by still-emerging technology. Those hoping to quickly get extra work complain that Checkr and others using AI to do background checks aren’t addressing errors and mistakes on their criminal records reports. In these cases, a glitch in the system can cost someone a job.But this isn’t exactly a new problem. In recent years, Checkr has faced a slew of lawsuits for making mistakes that have cost people much-desired opportunities to work, according to legal records. One complaint from a man hoping to drive for Uber alleged that he was wrongly linked to a murder conviction that actually belonged to someone with a similar name. Another person hoping to work for the ride-share giant complained that he was erroneously reported to have committed several misdemeanors — including the possession of a controlled substance — crimes that belonged to another person with the same name.Checkr is one of many companies automating aspects of the hiring process and cutting down on costs. Some of these companies are using artificial intelligence to scan through resumes, analyze facial expressions during video job interviews, compare criminal records, and even judge applicants’ social media behavior. And in a pandemic, where the companies still hiring are likely already seeing a surge in applications and eager to find ways to streamline the recruiting process, technology that makes hiring quicker and easier sounds appealing.But experts have expressed skepticism about the role that AI can actually play in hiring. The technology doesn’t always work and can exacerbate bias and privacy problems. Inevitably, it also raises bigger questions of how powerful AI should become.AI can help companies study your criminal recordWhen you’re being considered for a job, background check companies typically use personal information, provided by you, to learn more about your criminal record and other information about your identity. That can involve collating all types of data, including but not limited to information from sex offender registries, global watch lists, state criminal records databases, and the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. Sometimes, a background check provider will need to consult a courthouse to search for more records, a process that might not be possible right now due to pandemic-required closures.In recent years, using artificial intelligence to speed up the process of analyzing these records has been pioneered by Checkr, though other startups, like UK-based Onfido and Israeli-based Intelligo, have worked or are working on similar systems. Meanwhile, more traditional background check companies are also making use of AI. GoodHire, for instance, has used machine learning to verify the identity of people completing an online background check.Checkr has become a favorite of gig economy firms, including Uber, Instacart, Shipt, Postmates, and Lyft. On its website, Checkr argues that AI can ultimately drive down the cost of bringing on a new hire by helping process background-checks in two ways. First, the technology helps verify that a given criminal record belongs to the person whose background is being checked. Second, the AI assists in comparing the names of criminal charges that have different names in different places. What might be reported as “petty theft” in one locale could be reported as “petit larceny” somewhere else.But as lawsuits against Checkr suggest, these services can make mistakes, even with the use of AI. Many of these complaints allege that the company matched people to criminal records belonging to others with the same or similar names.Related:Artificial intelligence will help determine if you get your next job“The threshold question is, did we even match the right person,” explains Aaron Rieke, the managing director of the digital rights group Upturn. “If you have a common name, that’s a non-trivial thing to do, and the last 20 years are rife with database matching problems just at that very basic level.”Other complaints against Checkr say out-of-context or outdated records also end up getting included in their reports.Checkr did not comment on the lawsuits specifically, but Kristen Faris, the company’s industry strategy vice president, told Recode that humans are involved in both the review and quality assurance process to ensure the accuracy of the reports.“In the traditional world, where you’re using offshore labor to apply this criteria, you have a much lower accuracy rate just because of the manual processes involved,” Faris said.AI can also screen your social media and anything else that’s public on the webMost background checks tend to focus on criminal records, but some services have started to include information about a person that’s available online, including their social media presence. Some managers already look up social media activity of prospective hires, but companies like Good Egg sell social media background checks, while others like Intelligo can use AI to screen these platforms.“I think when people use their real name in public fora online, the reality is that that information could be sucked into a background check process,” Rieke, the digital rights advocate, said.This is what happened to Kai Moore earlier this year, when their employer switched payroll systems and required employee background checks to be run again. Moore expected a review of what’s typically included in this process: information about their criminal records and confirmation of their identity. But what they didn’t expect was a 300-page report from Fama Technologies on their social media history, which included documentation of their tweets, retweets, and “Likes.”Even more worrisome was how their online activity was graded. A post Moore had “Liked” with the phrase “Big Dick Energy” was flagged for “sexism” and “bigotry.” Tweets they’d favorited about alcohol were flagged as “bad,” while one mentioning “hell” in discussing LGBTQ identity and religion was flagged for “language.”Moore’s employer assured them that their job was not at risk, but it also noted that Fama’s algorithms had ultimately deemed them a “consider,” rather than an outright “clear,” for the position in which Moore had already been working. And to Moore, this signified the absurdity and inaccuracy of artificial intelligence.“I think it’s really dangerous to give these kinds of algorithms so much authority,” Moore told Recode. “It’s such a terrible algorithm. It’s a keyword search.” Fama founder and CEO Ben Mones told Recode that the company claims to be able to identify problematic behavior, like sexism and bullying, as well as the risk that someone might commit insider trading or intellectual property theft. Fama primarily analyzed Twitter activity in Moore’s case, but the technology can also pick up information about applicants from news sites and other webpages. Since Moore’s report was performed, Fama has stopped labeling these posts as “good” or “bad.” Now, it simply flags content, leaving employers to make their own judgments.Fama isn’t the only company that’s attempted such a business model. Other companies are looking for ways to report what prospective applicants share online, a process that some background check companies say they can expedite with the help of AI. Faris, the Checkr VP, said her company has talked about offering social media screenings but has yet to see significant demand from its existing customer base.It’s also unclear if social media companies themselves will tolerate this use of their data. Predictim, a company that used AI to score potential babysitters based on their social media, attracted enough negative attention back in 2018 that it was ultimately blocked by Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Predictim’s website is no longer active.Fama, for one, has found a way around some social media companies’ policies. Twitter told Recode that it suspended Fama’s API access around the same time Moore’s story about their background check went viral. Twitter said that its API policies ban the use of the platform for “background checks or any form of extreme vetting,” as well as “surveillance.” Fama maintains that it still has some form of access to Twitter data for its services.The use of artificial intelligence doesn’t mean your rights are forfeitedBackground check companies are generally considered credit reporting agencies, and there are state and federal laws that regulate how these agencies operate. Chief among them is the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law passed in 1970 to protect consumers that’s regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Just last month, the agency shared best practices for working with artificial intelligence and algorithms.Currently, the Fair Credit Reporting Act law requires potential employers to inform and get a person’s permission before running a background check. If the employer thinks the results of the background check will factor into rejecting an applicant for a job, they have to let the applicant know and give them a chance to contest any information in the report. If that happens, the credit reporting agency enlisted by the employer has to reinvestigate its findings. There is no guarantee, however, that any corrections will be made in time for a person to remain in consideration for a particular position.Background check companies can make significant errors, and those errors can impact whether or not someone is ultimately offered a job. According to Ariel Nelson, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, these firms do have a legal obligation to have “reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information.” There’s still a pervasive problem of mistakes being included in background checks, Nelson explained, even when AI is not involved. So when you find yourself applying for a new job, consider that your application could be subject to an AI-powered background check, especially if you’re looking for work in the gig economy. You do have control over some aspects of this process. You can make your social media accounts private or delete your data from these platforms entirely. Basically, if you can see information about you online while you’re not logged into a platform, a future employer — or a hired AI — can probably see it, too.

Welcome to AI book reviews, a series of posts that explore the latest literature on artificial intelligence.
Advances in artificial intelligence in the early 2010s, particularly in deep learning, triggered a new wave of panic and fear about technological unemployment. Further intensifying those fears were a host of sensational articles about the magical capabilities of AI algorithms and ambiguous statements by company executives creating the impression that human-level AI is just around the corner.
But the past few years have only highlighted the limits of current AI technologies. At the turn of the decade, as the world locked down to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, we got to see whether the promises of artificial intelligence and robots replacing humans would materialize.
They didn’t.
But while AI isn’t ready to replace humans, there’s no denying that it will change the employment landscape, including areas that were previously considered to be off-limits for technology and automation. AI will not eliminate humans, but it will redefine the economy, creating many new jobs and making some of the old jobs obsolete or less dependent on human intelligence.
Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, a book by Northeastern University president Joseph E. Aoun, discusses how the universities and higher education institutions will have to adapt as “any predictable work—including many jobs considered ‘knowledge economy’ jobs” come within “the purview of machines.”
Aoun’s message: “to stay relevant in this new economic reality, higher education needs a dramatic realignment.” And in Robot-Proof, he provides a roadmap for developing a lifelong education system that will enable future generations to engage in not one but many professional careers throughout their lives.
What makes artificial intelligence different?

AI is not the first technology to change the way we work. The steam engine, electrical power, the telephones, railroad, automobile, airplane—these are some of the technological advances that brought fundamental change to human life and labor. In every case, human labor was replaced by a medium that could get the job done faster and more accurately.
In every instance, old jobs were destroyed as new ones were created. And while we humans are usually reluctant to embrace change, as history shows, we’ve always done what we’re good at: adapt. Within a generation or two, humans changed their habits and learned skills to harness the new technology and make their lives more efficient. The people of the mid-19th century couldn’t imagine a world lined with millions of miles of asphalt roads and fast-moving cars—we can’t imagine a world without them. In the 1960s, there was little trust for the first ATM machines. Today, there are millions of ATMs worldwide. Twenty years ago, there was no sign of Facebook and Twitter. Today, they’ve become fundamental pieces of the socioeconomic puzzle across the world.
But what makes artificial intelligence different is the pace of change it will bring. AI itself is not a product, but an infrastructural technology that will help accomplish a wide range of tasks. Stanford University professor and Coursera Founder Andrew Ng describes AI as the “new electricity.”
Robot-Proof, a book by Joseph E. Aoun
“It is clear that the current digital revolution is different from previous technological leaps because machines now seem to have no limit to their potential processing power—no limit to their intelligence,” Prof. Aoun observes in Robot-Proof. “In any predictable task, computers have humans at a cognitive disadvantage. And because software is cheap to copy, any digital advance can be instantly replicated throughout the world.”
“Any predictable task” is an overstatement. There are still plenty of tasks where current AI algorithms perform very poorly, especially when the real world deviates too much from their training examples. But Aoun is right in that there are many areas that deep learning algorithms perform than humans, especially when there’s enough annotated data to train deep neural networks that can perform precise classification and prediction tasks. And the domains that AI algorithms excel at continue to expand as scientists develop new methods and structures to overcome their shortcomings.
I would also contest computers having humans at a “cognitive disadvantage.” A more accurate term would be that computers have humans at a, well, “computational” disadvantage. Thanks to advances in computer hardware, AI algorithms can peruse through massive amounts of data and find relevant patterns in a fraction of the time it would take humans to do the same thing. As long as the answer lies in the data, whether through search or pattern matching, the right AI algorithm (naturally, created by a human) will outperform the human mind.
This brings us to an important conclusion: While AI will not probably not replace humans altogether anytime soon, it will complement humans and amplify their speed and accuracy in performing tasks.
In many fields, this means we’ll finally be able to meet the growing demand for human expertise. An example is cybersecurity, where there’s a huge skills gap as the industry needs more and more security experts to secure our increasingly digitized world. But in other fields where the supply already meets demand, it might reduce the need for human experts. For instance, a radiology expert equipped with the right deep learning tools might be able to double or triple the number of x-ray scans she sees every day.
The third point Prof. Aoun makes, “any digital advance can be instantly replicated throughout the world,” is also very important and lies at the heart of the AI disruption. Software-only solutions do not rely on expensive production chains. And with cloud computing and internet connectivity becoming ubiquitous, they will quickly become accessible to everyone. This is why changes brought by AI will be much faster than previous technological revolutions.
How to stay competent in the age of AI?

In Robot-Proof, Prof. Aoun argues that the changes brought by AI will require universities and learners to rethink their approach to education. For learners, a key goal will be to find ways to distinguish themselves from machines.
“The fact remains that machines will keep getting better at performing skilled work. Consequently, many people are recognizing that education needs to transform into a lifelong pursuit that enables them to upskill and retrain continuously as they try to stay a step ahead of the job-eating robots,” Aoun says.
Many of the jobs today’s learners will occupy in the next 20-30 years do not even exist today. This means universities must repurpose themselves to serve learners throughout their working lives. Prof. Aoun calls for a new education model that is different in delivery method, content, and context.
The key change is to shift toward education that strengthens creativity, the one area where humans will continue to excel. AI algorithms are very efficient at retrieving patterns and making predictions based on data. But when it comes to abstract thinking, common sense and transfer learning, humans still have the edge.
This is why humans only need a few hours to learn a new computer game while it takes a deep learning algorithm thousands of hours’ worth of playtime to reach novice level. Meanwhile, humans can quickly apply abstract concepts learned from one domain to another, while for AI, every new task is a fresh new challenge that must be learned from scratch.
“Creativity combined with mental flexibility has made us unique—and the most successful species on the planet,” Prof. Aoun writes in Robot-Proof. “They will continue to be how we distinguish ourselves as individual actors in the economy. Whatever the field or profession, the most important work that human beings perform will be its creative work.”
The robot-proof education model
How does the education system reinvent itself to nurture creativity?
“A robot-proof model of higher education is not concerned solely with topping up students’ minds with high-octane facts,” Prof. Aoun says. “Rather, it refits their mental engines, calibrating them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or otherwise produce something society deems valuable… Instead of training laborers, a robot-proof education trains creators.”
Higher education should adopt a model that puts more emphasis on “experiential learning,” Prof. Aoun stresses, which removes the boundaries between the classroom and real life.
“Typically, students engage in experiential learning through internships, co-ops, work-study jobs, global experiences, and original research opportunities,” Aoun says.
Experiential learning replaces the passive absorption of information with the integration of knowledge and real-world experience. This enables learner to practice “far transfer”
“Transfer occurs when skills or knowledge are learned in one context and the student successfully applies them to another,” Aoun says. Near transfer happens when the contexts are similar, such as poetry and drama. But when the contexts are largely disparate, such as poetry and public relations, the transfer is far. “The students are encountering an entirely novel situation but are able to step back and understand how, embedded in the context, they can use their knowledge to solve a problem,” Aoun says.
By applying their classroom learning to workplace tasks, students in co-ops repeatedly practice far transfer, cementing their cognitive capacities—critical and systems thinking, entrepreneurship, and cultural agility.
Efforts in AI transfer learning have so far been limited to very narrow tasks, such as tuning a trained image classifier on a new set of images. For humans, being to apply abstract concepts from one domain to another will be key to constantly learning new skills as AI transforms the world around us.
History shows that we’re very bad at predicting the future, and we don’t know know exactly how the future of AI will unfold. But what’s for sure is that the current and next generations of learners will have be very versatile and flexible in their acquiring new skills as algorithms become smarter and smarter.
“Our potential to master far transfer is our competitive advantage over intelligent machines,” Aoun writes in Robot-Proof.

The most perfect AI imaginable would be able to process the world around us through typical sensory input but leverage the storage and computing strengths of supercomputers. 
With that end goal in mind, it’s not hard to understand the ways that AI is evolving as it continues to be developed.  Deep learning AI is able to interpret patterns and derive conclusions. In essence, it’s learning how to mimic the way that humans process the world around us. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

That said, from the onset, AIs generally need typical computer input, like coded data. Developing AIs that can process the world through audio and visual input, sensory input, is a much harder task. 
In order to understand artificial intelligence in the context of a perception-based interface, we need to understand what the end goal is. We need to understand how the brain is modeled and works.
Our brain from a computer’s perspective
Our brains are essentially the world’s most powerful supercomputers, except for the fact that they’re made out of organic material, rather than silicon and other materials.
Our right brain is largely perception-based, it’s focused on the interpretation of environmental inputs like taste, feel, sound, sight, etc. Our left brain, on the other hand, is focused on rational thought. Our senses provide patterns to our right brain, and to our left brain, those senses provide the rationale for decision making. In a sense, we have two AIs in our head that work together to create a logical, yet also emotionally swayed machine.

Human intelligence and our definition of what an intelligent thing is all drawback to how we ourselves process the world. In order for artificial intelligence to truly succeed, that is to be the best version of itself that it can be, then it needs to be intelligent from a human perspective.
All this draws back to modern AI in a simple way, AI is programmed in how to make a decision. Machine learning algorithms allow code to be pseudo-organically generated so that algorithms can “learn” in a sense. All of this programming is based on reasoning, on “if, then, do this.”

Arguably, our brain’s decision-making process is just as much based on emotions and feeling as it is reason. Emotional intelligence is a significant portion of what makes intelligence. It’s the ability to read a situation, to understand other human’s emotions and reactions. In order for AIs to evolve and be the best possible algorithm, they need to be able to process sensory input and emotion.
Integrating emotional & human intelligence into modern AI
Most artificial intelligence systems are primarily created on the foundation of deep learning algorithms. This is the means of exposing a computer program to thousands of examples and AI learning how to solve problems through this process. Deep learning can be boiled down to teaching a computer how to be smart. 

After any given deep learning phase for an AI, the system can perceive the inputs that it was trained on and make decisions therein. The decision-making tree that the AI forms from traditional deep learning mimics the way the right side of our brain works. It is based on the perception of inputs, of pseudo-senses. 
RELATED: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROVES TO BE 10 PERCENT FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN HUMAN LAWYERS
Deep learning is a way of getting computers to reason, not just with if-then statements, but through the understanding of the situation. That said, the current situations AI are being trained on aren’t as complex as interpreting a conversation with Becky to see if she’s into you. Rather it’s more along the lines of is this a dark cat, a black bag, or the night sky. Primitive, but still sensory perception…
While deep learning is currently heavily focused on one pathway, meaning AIs are developing specialties, eventually it won’t be too far fetched to start training AIs on multiple things at once. Just like a toddler might learn colors and numbers at the same time. Expanding this out, as computer processing power grows, perhaps accelerated by practical quantum computing, there’s no question that AIs will evolve to become more human. 
Understanding what this all means
Advanced AI will continue to deal with understanding and processing patterns from the world around us. Through this, it will develop more complex models on how to process that information. In a sense, AIs are like toddlers, but soon they’re going to be teenagers, and eventually, they may graduate with a doctorate. All figuratively of course… though, an age where an AI graduates a university probably isn’t that far off. 
RELATED: ELON MUSK AND OPEN AI WANT TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WON’T SPELL DOOM FOR HUMANITY
When we think about intelligent humans, we usually think of the most rationally minded people. Yet, we miss out on what is so unique about human intelligence – creativity. In a sense, we take for granted our creativity, yet it is the thing that makes us the most intelligent of living beings. Our ability to process situations, not just understand what the sum of two numbers is, is what makes us uniquely intelligent. So uniquely intelligent that we can design and create artificially intelligent beings that will soon be able to match our human intelligence. 
While modern AIs are primarily focused on singular strands of intelligence, whether that be finding which picture contains a bicycle or which email is spam, we’re already training AIs to be all-around smart, humanly smart. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

IBM's Top 35 Women Leaders Shaping the Future of Artificial Intelligence





May 7, 2020













IBM, at its Think Digital conference, unveiled its list of Women Leaders in AI, recognizing 35 exceptional female business leaders from 12 countries who are using artificial intelligence to drive transformation, growth and innovation across a wide variety of industries.  According to IBM, these leaders were chosen because they and their companies are demonstrating the power of AI to help improve business and work for their customers and employees. From understanding and deriving insights from tens of millions of financial documents, to improving new employee onboarding experiences, to helping women have a better experience buying intimate apparel, these women leaders are shaping innovative AI use cases. Their AI efforts, says IBM, helped to increase customer satisfaction, improvements in employee retention, faster response times, significant cost savings, and more efficient processes.Many honorees are demonstrating how the power of Watson's Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to improve efficiency in business processes and drive greater customer and employee experiences, says IBM. They are leveraging AI tools to build AI and supplement the data science skills shortage and they are proving, through a variety of AI applications, that human and machine collaboration can truly help improve how people work, adds the company. ""Artificial intelligence will be at the center of business transformation over the next decade, and for us to mitigate bias moving forward, we need women and diverse teams at the forefront of AI. That's why we are proud to share the stories of 35 remarkable women who are driving progressive use of AI using Watson,"" said Michelle Peluso, IBM's Senior Vice President for Digital Sales and Chief Marketing Officer, who also serves as the global leader for IBM's Women's Initiative. ""Their accomplishments are an inspiration to all of us.""To shed more light on diversity in AI, IBM recently teamed up with Morning Consult to conduct a new global study of more than 3,200 AI professionals. Notable findings of that study include:
85 percent of AI professionals believe the industry has become more diverse over the past few years; of those, 91 percent think that shift is having a positive impact. 74 percent of AI professionals believing diversity hasn't improved say the industry must become more diverse to reach its potential.
While men and women working in AI were equally likely to be interested in math and hard sciences growing up, men working in AI were more likely to be told they had a natural talent for mathematics and hard sciences than women, while women were more likely to be told they had a natural talent for the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts.
Two in five AI professionals facing hurdles in implementing AI reported challenges in building AI tech or getting their organization to adopt AI.
Women in AI globally were nearly five times as likely as men to say their career advancement was negatively impacted by their gender.

Donna Dodson’s last day as chief cybersecurity adviser for the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Information Technology Laboratory will be Friday, the agency announced.
Dodson also will be leaving behind her job as director of the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST, a title she has held since 2012. She joined the agency in 1987 and held a range of technology leadership positions.
For her work in cybersecurity and IT she earned several awards, including a FedScoop 2018 top women in tech award. Her latest portfolio as top cybersecurity official was massive, ranging from work on artificial intelligence to “baking” security into the growing Internet of Things.
“The most critical part of my job is looking strategically at the changes we’re seeing across the digital infrastructure, the changes in the threat environment and the existing vulnerabilities,” she told FedScoop in 2017.

It’s unclear where Dodson’s next move will be.
In her work to enhance cybersecurity, Dodson worked to incorporate elements beyond technology and have the people and policy behind the technology be a part of the equation.
“Cybersecurity is really about people, policy, process and technology. And I think we need to look at all of those, not just the coolest new technology,” she said.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the enterprise’s notions about extracting insight from data. Indeed, the vast majority of technology executives (91 percent) and 84 percent of the general public believe that AI is the “next technology revolution,” according to Edelman’s 2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Survey. PwC has predicted that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.
Understanding the types of AI, how they work, and where they might add value is critical.
AI, in short, is a pretty big deal. However, it’s not a monolithic entity: There are multiple flavors of cognitive capabilities. Understanding the various types of AI, how they work, and where they might add value to the business is critical for both IT and line-of-business leaders.
[ What’s next? Read also: 10 AI trends to watch in 2020 and How big data and AI work together. ]
Five important kinds of AI
Let’s break down five types of AI and sample uses for them:
Machine learning (ML)
ML is perhaps the most relevant subset of AI to the average enterprise today. As explained in the Executive’s guide to real-world AI, our recent research report conducted by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, ML is a mature technology that has been around for years.
When facing a situation in which a solution is hidden in a large data set, machine learning is a go-to.
ML is a branch of AI that empowers computers to self-learn from data and apply that learning without human intervention. When facing a situation in which a solution is hidden in a large data set, machine learning is a go-to. “ML excels at processing that data, extracting patterns from it in a fraction of the time a human would take, and producing otherwise inaccessible insight,” says Ingo Mierswa, founder and president of the data science platform RapidMiner.
ML use cases
ML powers risk analysis, fraud detection, and portfolio management in financial services; GPS-based predictions in travel; and targeted marketing campaigns, to list a few examples.
ML learning can get better at completing tasks over time based on the labeled data it ingests, explains ISG director of cognitive automation and innovation Wayne Butterfield, or it can power the creation of predictive models to improve a plethora of business-critical tasks.
Deep learning
An explainer article by AI software company Pathmind offers a useful analogy: Think of a set of Russian dolls nested within each other. “Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that does something smart.”
This branch of AI tries to closely mimic the human mind.
In our plain English primer on deep learning, we offer this basic definition: the branch of AI that tries to closely mimic the human mind. With deep learning, CompTIA explains, “computers analyze problems at multiple layers in an attempt to simulate how the human brain analyzes problems. Visual images, natural language, or other inputs can be parsed into various components in order to extract meaning and build context, improving the probability of the computer arriving at the correct conclusion.”
Deep learning uses so-called neural networks, which “learn from processing the labeled data supplied during training, and uses this answer key to learn what characteristics of the input are needed to construct the correct output,” according to one explanation provided by deep AI. “Once a sufficient number of examples have been processed, the neural network can begin to process new, unseen inputs and successfully return accurate results.”
Deep learning use cases
Deep learning powers product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix. It works behind the scenes of Google’s voice- and image-recognition algorithms. Its capacity to analyze very large amounts of high-dimensional data makes deep learning ideally suited for supercharging preventive maintenance systems, as McKinsey pointed out in its Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning: “Layering in additional data, such as audio and image data, from other sensors – including relatively cheap ones such as microphones and cameras – neural networks can enhance and possibly replace more traditional methods. AI’s ability to predict failures and allow planned interventions can be used to reduce downtime and operating costs while improving production yield.”

Natural language processing (NLP)
NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.
When you take AI and focus it on human linguistics, you get NLP. SAS offers one of the clearest and most basic explanations of the term: “Natural language processing makes it possible for humans to talk to machines.” It’s the branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.
NLP itself has a number of subsets, including natural language understanding (NLU), which refers to machine reading comprehension, and natural language generation (NLG), which can transform data into human words.
But, says ISG’s Butterfield, the premise is the same: “Understand language and sew something on the back of that understanding.”
NLP has roots in linguistics, where it emerged to enable computers to literally process natural language, explains Anil Vijayan, vice president at Everest Group. “Over the course of time, it evolved from rule-based to machine-learning infused approaches, thus overlapping with AI,” Vijayan says.
NLP might employ both ML learning and deep learning methodologies in combination with computational linguistics in order to effectively ingest and process unstructured speech and text datasets, says JP Baritugo, director at business transformation and outsourcing consultancy Pace Harmon.
NLP use cases
Natural language processing makes it possible for computers to extract key words and phrases, understand the intent of language, translate that to another language, or generate a response. “The enterprise literally runs through communication, either the written word or spoken conversation,” says Butterfield. “The ability to analyze this information and either find intent or insight will be absolutely critical to the enterprise of the future.”
Any area of the business where natural language is involved may be fodder for the deployment of NLP capabilities, says Vijayan. Think chatbots, social media feeds, emails, or complex documentation like contracts or claims forms.
Now let’s move on to the last two key types of AI: Computer vision and Explainable AI:

Caroline Sinders 05 May 2020Sharon Hogge, an electronics engineer, poses with autonomous sentry robot ROBART I and the HT3 Industrial Robot. Maryland, 1983 | The U.S. National Archives | Public DomainTechnology surrounds us and is everywhere, but how this technology is made and who really benefits from it and who does not, are still important questions to be investigated. Recently, movements have emerged such as Data Feminism and Design Justice, which analyse technology from a more critical angle with the intention of creating more equity in technological practice. We explore some of their implications based on the artistic project Feminist Data Set, hand in hand with its creator, who explores what an intersectional feminist machine learning labelling and training system would be like and what would be necessary to construct it.In a time of the re-rising of fascism, of what feels like a lessening of social justice values, and in an age of global digitization, social justice has never been more integral in the space of interrogating data, technology, and the structure of society itself. Technology surrounds us, everywhere, but how technology is made, and who benefits deeply from technology, and who does not, is still an important question to unpack, research and critique. Feminist Data Set is an art project that uses intersectional feminism as a critical framework for investigating and critiquing machine learning. The investigation happens through a critical design lens, since the project involves making a chatbot from start to finish using intersectional feminism as a guide. This includes asking what is intersectional feminist data collection; what is intersectional feminist data; what is intersectional feminist data labeling, and data training; does an intersectional feminist system or product exist to data label and data train; what does intersectional feminist software look like; what does it do, and are there intersectional feminist algorithms; what would these algorithms then need to exist; what does an intersectional chatbot look like, and how does it interact?Politically and artistically, Feminist Data Set is inspired by the work of the maker movement, critical design, Arte Útil, Data Feminism, Design Justice, the Critical Engineering Manifesto, Xenofeminism, and the Feminist Principles of the Internet. Pedagogically, Feminist Data Set operates in a similar vein to Thomas Thwaites’s Toaster Project, a critical design project in which Thwaites builds a commercial toaster from scratch. Feminist Data Set, however, takes a critical and artistic view on software, particularly machine learning. What does it mean to thoughtfully make machine learning, to carefully consider every angle of making, iterating, and designing? Every step of this process needs to be thoroughly re-examined through a feminist lens.There is a growing movement of analyzing technology through a more critical and ethical lens (however, the word ethical itself is becoming controversial and overused). But this critical lens is important, especially as it exists to create more equity within technology as a practice and as its own entity—entity, in the sense that technology is a specific kind of thing, be it software or hardware, and a practice would be how an individual or group uses technology as an addition to its own creativity and making. Current books like Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein generate a practice that unpacks data and datasets in society, and creates methodologies for having better data practices through a feminist lens. Design Justice by Sasha Costanza-Chock directly situates social justice within the design world, within design making and product design, and in design thinking as an exercise and practice.Feminist Data Set | Caroline SindersBoth Data Feminism and Design Justice analyze how capitalist and corporate structures use design and data, and how civic technologists, social justice movements, and activists engage with data and design. By situating design and data in both the corporate and non-corporate worlds, Data Feminism and Design Justice create an expansive, more holistic view of how data and design are utilized, from a more problematic end (the corporate side) and a more equity-driven end (the social justice and activist side). But both of these ends of the spectrums, and the spaces in-between, must be explored, and this is what makes Data Feminism and Design Justice strong as books, as methodologies, and as use cases. Feminist Data Set takes a similar stance. By interrogating machine learning, not just an artistic practice, but one rooted in product design and the corporate world, Feminist Data Set looks at how technology misuses machine learning as a whole field, and then in individual pieces within the machine learning pipeline.Often the tools I need to make Feminist Data Set as a critical design and art project don’t exist. For example, what is a feminist data training platform? Is there one? In machine learning, when it comes to labeling data and creating a data model for an algorithm, groups will generally use Amazon’s labor force, Mechanical Turk, to label data. Amazon created Mechanical Turk to solve their own machine learning problem of scale: they needed large data sets trained and labeled. Using Mechanical Turk in machine learning projects is standard in the field; it is used everywhere, from technology companies to research groups to help label data. Mechanical Turk underpays their workers and treats them as gig economy employees rather than full-time employees, thus giving them fewer benefits, and is not intersectional feminist, so I cannot use it in my work. I either have to find an alternative or build one. For the past year, I’ve been exploring what an intersectional feminist machine-learning labeling and training system is, and what it would need. I’ve been creating a tool, much like a calculator, that translates the number of tasks a Turker does, and the costs of those tasks, into an hourly wage. Say, for example, a client prices ten thousand tasks at four cents each: the calculator would translate that into hours or days of work it would take a Turker to complete all of those tasks, and how much their wages would be.In this sense, Feminist Data Set blends art and social justice-driven research and technology, like Turkopticon, made by Professor Lilly Irani and Mechanical Turkers. Turkopticon allows Mechanical Turkers to rate jobs and clients. This add-on solves a real problem that workers face, often not knowing the quality of a client and having no way to share this information with other Turkers.Sorting Feminist Data collected at SOHO20, 2018 | SOHO20 Gallery / Rachel SteinbergTo create a feminist AI, the labor and payment inequity in machine learning data training platforms needs to be confronted. In an article written by The Atlantic that investigates the treatment of Mechanical Turkers, the problem “is not necessarily that requesters are underpaying for the work. The average requester pays around eleven dollars an hour for the work they get, according to Hara. But there are also many requesters who pay less than that, and there are many requesters who post tasks that take longer than they say to complete. Still, the root of the problem is that these platforms allow requesters to avoid paying workers for the downtime that would arise if workers did these tasks full-time”. A research paper co-authored by researcher and Mechanical Turker Kristy Milland found that a median wage was about two dollars an hour but only four percent of Turkers earned more than $7.25 per hour.What is a feminist version of Mechanical Turk? What would it need?Pay equality and pay equity is a step towards equity in technology and society. Workers need to be paid for their time, not just for time doing a task, but time working—finding work and setting up work tasks—and they should be paid well for their labor. Gig economy companies should be held to labor standards and labor laws.Making must be thoughtful and critical in order to create equity. It must be open to feedback and interpretation. We must understand the role of data creation and how systems can use, misuse, and benefit from data. Data must be seen as something created from communities and as a reflection of that community—data ownership is key. Data’s position inside technology systems is political, it’s activated, and it’s intimate. For there to be equity in machine learning, every aspect of the system needs to be examined, taken apart and put back together. It needs to integrate the realities, contexts, and constraints of all different kinds of people, not just the ones who built the early Web. Technology needs to reflect those who are on the web now.Share ➔       Facebook         Twitter         Linkedin         WhatsApp          Email  ",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/#website', 'url': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/', 'name': 'CCCB LAB', 'description': 'Cultural Research and Innovation', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://lab.cccb.org/wp-content/uploads/femdata_lab.jpg', 'width': 1100, 'height': 782}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/#webpage', 'url': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/', 'name': 'Rethinking Artificial Intelligence through Feminism | CCCB LAB', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/#primaryimage'}, 'datePublished': '2020-05-05T07:30:10+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-05-06T07:53:49+00:00', 'author': {'@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/#/schema/person/70fc646db193a742dde0dae3523a32b0'}, 'description': 'From a feminist perspective, we offer a critical analysis of the machine learning of artificial intelligences to find more equitable practices.', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/']}]}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/', 'url': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/', 'url': 'https://lab.cccb.org/en/rethinking-artificial-intelligence-through-feminism/', 'name': 'Rethinking Artificial Intelligence through Feminism'}}]}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://lab.cccb.org/es/#/schema/person/70fc646db193a742dde0dae3523a32b0', 'name': 'Caroline Sinders', 'sameAs': ['https://carolinesinders.com', 'https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/carolinesinders']}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Artificial intelligence will transform job tasks and occupations. This column uses data from US online job postings during 2010–2019 to show how absolute and relative demand for AI-related skills has grown across all industry sectors and occupation groups. Jobs requiring AI skills command, on average, an 11% wage premium compared to similar jobs that do not require AI knowledge. However, AI is at least as much a managerial challenge as it is a technological challenge. Real productivity gains will come only when there are managers who can use AI to create and capture value.

Last year, the fastest-growing job title in the world was that of the machine learning (ML) engineer, and this looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. According to Indeed, the average base salary of an ML engineer in the US is $146,085, and the number of machine learning engineer openings grew by 344% between 2015 and 2018. Machine learning engineers dominate the job postings around artificial intelligence (A.I.), with 94% of job advertisements that contain AI or ML terminology targeting machine learning engineers specifically.  
This demonstrates that organizations understand how profound an effect machine learning promises to have on businesses and society. AI and ML are predicted to drive a “Fourth Industrial Revolution” that will see vast improvements in global productivity and open up new avenues for innovation; by 2030, it’s predicted that the global economy will be $15.7 trillion richer solely because of developments from these technologies.  
The scale of demand for machine learning engineers is also unsurprising given how complex the role is. The goal of machine learning engineers is to deploy and manage machine learning models that process and learn from the patterns and structures in vast quantities of data, into applications running in production, to unlock real business value while ensuring compliance with corporate governance standards.  
To do this, machine learning engineers have to sit at the intersection of three complex disciplines. The first discipline is data science, which is where the theoretical models that inform machine learning are created; the second discipline is DevOps, which focuses on the infrastructure and processes for scaling the operationalization of applications; and the third is software engineering, which is needed to make scalable and reliable code to run machine learning programs.   
It’s the fact that machine learning engineers have to be at ease in the language of data science, software engineering, and DevOps that makes them so scarce—and their value to organizations so great. A machine learning engineer has to have a deep skill-set; they must know multiple programming languages, have a very strong grasp of mathematics, and be able to understand and apply theoretical topics in computer science and statistics. They have to be comfortable with taking state-of-the-art models, which may only work in a specialized environment, and converting them into robust and scalable systems that are fit for a business environment.   
As a burgeoning occupation, the role of a machine learning engineer is constantly evolving. The tools and capabilities that these engineers have in 2020 are radically different from those they had available in 2015, and this is set to continue evolve as the specialism matures. One of the best ways to understand what the role of a machine learning engineer means to an organization is to look at the challenges they face in practice, and how they evolve over time.   
Four major challenges that every machine learning engineer has to deal with are data provenance, good data, reproducibility, and model monitoring.  
Challenge 1: Data Provenance  
Across a model’s development and deployment lifecycle, there’s interaction between a variety of systems and teams. This results in a highly complex chain of data from a variety of sources. At the same time, there is a greater demand than ever for data to be audited, and there to be a clear lineage of its organizational uses. This is increasingly a priority for regulators, with financial regulators now demanding that all machine learning data be stored for seven years for auditing purposes.  
This does not only make the data and metadata used in models more complex, but it also makes the interactions between the constituent pieces of data far more complex. This means machine learning engineers need to put the right infrastructure in place to ensure the right data and metadata is accessible, all while making sure it is properly organized.

Challenge 2: Good Data   
In 2016, it was estimated that the US alone lost $3.1 trillion to “bad data”—data that’s improperly formatted, duplicated, or incomplete. People and businesses across all sectors lose time and money because of this, but in a job that requires building and running accurate models reliant on input data, these issues can seriously jeopardize projects.   
IBM estimates that around 80 percent of a data scientist’s time is spent finding, cleaning up, and organizing the data they put into their models. Over time, however, increasingly sophisticated error and anomaly detection programs will likely be used to comb through datasets and screen out information that is incomplete or inaccurate.   
This means that, as time goes on and machine learning capabilities continue to develop, we’ll see machine learning engineers have more tools in their belt to clean up the information their programs use, and thus be able to focus more time spent on putting together ML programs themselves.  
Challenge 3: Reproducibility  
Reproducibility is often defined as the ability to be able to keep a snapshot of the state of a specific machine learning model, and being able to reproduce the same experiment with the exact same results regardless of the time and location. This involves a great level of complexity, given that machine learning requires reproducibility of three components: 1) code, 2) artifacts, and 3) data. If one of these change, then the result will change.   
To add to this complexity, it’s also necessary to keep reproducibility of entire pipelines that may consist of two or more of these atomic steps, which introduces an exponential level of complexity. For machine learning, reproducibility is important because it lets engineers and data scientists know that the results of a model can be relied upon when they are deployed live, as they will be the same if they are run today as if they were run in two years.  
Designing infrastructure for machine learning that is reproducible is a huge challenge. It will continue to be a thorn in the side of machine learning engineers for many years to come. One thing that may make this easier in coming years is the rise of universally accepted frameworks for machine learning test environments, which will provide a consistent barometer for engineers to measure their efforts against.  
Challenge 4: Monitoring  
It’s easy to forget that the lifecycle of a machine learning model only begins when it’s deployed to production. Consequently, a machine learning engineer not only needs to do the work of coding, testing, and deploying a model, but they’ll have to also develop the right tools to monitor it.   
The production environment of a model can often throw up scenarios the machine learning engineer didn’t anticipate when they were creating it. Without monitoring and intervention after deployment, it’s likely that a model can end up being rendered dysfunctional or produce skewed results by unexpected data. Without accurate monitoring, results can often slowly ‘drift’ away from what is expected due to input data becoming misaligned with the data a model was “trained” with, producing less and less effective or logical results.   
Adversarial attacks on models, often far more sophisticated than tweets and a chatbot, are of increasing concern, and it is clear that monitoring by machine learning engineers is needed to stop a model being rendered counterproductive by unexpected data. As more machine learning models are deployed, and as more economic output becomes dependent upon these models, this challenge is only going to grow in prominence for machine learning engineers going forward.  
Machine Learning Engineer: An Evolving Role  
One of the most exciting things about the role of the machine learning engineer is that it’s a job that’s still being defined, and still faces so many open problems. That means machine learning engineers get the thrill of working in a constantly changing field that deals with cutting-edge problems.   
Challenges such as data quality may be problems we can make major progress towards in the coming years. Other challenges, such monitoring, look set to become more pressing in the more immediate future. Given the constant flux of machine learning engineering as an occupation, it’s of little wonder that curiosity and an innovative mindset are essential qualities for this relatively new profession.

For decades,  artificial intelligence (AI) lived in data centers, where there was sufficient compute power to perform processor-demanding cognitive tasks. In time, AI made its way into software, where predictive algorithms changed the nature of how these systems support the business. Now AI has moved to the outer edges of networks.
“Edge AI happens when AI techniques are embedded in Internet of Things ( IoT) endpoints, gateways, and other devices at the point of use,” explains Jason Mann, vice president of IoT at SAS. 
“Put another way, edge computing brings the data and the compute closest to the point of interaction,” says Red Hat chief technology strategist E.G. Nadhan. Edge AI is a very real (and rapidly expanding) phenomenon, powering everything from smartphones and smart speakers to automotive sensors and security cameras.
AI is “the most common workload” in edge computing.
In fact, says Dave McCarthy, research director within IDC’s worldwide infrastructure practice focusing on edge strategies, AI is “the most common workload” in edge computing. “As IoT implementations have matured,” he adds, “there has been an increased interest in applying AI at the point of generation for real-time event detection.” 
Deloitte predicts that more than 750 million edge AI chips (specifically designed to perform or accelerate on-device machine learning) will be sold this year, with the enterprise market growing faster than its consumer counterpart at a compound annual growth rate of 50 percent over the next four years.
Enterprises will spend an average of 30 percent of their IT budgets on edge cloud computing over the next three years, according to “Strategies for Success at the Edge, 2019,” a report by Analysys Mason.
[ Why does edge computing matter to IT leaders – and what’s next? Learn more about Red Hat’s point of view. ]
As IT leaders consider where edge AI might fit into their own enterprise technology roadmap, here are some things we know now:
1. It's important to begin at the beginning
If you haven’t already implemented an edge solution, you can’t leapfrog to edge AI. “The first step for most IT leaders today is in constructing a solution architecture that leverages edge computing in conjunction with a cloud backend,” says Seth Robinson, senior director of technology analysis, at CompTIA. “Moving forward, integrating AI will be a critical step in managing the scale of edge solutions and building competitive advantage.”
2. Edge AI can address limitations of cloud-based AI
Every time you ask Siri or Alexa or Google a question, for example, your voice recording is sent to an edge network.
Latency, security, cost, bandwidth, and privacy are some of the issues associated with machine- or deep-learning tasks that edge AI – closer to data sources – can mitigate. Every time you ask Siri or Alexa or Google a question, for example, your voice recording is sent to an edge network where Google, Apple, or Amazon uses AI to translate voice to text to enable a command processor to generate an answer.
Without the edge, waiting seconds for a response would be commonplace. “The edge network allows for a pleasant user experience within the Doherty Threshold (less than 400 milliseconds),” says Stephen Blum, CTO and co-founder at PubNub. “Google, Apple, and Amazon have spent millions investing in their edge so that their AI can answer you quickly. To compete with the giants, the business needs to invest in edge AI.”
[ Get a shareable primer: How to explain edge computing in plain English.] 
3. Only a portion of AI workflow happens at edge today
The AI models themselves are usually trained in a central data center or cloud infrastructure using historical data sets.
“AI edge processing today is focused on moving the inference part of the AI workflow to the device,” Omdia analysts explain in their Artificial Intelligence for Edge Devices report. The AI models themselves are usually trained in a central data center or cloud infrastructure using historical data sets, IDC’s McCarthy explains. Then those AI models can be deployed to the edge for local inferencing against current data.
“Essentially, companies can train in one environment and execute in another,” says Mann of SAS. “The vast volumes of data and compute power required to train machine learning is a perfect fit for cloud, while inference or running the trained models on new data is a perfect fit for execution at the edge.” Model compression techniques that “enable squeezing large AI models into small hardware form factors” could push some training to the edge over time, notes Omdia.

4. Real-time learning at the edge will take time
“Real-time learning allows the AI to continuously evolve and improve during each interaction. For the AI to learn in real time, the matrix (AI brain) must allow training while also answering to your requests. Additionally, data learned must be synchronized with peering edges,” says Blum of PubNub. “This logistical challenge has led most networks to exclude real-time learning.”
When those challenges are overcome, however, that will open up the door to even more advanced Edge AI applications, Blum says.
Let’s look at three more important factors:

The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented crisis in journalism that could decimate media organizations around the world.
The future of journalism — and its survival — could lie in artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers “to intelligent machines that learn from experience and perform tasks like humans,” according to Francesco Marconi, a professor of journalism at Columbia University in New York, who has just published a book on the subject: Newsmakers, Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Journalism.
Marconi was head of the media lab at the Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press, one of the largest news organizations in the world. His thesis is clear and incontrovertible: the journalism world is not keeping pace with the evolution of new technologies. So, newsrooms need to take advantage of what AI can offer and come up with new a business model.

For Marconi, journalists and media owners are missing out and AI needs to be at the heart of journalism’s business model in the future. As a professor of journalism at the Université du Québec à Montréal, I have been closely following the evolution of this profession since 1990, and I am mostly in agreement with him. 
In Canada, The Canadian Press news agency is, for example, one of the rare media outlets to use AI in its newsrooms. It has  developed a system to speed up translations based on AI. The _Agence France-Presse_ news agency (AFP) also uses AI to detect doctored photos.
AI does not replace journalists
Artificial intelligence is not there to replace journalists or eliminate jobs. Marconi believes that only eight to 12 per cent of reporters’ current tasks will be taken over by machines, which will in fact reorient editors and journalists towards value-added content: long-form journalism, feature interviews, analysis, data-driven journalism and investigative journalism.
At the moment, AI robots perform basic tasks like writing two to six paragraphs on sports scores and quarterly earnings reports at the Associated Press, election results in Switzerland and Olympic results at the Washington Post. The outcomes are convincing, but they also show the limits of AI.
AI robots analyzing large databases can send journalists at Bloomberg News an alert as soon as a trend or anomaly emerges from big data.
AI can also save reporters a lot of time by transcribing audio and video interviews. AFP has a tool for that. The same is true for major reports on pollution or violence, which rely on vast databases. The machines can analyze complex data in no time at all.
Afterwards, the journalist does his or her essential work of fact-checking, analyzing, contextualizing and gathering information. AI can hardly replace this. In this sense, humans must remain central to the entire journalistic process.
A broken business model
Marconi is quite right when he explains that the media must develop a paid subscription model, get closer to their communities with even more relevant content, develop new products (newsletters, events, podcasts, videos) and new content. AI can facilitate some of this by generating personalized news: recommendations for readers, for example.
In this sense, AI is part of a new business model based on breaking down media silos. There needs to be a symbiosis in the sense of establishing a “close collaboration” between the editorial staff and other media teams such as engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, sales or marketing staff.
In a newsroom, more than ever before, databases must be used to find stories that are relevant to readers, listeners, viewers and internet users.
And there are already various AI tools available to detect trends or hot topics on the internet and social media. These tools can also help newsrooms distribute content.
Beware of bias
Of course, newsroom size must be taken into account. A small weekly or a hyper-local media organization may not have the means to act quickly in adopting AI. But for the others, it’s important to start taking action right away. Journalists need to be better trained and begin to work with start-ups and universities to get the best out of this. AI is not a fad. It is here to stay.



Journalism is not keeping up with new technologies, writes Francesco Marconi in Newsmakers, Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Journalism.


Take the current example of COVID-19. This is an opportunity to analyze public health data to make connections, analyze and dig into the data neighbourhood by neighbourhood and street by street. AI can help with that. But it takes well-trained data reporters to do this work.
One of the dangers of AI, on the other hand, is algorithm bias. Because algorithms are designed by humans, there will always be biases that can alter data analysis and lead to serious consequences. And human verification of content before publication will always remain a safeguard against errors.
AI has also helped developing systems for detecting fake videos (deepfakes) and fake news, which are of course supported by experienced journalists from Reuters and AFP, for example.  
In this sense, the transformation of newsrooms is only just beginning and Marconi’s essay is a must-read for identifying survival scenarios for media organizations and journalists. Because that’s what it’s all about. We need to better equip our newsrooms and completely rethink the workflow to achieve better collaboration and better content that will attract new and paying subscribers.

Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Search for COVID-19 Treatments


Researchers are using an artificial intelligence-powered tool to prioritize the most promising studies on COVID-19.

A team from Northwestern University has developed an artificial intelligence platform that can quickly identify research that has the most potential to produce COVID-19 treatments and solutions.

As the pandemic continues, scientists are conducting massive amounts of research related to coronavirus. With federal agencies like the FDA and HHS planning to accelerate clinical trials, hundreds of researchers are testing possible new treatments and vaccines, adding to the already-immense body of COVID-19 data.
To determine which research has the most potential to yield real solutions, the scientific community has historically used the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (DARPA SCORE) program. The program relies on scientific experts to review and rate submitted research studies based on how likely they are to be replicable.
On average, this process can take about 314 days, which is a long time to wait during a global pandemic.
With the AI-powered tool, researchers can prioritize resources for the most promising studies, and ignore studies that are unlikely to yield valuable solutions. The model is just as accurate as the human scoring system at making these predictions, and it can scale up to review a larger number of papers in minutes instead of months.
“The standard process is too expensive, both financially and in terms of opportunity costs,” said Brian Uzzi, Richard L. Thomas Professor of Leadership at Kellogg and co-director of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems.
“First, it takes take too long to move on to the second phase of testing and second, when experts are spending their time reviewing other people’s work, it means they are not in the lab conducting their own research.”
The artificial intelligence tool bypasses the human-scoring method, allowing the research community and policymakers to make faster decisions about prioritizing time and funds on studies that are likely to succeed.
To build the platform, the Northwestern team developed an algorithm that would predict which studies’ results are likely to be replicable – a critical sign that a study’s results are valid. The model’s prediction of the likelihood of replicability may be more accurate than the traditional human-scoring prediction.
Because it considers more of the narrative of the study – and expert reviewers tend to focus on the strength of relational statistics – the model may have a better idea of which studies could generate viable solutions.
“There is a lot of valuable information in how study authors explain their results,” Uzzi said. “The words they use reveal their own confidence in their findings, but it is hard for the average human to detect that.”
The algorithm analyzes the words of thousands of papers, recognizing word-choice patterns that humans might not recognize. Additionally, the tool has a much bigger schema to draw upon for its predictions, making it an ideal supplement to human expertise. Researchers can use the model to analyze COVID-19 -related research papers and quickly determine which show the most promise.
“This tool is particularly useful in this crisis situation where we can’t act fast enough,” Uzzi said. “It can give us an accurate estimate of what’s going to work and not work very quickly. We’re behind the ball, and this can help us catch up.”
Used alone, the tool has an accuracy comparable to the DARPA SCORE method. Together, human experts and the algorithm predict which findings will be replicable with even greater accuracy than either method on its own.
“This tool will help us conduct the business of science with greater accuracy and efficiency,” Uzzi said. “Now more than ever, it’s essential for the research community to operate lean, focusing only on those studies which hold real promise.”
With this AI-powered tool, researchers can come closer to finding a potential treatment for COVID-19.
“In the midst of a public health crisis, it is essential that we focus our efforts on the most promising research,” said Uzzi. “This is important not only to save lives, but also to quickly tamp down the misinformation that results from poorly conducted research.”

To accomplish certain goals, AI will be incredibly beneficial to make sure that the goals set for them are kept in check. Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have feared the potential that AI has been directly linked to the demise of humanity. Everyone knows that it is possible that if Artificial Intelligence is given access to its fullest power, the super Artificial Intelligence will overtake human intelligence and eventually control the planet. There are still a huge number of experts who think this is just fear mongering, by suggesting people not to worry more about this type of problem. Instead, people should be worrying about existing problems such as climate change, nuclear weapons, and neo-fascist political movements. However, this is not true at all, so let us take a close look at 3 ways artificial intelligence is a friend rather than a foe.1. AI technology is not a danger to humanity:The true fact is that all knows that if given the complete power, the super-AI technology will dominate human intelligence and soon the planet will be under their control, which will lead to a biggest question mark for the human existence on this planet. This is an incredibly silly notion that AI should not be encouraged to not spread mass hysteria. Humanity is still much smarter and cannot be challenged by this form of technology that needs to be constantly programmed and taught.  2. AI solution can reduce unemployment:The biggest fear that people have of AI is that it can tremendously reduce employment and can cause people to lose their jobs on a global scale. The fear of losing a present job is unimaginable, but people should not forget that their present jobs are the most booming and upgraded recently. The people who are familiar with AI will continuously work and gain success while others will fail. 3. Insufficient knowledge about Artificial Intelligence technology:According to a latest survey conducted online among global technology professionals, 56 percent of professionals agree that insufficient knowledge of AI talent is their weakness. The amazing fact is that the number increased from 36 percent and a survey was conducted four months ago for all levels of various technology professionals and special training is given based on the design of the Artificial Intelligence. Having a productive team can lead to innovations in organizations and small firms are nowadays using AI technology initially, which can cause people to believe that they know more than what they actually do. Conclusion:In conclusion, artificial intelligence is a boon and a blessing rather than a detriment. The future of job markets is going to increase tremendously and the slow transition period of 5-10 years will give sufficient time for industries to adopt the technology. Based on the design of the AI, proper authority should be given and this AI based decision will change the look of the industry.We hope you found this article informative in understanding the importance and relevance of artificial intelligence technology!

People spend hours writing and formatting the perfect resume hoping it to be read by a talent acquisition professional and, eventually, help them land a job interview. Unfortunately, around 75% of resumes submitted are never seen by a human eye.Due to the high number of applicants and resumes submissions to job postings, manual resumes screening processes become tedious, ineffective and time consuming for talent acquisition professionals. Therefore, standardized automated screening methods are necessary to categorize qualified from unqualified candidates based on their background, education and professional experience faster, with more efficiency and more accurate results to streamline hiring processes.Artificial Intelligence in Screening ProgramsArtificial intelligence, along with text mining and natural language processing algorithms, can be applied for the development of programs (i.e. Applicant Tracking Systems) capable of screening objectively thousands of resumes in few minutes without bias to identify the best fit for a job opening based on thresholds, specific criteria or scores.These programs usually look for specific keywords; they sort resumes and rank them to determine the job applications that should be further reviewed by recruiters. While each company might have its own resume screening system, it is crucial for candidates to know how they work with the aim of improving their keywords selection based on the job opening they are applying to.Engineer Resume Screening ExampleSince I am an industrial and systems engineer, let’s land the following example in this professional field. Within the industrial and system engineering field there is a wide range of concentration areas, which include — but not limited to — quality assurance, operations management, manufacture, supply chain, logistics, project management, data analytics and healthcare systems. Each of these has associated key terms and concepts well known within the industrial and systems engineering community.Even though industrial engineers must have knowledge and background of each concentration area, it is often recommended for them to pursue a career in a specific concentration area within this field. In addition, taking into consideration that we are currently on the specialization era, hiring managers are more likely to prioritize candidates with a strong background, knowledge and experience in a specific area than “generalist”’ candidates. Unfortunately, there is a misconception within candidates between being “good and proficient” at everything and being “specialized and highly skilled” in a particular subject.For the following example, let’s build a resume screening Python program capable of categorizing keywords into six different concentration areas (e.g. quality/six sigma, operations management, supply chain, project management, data analytics and healthcare systems) and determining the one with the highest expertise level in an industrial and systems engineer resume. Let’s test it on my resume and see the results!Python CodeThe following Python code will be divided into six major steps. Lines of comments are included to provide a brief explanation and guide you through the coding process.Step #1: PDF file opening, reading and text extractionStep #2: Text cleaningStep #3: Dictionary with key terms by area setup**Disclaimer: the key terms included in each area of this dictionary were obtained through a research of the most common key terms included in industrial and system engineering job postings. This dictionary can be customized to add/remove key terms according to hiring managers criteria.Step #4: Scores calculation per areaStep #5: Sorted data frame for final scores creationScores summary data frameStep #6: Pie chart creationFinal outcomeResume Screening ResultsOutcome InterpretationInteresting. According my resume screening results, my main industrial and systems engineering concentration area is operations management, followed by quality/six sigma tied with data analytics. The results show some degree of experience in healthcare and project management roles.There are two possible ways of analyzing these results. By looking at the scores summary data frame, hiring managers can determine how many key terms were included in each concentration area from a given list. On the other hand, by looking at the pie chart, hiring managers can identify my main concentration area and determine to what extent I could be considered for jobs related to other areas. The scores will be highly influenced by the number of keywords in each concentration area, reason why it is highly recommended to distribute keywords uniformly to avoid undesired bias on the results.As mentioned previously, is up to hiring managers and talent acquisition professionals to define thresholds, metrics and scores to determine a candidate’s qualification for a given job type.Now It’s Your TurnGive it a try! Download the Python code here, load your resume in PDF format and run the code. Find out which is your strongest industrial and system engineering expertise area according to your resume!Concluding ThoughtsIn this tutorial we have gone through one of the many possible applications of artificial intelligence and text mining on resumes screening programs. Real Applicant Tracking Systems are quite more complex and advanced than the program built in here; they not only scan resumes content but their format too. It is crucial for candidates to know how resume screening systems work to beat them and get their resumes to be viewed by a talent acquisition professional.Technology is making the job search process easier and harder. Larger pools of applicants and limited opportunities force candidates to write outstanding resumes capable of defeating the “bots”. It is highly recommended for candidates to optimize their resumes keywords to represent their soft and hard skills and avoid including buzzwords. Do not give up! Work on improving your resume and be confident about your skillset and professional competencies. All the best during your job search process!Interested in learning more about what Applicant Tracking Systems are and how their resume scanners are programmed?

Millions of people are expected to be laid off from their current jobs and re-enter the job market due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19. They need to know where their skills stand and whether they would have to transfer to new jobs. This is where Ashutosh Garg's and Varun Kochalia's ﻿Eightfold﻿.ai steps in to make employees relevant in the post-COVID world. Founded in 2016, Eightfold uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to break down people’s work into skills and other transferable experiences. It can match internal employees to new opportunities to put their skills to work. It can help recruiters find people with the potential to fill their openings, even if they’re not in a job with a matching job title right now. And it can provide job seekers much more visibility into how they can fit into a company with hundreds of job openings.Ashutosh Garg, CEO of Eightfold

The founders decided to go after the challenge of finding talent and providing the best career options. Eightfold wants to help people achieve the best career they can, freed up from the outdated over-reliance on tools and processes like resumes, bad job interviews, and job descriptions. The problem statementEightfold recognised the problems faced by employees: 1) People quit their jobs for new challenges and new roles when there are plenty of challenges in their own companies to apply their skills to new roles; 2) Recruiters get hundreds of resumes, but don’t have a great way of seeing who’s a goodmatch for a job.3) Job seekers don’t have a good way of searching for a job; they are stuck searching by keywords and titles instead of seeing how they have the potential to apply their skills to new challenges. There is very little ‘hiring for potential’, which hurts both companies and job seekers.""To make sense of all this, it’s only possible with a huge amount of information (more than a billion profiles of people) and very advanced artificial intelligence that has analysed these profiles. AI has seen the patterns of millions of careers, learning how people move from school to work to new work at such scale that it can accurately determine who is and isn’t a great match for an open job,"" Ashutosh tells YourStory. Eightfold.ai has partners, customers, and a full-time office in India supporting their B2B product. They see the market in India and Asia as huge for AI as companies need a better way of matching the right people to right jobs, whether new candidates or internal employees. There is also the need to improve retention rates, succession planning, and internal mobility.

 The Future Scope and Career of Artificial Intelligence





What does the platform do?""Eightfold’s Talent Intelligence Platform matches individuals to opportunities at scale. The Talent Intelligence Platform has analysed more than one billion career paths, and calculated the individual factors such as experiences, education, and skills that predict movement through career paths. These calculations form a model that is applied to the career path of any individual and any position. For an individual, the model will rank available positions and show the individual why a position is a match for their qualifications. For a position, the model will rank available candidates and show a recruiter or hiring manager why a person is a match for the position requirements,"" says Ashutosh.Eightfold says the Talent Intelligence Platform is able to match individuals and opportunities based on their potential to succeed in a role, rather than on past success in an equivalent role. The AI helps recogniseemployees who might feel stale in their current positions, provide themwith job openings that match their skills and ambitions. Eightfold is saving companies time and money. The platform reduces the time it takes to hire someone, honing in on the most qualified candidates, and cutting down on the need for a lot of recruitment agencies and other spendings. With this platform, AI can surface many candidates who are already in a company’s network: past applicants, current employees, alumni, and employee referrals, for example. “Let’s say, for example, an oil company wants to movetowards alternative energy. Then, it can get a visual representation of what skills its workforce has and see where there’s a gap. It can even look at how its skills compare to competitors’ skills. This is a platform that is very valuable to a company wanting to transform itself, and make sure the talent it has is the talent it needs,"" Ashutosh exemplifies.He adds that for Eightfold, diversity and inclusion are a major part of their mission, rather than an afterthought. The platform allows the individual to mask a person’s ethnicity or gender, thus stripping away any unconscious bias when a slate of candidates is delivered to the manager.

The one sure way not to forecast the impact of artificial-intelligence technologies is technological determinism.
Judith Clifton
Will artificial intelligence affect how and where we work? To what extent is AI already fundamentally reshaping our relationship to work? Over the last decade, there has been a boom in academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about these possible effects of AI—creating both utopian and dystopian visions of the future workplace. Despite this proliferation, AI remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood.  
Amy Glasmeier
Many studies have tried to answer the question whether AI and automation will create mass unemployment. Depending on the methodologies, approach and countries covered, the answers are wildly different. The Oxford University scholars Frey and Osborne predict that up to 47 per cent of US jobs will be at ‘high risk’ of computerisation by the early 2030s, while a study for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by Arntz et al asserts that this is too pessimistic, finding only 9 per cent of jobs across the OECD to be automatable.
Mia Gray
In a new paper, we argue that the impact of AI on work is not deterministic: it will depend on a range of issues, including place, educational levels, gender and, perhaps most importantly, government policy and firm strategy.

Highly uneven
First, we challenge the commonly held assumption that the effects of AI on work will be homogeneous across a country. Indeed, a growing number of studies argue that the consequences for employment will be highly uneven. Place matters because of the importance of regional sectoral patterns: industrial processes and services are concentrated and delivered in particular areas. At present AI appears to coinhabit locations of pre-existing regional industry agglomerations.
Moreover, despite globalisation, national and local industrial cultures and working practices often vary by place. Different cultural work practices mean that, once deployed, the same technology may operate distinctly in diverse environments. 
Secondly, education matters. Generally, jobs occupied by less-educated workers are more susceptible to the impacts of AI and automation, compared with better-educated peers performing more complex and discretionary tasks. For example, in the financial and insurance sectors repetitive, data-intensive operations may be more automatable in the US than in the UK, due to the differences in average education levels within these professions. Another example is legal services, where those in paralegal, less-skilled occupations are at most risk of displacement.

Thirdly, it appears men’s jobs are currently more vulnerable to automation—especially those requiring lower educational attainment, since these tend to be routine industrial tasks amenable to mechanisation. This may however change in the future.
Women dominate many care jobs in ‘high touch’ occupations, where emotional and cognitive labour are significant. These jobs appear more resistant to technological encroachment, as they involve face-to-face work. In the medium term, though, emerging applications aim to augment even these service functions with machine assistance and are likely to interact with and produce new gendered divisions of labour.
Narrow focus
Fourthly, the consequences of AI on work will depend, crucially, on policy and the firm. Acemoglu and Restrepo argue that productivity increases could outweigh the displacement effect of technologies under the ‘right’ type of AI: if governments actively support AI which enhances jobs, rather than AI which seeks to eliminate jobs, the outcome could be positive overall.
To do this well, government also needs to accompany AI with social policy. Governments have started publishing AI policies in the last few years. But a comparative analysis of government AI strategies shows that, to date, the great bulk of policy has focused narrowly on economic gains, with very little attention paid to social issues. Yet understanding the latter is a precondition of societies being able to evaluate, and regulate, new applications of AI.
Firms, too, can opt to promote the ‘right’ type of AI—or not. Meanwhile, they may increasingly turn to AI to support recruitment.
This could be problematic, since AI algorithms have been found to contain embedded gender and racial biases. The use of such technologies as facial and voice recognition, automated screening of curricula vitae and targeted profiling may inadvertently reduce the pool of eligible job-seeking applicants in profoundly prejudicial ways. If businesses put these to use for recruitment purposes, the distribution of job opportunities could be profoundly affected, and AI might reproduce pre-existing biases around gender, ethnicity, and class.
Two paths
At its starkest, we see two paths forward. Fuelled by scare tactics and the ‘great unknown’, consulting firms are pushing companies to jump on the AI bandwagon, to avoid becoming economic ‘laggards’. Each consultancy is carving out a niche toward distinct trajectories, from relying on cutting costs to eliminating low-skilled labour—and encouraging government AI policies to focus on economic gains.
Another path is however possible. The potential exists for AI applications to enable the reskilling of existing workforces, thus allowing workers to use their skills alongside new technologies. AI and associated technologies can be used to help transform education and health and, even, attain peace.
There is nothing preordained about how AI will be deployed. The application consequences of these technologies will reflect choices made at the organizational, political and societal levels. The future of AI is too important to be left to technology specialists. Social scientists, lawyers of technology and experts in the ethics of technology need actively to engage in shaping and structuring its development and adoption.

Now, researchers are finding that machines can bring out the best in group work.It’s long been recognised that when groups of people come together to solve a problem they can become more than the sum of their parts. The ‘wisdom of the crowd’ has been acknowledged as far back as Ancient Greece, when Aristotle noted that many unremarkable men often make better collective judgments than great individuals.Multiple people weighing in on a problem might intuitively seem to lead to a better outcome, but as any manager will tell you, keeping a large team on task is not easy. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) could make harnessing this collective wisdom much easier, making us more effective at our jobs and better able to solve pressing social challenges.“We know that the future of work is all about collaboration and problem solving,” says Peter Baeck, who leads the Centre for Collective Intelligence Design at Nesta, a UK charity that funds and promotes research into groundbreaking ideas. “One of the most obvious opportunities is using AI to better create connections within often quite chaotic messy networks of people who are working on a common challenge.”The biggest factor affecting how collectively intelligent a group can be is the degree of coordination among its members – Anita WoolleyThe biggest factor affecting how collectively intelligent a group can be is the degree of coordination among its members, says Anita Woolley, a leading expert in organisational behaviour at Carnegie Mellon University. Smart tools can be a boon in this area, which is why Woolley is working with colleagues to develop AI-powered coaches that can track group members and provide prompts to help them work better as a team.“The roles these [AI] tools can play are virtually endless,” says Woolley. “Fostering communication among the different components, reminding people of stuff they might have forgotten, being a repository of information, helping the group coordinate its decision making.”Getty ImagesSome firms are looking to the collective decision-making of bee swarms to help humans work together better (Credit: Getty Images)Hive mindsThere are already promising examples of how AI can help us better pool our unique capabilities. San Francisco start-up Unanimous AI has built an online platform that helps guide group decisions. They’ve looked to an unlikely place to guide their AI: the way honeybees make collective decisions.“We went back to basics and said, ‘How does nature amplify the intelligence of groups?’,” says CEO Louis Rosenberg. “What nature does is form real-time systems, where the groups are interacting all at once together with feedback loops. So, they're pushing and pulling on each other as a system, and converging on the best possible combination of their knowledge, wisdom, insight and intuition.”What nature does is form real-time systems, where the groups are interacting all at once together with feedback loops – Louis RosenbergTheir Swarm AI platform presents groups with a question and places potential answers in different corners of their screen. Users control a virtual magnet with their mouse and engage in a tug of war to drag an ice hockey puck to the answer they think is correct. The system’s algorithm analyses how each user interacts with the puck – for instance, how much conviction they drag it with or how quickly they waver when they’re in the minority – and  uses this information to determine where the puck moves. That creates feedback loops in which each user is influenced by the choice and conviction of the others allowing the puck to end up at the answer best reflecting the collective wisdom of the group.Several academic papers and high-profile clients who use the product back up the effectiveness of the Swarm AI platform. In one recent study, a group of traders were asked to forecast the weekly movement of several key stock market indices by trying to drag the puck to one of four answers — up or down by more than 4%, or up and down by less than 4%. With the tool, they boosted their accuracy by 36%.Credit Suisse has used the platform to help investors forecast the performance of Asian markets; Disney has used it to predict the success of TV shows; and Unanimous has even partnered with Stanford Medical School to boost doctors’ ability to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays by 33%.Getty Images‘Swarm intelligence’ can help radiologists reduce errors by a third when diagnosing pneumonia (Credit: Getty Images)Team buildingBut designing technology that can mesh well with human teams can be surprisingly difficult, says Woolley, who is working with colleagues to develop AI-powered coaches that can track group members and provide prompts to help them work better as a team.In one study, her team tried out three different tools designed to maximise collective intelligence: one that gave real-time feedback on team members’ effort, another that helped divide and assign tasks and a chatbot that helped the group talk about their skills and expertise.It's easier to be harmful or to create things that annoy people than it is to create things that are honestly helpful – Anita WoolleyThe first tool appeared to demotivate people, while the second ended up distracting teams with unnecessary planning. Only the final tool helped, by ensuring the best-suited people worked on each task. “What we keep discovering is that it's easier to be harmful or to create things that annoy people than it is to create things that are honestly helpful,” says Woolley.It is still really difficult to build AI with social intelligence, she says, because machines continue to struggle to pick up the nuanced social cues that guide so much of group dynamics. It’s also evident from Woolley’s research that these kinds of systems only work if humans truly trust AI decision making, and if users are only receiving gentle nudges from the system. “As soon as it's heavy handed, people are looking for ways to disable it,” says Woolley.Getty ImagesRobots struggle with the social cues that make up group dynamics, and humans struggle to trust AI systems that are too heavy-handed (Credit: Getty Images)But the reasons why it can be hard to combine machines and humans are also central to why they work so well together, says Baeck. AI can operate at speeds and scales far out of our reach, but machines are still a long way from replicating human flexibility, curiosity and grasp of context.A recent report Baeck co-authored with Nesta senior researcher Aleks Berditchevskaia identified a number of ways AI could enhance our collective intelligence. This includes helping make better sense of data, finding better ways to coordinate decision making, helping us overcome our inherent biases and highlighting unusual solutions that are often overlooked.But the report also showed that combining AI tools with human teams requires careful design to avoid unintended consequences. And there is currently a dearth of research into how groups react to being corralled by AI, says Berditchevskaia, making it hard to predict how effective these systems will be in the wild.“It can potentially stretch us in new ways or enhance our speed when we need to be reacting quicker,” she adds. “But we're still at very early stages of understanding and being able to navigate the individual reactions to those kinds of AI system in terms of issues of trust and how it affects their own sense of agency.”Humanising AIOur combined wisdom can also help give a more human element to AI technology, and better guide its decisions.At London-based start-up Factmata, which has built an AI moderation system, the company has enlisted more than 2,000 experts, including journalists and researchers, to analyse online content for things including bias, credibility or hate speech. They then used this analysis to train a natural-language processing system to automatically scan web pages for problematic content.“Once you have that trained algorithm it can scale to those millions of pieces of content across the internet,” says CEO Dhruv Ghulati. “You're able to scale up the critical assessment of those experts.”While AI is often trained on data labelled by experts in a one-off process, Factmata’s experts continually refresh the training data to make sure the algorithms can keep up with the ever-shifting political and media landscape. They also let members of the public give feedback on the AI’s output, which Ghulati says ensures it remains relevant and free of bias itself.Entwining ourselves and our decisions every more tightly with AI is not without risks, however. The synergy between AI and collective intelligence works best the more information we give the machine, says Woolley, which involves difficult choices about how much privacy we’re happy to surrender.We can have some very smart individuals working on different components in isolation, but if we don't have coordination it's really hard to make any headway – Anita WoolleyBut given the world’s complex multifaceted challenges, such as climate change and pandemics, harnessing our collective intelligence more effectively is essential, she says.There are already examples of how the approach could tackle these kinds of problems. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon are currently forecasting the Covid-19 pandemic in real time by using machine learning to combine voluntary symptom surveys, doctors’ reports, lab statistics and Google search trends. Elsewhere, the Early Warning Project in the US has identified countries at greatest risk of atrocities using a combination of crowd-sourced predictions, expert assessments and machine learning algorithms.“We can have some very smart individuals working on different components in isolation, but if we don't have coordination it's really hard to make any headway,” says Woolley. “I think it's going to be critical to helping these different components actually coordinate in the ways needed to address the biggest collective action problems.”Technology",https://schema.org,NewsArticle,How AI can help us harness our 'collective intelligence',2020-05-14T03:16:35.000Z,2022-02-25T06:48:21.050Z,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Edd Gent', 'url': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p08d0715.jpg'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, he wrote about technology and gaming for Naavik, Protocol, and The Verge. May 12, 2020, 12:00 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by James Bareham / The VergeFacebook on Monday released a new report detailing how it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human fact-checkers and moderators to enforce its community standards. The report — called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months — has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators. Facebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms’ employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform. Facebook says the data it’s compiled its most recent report doesn’t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. “This report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,” writes Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. “We anticipate we’ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.’Given the state of the world, Facebook’s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools. Facebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month“During the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,” the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. “Since March 1st, we’ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.”Facebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links. “We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos,” the company says in a separate hate speech-specific blog post about its recent moderation findings and research. “As with other content, hate speech also can be multimodal: A meme might use text and image together to attack a particular group of people, for example.”This is a tougher challenge for AI to tackle, the company admits. Not only do AI-trained models have a harder time parsing a meme image or a video due to complexities like wordplay and language differences, but that software must also then be trained to find duplicates or only marginally modified versions of that content as it spreads across Facebook. But this is precisely what Facebook says it’s achieved with what it calls SimSearchNet, a multiyear effort across many divisions within the company to train an AI model how to recognize both copies of the original image and those that are near-duplicates and have perhaps one word in the line of text changed. “We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos.”“Once independent fact-checkers have determined that an image contains misleading or false claims about coronavirus, SimSearchNet, as part of our end-to-end image indexing and matching system, is able to recognize near-duplicate matches so we can apply warning labels,” the company says. “This system runs on every image uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and checks against task-specific human-curated databases. This accounts for billions of images being checked per day, including against databases set up to detect COVID-19 misinformation.” Facebook uses the example of a misleading image modeled after a broadcast news graphic with a line of overlaid text reading, “COVID-19 is found in toilet paper.” The image is from a known peddler of fake news called Now8News, and the graphic has since been debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations. But Facebook says it had to train its AI to differentiate between the original image and a modified one that says, “COVID-19 isn’t found in toilet paper.” The goal is to help reduce the spread of duplicate images while also not inadvertently labeling genuine posts or those that don’t meet the bar for misinformation. This is a big problem on Facebook where many politically motivated pages and organizations or those that simply feed off partisan outrage will take photographs, screenshots, and other images and alter them to change their meaning. An AI model that knows the difference and can label one as misinformation and the other as genuine is a meaningful step forward, especially when it can then do the same to any duplicate or near-duplicate content in the future without roping in non-offending images in the process.  Image: Facebook“It’s extremely important that these similarity systems be as accurate as possible, because a mistake can mean taking action on content that doesn’t actually violate our policies,” the company says. “This is particularly important because for each piece of misinformation fact-checker identifies, there may be thousands or millions of copies. Using AI to detect these matches also enables our fact-checking partners to focus on catching new instances of misinformation rather than near-identical variations of content they’ve already seen.”Facebook has also improved its hate speech moderation using many of the same techniques it’s employing toward coronavirus-related content. “AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove, up from 80.2 percent the previous quarter,” the company says. “In the first quarter of 2020, we took action on 9.6 million pieces of content for violating our hate speech policies — an increase of 3.9 million.”Facebook is able to rely more on AI, thanks to some advancements in how its models understand and parse text, both as it appears in posts and accompanying links and as overlaid in images or video. “AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove.”“People sharing hate speech often try to elude detection by modifying their content. This sort of adversarial behavior ranges from intentionally misspelling words or avoiding certain phrases to modifying images and videos,” the company says. “As we improve our systems to address these challenges, it’s crucial to get it right. Mistakenly classifying content as hate speech can mean preventing people from expressing themselves and engaging with others.” Facebook says so-called counterspeech, or a response to hate speech that argues against it but nonetheless usually contains snippets of the offensive content, is “particularly challenging to classify correctly because it can look so similar to the hate speech itself.”Facebook’s latest report includes more data from Instagram, including how much bullying content that platform removes and how much of the content is appealed and reinstated. It applied its image-matching efforts toward finding suicide and self-injury posts, raising the percentage of Instagram content that was removed before users reported it.Suicide and self-injury enforcement on Facebook also expanded in the last quarter of 2019, when the company removed 5 million pieces of content — double the amount it had removed in the months before. A spokesperson says this spike stemmed from a change that let Facebook detect and remove lots of very old content in October and November, and the numbers dropped dramatically in 2020 as it shifted its focus back to newer material.Facebook says its new advances — in particular, a neural network it calls XLM-R announced last November — are helping its automated moderation systems better understand text across multiple languages. Facebook says XLM-R allows it “to train efficiently on orders of magnitude more data and for a longer amount of time,” and to transfer that learning across multiple languages. But Facebook says memes are proving to be a resilient and hard-to-detect delivery mechanism for hate speech, even with its improved tools. So it built a dedicated “hateful meme” data set containing 10,000 examples, where the meaning of the image can only be fully understood by processing both the image and the text and understanding the relationship between the two. An example is an image of a barren desert with the text, “Look how many people love you,” overlaid on top. Facebook calls the process of detecting this with automated systems multimodal understanding, and training its AI models with this level of sophistication is part of its more cutting-edge moderation research.  Image: Facebook“To provide researchers with a data set with clear licensing terms, we licensed assets from Getty Images. We worked with trained third-party annotators to create new memes similar to existing ones that had been shared on social media sites,” the company says. “The annotators used Getty Images’ collection of stock images to replace the original visuals while still preserving the semantic content.”Facebook says it’s providing the data set to researchers to improve techniques for detecting this type of hate speech online. It’s also launching a challenge with a $100,000 prize for researchers to create models trained on the data set that can successfully parse these more subtle forms of speech that Facebook is seeing more often now that its systems are more proactively taking down more blatant hateful content. Update May 12th, 3:55PM ET: Added information about Facebook’s $52 million settlement with third-party contract moderators.

The report — called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months — has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators. 

Facebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms’ employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform.

Facebook says the data it’s compiled its most recent report doesn’t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. “This report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,” writes Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. “We anticipate we’ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.’

Given the state of the world, Facebook’s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools. 

""Facebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month""

“During the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,” the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. “Since March 1st, we’ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.”

Facebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links. 

“We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos,” the company says in a separate hate speech-specific blog post about its recent moderation findings and research. “As with other content, hate speech also can be multimodal: A meme might use text and image together to attack a particular group of people, for example.”

This is a tougher challenge for AI to tackle, the company admits. Not only do AI-trained models have a harder time parsing a meme image or a video due to complexities like wordplay and language differences, but that software must also then be trained to find duplicates or only marginally modified versions of that content as it spreads across Facebook. But this is precisely what Facebook says it’s achieved with what it calls SimSearchNet, a multiyear effort across many divisions within the company to train an AI model how to recognize both copies of the original image and those that are near-duplicates and have perhaps one word in the line of text changed. 

""“We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos.”""

“Once independent fact-checkers have determined that an image contains misleading or false claims about coronavirus, SimSearchNet, as part of our end-to-end image indexing and matching system, is able to recognize near-duplicate matches so we can apply warning labels,” the company says. “This system runs on every image uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and checks against task-specific human-curated databases. This accounts for billions of images being checked per day, including against databases set up to detect COVID-19 misinformation.” 

Facebook uses the example of a misleading image modeled after a broadcast news graphic with a line of overlaid text reading, “COVID-19 is found in toilet paper.” The image is from a known peddler of fake news called Now8News, and the graphic has since been debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations. But Facebook says it had to train its AI to differentiate between the original image and a modified one that says, “COVID-19 isn’t found in toilet paper.” 

The goal is to help reduce the spread of duplicate images while also not inadvertently labeling genuine posts or those that don’t meet the bar for misinformation. This is a big problem on Facebook where many politically motivated pages and organizations or those that simply feed off partisan outrage will take photographs, screenshots, and other images and alter them to change their meaning. An AI model that knows the difference and can label one as misinformation and the other as genuine is a meaningful step forward, especially when it can then do the same to any duplicate or near-duplicate content in the future without roping in non-offending images in the process.

Picking out pests from plants is one use of this AI that can see past camouflageRolf Nussbaumer Photography / Al
Camouflaged objects are difficult to detect, for both humans and artificial intelligence. But now an AI has been trained to parse objects from their backgrounds.
This could have a variety of applications, such as being used for search-and-rescue work, detecting agricultural pests, medical imaging or in military settings.
Detecting camouflaged objects requires visual perception and knowledge. Until now, many AIs have struggled with this task because their algorithms rely on visual cues, such as differences in colour or…

MyOpenCourt currently features two free and simple-to-use web-based tools that harness artificial intelligence and data science technologies. 


As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, millions of Canadians are out of work and facing uncertainty about returning. These circumstances can put workers, particularly those in ‘gig economy’ jobs, in situations where their legal rights are unclear. 
MyOpenCourt, a project of the Conflict Analytics Lab at Queen’s University’s Faculty of Law and Smith School of Business, will now help these workers understand their rights – and options. 
“Most Canadian workers cannot afford an employment lawyer, or live in areas with few skilled employment law experts,” says Samuel Dahan, Director of the Conflict Analytics Lab and a professor in the Faculty of Law with a cross-appointment to Smith. “Since COVID-19’s arrival in Canada, we have seen nearly 2 million jobs lost with terminations and layoffs across many different sectors, and decided to launch our tools to help Canadians who have lost work.”
MyOpenCourt currently features two free and simple-to-use web-based tools that harness artificial intelligence and data science technologies. Both are available at the project site at myopencourt.org. 
The “Am I an employee or contractor?” application can determine the likelihood that a work arrangement is an employment relationship or that of a contractor through a fast, anonymous questionnaire.
Workers who believe they have been wrongfully dismissed can use the “How much severance am I entitled to?” tool to calculate reasonable notice for dismissal.
“These tools are as valuable for employers as they are for workers,” Professor Dahan says. “Navigating employer-contractor relationships is challenging, and severance is difficult to calculate. We hope to provide both workers and employers with ways to avoid pitfalls and find equitable solutions to the challenges created by the pandemic.” 
Powerful AI technology lies behind both tools. Working from thousands of Canadian employment law cases, MyOpenCourt can make predictions that can offer guidance to workers in these uncertain situations. While these applications cannot take the place of a lawyer, they can help users understand if they have a case before contacting one.
Should a user discover they have a case, MyOpenCourt will automatically connect the user to a partner law firm at no cost. 
The MyOpenCourt tools have been developed by students and researchers at Queen’s Law, the Smith Master of Management in Artificial Intelligence, Queen’s Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, and partners like McGill University and institutions based in the U.S. and Europe. Professor Maxime Cohen of McGill and Professor Jonathan Touboul of Brandeis University provided data science expertise, helping to translate the case data into predictions.
“We are thrilled that the Conflict Analytics Lab has been able to launch this platform, at a time when these tools will be able to help many Canadians,” says Yuri Levin, Executive Director of the Analytics and AI ecosystem at Smith and an instrumental player in the creation of the Conflict Analytics Lab.
 MyOpenCourt reasonable notice calculator cannot currently be used to generate case outcomes for Québec-based users.

One of the hum-drum housekeeping tasks that AI already handles at VFX studio Industrial Light & Magic is overseeing the workflow of rendering animation and visual effects. ""We use it for scheduling render jobs on the render farms to get our workloads done every single night in a predictable fashion,"" says Rob Bredow, senior vp, executive creative director and head of ILM, whose recent work includes Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. ""One of the things that's interesting about machine-learning algorithms is, even when they're only 80 or 90 percent effective, sometimes their guesses tend to pretty much align with if you had put a person there and had them make that guess.""

Bones editor Harry B. Miller relates that AI is used for certain tasks in various editing systems including Avid's Media Composer, ""which has a software add-on that matches dialogue spoken in dailies to the script, allowing the editor to quickly find every take and angle for that part of a scene."" Adobe's Premiere Pro can also use AI ""to reframe video for different aspect ratios,"" adds Miller, though he sees limitations. ""A computer may know what a joke is, but it can't tell what is funny,"" he says. ""Stanford University has worked on software that takes motion picture dailies and assembles shots in script order. But it can't tell what is the best dramatic scene. To know what 'works,' for now, takes a human.""

VFX house Digital Domain used AI as part of its Masquerade facial capture system to superimpose Josh Brolin's performance onto the villain Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. ""We've seen huge advancements in that area of research lately,"" says Darren Hendler, director of the studio's digital human group. ""Real-time rendering together with our AI-driven, real-time facial capture system is changing the timelines for creating movie creatures. Soon we'll be able to generate realistic Thanos-like performances live on set."" Hendler says a suite of deep-learning technologies on the horizon ""can potentially allow us to quickly and realistically transform a stunt double into an actor or change an actor's lines.""

AI is having a ""drastic"" effect in the world of digital humans, says Christopher Nichols, director of Chaos Group Labs and key member of the Digital Human League, a research and development group: ""The massive challenges that were put on artists and tools to find all those subtle nuances that make a human look real are actually much easier to solve through deep learning."" The improvements have also led to deepfakes, such as the viral faux PSA using FaceSwap AI in which Jordan Peele ventriloquizes former President ""Barack Obama"" calling President Trump a ""complete dipshit."" Says Nichols: ""A great number of people want to stop the technology and outright outlaw it. [But] the tools themselves have huge potentials that we should all continue to explore."" He concludes, ""What I believe is that we need more education on the subject and better tools that help detect what is real and not real. We have come to accept that Photoshop can manipulate images very well and easily, and we are not banning that as a tool. But we have come to understand and doubt every image that is presented to us.”

How About a Movie From Scratch?Share

""Decades from now, an AI algorithm will make your movie simply from the text of the script,"" even in a particular director's style, predicts Paul Debevec, senior scientist at Google. ""Both scripts and features are just strings of 0's and 1's on a computer. If we provide a sufficiently large neural network and enough training pairing scripts and movies, it will learn the mapping and generate an entirely new movie from an entirely new script. You could even ask it to make your new film — or remake an old one — in the style of Kubrick, Tarantino or Scorsese by emphasizing the correlations between each of their scripts and movies.""

It sounds like it belongs in a history book, filed somewhere between bloodletting and velocipedes. We’d like to think that judging people’s worth based on the size and shape of their skull is a practice that’s well behind us. However, phrenology is once again rearing its lumpy head. In recent years, machine-learning algorithms have promised governments and private companies the power to glean all sorts of information from people’s appearance. Several startups now claim to be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help employers detect the personality traits of job candidates based on their facial expressions. In China, the government has pioneered the use of surveillance cameras that identify and track ethnic minorities. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of schools installing camera systems that automatically sanction children for not paying attention, based on facial movements and microexpressions such as eyebrow twitches. Perhaps most notoriously, a few years ago, AI researchers Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang claimed to have trained an algorithm to identify criminals based on the shape of their faces, with an accuracy of 89.5 per cent. They didn’t go so far as to endorse some of the ideas about physiognomy and character that circulated in the 19th century, notably from the work of the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso: that criminals are underevolved, subhuman beasts, recognisable from their sloping foreheads and hawk-like noses. However, the recent study’s seemingly high-tech attempt to pick out facial features associated with criminality borrows directly from the ‘photographic composite method’ developed by the Victorian jack-of-all-trades Francis Galton – which involved overlaying the faces of multiple people in a certain category to find the features indicative of qualities like health, disease, beauty and criminality. Technology commentators have panned these facial-recognition technologies as ‘literal phrenology’; they’ve also linked it to eugenics, the pseudoscience of improving the human race by encouraging people deemed the fittest to reproduce. (Galton himself coined the term ‘eugenics’, describing it in 1883 as ‘all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had’.) In some cases, the explicit goal of these technologies is to deny opportunities to those deemed unfit; in others, it might not be the goal, but it’s a predictable result. Yet when we dismiss algorithms by labelling them as phrenology, what exactly is the problem we’re trying to point out? Are we saying that these methods are scientifically flawed and that they don’t really work – or are we saying that it’s morally wrong to use them regardless? There is a long and tangled history to the way ‘phrenology’ has been used as a withering insult. Philosophical and scientific criticisms of the endeavour have always been intertwined, though their entanglement has changed over time. In the 19th century, phrenology’s detractors objected to the fact that phrenology attempted to pinpoint the location of different mental functions in different parts of the brain – a move that was seen as heretical, since it called into question Christian ideas about the unity of the soul. Interestingly, though, trying to discover a person’s character and intellect based on the size and shape of their head wasn’t perceived as a serious moral issue. Today, by contrast, the idea of localising mental functions is fairly uncontroversial. Scientists might no longer think that destructiveness is seated above the right ear, but the notion that cognitive functions can be localised in particular brain circuits is a standard assumption in mainstream neuroscience. Phrenology had its share of empirical criticism in the 19th century, too. Debates raged about which functions resided where, and whether skull measurements were a reliable way of determining what’s going on in the brain. The most influential empirical criticism of old phrenology, though, came from the French physician Jean Pierre Flourens’s studies based on damaging the brains of rabbits and pigeons – from which he concluded that mental functions are distributed, rather than localised. (These results were later discredited.) The fact that phrenology was rejected for reasons that most contemporary observers would no longer accept makes it only more difficult to figure out what we’re targeting when we use ‘phrenology’ as a slur today. Both ‘old’ and ‘new’ phrenology have been critiqued for their sloppy methods. In the recent AI study of criminality, the data were taken from two very different sources: mugshots of convicts, versus pictures from work websites for nonconvicts. That fact alone could account for the algorithm’s ability to detect a difference between the groups. In a new preface to the paper, the researchers also admitted that taking court convictions as synonymous with criminality was a ‘serious oversight’. Yet equating convictions with criminality seems to register with the authors mainly as an empirical flaw: using mugshots of convicted criminals, but not of the ones who got away introduces a statistical bias. They said they were ‘deeply baffled’ at the public outrage in reaction to a paper that was intended ‘for pure academic discussions’. From Wu and Zhang (2016) Notably, the researchers don’t comment on the fact that conviction itself depends on the impressions that police, judges and juries form of the suspect – making a person’s ‘criminal’ appearance a confounding variable. They also fail to mention how the intense policing of particular communities, and inequality of access to legal representation, skews the dataset. In their response to criticism, the authors don’t back down on the assumption that ‘being a criminal requires a host of abnormal (outlier) personal traits’. Indeed, their framing suggests that criminality is an innate characteristic, rather than a response to social conditions such as poverty or abuse. Part of what makes their dataset questionable on empirical grounds is that who gets labelled ‘criminal’ is hardly value-neutral. One of the strongest moral objections to using facial recognition to detect criminality is that it stigmatises people who are already overpoliced. The authors say that their tool should not be used in law-enforcement, but cite only statistical arguments about why it ought not to be deployed. They note that the false-positive rate (50 per cent) would be very high, but take no notice of what that means in human terms. Those false positives would be individuals whose faces resemble people who have been convicted in the past. Given the racial and other biases that exist in the criminal justice system, such algorithms would end up overestimating criminality among marginalised communities. The most contentious question seems to be whether reinventing physiognomy is fair game for the purposes of ‘pure academic discussion’. One could object on empirical grounds: eugenicists of the past such as Galton and Lombroso ultimately failed to find facial features that predisposed a person to criminality. That’s because there are no such connections to be found. Likewise, psychologists studying the heritability of intelligence, such as Cyril Burt and Philippe Rushton, had to play fast and loose with their data to manufacture correlations between skull size, race and IQ. If there were anything to discover, presumably the many people who have tried over the years wouldn’t have come up dry. The problem with reinventing physiognomy is not merely that it has been tried without success before. Researchers who persist in looking for cold fusion after the scientific consensus has moved on also face criticism for chasing unicorns – but disapproval of cold fusion falls far short of opprobrium. At worst, they are seen as wasting their time. The difference is that the potential harms of cold fusion research are much more limited. In contrast, some commentators argue that facial recognition should be regulated as tightly as plutonium, because it has so few nonharmful uses. When the dead-end project you want to resurrect was invented for the purpose of propping up colonial and class structures – and when the only thing it’s capable of measuring is the racism inherent in those structures – it’s hard to justify trying it one more time, just for curiosity’s sake. However, calling facial-recognition research ‘phrenology’ without explaining what is at stake probably isn’t the most effective strategy for communicating the force of the complaint. For scientists to take their moral responsibilities seriously, they need to be aware of the harms that might result from their research. Spelling out more clearly what’s wrong with the work labelled ‘phrenology’ will hopefully have more of an impact than simply throwing the name around as an insult.

Tech chiefs are looking for some approaches to implement artificial intelligence technologies into their organizations to draw obstruction and include values, for example, AI is immovably utilized in the banking and media industry. There is a wide arrangement of methods that come in the space of artificial intelligence, for example, linguistics, bias, vision, robotics, planning, natural language processing, decision science, etc. Let us learn about some of the major subfields of AI in depth..Machine Learning.ML is maybe the most applicable subset of AI to the average enterprise today. As clarified in the Executive's manual for real-world AI, our recent research report directed by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, ML is a mature innovation that has been around for quite a long time..ML is a part of AI that enables computers to self-learn from information and apply that learning without human intercession. When confronting a circumstance wherein a solution is covered up in a huge data set, AI is a go-to. &quot;ML exceeds expectations at processing that information, extracting patterns from it in a small amount of the time a human would take and delivering in any case out of reach knowledge,&quot; says Ingo Mierswa, founder and president of the data science platform RapidMiner. ML powers risk analysis, fraud detection, and portfolio management in financial services; GPS-based predictions in travel and targeted marketing campaigns, to list a few examples..Neural Network.Joining cognitive science and machines to perform tasks, the neural network is a part of artificial intelligence that utilizes nervous system science ( a piece of biology that worries the nerve and nervous system of the human cerebrum). Imitating the human mind where the human brain contains an unbounded number of neurons and to code brain-neurons into a system or a machine is the thing that the neural network functions..Neural network and machine learning combinedly tackle numerous intricate tasks effortlessly while a large number of these tasks can be automated. NLTK is your sacred goal library that is utilized in NLP. Ace all the modules in it and you'll be a professional text analyzer instantly. Other Python libraries include pandas, NumPy, text blob, matplotlib, wordcloud..Deep Learning.An explainer article by AI software organization Pathmind offers a valuable analogy: Think of a lot of Russian dolls settled within one another. &quot;Profound learning is a subset of machine learning and machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that accomplishes something smart.&quot;.Deep learning utilizes alleged neural systems, which &quot;learn from processing the labeled information provided during training and uses this answer key to realize what attributes of the information are expected to build the right yield,&quot; as per one clarification given by deep AI. &quot;When an adequate number of models have been processed, the neural network can start to process new, inconspicuous sources of info and effectively return precise outcomes.&quot;.Deep learning powers product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix. It works in the background of Google's voice-and image-recognition algorithms. Its ability to break down a lot of high-dimensional information makes deep learning unmistakably appropriate for supercharging preventive maintenance frameworks.Robotics.This has risen as an extremely sizzling field of artificial intelligence. A fascinating field of innovative work for the most part focuses around designing and developing robots. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering consolidated with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and numerous others. It decides the designing, producing, operating, and use of robots. It manages computer systems for their control, intelligent results and data change..Robots are deployed regularly for directing tasks that may be difficult for people to perform consistently. Major robotics tasks included an assembly line for automobile manufacturing, for moving large objects in space by NASA. Artificial intelligence scientists are additionally creating robots utilizing machine learning to set interaction at social levels..Computer Vision.Have you taken a stab at learning another language by labeling the items in your home with the local language and translated words? It is by all accounts a successful vocab developer since you see the words again and again. Same is the situation with computers fueled with computer vision. They learn by labeling or classifying various objects that they go over and handle the implications or decipher, however, at a much quicker pace than people (like those robots in science fiction motion pictures)..The tool OpenCV empowers processing of pictures by applying them to mathematical operations. Recall that elective subject in engineering days called &quot;Fluffy Logic&quot;? Truly, that approach is utilized in Image processing that makes it a lot simpler for computer vision specialists to fuzzify or obscure the readings that can't be placed in a crisp Yes/No or True/False classification. OpenTLA is utilized for video tracking which is the procedure to find a moving object(s) utilizing a camera video stream..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The award was for $210,000, not $210 million. The headline was also changed the reflect the correct amount. The Department of Justice awarded a $210,000 contract to artificial intelligence company Veritone, the firm announced May 12.Under the two-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract, Veritone will provide audio and video transcription services as well as translation services to the department and its 94 U.S. attorneys offices across the country.According to Veritone, the service will reduce the time associated with discovery processes and lower costs.“We appreciate being selected as the provider of AI-based transcription and translation services for the DOJ to assist their agencies with audio and video based discovery, securely and at scale,” said Jon Gacek, head of government, legal and compliance at Veritone. “In our pursuit to help transform government operations through AI-enabled solutions that provide actionable intelligence and tools that save cost, resources and time, this contract represents a major milestone and opportunity for Veritone.”Veritone’s platform, called aiWARE Government, was approved for use in the federal government by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, in March 2019. Its authorization was sponsored by the DOJ.This is Veritone’s first major federal government contract, a company spokesperson confirmed. It previously provided services to the federal government as a subcontractor, including work at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Army.Veritone is looking to expand its footprint in federal contracting. On a May 11 earnings call, Veritone’s president and co-founder Ryan Steelberg said the company is “very optimistic” about its federal business. Its platform is currently used by the Air Force as part of the service’s AFWERX program, a rapid acquisition initiative.“We’re starting to see a lot of those deals start to come in and actually close,” Steelberg said. “So, we are very optimistic about the pipeline for [government, legal and compliance], both from I’ll say more legal-centric initiatives with the DOJ, but also with [the Department of Defense] and other related opportunities within the government.”About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

At the very least though, these bots are pretty useful when it comes to writing parody songs. So, what happens when all of AC/DC's lyrics and music are filtered through AI? The hysterical song ""Great Balls"" is what happens.YouTube user Funk Turkey has used artificial intelligence to create ""new"" songs by certain artists, such as Nickelback, in the past and, here, elected to see what would happen with AC/DC, whose narrow lyrical themes typically center around rocking both the stage and the bedposts, money, cars, gambling.Curiously, the word ""rock"" didn't make a single appearance in this new set of lyrics for ""Great Balls,"" but dogs, women and balls are in overabundance. To craft the song, Funk Turkey ran AC/DC's lyrics through the lyrics.rip service, which then spat them back out as seen below. A predictive algorithm was then used to generate the music.Read the lyrics for ""Great Balls"" directly below and listen to the song at the bottom of the page. Funk Turkey does a pretty passable job at tackling Brian Johnson's voice, which makes this whole thing even greater.I'm gonna ride on the dog a touch too muchThe dog a truck 'cuz I'm justI’m on

The pandemic has accelerated workplace innovation across sectors to the point of no return, with contemporary businesses now almost entirely reliant on new technologies simply to exist. 

 What role, then, does artificial intelligence (AI) have to play in this drastic shift? For some time now, I’ve firmly maintained the belief that AI would take over the vast majority of process-driven work within 15 years. However, with years of key developments in the world of work having recently been crammed into a matter of months, the future has unfolded very differently than we imagined. 


Rather than coming about through careful planning, companies have been thrust into this new way of working. Without doubt, many were unprepared for it and have had to move quickly to put in place remote working solutions to keep business going. They simply didn’t have the time to manage change and implement AI-driven solutions. 

However, many predict that we’ll see remote working becoming part of the ‘new normal’ even after lockdown measures are eased. Companies like Twitter, for example, have already announced that their employees can work from home indefinitely. Assuming that the growing trend towards permanent remote working continues, organisations will need to carefully consider the AI solutions they turn to for automating process-driven work. Yet, how does this affect the security considerations required to make remote working effective for companies? 

PROMOTED
Every time we send a message to a colleague or share a company file, we share bits of data electronically. Data, of course, is the lifeblood of every modern organisation, so when it is shared, it must be done so securely. If we add AI into the mix, we run into a potential data security issue. 
This is because, fundamentally, AI needs data to work properly. Its purpose is to access data, analyse it and generate better outcomes for organisations through automation. In doing so, it replaces certain tasks, but also enables employees to perform existing jobs more effectively.

Yet, despite the productivity gains, this new era of remote working doesn’t necessarily lend itself to AI being used appropriately when it comes to the secure transmission of data. AI-driven communications are just as vulnerable to security flaws as those performed by humans.

This is especially evident when we look closely at the kind of technology enterprises use to communicate internally – a crucial component of any business model outside an office’s four walls. According to Morten Brøgger, CEO of messaging and collaboration platform Wire, AI may not be as intertwined with the future of work as we think: “AI and the future of work aren’t necessarily compatible. Definitely not in the collaboration and communication market or in the future of work 2.0.”

Brøgger continues: “The reason is that if you start building a lot of AI into communication tools, it means surveillance for your users, which is a clear breach of their privacy. If you do need an AI, you need to have the data to examine behavioural patterns. This means breaking end-to-end encryption, because there will be a machine that receives a copy of everything a user is doing.” 
Wire is one of a crop of collaboration tools that have enabled many organisations to continue operating during COVID-19. It found its niche by specifically targeting large enterprises back in 2017, who Brøgger believes have an advanced understanding of the importance of security and privacy. With its leadership team comprising ex-Skype employees, the company now positions itself as being on a mission to change the way employees communicate in the workplace. 
Though organisations can safely integrate AI technology, this abrupt new iteration of the workplace that we’ve suddenly found ourselves in has perhaps gone some way to exposing why AI isn’t the panacea for everything - at least not without careful security planning at the outset. 
As Brøgger notes: “There were a lot of companies who were basically caught in this situation that weren’t ready for it. So, how do they put infrastructure in place that is sufficiently secure to allow people to work from home and work on things that are absolutely confidential? There are no longer any global rules – no one size fits all. That’s not how the world is, even with collaboration.”
It’s clear that the world of work is changing, though it took a pandemic to accelerate that change. Companies need to take stock of how they can make the most of the tools available to them to reduce inefficiencies, and I still maintain that AI is, in many ways, at the heart of that. But it must be done in a way that doesn’t come at the expense of breaching a company’s security and putting its most valuable data assets at risk.

For its latest project, Nvidia researchers taught an AI system to recreate the game of Pac-Man simply by watching it being played. There’s no coding involved, no pre-rendered images for the software to draw on. The AI model is simply fed visual data of the game in action along with the accompanying controller inputs and then recreates it frame by frame from this information. The resulting game is playable by humans, and Nvidia says it will be releasing it online in the near future. “It learns all of these things just by watching”The AI version is by no means a perfect facsimile, though. The imagery is blurry and it doesn’t seem like the AI managed to capture the exact behavior of the game’s ghosts, each of which is programmed with a specific personality that dictates its movement. But the basic dynamics of Pac-Man are all there: eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and try not to die. “It learns all of these things just by watching,” Nvidia’s Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation technology, told journalists in a briefing. “[It’s] similar to how a human programmer can watch many episodes of Pac-Man on YouTube and infer what the rules of the games are and reconstruct them.” Lebaredian said the work had been done in collaboration with Pac-Man’s creator, Bandai Namco, which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the arcade classic today. The AI-generated Pac-Man is a little blurry, but all the basics are there. Image: NvidiaNvidia says work like this shows how artificial intelligence will be used for game design in the future. Developers can input their work into the AI and use it to create variations or maybe design new levels. “You could use this to mash different games together,” Sanja Fidler, director of Nvidia’s Toronto research lab, told journalists, “giving additional power to games developers by [letting them] blend together different games.”Creating AI that can learn the rules of a virtual world just by watching it in action also has implications for tasks like programming robots. “Eventually we’d like it to learn the rules of the real world,” says Lebaredian. The AI might watch videos of robotics trolleys navigating a warehouse, for example, and use that information to design navigation software of its own.The program that recreated Pac-Man is called GameGAN. GAN stands for generative adversarial network and is a common architecture used in machine learning. The basic principle of a GAN is that it works in two halves. The first half of the GAN tries to replicate the input data, while the second half compares this to the original source. If they don’t match, the generated data is rejected and the generator tweaks its work and resubmits it. AI systems like this could be used to train warehouse robots like the one above, which is powered by Nvidia’s hardware and software. Image: NvidiaUsing AI to generate virtual worlds like video games has been done before. But Nvidia’s researchers introduced several new aspects, including a “memory module” that allowed the system to store an internal map of the game world. This leads to greater consistency in the game world, a key characteristic when recreating the mazes of Pac-Man. They also allow for the static elements of the game world (like the maze) to be separated from the dynamic ones (like the ghosts), which suits the company’s goal of using AI to generate new levels.David Ha, an AI researcher at Google who’s worked on similar tasks, told The Verge that the research was “very interesting.” Earlier teams have tried to recreate game worlds using GANs, said Ha, “but from what I know, [this] is the first to demonstrate good results.” “All in all, a very exciting paper, and I look forward to see more developments using this approach,” said Ha. Some elements of the process definitely need tweaking, though, and demonstrate the particular fragility of artificial intelligence when learning new tasks. Fidler told journalists that to recreate Pac-Man, GameGAN had to be trained on some 50,000 episodes. Getting that gameplay data from humans wasn’t feasible, so the team used an AI agent to generate the data. Unfortunately, the AI agent was so good at the game that it hardly ever died.  “That made it hard for the AI trying to recreate the game to learn the concept of dying,” says Fidler. Instead, in early versions of the AI-generated Pac-Man, GameGAN tweaked the game so that ghosts never actually reached the title character but trail directly behind it like baby ducks following a parent. “It’s a funny effect of the way we trained it,” says Fidler.

Nvidia says work like this shows how artificial intelligence will be used for game design in the future. Developers can input their work into the AI and use it to create variations or maybe design new levels. “You could use this to mash different games together,” Sanja Fidler, director of Nvidia’s Toronto research lab, told journalists, “giving additional power to games developers by [letting them] blend together different games.”

Creating AI that can learn the rules of a virtual world just by watching it in action also has implications for tasks like programming robots. “Eventually we’d like it to learn the rules of the real world,” says Lebaredian. The AI might watch videos of robotics trolleys navigating a warehouse, for example, and use that information to design navigation software of its own.

The program that recreated Pac-Man is called GameGAN. GAN stands for generative adversarial network and is a common architecture used in machine learning. The basic principle of a GAN is that it works in two halves. The first half of the GAN tries to replicate the input data, while the second half compares this to the original source. If they don’t match, the generated data is rejected and the generator tweaks its work and resubmits it.

Using AI to generate virtual worlds like video games has been done before. But Nvidia’s researchers introduced several new aspects, including a “memory module” that allowed the system to store an internal map of the game world. This leads to greater consistency in the game world, a key characteristic when recreating the mazes of Pac-Man. They also allow for the static elements of the game world (like the maze) to be separated from the dynamic ones (like the ghosts), which suits the company’s goal of using AI to generate new levels.

David Ha, an AI researcher at Google who’s worked on similar tasks, told The Verge that the research was “very interesting.” Earlier teams have tried to recreate game worlds using GANs, said Ha, “but from what I know, [this] is the first to demonstrate good results.” 

“All in all, a very exciting paper, and I look forward to see more developments using this approach,” said Ha.

Some elements of the process definitely need tweaking, though, and demonstrate the particular fragility of artificial intelligence when learning new tasks. Fidler told journalists that to recreate Pac-Man, GameGAN had to be trained on some 50,000 episodes. Getting that gameplay data from humans wasn’t feasible, so the team used an AI agent to generate the data. Unfortunately, the AI agent was so good at the game that it hardly ever died.  

“That made it hard for the AI trying to recreate the game to learn the concept of dying,” says Fidler. Instead, in early versions of the AI-generated Pac-Man, GameGAN tweaked the game so that ghosts never actually reached the title character but trail directly behind it like baby ducks following a parent. “It’s a funny effect of the way we trained it,” says Fidler.

After the COVID-19 pandemic is over and the economy reopens, many students will resume work on their careers. But for many young people, their priorities are going to shift. After seeing the pain and suffering caused by a single invisible enemy, some will naturally prioritize biomedical research over other easier and more lucrative trades, like law and finance. And some will choose to pursue possibly the most impactful area, which lies on the borderline of computer science and biomedicine - Artificial Intelligence (AI) for drug discovery.  


However, many women have historically seen both AI and drug discovery as predominantly male professions. And, according to a study we performed with a group of colleagues a few years back, women comprised only a small fraction of the top executives and board members in the Forbes 500 list of corporations.

However, news over the last two weeks has allowed the industry to take a breath of fresh air and has given renewed hope to the millions of young high-performing women entering the workforce. 

PROMOTED
Dr. Fei-Fei Li appointed to the board of Twitter after leaving Google 

Two years after Google removed its motto of “don’t be evil” from the corporate code of conduct and replaced it with “do the right thing”, “the right thing” started yielding lucrative military contracts, including the now famous Project Maven. One of the greatest AI scientists of our time, Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a computer science professor at Stanford and VP at Google, was one of the first to raise concerns about how this military engagement could impact the company. Dr. Li was the mastermind of the ImageNet project, which ignited a revolution in AI by demonstrating that deep learning systems can now outperform humans in image recognition. These ultra-fast and highly-accurate machine vision systems can now be widely used in military drone applications and have the potential to  be grossly misused. Dr. Li quit Google and joined Twitter last week as an independent board member. Twitter has a lot to gain from this celebrity appointment.

Many of the frequently-invited speakers to the top AI, data science, and drug discovery conferences know Dr. Najat Khan as one of the most well informed executives in AI for drug discovery and development. Previously, Janssen was comparatively slow with the adoption of AI joining a couple of university and industry AI consortiums and showcasing these as achievements. And to take data science efforts to the next level, Janssen’s new Global Head of Research and Development, Dr. Mathai Mammen, set up R&D Data Science as a top priority with a focus on Applied Data Science - the central figure in this is Dr. Najat Khan, who has already demonstrated a strong track record of delivering on measurable outcomes using Data Science tied to Janssen’s pipeline priorities. She has researched the field so deeply that the top management from other big pharma and AI companies started seeking her advice. She has a very unusual biography where she started her career as a Computational scientist, followed by a PhD in Organic Chemistry from an Ivy League school, almost a decade of leadership and strategy management consulting experience at the Boston Consulting Group across R&D and Commercial at top firms, deep knowledge of technology, and a track record to solve complex problems and deep experience leading teams with diverse skillsets. So when the company started executing on its Data Science strategy and vision, Najat was promoted to a newly-formed role of a Chief Data Science Officer (CDSO). In the pharma industry, the word “AI” is often associated with hype and the more conservative scientists in the trenches often use it as an excuse to resist change. My guess is that this was one of the reasons why “Data Science” was chosen for this critical organizational role and we should expect the other pharma companies to follow. Kudos to J&J.

Dr. Iya Khalil recruited by Novartis as the head of the new AI Center established in collaboration with Microsoft
When you meet Dr. Iya Khali at a conference for the first time, you will see a postdoctoral student or a young university professor in her 20s or early 30s. But when she walks on stage and starts presenting her case studies you will naturally start looking for a bio in a conference program. 
Founded in the year 2000 by Iya Khalil and Colin Hill out of Cornell University in New York,  Gene Network Sciences (GNS) was focusing on the applications of computational biology to drug discovery.  In 2010 it formed a subsidiary, GNS Healthcare to focus on the applications of data science in the healthcare industry. The company built a strong brand and presence in multiple industries driven by Dr. Khalil’s relentless pursuit of innovative solutions that solve practical problems. In fact, GNS Healthcare was doing so well that the move to a new role with a big pharma company caught many industry insiders by surprise. 
In 2017 Novartis surprised the market by appointing then 41-year-old Dr. Vasanth (Vas) Narasimhan as the CEO of the company. His major strategic directive - digital transformation. In October 2019 this strategy culminated in a partnership between Novartis and Microsoft intended to transform medicine with artificial intelligence. While Novartis is clearly one of the leaders in innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, Microsoft is not as well-known for pioneering innovative work in AI in drug discovery or drug development. But it also managed to partner with AstraZeneca and added the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, Emma Walmsley, to its board of directors. On a side note, the Chief Digital & Technology Officer (CDTO) of GSK is also a brilliant female executive, Karenann Terrell.  
The partnership between Microsoft and Novartis resulted in the formation of an AI Innovation Lab at Novartis intended to develop AI for end-to-end drug discovery and development across the entire organization. The success of this lab technically defines the success of the entire organization in its AI efforts. It had to be a sure bet and Novartis started looking for an AI expert with an impeccable track record of delivering results.  Many industry insiders held their breath and debated who is it going to be and who could fill this highly-visible and demanding role. Some theorized that either Novartis or Microsoft would acquire an existing platform and team to accelerate. However, to everyone’s surprise, and cheers, Novartis managed to miraculously lure Dr. Iya Khalil to take the driver’s seat. The industry insiders can now rest easy. The lab is in good hands. Congratulations to Novartis on grabbing one of the high-power female AI executives from a top startup. 
BioPhamaTrend published a report on 11 Inspiring women in AI for drug discovery
A new industry publication and analytical house, BiopharmaTrend, compiled a list of female scientists leading the way in AI-powered drug discovery and development. The list is structured by the publication record and impact. I know many of these women personally and some of them are the original inventors of technologies that are transforming the way we think about drug discovery. While I know over half of these leaders personally, I was also very happy to see Dr. Elena Tutubalina, one of the rising stars in deep learning for natural language processing (NLP) on this list. 
A Spring for Women in AI 
To conclude, while there is still a long way to go before we see equal numbers of women in AI for healthcare, the glass ceiling is breaking and I cannot think of a better career choice for a young woman. From personal experience, I may add that just a week ago I got to take part in the AI and longevity group meetings in our organization where I was the only male. AI-powered drug discovery is likely to be the most impactful field of research in the 21st century, and it would be great to see it being led by a group of ambitious women. The two fields that were previously dominated by males are converging and attracting many great female leaders. The glass ceilings are breaking, and soon cease to exist.

 Deepfake is a new media technology wherein a person simply takes existing text, picture, video, or audio and then manipulates, i.e., ‘fakes’ it to look like someone else using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network (NN) technology After its first appearance a few years back, deepfake technology has evolved from an innocuous tech geek’s chicanery to a malicious slandering weapon. In this article, we’ll see what exactly this dreaded deepfake tech is, how it works, what different forms it comes in, and how we can detect or bust a deepfake. Recommended Video for you:PlayWhat Is An AI Camera? What Makes It So Powerful?  What Is Deepfake? Deepfake is one of the buzzwords in media technology wherein a person simply takes existing text, picture, video, or audio and then manipulates, i.e., ‘fakes’ it to look like someone else using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network (NN) technology. Want to put abusive words in the mouth of your nemesis? Or swap the movie protagonist with your favorite Hollywood superstar? Or do you just want to make yourself dance like Michael Jackson? Then deepfake is what you need! Deepfake content is growing exponentially. Unfortunately, deepfake tech has already been repeatedly used to gain political mileage, to tarnish the image of a rival, or to commit financial fraud. Let’s now look into the three main types of deepfakes and explore the data science that allows them to work. We’ll also focus on deepfake detection technologies that researchers and security consultants are working on to curb the malicious use of deepfakes.  Also Read: How Does FaceApp Work?Deepfake Text In the early days of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), it was posited that it would be a challenge for a machine to do a creative activity like painting or writing. Fast-forward to 2021; with the powerful language models and libraries that have been built over the years by the incremental work of researchers and data science professionals, top-rated AI-generated prose can now write with humanlike pith and coherence. With the powerful language models and libraries, AI-powered software tools can now compose prose with humanlike pith and coherence. (Photo Credit : kung_tom/Shutterstock) GPT-2 Take, for example, GPT-2—the latest breed of the text-generation system released by research lab OpenAI from Silicon Valley. This tech has impressed both the layman and domain experts with its ability to churn out coherent text with minimal prompts. OpenAI engineers used over 8 million textual documents that were scrapped (method of relevant data extraction from webpages) and combined with a billion parameters for modeling and training of GPT-2 AI. The essence of deepfake and other such technologies like deeplearning, which leverage artificial technologies, lies in training the software to think and adapt itself using past data it is fed through data sets. You can read more about artificial intelligence in this article. Using GPT-2, you can just punch in the headline and the deepfake text algorithm will generate a fictitious news story around that headline. Or simply supply it a first line of a poem and it will return the whole verse. Many media houses are using deepfake algorithms coupled with web scrapping to generate stories or blogs that are written by the software themselves. Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counter-terrorism (CTEC) warns that tools like GPT-2 can be misused to propagate racial supremacy or disseminate radical messages by extremist organizations. by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHappy in ShapeFarmer Finds Missing Cow After 8 Months - Watch What Happend To The Cow!Happy in ShapeUndoVoIPGoodbye Cell Phone, Hello VoIP (Find Out Why Everyone Is Switching to VoIP)many Americans still don't know about these new cell phone and landline alternativesVoIPLearn MoreUndoDeepfakes On Social Media In tandem with writing stories or blogs, deepfake technology can also be leveraged to create a fake online profile that would be hard for a normal user to discern. For example, a Bloomberg (non-existing) journalist with the name Maisy Kinsley on social networking sites like LinkedIn and Twitter was plausibly a deepfake. Her profile picture appeared strange, perhaps computer generated. The profile was probably created for financial benefit, as the profile of Maisy Kinsley repeatedly tried to connect with short-sellers of Tesla stock on social media. Short-sellers are people who are bearish on the stock market and they short, i.e, sell the stock with the conviction that the stock price will fall and then buy stock at a lower price, effectively generating a handsome profit. Another profile with the name Katie Jones, which supposedly mentioned working at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was found to be a deepfake created with the mala fide intention of spying. Detecting Textual Deepfakes Researchers from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence have developed a software tool called Grover to detect synthetic content floating online. Researchers claim that this software is able to detect deepfake-written essays 92% of the time. Grover works on a test set compiled from Common Crawl, an open-source web archive and crawler. Similarly, a team of scientists from Harvard and the MIT-IBM Watson laboratory have come together to design Giant Language Model Test Room, a web tool that seeks to discern whether the text inputted is generated by AI.  Also Read: Bot Or Not: How To Tell A Bot From A HumanDeepfake Video Making fake photos and videos is the main arsenal of deepfakes. It is the most used form of deepfake, given that we are living in the ubiquitous world of social media, wherein pictures and videos elucidate events and stories better than plain text. Modern video-generating AI is more capable, and perhaps more dangerous, than its natural language counterpart. Seoul-based tech company Hyperconnect recently developed a tool called MarioNETte that can generate deepfake videos of historical figures, celebrities, and politicians. This is done through facial reenactment by another person, whose facial expressions are then superimposed on the targeted personality whose deepfake is to be created.  How Deepfake Video Is Produced? This video trickery employs a technique called generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is a part of a machine learning branch called neural networks. These networks are designed to emulate the neuronal processes of the human brain. Programmers can train neural networks to recognize or manipulate a specific task. In GAN used for deepfake generation, two neural networks are pitted against each other to generate a realistic output. The purpose of doing so is to ensure that the deepfakes are created to look as real as possible. The essence of GAN lies in the rivalry between the two neural networks. In GAN, the picture forger and the forgery detector repeatedly attempt to outsmart one another. Both the neural networks are trained using the same data set. The first net is called the generator, whose job it is to generate a forged image using noise vectors (a list of random numbers) that look as realistic as possible. The second net, called the discriminator, determines the veracity of the generated images. It compares the forged image generated by the generator with the genuine images in the data set to determine which images are real and which are fake. On the basis of those results, the generator varies the parameter for generating images. This cycle goes on until the discriminator fails to ascertain that a generated image is bogus, which is then used in the final output. This is why deepfakes look so eerily real. Demonstration of generative adversarial network (GAN) (Photo Credit : ShadeDesign/ Shutterstock) Detecting Deepfake Videos Forensic experts across the globe are toiling hard to come up with ways and tools to identify deepfakes, as they are becoming more and more convincing every day. For example, consider this deepfake demonstration video of Obama released by Buzzfeed in 2018, which stupefied viewers across the globe. You can check it out here: Play As machine-learning tools are reaching the masses, it has become much easier to create convincing fake videos that could be used to disseminate propaganda-driven news or to simply harass a targeted individual. The US Defense Department (DARPA) has released a tool for detecting deepfakes called Media Forensics. Originally, the program was developed to automate existing forensic tools, but with the rise of deepfakes, they have used AI to counter AI-driven deepfakes. Let’s see how it works. The resultant video generated using deepfake technically has discernible differences in the way the video’s metadata is distributed, as compared to the original one. These differences are referred to as glimpses in matrix, which is what DARPA’s deepfake detection tool tries to leverage when detecting deepfake media. Siwei Lyu, professor from the computer science department at the State University of New York, has noted that faces created using deepfake technology seldom blink. Even if they do, it seems unnatural. He posits that this is because most of the deepfake-driven videos are trained using still images. Still, photographs of a person are generally taken when their eyes are open. Besides eye blinking, other data points on facial movements, such as when they raise upper lip while conversing, how they shake their heads etc. can also provide clues as to whether the streamed video is fake.  Deepfake Audio The power of artificial intelligence and neural networks isn’t just limited to text, pictures, and video. They can clone a person’s voice with the same ease. All that is required is a data set of the audio recording of a person whose voice needs to be emulated. Deepfake algorithms will learn from that data set and becomes empowered to recreate the prosody of a targeted person’s speech. Commercial software is being released in the market like Lyrebird and Deep Voice, wherein you need to speak only a few sentences before the AI has grown accustomed to your voice and intonation. As you feed in more audio of yourself, this software becomes powerful enough to clone your voice. After feeding in the dataset of your own audio samples, you can just give a sentence or a paragraph and this deepfake software will narrate the text in your voice! Detecting Deepfake Audio Right now, there are not many dedicated deepfake audio tools available, but developers and cybersecurity companies are working in this domain to come up with better protective solutions in this regard. For example, last year, developers at tech startup Resemble developed an open-source tool called Resemblyzer for the detection of deepfake audio clips. Resemblyzer uses advanced machine-learning algorithms for deriving computation representations of voice samples to predict whether they are real or fake. Whenever a user submits an audio file for evaluation, it generates a mathematical representation summarizing the unique characteristics of the submitted voice sample. Through this conversion, it becomes possible for the machine to detect whether the voice is real or artificially produced by deepfake tools.  Also Read: What Is Artificial Intelligence And How Is It Powering Our Lives?The Road Ahead With Deepfakes An investigation done by Deeptrace labs last year found that over 14,000 deepfake videos are lurking online. They have also noted a jump of 84% in their production in a span of just seven months. Interestingly, more than 90% of deepfake videos are pornographic material, wherein famous women are face-swapped in porn. As deepfake is getting serious traction, it is posing a serious problem of intruding not just on the privacy, but also the dignity of individuals. Ironically, to counter AI-powered deepfakes, artificial intelligence itself is being used. Although a ‘good’ AI is helping to identify deepfakes, this detection system relies highly upon the dataset it consumes for training. This means they can work well to detect deepfake videos of celebrities, as a vast amount of data is available about them. But to detect the deepfake of a person who has a low profile would be challenging for such detection systems. Social media tech giants are working on deepfake detection systems as well. Facebook recently announced that it is working on an automated system to identify deepfake content on its platform and weed it out. On similar lines, Twitter proposed flagging deepfakes and eliminating them if they’re found to be provocative. Although we acknowledge and appreciate efforts by these tech companies, only time will tell how successful they are at keeping malicious deepfakes at bay!

H The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic seems to generally have dispelled a few hardened organisational “myths” (for example, large scale work-from-home is not possible) and forced companies to relook at how they work and interact with key stakeholders. Companies, and subsequently employees have been compelled to innovate-on-the-go (for example, quickly shipping large screen monitors and printers to the home of employees before lockdown closed the markets). Perhaps, it would not be an exaggeration to say that even the best drafted Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) for most companies were stretched to the limit and yet struggled to cope with the rapid and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. From the evidence available thus far, it seems apparent that the world will have to learn to adapt swiftly and significantly to a “new normal” of work to deal with the current (and potential future) phases of Covid-19. Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a very important role in defining this “new normal” of work in the Covid-19 (and post-Covid-19) world. More specifically, automation and AI can help companies infuse three key attributes of agility/flexibility, responsiveness, and frugality, enabling companies to better adapt to the fast changing situations in the times of Covid-19. Agility/flexibility: Most organisations in the pre-Covid-19 world were “human intensive,” wherein most work (especially in the non-manufacturing sectors) was performed by humans. A fundamental challenge with “human intensive” organisations is swift scalability based on the demands that the dynamic environment Covid-19 presents. For instance, when most governments announced policies related to mortgage payment deferment to help citizens better cope with Covid-19-related economic challenges, several banks and financial institutions had to scamper for additional human resources to process the sudden spike in these additional (and probably one-time and time-sensitive) transactions. This is where Automation and AI can help organisations significantly. Both Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and AI bots are typically hosted on servers and hence, do not need to change work locations as humans were required to. They can also be replicated (scaled up or down) almost on demand. The evidence in the marketplace suggests that those banks who had employed automation to deal with these demand fluctuations in work generally fared much better than those who relied primarily on humans working remotely to handle the additional workload. Also Read: Twitter says employees can work from home forever Responsiveness: Covid-19-induced lockdowns threw many well-defined and widely-followed processes off gear across companies. For instance, in several companies, IT and HR support were typically located in defined physical spaces or in call centres. However, as most employees began to work remotely, it became difficult for them to get answers on important IT and HR-related questions. Automation and AI can help manage these interactions efficiently and also enhance the stakeholder experience. For example, certain companies leveraged technologies such as chatbots to answer employee queries quickly, effectively, and remotely. This helped reduce employee anxiety and improve productivity. The same interaction technology can be leveraged to enhance interaction experience with other important stakeholders such as customers and vendors. Another example is that of a global automobile player, which recently launched its online sales, 360 degree digital services, and a contactless-service experience in the first week of April. They leveraged robotics, AI, and ML technologies to bring continuity to their operations and minimise disruptions for their customers. Also Read: Govt extends relaxed ‘work from home’ norms till July 31 for IT firms, BPOs Frugality: Covid-19 has significantly impacted the top line of most companies. Hence, it is crucial that companies focus on their bottom line to actively manage profitability. Automation and AI can help companies effectively manage and optimise costs. For example, technologies such as RPA, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can automate 25–50 per cent of processes. This will help companies achieve better outcomes at lower costs and also free up human time for higher value work (e.g., better serving high-value customers, responding faster to regulatory requirements or government directives). Also Read: Govt staff may get work from home option for 15 days a year Cyborg chess has demonstrated that when human and machine capabilities come together, they produce better results than both “human only” and “machine only” capabilities. As companies across the world adapt to new ways of working, automation and AI can create a HumBot (human + robot) workforce to effectively combine the human capability of superior thinking with the fast-execution capability of robots. Companies that successfully combine human and machine capabilities will not only survive the challenging conditions but will likely come out with newer, better, and stronger capabilities. These enhanced capabilities will enable organisations to “rewrite the rules of the game” in their industries and occupy a place of sustainable prominence in the revamped competitive landscape of the current and post-Covid-19 world.

President Trump called for a 2-year doubling of non-defense AI R&amp;D in his fiscal year (FY) 2021 budget proposal, and in 2019 the Administration updated its AI R&amp;D strategic plan, developed the first progress report describing the impact of Federal R&amp;D investments, and published the first-ever reporting of government-wide non-defense AI R&amp;D spending..Unleash AI resources.The United States is adamant on enhancing access to high-quality Federal data, models, and computing resources to increase their value for AI R&amp;D, while maintaining and extending safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality protections. The American AI Initiative called on Federal agencies to identify new opportunities to increase access to and use of Federal data and models. In 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget established the Federal Data Strategy as a framework for operational principles and best practices around how Federal agencies use and manage data..Remove barriers to AI innovation.The United States is making efforts in reducing barriers to the safe development, testing, deployment, and adoption of AI technologies by providing guidance for the governance of AI consistent with our Nation's values and by driving the development of appropriate AI technical standards. As part of the American AI Initiative, The White House published for comment the proposed United States AI Regulatory Principles, the first AI regulatory policy that advances innovation underpinned by American values and good regulatory practices. In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the first-ever strategy for Federal engagement in the development of AI technical standards..Train an AI-ready workforce.The United States is empowering current and future generations of American workers through apprenticeships; skills programs; and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with an emphasis on computer science, to ensure that American workers, including Federal workers, are capable of taking full advantage of the opportunities of AI. President Trump directed all Federal agencies to prioritize AI-related AMERICAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVE: YEAR ONE ANNUAL REPORT – apprenticeship and job training programs and opportunities. In addition to its R&amp;D focus, the National Science Foundation's new National AI Research Institutes program will also contribute to workforce development, particularly of AI researchers..Promote an international environment supportive of American AI innovation.The United States is working on engaging internationally to promote a global environment that supports American AI research and innovation and opens markets for American AI industries while also protecting our technological advantage in AI. Last year, the United States led historic efforts at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop the first international consensus agreements on fundamental principles for the stewardship of trustworthy AI. The United States also worked with its international partners in the G7 and G20 to adopt similar AI principles..Embrace trustworthy AI for government services and missions.The United States is readily embracing technology such as artificial intelligence to improve the provision and efficiency of government services to the American people and ensure its application shows due respect for our Nation's values, including privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The General Services Administration established an AI Center of Excellence to enable Federal agencies to determine best practices for incorporating AI into their organizations..America's strong innovation ecosystem, fueled by strategic Federal investments, visionary scientists and entrepreneurs, and renowned research institutions, has propelled United States global leadership in AI. However, continued leadership is not predetermined. Maintaining America's preeminent role in AI can only be realized by continually building upon our progress and pursuing a strategic, forwardlooking approach in partnership with industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and other non-Federal entities..Global leadership in AI matters. With the United States in the lead — together with like-minded allies — we will shape the trajectory of AI development for the good of the American people — enriching our lives, promoting innovation, fostering trust and understanding, and ensuring our national defense and security..Importance of partnerships to maintaining United States leadership in AI .In all areas of strategic emphasis, partnerships and collaboration with academia, industry, nonprofit organizations, civil society, other non-Federal entities, and international partners and allies are of growing importance. Concurrent advances across government, universities, and industry mutually reinforce an innovative, vibrant American AI sector. Public-private partnerships enable strategic leveraging of resources, including facilities, datasets, and expertise. These partnerships also accelerate the transition of research innovations to practice, by leveraging industry expertise to turn open and published research results into viable products and services in the marketplace for economic growth..In the education and workforce area, partnerships are enhancing education and training for next-generation researchers, technicians, and workers, so that all can contribute to the 21st century economy. Partnerships with nonprofit organizations and civil society can help address important societal challenges arising from technological developments. The Nation also benefits from relationships between Federal agencies and international partners who work together to address key challenges. AI partnerships with allies and partners represent one of our sources of strategic competitive advantage..US Global Leadership in AI in Numbers.According to Analytics Insight,.Total number of Open AI Jobs in 2020: 743,682.Average Salary of AI Professionals in 2020: US$114,061 per annum.AI Market Revenue in 2020: US$25.9 billion.Moreover, the AI market in North American region with market share of 47%, is expected to grow from US$20.0 billion in 2019 to US$71.9 billion in 2023 with a CAGR of 29.2% during the forecast period of 2019-2023.
