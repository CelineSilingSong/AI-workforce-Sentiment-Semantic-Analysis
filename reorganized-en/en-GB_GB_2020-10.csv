Can Artificial Intelligence Help Students Work Better Together? According to Research, the Answer is Yes.
WPI computer scientist looks at better collaboration between AI and humans in today’s classrooms.







October 19, 2020



WPI assistant professor of computer science Jacob Whitehill is collaborating with colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder to explore how artificially intelligent (AI) teaching agents might help encourage more meaningful collaboration among students in school classrooms.

As part of a five-year, $20 million grant awarded by the National Science Foundation to CU Boulder, Whitehilll and colleagues at nine other institutions will study how to build AI agents that interact with students in small-group collaborative problem-solving settings and thereby foster more enriching learning experiences for students.
“There is so much evidence that students learn best when they learn actively and collaborate with each other in real time,” says Whitehill, who specializes in AI and machine learning. “But that’s not always easy for teachers to achieve, whether the collaboration is happening in a physical classroom or during remote learning.”
Under the grant, of which WPI will receive almost $612,000, Whitehill and his colleagues will work with two public school districts in Colorado, building and testing different forms of “AI Partners” in the classroom—ranging from a simple iPad with a camera and microphone, to animated interactive avatars that perceive and understand students’ language, gestures, facial expressions. The role of the AI Partner will vary depending on the situation: In some settings, the Partner might play the role of another “student” who is learning the curriculum alongside the human students. In other settings, the Partner might be a coach who keeps the students on-topic and makes sure everyone is contributing meaningfully to the conversation.
“The AI Partner might, for example, ask a particular student to share their ideas, particularly if they had been quiet for most of the time,” Whitehill says.
The role of Whitehill’s team will be to use multi-modal machine learning to develop social signal processing algorithms to determine who is talking when, and to estimate the emotion of each person.










WPI professor Jacob Whitehill’s research with CU Boulder stems from his earlier work toward building an Automatic Classroom Observation Recognition neural Network (ACORN) , which analyzes videos of school classrooms and estimates the level of “emotional support” exhibited by students and teachers. ACORN can provide researchers and teachers with a new “lens” with which to observe classrooms objectively, potentially lowering the costs of teacher training.
Many WPI graduate and undergraduate students have helped advance this research since its early stages, Whitehill says, particularly through machine learning research in the areas of emotion recognition, speaker identification, and human behavior recognition.












Once the AI Partners are integrated in these classrooms, Whitehill and his team will be able to collect data on how students interact with them, and then iteratively make them more intelligent and effective. Initially, the AI Partner might be controlled by a human teacher in a backroom (“Wizard of Oz”-style interaction), but over time, it can learn from its human controller what to do when and thereby become more autonomous. Whitehill and his team anticipate that the particular form that the Partner takes is likely also important.
“Students might find an embodied robot creepy, but they might like interacting with an animated avatar on a touchscreen,” he says.
This project represents a shift in how researchers envision AI in the classroom. While earlier work in this field sought to fully automate the teaching process, which Whitehill considers to be infeasible, this project is about human-AI teaming, and how humans and teachers possess complementary abilities. AI Partners can help to magnify teachers’ existing strengths by increasing the number of students in the classroom who receive the real-time feedback they need for optimal learning.
Whitehill also says that this research will be greatly informative even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many school districts across the country are participating in remote learning. In fact, he says testing agent-student interactions over platforms like Zoom have certain advantages over in-person interactions.
“With Zoom, each student and teacher in the classroom is cleanly separated from each other, and all their audiovisual inputs are channeled through a common software interface. This makes it much easier to analyze their speech, gestures, language, and interactions with each other,” Whitehill says. “In contrast, in normal, in-person classrooms, the interactions are much messier,” since students often sit in all kinds of different positions, might be touching their faces, and work in a noisy environment, which makes it more challenging for the Partner to observe and analyze.
By the end of this research, Whitehill says he hopes to find practical teaching and coaching strategies that AI Partners can execute that work well with students. “It’s not clear at all that the way humans teach would work well for a computer, robot, or avatar,” he says.
While the computational challenges of the project—signal processing in extremely noisy and cluttered settings, real-time control in an uncertain environment, and human-computer interaction for a novel setting—are formidable, Whitehill says the potential rewards make it worth the effort.
“The exciting thing about this project is that we get to completely rethink the role of AI in the classroom,” he says. “My hope is that, through next-generation educational AI, we will be able to stimulate deeper critical thinking and collaboration among students to help them learn better and achieve more.”

If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren't alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km2 area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa. 
""We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era,"" asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of the study's scientific article, now published in Nature.
The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning -- an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover,  a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted. 
The role of trees in the global carbon budget
 New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget: 
""Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle,"" explains Martin Brandt.
Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.       
""Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients,"" explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.
Technology with a high potential
 The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.
The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve. 
""This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. We are motivated to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence,"" says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.
The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas. ###
FACTS:
 The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m2. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.
  Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. 
  The scientific article for this study is published in the renowned journal Nature. 
  The research was carried out by researchers from the University of Copenhagen; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, USA; HCI Group, University of Bremen, Germany; Université Paul Sabatier, France; Pastoralisme Conseil, France; Centre de Suivi Ecologique, Senegal; Geosciences Environnement Toulouse (GET), France; Ecole Normale Supérieure, France; Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

Currently, Southern has over 452 thousand subscribers on YouTube and “Lovesick” a song from the album was listened and viewed by more than 45,000 viewers. But since then, the application of AI in this field has both got more sophisticated and branched out further. Open AI has created MuseNet, as the company explains, “a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the same general-purpose unsupervised technology as GPT-2, a large-scale transformer model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or text.”On the other hand, as GeekWire, among others, reports, Dr. Mick Grierson, computer scientist and musician from Goldsmiths, University of London was recently commissioned by the Italian car manufacturer Fiat to produce a list of 50 most iconic pop songs using algorithms. His analytical software was used to “determine what makes the songs noteworthy, including key, the number of beats per minute, chord variety, lyrical content, timbral variety, and sonic variance.”According to his results, the song that had the best cocktail of the set parameters was Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” ahead of U2’s “One” and John Lennon’s “Imagine”. Nirvana’s song was then used by FIAT to promote its new FIAT 500 model. Grierson explained that the algorithms showed that, ‘the sounds these songs use and the way they are combined is highly unique in each case.’Another application was prepared by musicnn library, which as explained, uses deep convolutional neural networks to automatically tag songs. The models “that are included achieve the best scores in public evaluation benchmarks.” music (as in musician) and its best models have been released as an open-source library. The project has been developed by the Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, located in Barcelona, Spain.In his analysis of the application, Jordi Pons used musicnn to analyze and tag another iconic song, Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He noticed that the singing voice of Freddie Mercury was tagged as a female voice, while its other predictions were quite accurate. Making musicnn available as open-source makes it possible to further refine the tagging process.

Expanding AI’s Impact With Organizational Learning









October 20, 2020


by: Sam Ransbotham, Shervin Khodabandeh, David Kiron, François Candelon, Michael Chu, and Burt LaFountain


Most companies developing AI capabilities have yet to gain significant financial benefits from their efforts. Only when organizations add the ability to learn with AI do significant benefits become likely.















Only 10% of companies obtain significant financial benefits from artificial intelligence technologies. Why so few?
Our research shows that these companies intentionally change processes, broadly and deeply, to facilitate organizational learning with AI. Better organizational learning enables them to act precisely when sensing opportunity and to adapt quickly when conditions change. Their strategic focus is organizational learning, not just machine learning.
Organizational learning with AI is demanding. It requires humans and machines to not only work together but also learn from each other — over time, in the right way, and in the appropriate contexts. This cycle of mutual learning makes humans and machines smarter, more relevant, and more effective. Mutual learning between human and machine is essential to success with AI. But it’s difficult to achieve at scale.

The research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an MIT Sloan Management Review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by Boston Consulting Group.

Our research — based on a global survey of more than 3,000 managers, as well as interviews with executives and scholars — confirms that a majority of companies are developing AI capabilities but have yet to gain significant financial benefits from their efforts. More than half of all respondents affirm that their companies are piloting or deploying AI (57%), have an AI strategy (59%), and understand how AI can generate business value (70%). These numbers reflect statistically significant increases in adoption, strategy development, and understanding from four years ago. What’s more, a growing number of companies recognize a business imperative to improve their AI competencies. Despite these trends, just 1 in 10 companies generates significant financial benefits with AI.
We analyzed responses to over 100 survey questions to better understand what really enables companies to generate significant financial benefits with AI. We found that getting the basics right — like having the right data, technology, and talent, organized around a corporate strategy — is far from sufficient. Only 20% of companies achieve significant financial benefits with these fundamentals alone. Getting the basics right and building AI solutions that the business wants and can use improve the odds of obtaining significant financial benefits, but to just 39%.
Our key finding: Only when organizations add the ability to learn with AI do significant benefits become likely.

Our survey results indicate that smaller businesses — in contrast with larger organizations — capture most of their AI-related benefits from learning with the most autonomous mode (AI decides and implements). One reason may be that smaller companies typically have less organizational complexity, which can make it easier to realize significant financial benefits from automation than at larger companies.

Only 11% of companies surveyed say they get any financial benefits from AI implementation. What’s holding the others back? 
When the pandemic accelerated organizations’ digital transformation, the first technology that gained higher acceptance was artificial intelligence (AI). Companies rushed to understand how it works and what aspects of their business and people processes can be adapted to include AI. The overall belief is that it will raise productivity and performance as well.
A new studyOpens a new window  by MIT Sloan and BCG titled Expanding AI’s Impact With Organizational Learning shares a crucial finding. Only 11% of companies are getting significant ROI from AI technologies. The big difference between these companies and those who don’t get financial returns is that the former focus on organizational learning, not just machine learning. They are open to changing their processes to enable higher levels of learning.
Responses of 3,000 executives to 100 survey questions were analyzed to find that identifying, investing in, and implementing AI is not enough to make it a valuable game-changer in organizational performance. Employees and leaders need to learn how to learn from AI and transfer their own learning back to AI. The cycle of learning must be continuous and collective for it to make a significant difference.
When AI Use Results in Financial Benefits
As per the study, some organizations can double their opportunities to have high financial benefits from AI with one step – allowing humans and AI to learn from each other mutually.
The roles of machines and humans are not defined. They are fluid and change based on the situation. Strategy is also rooted in digital data as well as human experience as per the report.
Leaders follow five models of AI implementation, based on the report findings, with two models being most successful:

AI recommends and humans implement
AI generates insights and humans use them in the decision-making process

While companies are at the threshold of adapting to AI’s role, a structured process must be established for humans to learn how AI works and when human intervention is required to add value. This understanding of how human and machine learning can be facilitated will drive the success of any AI solution.

Bringing Human and Machine Learning Together
The lines between human learning and machine learning are blurring. But therein lies the reason for its importance. Each model has its pros and cons, but it is crucial to understand the two models in which leaders have seen more success.
AI the recommender: AI recommends, human decides
It is evident that machines are equipped with enough data and past insights for it to offer recommendations. This indicates that it can integrate multiple facets needed for problem-solving. But when companies use this approach, the final decision-making is left to humans. Human beings can gauge the steps that AI took to arrive at the recommendation and add their own assumptions or business context to evaluate whether that recommendation is implementable.
AI the illuminator: AI generates insights, humans base decisions on them
In this model, the AI does the entire thinking through in terms of data and what it is pointing toward. It does not make recommendations, but it does give insights from the data that can enable humans to arrive at a logical solution. The insights form the basis of further decision-making, which can result in multiple options for problem-solving as against weighing the pros and cons of a specific recommendation.

Companies are in the nascent stages of their understanding of AI and its application. Some believe that it will result in job loss. But when applied in the right context, AI can result in job elevation, evolution, and redesign.

AI conferences have a flawed review process

AI conferences are highly biased in favor of top-tier academic institutions, reputable researchers, and male contributors
This article is part of our reviews of AI research papers, a series of posts that explore the latest findings in artificial intelligence.
With the past decade seeing renewed interest in artificial intelligence, research and publication in the field has grown immensely. And while publishing an AI paper online is not very difficult, it is acceptance and presentation at conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, and ICML that give needed credit and exposure to the work done by researchers.
Organizers of AI conferences face the mounting challenge of having many more submissions than they have space for. As a result, a small percentage of submitted papers make it to mainstream AI conferences.
The question is, are AI conferences choosing the best research for presentation? A new paper published on OpenReview and submitted to ICLR 2021 investigates the quality of the AI conference review process. Titled “An Open Review of OpenReview,” the document reveals some of the flaws of the review process for machine learning conferences, including inconsistent scoring, institutional bias, and lower acceptance rates for female researchers.

The AI conference review process
The paper focuses on the ICLR review process, though other conferences use similar methodologies. Each AI paper submitted to the conference goes through several steps before being accepted or rejected. The process involves, reviewers, area chairs, and program chairs.
Area chairs are experts that have experience in specific domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. They do not review individual papers but control the process. They guide reviewers, moderate discussions, and make recommendations based on the feedback they get from authors and reviewers.
Reviewers are the people who work on individual papers. Each paper is assigned to several reviewers, who read it in full and verify the code and data that comes with the paper to make sure the findings are valid and reproducible. They correspond with the author and the area chairs to clarify questions that need to be answered, and finally, they give their final recommendations on whether a paper should be accepted or rejected.
Program chairs are senior scientists and experts that make high-level decisions, including the final decision on which papers get rejected or accepted. They can also intervene in the review process if needed.
The ICLR review process (source: ICRL website)
Experts can apply to become reviewers and area chairs at ICLR, but most are invited by the organizers.
The entire process is registered on the OpenReview platform, where everyone can see the feedback given by reviewers, authors, area chairs, and program chairs. OpenReview also accepts public comments from people who are not involved in the review process.
Example of paper rejected on OpenReview
Investigating the AI research paper review process
The authors of the paper, who remain anonymous as of this writing, were keen on answering the question: Do conference reviews consistently identify high-quality work? Or has review degenerated into censorship?
To make an informed decision, they used public information registered in OpenReview, including titles, abstracts, authors lists, emails, scores, and reviews for more than 5,000 papers submitted to ICLR conferences from 2017 to 2020. The authors obtained additional information about withdrawn papers after communicating with the administrators of OpenReview.
The researchers used different methods to find additional information, such as the impact of papers and authors on other AI research work. They also analyzed the paper data to determine the topic of each paper.
Is the review process reproducible?
The first question the researchers answered was whether there was any amount of randomness involved in the acceptance or rejection of AI research papers. This means that, for instance, if an accepted paper went through the review process again, would it be accepted again?
To perform this test, the researchers created a regression model from paper scores and the final decision made by the area chairs. Then they simulated the process by generating scores the fit the threshold and checked to see how many times the model reproduced the same decision on the paper. They ran the simulation separately for the papers submitted to each year, and the results were disappointing.
“We observe a downward trend in reproducibility, with scores decreasing from 75% in 2017, to 70% in 2018 and 2019, to 66% in 2020,” the authors write.
Even when they increased the number of reviewers in their simulation, the gains were not significant. “While reproducibility scores increase with more reviewers, gains are marginal; increasing the number of reviewers from 2 to 5 boosts reproducibility by just 3%,” the authors write. “As more reviewers are added, the high level of disagreement among area chairs remains constant, while the standard error in mean scores falls slowly. The result is paltry gains in reproducibility.”
Adding to the number of reviewers of AI research papers does not result in significant gains.
To improve the process, the authors recommend to use a small number of reviewers and ad ad-hoc reviewers where first-round reviews are uninformative.
What is the impact of accepted AI research?
Papers accepted at major AI conferences should help advance future artificial intelligence research. In their work, the authors of the OpenReview paper analyzed the impact of both accepted and rejected AI research papers. “We measure impact using citation rate, calculated by dividing citation count by the number of days since the paper was first published online,” they write.
In other words, impactful papers should receive more citations from other AI researchers. Naturally, papers accepted and presented at AI conferences gain more exposure and by extension more citations than rejected work. But when comparing accepted papers among themselves, the researchers found a very small correlation between citation and review scores.
Scatterplot shows citation and impact of papers are very marginally correlated.
“Our dataset shows that reproducibility scores, correlations with impact, and reviewer agreement have all gone down over the years,” the authors write.
Institution and reputation bias in the AI review process
The authors of the paper were also interested in knowing whether there was a preference for AI research done at prestigious academic institutions or tech companies. “We found that 85% of papers across all years (87% in 2020) had at least one academic author,” the authors write, adding that this finding per se does not imply bias toward and can fairly be related to the quality of research done at these institutions.
To further investigate, they “controlled for paper score,” which means they verified whether area chairs showed any bias when deciding on papers that had similar scores.
“We found that, even after controlling for reviewer scores, being a top ten institution leads to a boost in the likelihood of getting accepted,” the authors write. This bias remained even when the researcher only considered the affiliation of the last author of the AI papers (last authors are usually the senior person who oversees the research or heads the lab where the research takes place).
There was a significant preference for Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Cornell universities, the authors found. Another interesting point that confirms this finding is that author identity visibility improves its review score. The authors of an AI paper submitted to OpenReview remain anonymous to reviewers while it is going through the review process. But at the same time, the researchers can publish their paper in other mediums, such as the arXiv preprint server. The researchers found that AI papers appearing on arXiv before the review process tended to do better, especially if the researchers were associated with CMU, MIT, or Cornell.
Reviewers of AI conferences prefer to accept papers submitted from researchers associated with top-tier universities
The authors of the OpenReview analysis also found that, all things equal, area chairs generally preferred submissions authored by highly reputed individuals.
Interestingly, their research did not find a significant bias toward large tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, which house reputable AI researchers. At first glance, this is a positive finding, because big tech already has a vast influence over commercial AI and, by extension, on AI research.
But as other authors have pointed out, the same academic institutions that are very well represented at AI conferences serve as talent pools for big tech companies and receive much of their funding from those same organizations. So this just creates a feedback loop of a narrow group of people promoting each other’s work and hiring each other at the expense of others.
Also concerning is the under-representation of women in AI conferences. The gender gap is a well-known problem in the AI community (and the tech community in general), and it carries over to the paper review process. “We observe a gender gap in the review process, with women first authors achieving a lower acceptance rate than men (23.5% vs 27.1%),” the authors of the OpenReview analysis observe in their paper.
The researchers add that while in 2019, women made up 23.2 percent of all computer science PhD students, only 10.6 percent of publications at ICLR 2020 had a female first author (the first author is the lead contributor of the AI research). Meanwhile, women constitute 22.6 percent of computer science faculty in the U.S. but only 9.7 percent of senior authors at ICLR.
“We observe a gender gap in the review process, with women first authors achieving a lower acceptance rate than men (23.5% vs 27.1%),” the authors of the analysis add.
Why is this important?

“When the number of papers with merit is greater than the number of papers that will be accepted, it is inevitable that decisions become highly subjective and that biases towards certain kinds of papers, topics, institution, and authors become endemic,” the authors conclude in their paper.
As artificial intelligence continues to gain prominence in different areas of life, it is important that it becomes inclusive and represents all different demographics. AI conferences serve as hubs to draw attention to influential work that can have a great impact on future applications and research. When the review process favors one group of people, the effects can ripple to other areas that benefit from AI research, including health care, finance, hiring, and the justice system.
AI conference organizers should certainly reconsider the review process and take measures to ensure all researchers get a fair shot at having their work presented at prestigious venues. The work also has a message for the rest of us, the people who are following and covering AI research. We should all be aware that while AI conferences are a good criterion for where the community is headed, there is plenty of good research that never find their way into the spotlight. I’ve had some great experience unearthing some of these gems while perusing the machine learning subreddit, the AI and deep learning Facebook group, and creating my own list of AI researchers and computer scientists to follow on Twitter. I’m proud to have been able to give some of these researchers the exposure their work deserves. I’m sure others can do even better than me.

 There's a big brain at work in Baldur's Gate 3, and I'm not talking about the monster. It's actually an artificial intelligence that's tirelessly pushing the game's boundaries, pressing different combinations of buttons and input commands faster than a human could ever hope for, and it's letting Larian Studios develop their game faster and more efficiently than ever before. 






 In the before times, all this work had to be done by QA testers--basically humans whose sole job was to try and break the game. While this might seem like just playing video games all day long, it's actually tedious, monotonous work. You're not so much playing the game as you are running into walls and pressing weird input combinations to see what happens. 

 Larian still has QA testers in their employ, but a lot of the grunt work has been taken over by an artificial intelligence that Larian calls World Tester. In an interview with Polygon, the developer explains that World Tester is a sort of ""super gamer,"" going through combat, dialog options, and menus in search of bugs at ""lightning speed."" 

 With every new build of Baldur's Gate 3, World Tester gets first crack at it, and only after it reports the build to be safe does an actual human start poking around.

 “In the early years, it was just teleporting an NPC across regions, testing performance markers and looking for basic crashes,” Larian said, referring to their time developing Divinity: Original Sin. Since that game's 2014 release, World Tester has been evolving to perform more complex tasks, but Larian says it's not going to fully replace humans. At least, not yet. 

 via screenshot   

 “Our QA teams across the world are extremely important, and the world-tester is really not as smart as it thinks it is."" 

 AI is great and all, but it'll never figure out how to kill all the goblins at Selûne's temple without ever casting a single spell. 





 Baldur’s Gate 3 has already exceeded one million units sold, but players should keep in mind that their Early Access save files won’t transfer over to the final product when it eventually releases.

Hackathon is open to the public and will take place November 6-8, 2020
Cambridge, Mass., October 19, 2020—In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person health care switched to telemedicine and digital health, businesses quickly had to adapt to remote work, and supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing and necessitated challenging resource allocation decisions. The nature of work had been changing for decades. COVID-19 accelerated that trajectory.

Umbereen S. Nehal, MD, MPH, a current MIT Sloan Fellow, lead organizer of Hack4theFuture, and former Chief Medical Officer
In anticipation of the complex business and healthcare operations this winter and the virtual solutions that will need to be extended well into 2021, MIT Sloan is hosting Hack4theFuture. Hack4theFuture is a 48-hour virtual event that will focus on this accelerated transition and on humanizing artificial intelligence for the future of work and systems in the age of COVID-19. The hackathon is part of the MIT COVID-19 Challenge series with Hack4theFuture taking place November 6-8, 2020.
Many of the challenges that the hackathon will address were predicted in discussions of what the Future of Work would entail—namely the increasing use of artificial intelligence, automation and robotics and their potential to displace workers or encode biases. Now, some of those feared Future of Work solutions are helping to keep us safe while maintaining vital business operations. With the right people at the table, AI-enabled solutions can continue to advance technology while serving humanism and equity goals.
Hack4theFuture will be the first of the series focused on the Future of Work. Open to the public, this female-led hackathon aims at capturing all those interested in applying an entrepreneurial mindset to move forward into a future of anti-fragile systems while bringing everyone along. All are welcome to apply by 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday, October 30.

Michael Akinyele, former founding Chief Innovation Officer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
The kickoff on November 6 will feature keynote speaker Michael Akinyele, former founding Chief Innovation Officer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Akinyele says, “While the impact of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health on the U.S. healthcare system remains nascent, to scale, solutions must improve health outcomes and eliminate unnecessary spend.""
On November 6, participants will gather and form teams to solve key problems within three themes: AI and the Future of Work and Teams; AI and the Future of Healthcare; and AI and the Future of Systems. Over the following 48 hours, teams will iterate on these ideas with the assistance of mentors and collaborating organizations.
On November 8, participants will reconvene to present their final pitches to judging panels, and winning teams will be selected per track. After the weekend, the best ideas and teams will enjoy an ecosystem of mentorship to co-develop and implement their solution. Through ongoing collaboration with companies and institutions, Hack4theFuture will create an accelerated pipeline for adoption into enterprise. This ensures that the best ideas help to optimize systems needed for the immediate future.
“COVID-19 disrupted many previously change-resistant industries like healthcare and the public sector,” says Umbereen S. Nehal, MD, MPH, a current MIT Sloan Fellow, lead organizer of Hack4theFuture, and former Chief Medical Officer. “With reports of cases rising again, we need sustained creativity in crisis and anti-fragile systems. This is especially important for effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution which experts consider the most important way to end the pandemic.”
Jagjit Dhaliwal, MIT Sloan Executive MBA student, part of the Hack4theFuture leadership team, and current Deputy CIO of Los Angeles County, asks “What does the work look like in a post-COVID world? We need to reimagine business processes and operations while re-inventing the customer experience. While the future of work brings a new era of digital experience, it will pose new challenges of the digital divide, inclusivity, cyber-security, work-life balance. Artificial Intelligence adaption will grow significantly to activate new opportunities in data, analytics, and automation areas.”
Hack4theFuture is sponsored by the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, MIT Innovation Initiative, MIT Hacking Medicine. The event is co-sponsored by the MIT Sloan Entrepreneurship Club.
This virtual event follows on the heels of the India Turning the Tide Challenge held August 28-30, 2020. Earlier hackathons in the MIT COVID-19 Challenge included the MIT COVID-19 IDEAthon, Beat the Pandemic I, Africa Takes On COVID-19, MIT COVID-19 Datathon, Beat the Pandemic Hackathon II, and Latin America vs. COVID-19.

He is one of only 20 students nationwide to be recognized as a scholarship winner, said a news release from the Davidson Institute.""I started this project the summer before my junior year just as something to do over the summer, something I was interested in,"" Yasonik said in a phone interview. ""Now to see it blow up kind of like this — now that its two years later, and I'm still working with this stuff and people are still noticing it — it means the world. I didn't even know what the Davidson Fellows(hip) was two years ago, and now here I am.""The scholarship comes from the Davidson Institute's Fellows Scholarship Program, which offers $50,000, $25,000 and $10,000 college scholarships to students 18 or younger who have completed significant projects that have the potential to benefit society in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, literature and music. It is a program of the Davidson Institute for Talent Development, a national nonprofit organization headquarters in Reno, Nevada, that supports profoundly gifted youth.Yasonik and the other 2020 Davidson Fellows were honored during a digital reception Sept. 30.""They pulled together an entire video special for us. They brought us all together to actually meet over Zoom, so we were still able to talk with each other to meet each other. They put a highlight reel together of all our projects and what we've done, which is really special to see,"" Yasonik said.Yasonik's projectAccording to his biography page on the Davidson Institute's website, Yasonik's artificial intelligence-based project generates drug-like molecules from scratch and can uniquely optimize many molecular properties at once.Traditional approaches to drug development are rooted in trial and error and struggle to account for many molecular properties collectively. This results in long timelines (10-15 years), excessive costs ($160 million to $2.6 billion) and extremely high failure rates (87% to 97%), just to develop a single new drug.Yasonik's project could improve the process for creating new pharmaceutical drugs by using a generative approach to reduce reliance on trial and error and premade molecular databases.His project's ability to optimize many molecular characteristics at once ""could result in far better success rates further along the pharmaceutical pipeline,"" his biography page said.""Before, traditionally what happens is we have this molecule, and then we test for which properties does this molecule have.""The newer approach with artificial intelligence is we know which properties we want. Now let's find the molecule that meets these properties. It's kind of the reverse that way,"" Yasonik explained.Yasonik worked on the project first and then submitted a paper about his project along with a video. He did a literature review of papers involving artificial intelligence in medicine and pharmaceuticals before his junior year of high school, in summer 2018. Yasonik then did all the programming and testing during his junior year in 2018-19, which extended into his senior year of high school in 2019-20.Current and future plansYasonki is currently attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is taking classes virtually this semester from home and then plans to attend in-person classes in the spring. He is continuing his education in artificial intelligence and its application in medicine, which inspired his recent work in computational biology, the Davidson Institute's news release said.Yasonik said he hopes to work at an artificial intelligence research lab or start his own biotech company. ""I keep hearing 'make sure you're in the right place, right time.' So looking at coronavirus, looking at what's going on right now, I feel like this is the right place, right time for biotech and for biotech research. That's why I've been really getting interested in startups and things like that,"" he said.Contact Alec Johnson at (262) 875-9469 or alec.johnson@jrn.com.

By and large, manufacturing jobs as we know them are not going to return. Instead, they are set to be replaced by automation and machine learning.This is not a uniquely American problem. Global population forecasts say we will reach almost 8.5 billion by 2030. Add the exponential speed at which areas such as AI, computational processing power and robotics are developing, and it is safe to predict that our global workforce and the demands we put on it will change markedly in the near future.Job functions will change rapidly to mirror the pace of technology, so creating a workforce that is educated and ready to adjust to changing demands must be among our priorities.The form future jobs will take is likely to be shaped by how man and machine end up working together. It remains unclear to what extent the analytical power of machines will replace that of humans. Will the human presence in some job functions become entirely obsolete? Such questions could be better framed. Image: World Economic ForumThere’s good news for those in creative roles: so far, machines cannot really replicate the imagination. The bad news is for those who have routine, non-creative jobs, as these are indeed being eaten up by automation.Man can meet machine in two waysThere are two opposing approaches to how we can help the workforce keep up with technological development. One is to boost employees’ analytical skills to compete directly with the machines, the other is to strive to complement machines and artificial intelligence with synthetic skills. But it is not about polar extremes, nor is it a question of picking one or the other; it is about finding that sweet-spot of how machines and humans work best together. This will not come about by designing the fastest central processing unit (CPU) nor the strongest robot. Instead it will be the fruit of designing the best teams, best processes, and best user experiences. We should not be sizing up the potential of humans nor machines in isolation, but taking both combined. Designers must look into solutions whereby humans and machines complement each other, maximizing the potential of both.Why computational power should not be reserved for only the specialistsGarry Kasparov, a Russian chess-master who still holds the record for consecutive professional tournament victories said, “A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone, but more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process.” In the 1990s, Kasparov represented humans versus machines in a historic chess game against IBM’s Deep Blue computer. He went on to observe and participate in various chess contests where teams of man and machines competed against each other. His conclusion? It is not the team with the most computational power or the highest-ranking grand masters that will win, but the team with the best interplay – the best teamwork. In 2000, grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik defeated Garry Kasparov and became the Classical World Chess Champion. After retirement, he sought to rekindle human virtuosity in chess. Paradoxically he did so with the help of DeepMind – the makers of the best chess computer so far, AlphaZero, a far more advanced chess computer than Deep Blue. It is self-taught, and since AlphaZero can teach itself to play, it is also able to learn how to play any game by new rules. It can explore new variants of games and reveal its bugs and beauty more quickly than generations of human play could ever do. It can test all the outcomes of a game and decide if the game is worth playing. Consequently, the human-machine team Kramnik-AlphaZero are exploring new forms of chess that bring about human mastery and aesthetics, and they have come up with all sorts of new and alluring types of chess as a result.Reimagining the business processWe should not expect the future of machine learning and robotic design to be about humans versus machines but rather how humans and machines can form the best teams. A survey of a thousand companies working with AI published in Harvard Business Review stated in 2018 that, “Most activities at the human-machine interface require people to do new and different things (such as train a chatbot) and to do things differently (use that chatbot to provide better customer service). So far, however, only a small number of the companies we surveyed have begun to reimagine their business processes to optimize collaborative intelligence.”Today, at least 90,000 of IBM’s 388,000 employees are applying design-thinking methods to develop the company’s business domains - such as AI and CPU. As such, IBM is iterating and experimenting with how they can improve the user’s experience of working with computational power. The future will not be about creating the fastest CPU or cultivating prototypical employee skills, but it will be about designing the most compatible combinations of humans and machines, and optimising and simplifying the interaction between the two. And the most pioneering companies already know it.Have you read?Artificial intelligence will save jobs, not destroy them.

ON AN upper floor, something stirs in the semi-darkness of a closed shopping centre. It stops in front of a clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other malls and hospitals in Singapore. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.
Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.
This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”
And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?
The rise of robotics…

Researchers use artificial intelligence language tools to decode molecular movements

By applying natural language processing tools to the movements of protein molecules, University of Maryland scientists created an abstract language that describes the multiple shapes a protein molecule can take and how and when it transitions from one shape to another.





A protein molecule's function is often determined by its shape and structure, so understanding the dynamics that control shape and structure can open a door to understanding everything from how a protein works to the causes of disease and the best way to design targeted drug therapies. This is the first time a machine learning algorithm has been applied to biomolecular dynamics in this way, and the method's success provides insights that can also help advance artificial intelligence (AI). A research paper on this work was published on October 9, 2020, in the journal Nature Communications.
""Here we show the same AI architectures used to complete sentences when writing emails can be used to uncover a language spoken by the molecules of life,"" said the paper's senior author, Pratyush Tiwary, an assistant professor in UMD's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute for Physical Science and Technology. ""We show that the movement of these molecules can be mapped into an abstract language, and that AI techniques can be used to generate biologically truthful stories out of the resulting abstract words.""






Biological molecules are constantly in motion, jiggling around in their environment. Their shape is determined by how they are folded and twisted. They may remain in a given shape for seconds or days before suddenly springing open and refolding into a different shape or structure. The transition from one shape to another occurs much like the stretching of a tangled coil that opens in stages. As different parts of the coil release and unfold, the molecule assumes different intermediary conformations.
But the transition from one form to another occurs in picoseconds (trillionths of a second) or faster, which makes it difficult for experimental methods such as high-powered microscopes and spectroscopy to capture exactly how the unfolding happens, what parameters affect the unfolding and what different shapes are possible. The answers to those questions form the biological story that Tiwary's new method can reveal.
Tiwary and his team applied Newton's laws of motion—which can predict the movement of atoms within a molecule—with powerful supercomputers, including UMD's Deepthought2, to develop statistical physics models that simulate the shape, movement and trajectory of individual molecules.

University of Maryland researchers used an artificial intelligence system to create an abstract language from the constant motion of biological molecules, such as the lysozyme molecule shown here. This language describes the multiple shapes a protein molecule can take and how and when it transitions from one shape to another--key information for understanding disease and developing therapeutics. Credit: Zachary Smith/UMD
Then they fed those models into a machine learning algorithm, like the one Gmail uses to automatically complete sentences as you type. The algorithm approached the simulations as a language in which each molecular movement forms a letter that can be strung together with other movements to make words and sentences. By learning the rules of syntax and grammar that determine which shapes and movements follow one another and which don't, the algorithm predicts how the protein untangles as it changes shape and the variety of forms it takes along the way.
To demonstrate that their method works, the team applied it to a small biomolecule called riboswitch, which had been previously analyzed using spectroscopy. The results, which revealed the various forms the riboswitch could take as it was stretched, matched the results of the spectroscopy studies.
""One of the most important uses of this, I hope, is to develop drugs that are very targeted,"" Tiwary said. ""You want to have potent drugs that bind very strongly, but only to the thing that you want them to bind to. We can achieve that if we can understand the different forms that a given biomolecule of interest can take, because we can make drugs that bind only to one of those specific forms at the appropriate time and only for as long as we want.""
An equally important part of this research is the knowledge gained about the language processing system Tiwary and his team used, which is generally called a recurrent neural network, and in this specific instance a long short-term memory network. The researchers analyzed the mathematics underpinning the network as it learned the language of molecular motion. They found that the network used a kind of logic that was similar to an important concept from statistical physics called path entropy. Understanding this opens opportunities for improving recurrent neural networks in the future.
""It is natural to ask if there are governing physical principles making AI tools successful,"" Tiwary said. ""Here we discover that, indeed, it is because the AI is learning path entropy. Now that we know this, it opens up more knobs and gears we can tune to do better AI for biology and perhaps, ambitiously, even improve AI itself. Anytime you understand a complex system such as AI, it becomes less of a black-box and gives you new tools for using it more effectively and reliably.""

“Usama will work with senior leadership to create a pioneering research hub that places human skills and intelligence at the forefront of artificial intelligence development, from the earliest design steps to final implementation,” wrote David Madigan, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, in a letter welcoming Fayyad to the university.
Launched a year ago, the institute is university-wide in scope but will work especially closely with the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine.
The Institute of Experiential Artificial Intelligence focuses on application-driven, human-centered AI, says Carla Brodley, dean of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern, has championed the institute based on his belief that “the true promise of AI lies not in its ability to replace humans, but to optimize what humans do best.”
Fayyad, whose work has been advancing AI for three decades, believes in the institute’s mission as well as its opportunity to become a world leader.









Here’s what it takes to test a COVID-19 vaccine with clinical trials




“I used to call it ‘pragmatic AI’ and ‘hybrid AI,’ but I think ‘experiential AI’ is a better term for it—which is AI with humans in the loop,” says Fayyad, whose leadership of the institute will commence “Northeastern is committed to building the top research institute in the world when it comes to experiential AI. One of the reasons I’m excited about that is because no one has yet claimed the space. There is a chance to be number one [in the field].”
Since 2008, Fayyad has been leading Open Insights, a company that he founded near Seattle that deploys data-driven solutions to grow revenue from data assets. 
Prior to that, he was co-founder and chief technical officer of OODA Health, a venture capital-funded company. He served as global chief data officer and group managing director at Barclays Bank in London, after having been appointed executive chairman of Oasis 500. He has been chairman and chief executive of several startups, including Blue Kangaroo Corp., DMX Group, and digiMine Inc. 
When one of Fayyad’s startups was acquired by Yahoo! in 2004, he became the first person known to hold the title of chief data officer; there are now thousands of chief data officers at companies around the world. He founded Yahoo! Research Labs and built Yahoo!’s Strategic Data Solutions group.
Fayyad has served in leadership positions at Microsoft, and he founded the Machine Learning Systems group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where his work on machine learning earned him the top Excellence in Research award from Caltech, and a U.S. Government medal from NASA.









Self-driving cars could revolutionize transportation for people with disabilities. These researchers are trying to make it happen.




Fayyad holds more than 30 patents and has published more than 100 technical articles on data mining, data science, AI and machine learning, and databases. He has edited two influential books on data mining/data science and served as Founding Editor-in-Chief on two key industry journals.
He is co-founder of KDD—the largest international data science conference—and SIGKDD, the Association for Computing Machinery’s special interest group on knowledge discovery and data mining.
“I have known and respected Usama for three decades, and he is literally perfect for this position,” says Brodley. “We had an amazing slate of candidates, and he just really fit the bill with both his research experience and his entrepreneurship. He is going to be building experiential AI across the entire Northeastern network.”
Fayyad says he is looking forward to getting to know the Northeastern community in order to develop interdisciplinary partnerships that can help the institute confront many of the issues that are hindering experiential AI.
“This is a continued evolution of a path I’ve been on all of my professional life,” Fayyad says. “The first order of business is mapping out the strengths of the university; and mapping out the market weaknesses of what is missing and where are the real opportunities in experiential AI; and then figuring out how to leverage our strengths and resources that we will have at the institute in order to address those areas with a maximum impact. That gives you the ability to take the lead in certain areas that are in high demand, and it gives you the ability to attract the best minds to join in the journey because you are addressing problems that many of the other great research institutions are not working on.
“That’s how I normally like to do it, because you can add value and achieve distinction very quickly.”

Professor Shawn Newsam, left, and graduate student Shrishail “Shree” Baligar are using computer science to help conservation efforts.


Bird species usually are counted twice a year by wildlife surveyors: once during the breeding season and again during the Christmas Bird Count.
New technology, however, is increasing the accuracy of bird population studies. A team of UC Merced researchers is developing a model to recognize bird calls.
Recording devices called AudioMoths have been placed across bird habitat in Sonoma County. During two-week periods, the device wakes up every 10 minutes and records one minute of sound. Department of Computer Science and Engineering professor Shawn Newsam and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science graduate student Shrishail “Shree” Baligar are using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect bird calls in the recordings.
Their model can detect 45 different species so far, and will be used to produce maps of where, when and how many species are present.
Newsam and several colleagues joined up to explore the idea with two recently funded awards.
“I love working on multidisciplinary problems. It charges me,” Newsam said. He and Baligar are working with geography professor Matthew Clark from Sonoma State University, and Leo Salas, a quantitative ecologist at Point Blue Conservation Science, a nonprofit focused on climate-smart conservation.
“I’m excited to apply AI for the benefit of the Earth,” Newsam said. “Being able to passively detect and map species distributions using low-cost audio recording devices allows a range of down-stream research by domain scientists.”

The tiny AudioMoth recorders will capture recordings in nature, which can later be used to teach a computer model to recognize bird sounds.

The “Soundscapes to Landscapes (S2L): Monitoring Animal Biodiversity from Space Using Citizen Scientists” program is supported by $1.1 million over three years through NASA’s Citizen Science for Earth Systems program. It uses citizen scientists to deploy the AudioMoths. Other birders knowledgeable in bird calls will annotate a subset of the recordings, which serve as the training data for the AI models.
This summer, Newsam also received a $90,000, one-year “AI for Earth Innovation” grant from Global Wildlife Conservation in partnership with Microsoft. The nonprofit relies on research to work with local communities to address the root causes of threats to wildlife.
Newsam’s is one of only five projects funded out of 135 applications. The grant supports AI projects that can scale quickly. The research will benefit many other projects because it is open source.
For Newsam, there are many questions about processing the data, and many technical challenges. The recordings have biophony, geophony and anthrophony noise, and the bird calls are often faint. Some species have different calls for different communications: warning calls, mating calls and others. Which one should the AI focus on?
“Birds often modify their calls by changing frequency, for example, if other birds are also calling,” Newsam said. “I am learning a lot about bird calls.”
Baligar hears the calls as something more than just bird communication.
“I like to think of birds as musical instruments,” he said. “All the violins are orange crowned warblers, but no two violins are the same. A bird song plays different notes, and every bird likes to play a song differently every time.”
Each AudioMoth gathers about 2,000 minutes of data per site. So far, the team has more than 500,000 minute-long recordings — more than 8,000 hours of data from over 600 locations — and terrabytes of data to manage.
However, training the AI model requires a lot of annotated data.
“Deep learning is data hungry,” Baligar said. “The more data the better. On average, we have just 650 training clips per bird species, which is not a lot.”
Newsam, who co-founded the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SpARC) at UC Merced, is an expert in image analysis and understanding.
“Image and audio are sensorily very different but in the end, it is just data — data that we are turning into information through several processes,” he said.
Baligar did not set out to study sound or bird calls when he was a master’s student. He was more interested in time-series questions. Now, audio over time is the focus of his dissertation, and potentially the basis for a company he hopes to launch after graduation.
Computer science and environmental science are two of UC Merced’s growing number of strengths, said professor Josh Viers, director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at UC Merced.
“Professor Newsam’s research is indicative of the progress UC Merced has made in attracting top talent and solving important global problems,” Viers said. “Shawn is a leader in developing computer science tools that interpret and integrate massive amounts of information, from Earth imagery to sound recordings, and his research is pushing the envelope on innovation in sustainability and technology. It is really exciting to see this example of artificial intelligence used to benefit wildlife conservation efforts.”
Future work for the team includes trying to identify individual birds and be able to track them over their range.
“If we can overcome some of the modeling challenges,” Newsam said, “we might be able to replace satellites with much more fine-scaled information about all kinds of wildlife.”

The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry



In the past two decades, the world has made tremendous advances in technology and has affected many aspects of human life. Dental health has also benefited from technological advances. The intelligent toothbrush, virtual reality, laser technology, and 3D printing have fundamentally changed the dentistry landscape.
The next big topic in dentistry will be the use of artificial intelligence in diagnostics and treatment.
How is AI Currently Being Used in Dentistry?
In dentistry, AI is used for a wide variety of applications. For example, it is used in voice commands such as DEXvoice.
DEXvoice, created by Simplifeye and DEXIS is the “Alexa” for the dentist. DEXvoice is able to pull up things like x-rays, patient records and charts. The DEXvoice solution creates a “hands-free” approach and can ultimately speed up the work of a dentist, as the technician or assistant does not have to constantly try to find documents, x-rays and diagrams on the computer. It also makes the work area cleaner and safer as there is no need to put on and take off gloves to use the computer.
Anyone who has been treated for tooth decay by the dentist knows how painful the process can be. Isn’t it great if artificial intelligence can help make the treatment fast and less painful?
Interpreting X-rays
Interpreting X-rays and properly planning treatment are some of the most important skills a dentist must master. Still, they remain some of the most difficult skills to develop, especially because much of the images are not clearly visible with the naked eye. At the moment, AI is helping with caries detection.
ParallelDots, an AI company, launched a cloud-based AI application to detect cavities on dental x-rays. They named this new clinical device Dentistry.AI. The device contains thousands of X-ray images that serve as a data set.
The AI ​​algorithm is trained to recognize patterns from this large amount of data. Another Industry 4.0 technology, blockchain, guarantees this data’s immediacy and validity to all the system participants.
AI enables better identification of tooth decay by analyzing bone density.
The correct interpretation of X-ray and 3D images requires a lot of experience, and the AI ​​assistant makes work a lot easier, as millions of images have already been evaluated. The artificial intelligence algorithm, trained with thousands of X-ray images, achieves a high degree of accuracy in predicting tooth decay.
The AI ​​has also brought us a smart assistant – the ChairFill program developed by MMG Fusion – that can help optimize dental practices schedule by contacting patients to coordinate treatments that have not yet been completed.
On the one hand, it is about finding out which types of patients dentists need at what times to fill the calendars as best as possible, on the other hand, it is about contacting and coordinating these patients.
The program works like an intelligent assistant. It can also be connected to the marketing system to start new patient marketing campaigns. Profit maximization strategies and algorithms are examined to determine which campaign is running and who it is aimed at.
Is Artificial Intelligence Already an Ally for Dental Health Care?
While these advances in dental care provide an outlook on what may be possible in the future in this area, some experts in the field such as Dr. Sunali S. Khanna and Prita A. Dhaimade, members of the National Academy of Medical Sciences in India, noted that advances still have many drawbacks and challenges to be overcome. For example, the high initial investment costs.
AI Recognizes Tooth Decay Better than Humans
Jaroslav Bláha reported that a group of dentists found only about 50 percent of caries cases in X-rays than AI. He was also able to show that AI is better able than humans to detect orthodontic landmarks on X-rays.
In some cases, AI systems already outperform humans. And even if the quality of AI were only as good as humans, its speed is already significantly higher today. By saving time and the associated cost reduction alone, AI systems will play an increasingly important role in dentistry in the future.
AI-Assisted Dentists
In addition to acquiring factual knowledge about diseases, a strong focus should be placed on the use of AI systems to support decision-making in dentistry. The aim should be to train the next generation of dentists to learn the basics of how decision support systems work in order to be able to understand their decisions and, if medically indicated, to counter them.
Looking Into the Future
The use of AI in dentistry has the potential to introduce solutions with personalized diagnostics more quickly. It will improve communication between doctors and patients and allow for an accurate analysis of patient tests.
The AI ​​platform offers much more suitable alternatives for diagnosing patients. While the existing orthodontic CAD is performed manually by an operator according to the orthodontist’s instructions and may involve human error, the AI-based analysis will have an accurate setup with a precise diagnosis and prognosis before and after orthodontic treatment.
Personally, I hope that with the advent of artificial intelligence in dental health, visits to the dentist will in some ways, become more pain-free and stress-free.
I myself am the son of a dentist and already have experience with painful orthodontic treatment that lasted a total of 3 years. I know that dental visits that go wrong can have lasting psychological effects for many patients, children, and adults alike.
But it’s also exciting to think about the positive results that artificial intelligence and dentistry may have for dental health care in the future.
Conclusion
While AI systems are becoming more and more involved in people’s everyday lives and represent a meaningful and homogeneous addition to life, some challenges are associated with them.
People are afraid of change – including artificial intelligence. In this context, it is, therefore, essential that users always know why a particular decision was made. Understanding the reasons for decisions ensures not only transparency but also increases acceptance.
Another challenge of the future concerns the “distortion” of the data. The artificial intelligence-based on machine learning – can arrive at neutral findings, the output data must also be free of any kind of distortion.
In ethical and legal issues, in particular, we still have a long way to go before we can count on the use of strong artificial intelligence. According to Kreutzer, global agreements are necessary for this – but in view of the geopolitical situation, this seems to be a utopia.

Countries across the world are making efforts to be part of the AI-led digital economy, which is estimated to contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. India, with its “AI for All” strategy, a vast pool of AI-trained workforce and an emerging startup ecosystem, has a unique opportunity to be a major contributor to AI-driven solutions that can revolutionise healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, education and skilling. AI is the branch of computer science concerned with developing machines that can complete tasks that typically require human intelligence. With the explosion of available data expansion of computing capacity, the world is witnessing rapid advancements in AI, machine learning and deep learning, transforming almost all sectors of the economy. India has a large young population that is skilled and eager to adopt AI. The country has been ranked second on the Stanford AI Vibrancy Index primarily on account of its large AI-trained workforce. Our leading technology institutes like the IITs, IIITs and NITs have the potential to be the cradle of AI researchers and startups. India’s startups are innovating and developing solutions with AI across education, health, financial services and other domains to solve societal problems. Machine Learning-based deep-learning algorithms in AI can give insights to healthcare providers in predicting future events for patients. It can also aid in the early detection and prevention of diseases by capturing the vitals of patients. A Bengaluru based start-up has developed a non-invasive, AI-enabled technology to screen for early signs of breast cancer. Similarly, hospitals in Tamil Nadu are using Machine Learning algorithms to detect diabetic retinopathy and help address the challenge of shortage of eye doctors. For the COVID-19 response, an AI-enabled Chatbot was used by MyGov for ensuring communications. Similarly, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) deployed the Watson Assistant on its portal to respond to specific queries of frontline staff and data entry operators from various testing and diagnostic facilities across the country on COVID-19. AI-based applications have helped biopharmaceutical companies to significantly shorten the preclinical drug identification and design process from several years to a few days or months. This intervention has been used by pharmaceutical companies to identify possible pharmaceutical therapies to help combat the spread of COVID19 by repurposing drugs. Opinion | An AI future set to take over post-Covid world AI-based solutions on water management, crop insurance and pest control are also being developed. Technologies like image recognition, drones, and automated intelligent monitoring of irrigation systems can help farmers kill weeds more effectively, harvest better crops and ensure higher yields. Voice-based products with strong vernacular language support can help make accurate information more accessible to farmers. A pilot project taken up in three districts — Bhopal, Rajkot and Nanded — has developed an AI-based decision support platform combined with weather sensing technology to give farm level advisories about weather forecasts and soil moisture information to help farmers make decisions regarding water and crop management. ICRISAT has developed an AI-power sowing app, which utilises weather models and data on local crop yield and rainfall to more accurately predict and advise local farmers on when they should plant their seeds. This has led to an increase in yield from 10 to 30 per cent for farmers. AI-based systems can also help is establishing partnerships with financial institutions with a strong rural presence to provide farmers with access to credit. An AI-based flood forecasting model that has been implemented in Bihar is now being expanded to cover the whole of India to ensure that around 200 million people across 2,50,000 square kilometres get alerts and warnings 48 hours earlier about impending floods. These alerts are given in nine languages and are localised to specific areas and villages with adequate use of infographics and maps to ensure that it reaches all. The Central Board of Secondary Education has integrated AI in the school curriculum to ensure that students passing out have the basic knowledge and skills of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had launched a “Responsible AI for Youth” programme this year in April, wherein more than 11,000 students from government schools completed the basic course in AI. As AI works for digital inclusion in India, it will have a ripple effect on economic growth and prosperity. Analysts predict that AI can help add up to $957 billion to the Indian economy by 2035. The opportunity for AI in India is colossal, as is the scope for its implementation. By 2025, data and AI can add over $500 billion and almost 20 million jobs to the Indian economy. Opinion | Automation and AI in a changing business landscape India’s “AI for All” strategy focuses on responsible AI, building AI solutions at scale with an intent to make India the AI garage of the world — a trusted nation to which the world can outsource AI-related work. AI solutions built in India will serve the world. AI derives strength from data. To this end, the government is in the process of putting in place a strong legal framework governing the data of Indians. The legislation stems from a desire to become a highly secure and ethical AI powerhouse. India wants to build a data-rich and a data-driven society as data, through AI, which offers limitless opportunities to improve society, empower individuals and increase the ease of doing business. The RAISE 2020 summit has brought together global experts to create a roadmap for responsible AI — an action plan that can help create replicable models with a strong foundation of ethics built-in. With the participation of more than 72,000 people from 145 countries, RAISE 2020 has become the true global platform for the exchange of ideas and thoughts for creating a robust AI roadmap for the world.

If we didn’t have enough to worry about—Covid-19, a nation divided, massive job losses and civil unrest—now we have to be concerned that robots will take our jobs. 

The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a recent report that “a new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the coronavirus pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people.      


Millions of people have lost their jobs due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and now the machines will take away even more jobs from workers, according to the WEF. The organization cites that automation will supplant about 85 million jobs by 2025. WEF says there’s nothing to worry about since its analysis anticipates the future tech-driven economy will create 97 million new jobs. Currently, approximately 30% of all tasks are done by machines—and people do the rest. However, by the year 2025, it's believed that the balance will dramatically change to a 50-50 combination of humans and machines. 

Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”  

PROMOTED
In a dire prediction, WEF said, “While some new jobs would be created as in the past, the concern is there may not be enough of these to go round, particularly as the cost of smart machines falls over time and their capabilities increase.”
Concerns of new technologies disrupting the workforce and causing job losses have been around for a long time. On one side, the argument is automation will create better new jobs and erase the need for physical labor. The counterclaim is that people without the appropriate skills will be displaced and not have a home in the new environment.

Banking and financial services employees, factory workers and office staff will seemingly face the loss of their jobs—or need to find a way to reinvent themselves in this brave new world. Millions would need to be reskilled to cope with the change, while governments would have to provide stronger safety nets for displaced workers.

“More than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
 High-profile business leaders and a small number of politicians are starting to speak out about the potential deleterious effects of transitioning to technology and replacing workers. “Computers, intelligent machines and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla.
Mark Cuban, a billionaire in the tech space and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said in a CNBC interview, “President Donald Trump should be more aware of tech advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and how that will impact America’s future.” Cuban said, “I’m willing to bet that these companies building new plants...this will lead to fewer people being employed.”
Andrew Yang, former Democratic presidential hopeful, was one of the few candidates and politicians vocalizing concerns over the ascendancy of AI. Yang’s official website offered the following:
“Advances in automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold the potential to bring about new levels of prosperity humans have never seen. They also hold the potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations, and, if experts such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are to be believed, destroy humanity.”
States and governments have grave concerns over tax collections, as people are phased out and replaced by robots. Many cities are suffering financial challenges, as tax revenues plummeted with the closure of businesses and loss of income from the ranks of the newly unemployed. To compensate for the shortfall, billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist Bill Gates called for a tax on robots, due to the disruption that will occur, resulting in the loss of jobs and tax revenue. “Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in an interview with Quartz.  
AI, robotics and technology are advancing at a furious pace. We’re heading into uncharted territory without appropriate regulations, oversight or conversations around what this will do to society. As millions of workers will be displaced, with hopes that they can be retrained, it's important that this trend needs to be carefully addressed. What will happen if the experts are wrong and we are unable to find jobs for the millions of Americans who no longer have “Fourth Industrial Revolution” skills? Technological innovation doesn’t have to stop, but it has to be monitored and analyzed to ensure that we don’t go past the point of no return.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the birth of computers in the 1950s. The original pioneers dreamed of making ‘computer brains’ that could perform the same kinds of tasks as our own brains, such as playing chess or translating languages. But hopes that AI would quickly reach human-level intelligence didn’t come to fruition, and AI soon fell out of favour.
Over the following decades, technology improved at an exponential rate. Computers got faster, the internet was invented, and researchers made new advances in AI algorithms.
In the last decade, AI has started solving many of the problems that we always dreamed it could. This has prompted billions of dollars of investment from companies, governments and financiers, and many major organisations now embrace AI as a core element of their business.Early AI engineers attempted to make 'computer brains' © GraphicaArtis/Getty Images)
Are there different kinds of AI?
Mention AI, and most people think of ‘deep learning’. This kind of AI is loosely inspired by the way our brains work. It uses lots of computers to simulate large networks of artificial ‘neurons’, which are then trained, typically using humongous amounts of data, until they’ve learned to do what we want them to – for example, understanding speech.
This training is the slow and resource-heavy part. Once trained, even a phone can then run the AI and instantly perform the right function, such as obeying your voice command. Deep learning is just one kind of AI, among thousands of others.Artificial intelligence can be used to help predict financial markets © Getty Images
Some AIs use advanced statistics to help computers make predictions, such as the likely side effects of a new drug; others use logic to make deductions about their environment, such as a robot mapping out a route; while others simulate evolution or even swarms of bees in order to find solutions to difficult problems such as scheduling activities in a factory or optimising the shape of an aircraft wing.

Can a computer be self-aware?
If an AI became sentient, would it gain human (or equivalent) rights?
If we’re ever able to make robots as intelligent as us, won’t forcing them to work for us be as bad as slavery?
How can we stop robots rising up against the human race?

Will AI ever be as clever as us?
This is a tough question, as it depends on how we measure intelligence. The more advanced AIs can recognise features in images (that’s a half-hidden cat; that’s a corner of a bus) better than us, provide expert opinions more reliably than us (your test results mean you have an 85 per cent chance of condition X), and play many games better than us – most recently Go and classic arcade games like Asteroids.
But no AI can drive a car as well as an experienced driver, despite billions of dollars of research and data equivalent to more than 10 billion miles of driving. No artificial intelligence can control a robot to wash the dishes. No AI has an IQ more than that of an average six-year-old child.A robotic arm plays Go against a human opponent at an AI conference in Shanghai © Getty Images
We have very powerful computers, lots of training data, and some clever algorithms, but we still don’t know how to make an AI with the flexibility and learning capacity of the human brain – and we also don’t know how to make AIs that become cleverer without human input.
What’s more, we still don’t fully understand how intelligence arises in biological organisms, so it’s hard to see how our human-inspired AIs will match our intelligence in the near future.
What else is AI used for?
AI has become a ubiquitous technology. When you unlock your phone by looking at it, an AI has recognised your face. When you speak to your TV or smart speaker, an AI has recognised your voice. When you take a photo with your phone or digital camera, an AI identifies elements in the foreground to help blur the background, and combines several photos taken with different exposures to construct a perfect picture.
AIs check for fraud every time you buy something online. They monitor your online shopping behaviour and present you with adverts tailored to your likes. They suggest news stories that you are more likely to be interested in, and answer your questions in online help desks.
AIs are creative, composing music, designing buildings, painting artworks. AIs are also enabling our vehicles to become increasingly autonomous, taking over some of the more tedious and repetitive aspects of driving.

Can we trust AI?
There are always downsides to technologies. If an AI is trusted too much, then we may get ourselves into trouble – this is why driverless cars will always need a human override option.
If we train AI with biased data then the AI will also be biased, as studies have shown where AIs recognise white male faces better than others. Some worry that AI will lead to job losses, which may be true, but AI will also create many jobs.Artificial intelligence still cannot drive a car as well as an experienced driver © Getty Images
AI is nothing new in this regard: a similar thing happened in the Industrial Revolution, and again in the ‘information revolution’ with the advent of computers and the internet.
In the end, artificial intelligence should not be feared. AI is being created to help us, and like all future technologies, we need to ensure that it is used appropriately.

 ""There are considerable benefits of setting up a transatlantic digital community cooperating on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging and disruptive technologies, where NATO can play a key role as a facilitator for innovation and exchange"", said NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană. On Wednesday (28 October 2020) he took part in a high-level virtual discussion on transatlantic cooperation in the era of AI, organised by the Atlantic Council's Future Europe Initiative and GeoTech Center. 






Mr. Geoană engaged in this conversation alongside the Chair and Vice Chair of the  National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), Dr. Eric Schmidt and Secretary Robert O. Work, and the Head of Cabinet of European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, Ambassador Kim Jørgensen. They discussed what modern technologies mean for European and American defence and security stakeholders, why the United States and the European Union should cooperate on AI, and how best to promote shared values in the field.
""NATO is a natural platform for transatlantic cooperation of AI,"" the Deputy Secretary General underlined. “NATO offers its consultative mechanisms and unique networks for collaboration on defence and security questions. Bringing together Allies and partners, public and private sector, innovators and industry. We have great communities in areas like military capability development, science and technology, standardisation - and of course our Command Structure and military exercises. We also have new cross-cutting policy teams on Innovation Policy, who cover AI, and on Data Policy,” he pointed out.

EU Council presidency conclusions on Artificial Intelligence and human rights failed to secure unanimous backing from member states last week after Poland refused to support a text due to opposing the inclusion of the term ‘gender equality,’ EURACTIV has learned.
The German presidency of the EU Council adopted on 21 October conclusions on the charter of fundamental rights in the context of artificial intelligence, but stated that ‘one member state’ objected to the inclusion of ‘gender equality’ on the grounds that “neither the Treaties nor the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights uses the term ‘gender.’”
All other 26 nations, however, had insisted that the phrase be included in the conclusions. Multiple EU sources confirmed to EURACTIV that Poland was the member state which opposed the phrase.
EURACTIV followed up with the Poles, who came clean on their opposition. In a statement, Ambassador Andrzej Sadoś said the country “strongly supports equality between women and men, as it stands in all EU documents based on terminology adopted in primary law.”
“The Treaties refer to equality between women and men, similar to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The meaning of ‘gender’ is unclear; the lack of definition and unambiguous understanding for all member states may cause semantic problems. Neither the Treaties nor the Charter of Fundamental Rights use the term ‘gender’,” Sadoś continued.
The ambassador added that his country would work to adopt the conclusions on fundamental rights in the future.
Poland has recently come under heavy criticism in Brussels for a series of measures put in place that some believe encroach on gender rights.
A court ruling in the country recently outlawed the majority of abortions, with a small number of exceptions, including in cases of rape or incest.
This followed Poland’s July decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, at a time when dozens of conservative and Catholic regions across the country were adopting resolutions that criticised ‘LGBT ideology.’



Commission will ‘not exclude’ potential ban on facial recognition technology
The European Commission has not ruled out a future ban on the use of facial recognition technology in Europe, as the EU executive mulls the findings of a recent public consultation on Artificial Intelligence.


‘Clear legal requirements for AI’ 
Elsewhere in the German Presidency’s conclusions on Artificial Intelligence and fundamental rights, certain nefarious applications of next-generation technologies were cited as a potential cause for concern.
Both the use of mass surveillance technologies and facial recognition applications should be subject to ‘clear legal requirements’, the text said.
“We note the ongoing discussion on whether such systems should be used in principle and on possible bans on their use. To the extent that these systems are to be used, we recognize that clear legal requirements need to be formulated beforehand.”
The European Commission has not entirely discounted the possibility of a ban on the use of facial recognition in public spaces. Speaking to MEPs in the European Parliament’s Internal Market Committee in September, Kilian Gross of the Commission’s DG Connect said that all options were still on the table with regards to a possible ban on this technology.
Ahead of the official publication of the Commission’s White paper on Artificial Intelligence in February this year, which presented its framework strategy for mitigating the future risks of AI, a leaked working document revealed that the Commission had been weighing up the possibility of introducing a temporary moratorium on facial recognition technologies.



LEAK: Commission considers facial recognition ban in AI 'white paper'
The European Commission is considering measures to impose a temporary ban on facial recognition technologies used by both public and private actors, according to a draft white paper on Artificial Intelligence obtained by EURACTIV.

Parliament on fundamental rights and AI
Elsewhere in Brussels, last week MEPs adopted proposals on how the EU can best regulate Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a means to foster innovation, ethical standards, and trust.
One initiative report, led by Spanish Socialist Iban García del Blanco, urged the Commission to develop ethical standards that abide by a human-centric approach, while also safeguarding against bias and discrimination.
Del Blanco’s text duly highlighted the importance of preserving non-bias in AI technologies, noting that discrimination should not be conducted on grounds including race, gender, sexual orientation, among a range of other metrics.

Transatlantic democratic allies must begin working together to develop new technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, to strengthen their collective defense, support democracy, and protect their societies.
Speakers from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), European Commission (EC), and NATO called for transatlantic allies to extend their cooperation to research and development of artificial intelligence at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council on October 28. The event marked one of the first public live discussions between Europe and the United States on transatlantic coalitions on artificial intelligence. “It is time for us to build another partnership: a partnership around artificial intelligence,” Eric Schmidt, chair of NSCAI and former CEO of Google, argued. Secretary Robert O. Work, vice chair of NSCAI and former deputy secretary of defense, agreed, adding “NATO is absolutely central to this [technological] competition.”
Ambassador Mircea Geoană, Deputy Secretary General of NATO, threw his support behind a common NATO approach to artificial intelligence, proclaiming that the Alliance’s democratic values and adaptability are crucial for allies to win the technological race in artificial intelligence as “in the end, this is something that would make us prevail.” Geoană, Work, and Schmidt were joined by Ambassador Kim Jørgensen, head of cabinet for European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, who argued that the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges show that crises “don’t stop at the borders,” but require “a common approach,” that utilizes these new technologies and deep cooperation.
Here’s a quick look at what the speakers said about how a transatlantic alliance for artificial intelligence will impact the geopolitical landscape and protect democracy worldwide:

A transatlantic approach

A strong democratic AI alliance: Schmidt argued that the partnership between the European Union and the United States has “provided extraordinary economic growth, military security, national security, and cultural enrichment that has benefitted all of us enormously.” But as China and other adversaries race for technological superiority, “a strong alliance among the democratic nations for this techno-economic competition” is needed, as proposed by the NSCAI in its Third Quarter Recommendations for the US government. The recommendations called for “expediting the responsible development of artificial intelligence by NATO and member states, resilient artificial intelligence partnerships,” and a Strategic Dialogue for Emerging Technologies with the EU. Schmidt considered artificial intelligence a “game-changer” for the EU and the United States and the most powerful tool for increasing prosperity and “expanding freedom.”
True partners share values (and data): While AI may be a new area of focus for NATO, Work argued that deep transatlantic partnership will be key in keeping up with the technological competition. “We have to share our data, [just like] we have to share our values.” Geoană agreed, but also noted that NATO must continue to “make sure that we keep the right balance between the traditional way [of keeping] our deterrence and defense… while rapidly and systematically [making] the transition towards the new era and new technologies.” Geoană maintained that this balance is essential as NATO has been the “most successful alliance in human history” because “we kept our values… but also we kept always our technological edge.” Indeed, NATO has a crucial stake in transatlantic democracies winning the technological race “because the moment you lose this technological edge…then not only will the last seven decades of the transatlantic bond…be in jeopardy, but also a few centuries of Western domination in technology,” explained Geoană.
It’s an opportunity for new partners, too: The challenge to compete on the technical stage is so overwhelming that relying only on an EU-US partnership may not be enough to counter adversaries. “This is why opening up to our like-minded, democratic partners from all over the world… who are sharing the same values” should be a priority, Geoană explained, identifying opportunities with Australia, Japan, and Korea. Work agreed that a “coalition of digital democracies” should be a priority. He noted that India is an attractive partner, especially as the United States and India signed a military agreement this week that joins the countries to share satellite data—which is intended to counter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.
Winner takes all: The advantages of winning the race to AI do not stop at defense capabilities, Jørgensen emphasized, but also show the potential technology “offers to make our economies more sustainable and to meet a wide range of societal needs.” The current COVID-19 pandemic, she added, has illustrated the benefits of EU-US cooperation on technologies like artificial intelligence, as they can “help us… to improve our health system and future responses to such [crises],” Jørgensen claimed.

The global race to establish standards and norms

Norms now for safe technology use later: The race for mastery of artificial intelligence will also have important implications for the rest of the world. Work warned that whichever country succeeds in the technological competition will see its values “reflected in the way the technology is used” around the world. Democratic nations need to take the lead in artificial intelligence as “we do not want the Chinese to be developing global norms and technical standards for artificial intelligence technologies.” Should Beijing win the race for AI, it “will use these technologies to surveil its population, to suppress minorities; they have no real concern over personal privacy… their values are much different.”
A rules-based system by transatlantic norms: According to Work, joint EU-US work on artificial intelligence is “absolutely critical” to “shape artificial norms and technical standards” that respect freedom before China sets the rules. Geoană also agreed that democracies need to establish standards and norms for artificial intelligence use early to “keep our citizens safe and prosperous,” warning that “we have to bring all the arsenal, our toolboxes, our imagination, [and] our strengths together in this direction.”
Bulk up for stronger AI standards: Jørgensen agreed that democratic allies and partners should set their priorities to “lead the development of technology and be at the forefront when it comes to setting the global standard.” Jørgensen floated tapping into partnerships with non-NATO countries like India, because “the larger the combined economic weight of our allied partners, the more effective we will be in promoting our standards.”

Off to the races: China and the West

Beijing is catching up: Work warned that “China is catching up fairly quickly” to Western technological levels, “[but] the West is still ahead.” As China has made technological and artificial intelligence advancement a national priority, described Work, there’s “every reason” to believe that “they can be already significant peer competitors in this arena.” Work added that if China “wins” on a technological platform such as artificial intelligence or 5G, and if “we start using Chinese platforms as opposed to Western platforms, this will have all sorts of negative impacts on our society.”
All the ingredients for supremacy: Geoană further cautioned that “for the first time in our history on technology, one competitor—China—has, at the same time, all the ingredients of global supremacy on technology,” said Geoană, adding that Beijing not only has the capacity to develop technology, but also a growing global technology market through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Step one of the game plan: Work identified that China’s approach to smart cities—cities that use technology to connect different components of a city and collect data on its citizens and visitors—and surveillance technologies “furthers authoritarianism and violates personal privacy and civil liberties.” But establishing a “US-EU digital ecosystem,” with initiatives like building trusted cities that use AI and data consistent with democratic values, “would be very good for the long-term competition between democratic and authoritarian regimes.”

Harnessing transatlantic brain-power

Humans matter: The NSCAI’s Blueprint for Artificial Intelligence Cooperation includes recommendations for transatlantic defense and security operations, joint research and development, data sharing, and innovation: but Schmidt stresses that talent acquisition comes first. “We need all the top brains that are available to us in all of the Atlantic Council countries, working to build platforms that have our values and commitments to protecting individual rights, restoring commercial competition built on fair rules, and strengthening defense alliances.” The most important objective, he added, is to “get the human capital that is available in Europe and in the United States” working toward research on artificial intelligence and setting technological norms and standards. “We are strong when we are innovating in these spaces and combined, we can build amazing platforms.” Work added that focusing on talent is “key to winning a long-term technical competition on artificial intelligence.”
A transatlantic digital community: Geoană also argued that talent will be found within the triangular alliance—academia, government, and industry—as per the NSCAI’s recommendations. He advocated for a transatlantic digital community that would bring together the talent of NATO members’ universities, researchers, young entrepreneurs, startups, and governments. “Harnessing this synergy between the three pillars of our democratic society is not only smart in terms of business and adaptability, but it is also our main competitive advantage in our competition with our authoritarian rivals,” Geoană said.
This panel discussion was convened by the Atlantic Council’s GeoTech Center and Future Europe Initiative.
Katherine Walla is assistant director of editorial at the Atlantic Council.

Ocado was founded in 2000 as an entirely online experience and therefore never had a brick-and-mortar store to serve its customers, who number 580,000 each day. Its technology expertise came about out of necessity as it began to build the software and hardware it needed to be efficient, productive, and competitive. Today, Ocado uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in many ways throughout its business.

From Online Retailer to Ocado Technology

Since 2000, Ocado tried to piece together the technology they needed to succeed by purchasing products off the shelf. They quickly realized these off-the-shelf solutions weren’t suitable for the unique demands of an online grocery, so they set out to build the hardware and software they needed. Today, the Ocado Smart Platform runs end-to-end e-commerce and is being sold to other brick-and-mortar grocery retailers such as Canadian grocer Sobey’s, French retailer Groupe Casino, Aeon in Japan, Kroger in the United States, ICA in Sweden, and others around the world. Ocado Technology is helping to provide software as a service and hardware to help other grocers operate profitably and sustainably online. Ocado Technology has led the industry in innovation for years, from launching the first grocery app in 2009 to being the first UK supermarket to have an Alexa app.

Automated warehouses

Ocado’s warehouses are fully automated. The company’s warehouses illustrate the power of Industry 4.0, where technology trends such as the Internet of Things, robotics, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are at work every day, making Ocado's operations streamlined and efficient—in just 5 minutes robotics can complete 50,000 orders. The choreography of the robots—a swarm—is something to behold as they navigate around warehouses the size of several football fields, pick up bins and deliver them to pick stations to complete customer orders. Ocado made this system completely scalable to accommodate the evolving needs of online grocers during changing seasons, promotions, and events such as a global pandemic. This robotic workforce is powered by big data and artificial intelligence and becomes better through machine learning. Machine learning determines the traffic flow of the robots through the warehouse to prevent collisions and to optimize efforts, calculates the precise placement of bins for maximum efficiency, and also monitors the health and maintenance needs of the robots to reduce any downtime. Artificial intelligence also helps the system understand what products are in stock through real-time availability, so they are able to give customers what they expect to receive.

Reduce food waste
It is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that we waste around 1.3 billion tons of food each year on earth. If we could stop the waste, there would be enough food to feed all the world's hungry and even have food leftover. Technology could help us solve the world hunger problem, and Ocado might just be leading the way to a solution. Ocado uses machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics to slash its food waste to just losing 1 in 6,000 produce items. The Ocado Smart Platform determines the food customers want and need and adjusts orders from suppliers accordingly. The company's platform assesses 20 million forecasts each day to maximize freshness and availability while reducing overstock and waste. Additionally, the machines help determine the optimal time for discounts to push out all inventory.  
Artificial intelligence and machine learning also help reduce food waste by ensuring that products are stored or delivered in a way and at temperatures that reduce the likelihood of spoilage. It donates produce to those in need that are only a few days away from expiring. Machine learning algorithms help the company effectively monitor and manage this donation effort.

Better customer service 
As you might be able to ascertain, customer service is a priority for Ocado, and having the products customers want available and fresh, greater personalization, and smarter product recommendations are certainly ways to create a stellar customer experience. While customer interaction isn't the same as it would be in a brick-and-mortar store, customers do interact with Ocado delivery drivers whose delivery routes are constantly evolving as AI determines how to circumnavigate the city to avoid traffic and other delays or when they interact with Ocado's contact centers via a phone call or email. These are also areas where Ocado puts technology to work.

At Ocado’s contact centers, they allow customers to contact the company in a variety of ways (email, social media, phone call). But, this isn’t what sets its customer service apart because most companies who prioritize the customer experience do the same. Ocado differentiates its customer service experience by applying machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to quickly categorize customer communications to prioritize the message and get it to the right team to solve the issue as quickly as possible.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems due to an increased need for automation, advanced analytics, and remote work. In fact, machine learning and other forms of AI are being applied to address the increasing scale of the pandemic itself. Now, say experts, is a good time to step back and consider the ethics of these (and all) AI applications.
“These past few months have been especially challenging, and the deployment of technology in ways hitherto untested at an unrivaled pace has left the internet and technology watchers aghast,” Abhishek Gupta, founder of the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, said in the introduction to that organization’s inaugural State of AI Ethics report this June. “It has never been more important that we keep a sharp eye out on the development of this field and how it is shaping our society and interactions with each other.”
[ Do you understand the main types of AI? Read also: 5 artificial intelligence (AI) types, defined. ]
The CapGemini Research Institute looked at many of the ethical issues emerging at the enterprise level in its recent report, AI and the Ethical Conundrum: How organizations can build ethically robust AI systems and gain trust. “Now is a good time to talk about the ethics of these AI systems, because when those systems were initially implemented, they may not have been done with ethical considerations in mind,” Dan Simion, vice president of AI & Analytics for Capgemini North America, says of some of the most recent AI-enabled implementations. “Rather, the priority was to get them up and running from a pure productivity perspective. IT leaders need to go back and evaluate their AI systems that were deployed into production and evaluate if they are showing any unethical outcomes or AI biases.”
Looking forward, Simion says, CIOs can play a more pivotal role in making sure that ethical considerations are part of the conversation from the start. “In the future, it’s up to IT leaders to ensure that ethics are a part of the conversation from the beginning when deploying these AI systems – even when deployments are done quickly.” 
AI ethics, by the numbers - and implications for IT
We talked to Simion about a few of the most telling stats from his organization’s AI ethics research and what they mean for IT leaders:
Nine out of 10: This overwhelming majority of organizations said they were aware of at least one instance where an AI system had resulted in ethical issues for their business.
Not surprising, says Simion. “At the end of the day, the AI systems are relatively new. However, when companies see these unethical outcomes, they need to make sure their systems are more rigorously tested against those outcomes, including discriminatory bias.”
65 percent: Nearly two-thirds of executives said they are aware of the issue of discriminatory bias with AI systems, up from 35 percent last year. Leaders who are aware of these issues need to actively work to fix them to prevent these unethical outcomes from occurring with their customers in the future. “The awareness gives the organization visibility that there is a problem,” Simion says, “but it’s up to the organization to correct the problem.”
At the same time, more than three-quarters (78 percent) said they were aware of explainability, up from 32 percent last year. And 69 percent said they understood the issues of transparency in AI engagements, up from 36 percent in 2019.
Two-thirds: That’s the proportion of customers who say that they expect the AI models of organizations to be fair and free from prejudice and bias against them or any other person or group. An even higher number (71 percent) expect the AI system to be able to clearly explain results to them, and 67 percent said that they expect organizations to take ownership of their AI algorithms when they go wrong.
80 percent: The single-year jump in the number of organizations that have defined an ethical charter to provide guidelines on AI development. Almost half (45 percent) of organizations have one today, up from just five percent in 2019.
Simion attributes the sizable leap to a combination of factors. “First, the situation created by the pandemic resulted in a greater need for AI and more organizations utilizing these capabilities,” he says. “Second, now that consumers are interacting more with AI to avoid person-to-person contact, they are demanding that these interactions be ethical in nature.”
59 percent: That’s the number of organizations that informed users about the ways in which AI decisions might affect them this year. However, that’s about a 20 percent decrease from the nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of organizations that said they did so last year.
The reason? Likely, other priorities have superseded these efforts given the “significant changes and transformations that needed to take place to keep businesses operational when the pandemic began this year,” says Simion, who doesn’t see a cause for concern yet. “These initiatives to build AI systems that will inform users have just been pushed back as a result of the current circumstances.”
Six out of 10: That’s the number of organizations that have attracted legal scrutiny because of these decisions reached by AI systems. Another 22 percent say they have faced customer backlash as a result of AI-enabled actions or decisions.
As regulators begin to analyze the ethics of AI systems more closely, Simion expects the legal issues to increase in the days ahead. Conversely, he predicts customer backlash is prone to decrease given the fact that companies are going to continue to improve their systems and their transparency with the outcomes of AI. “As companies work to create systems that remove and avoid unethical AI bias,” he explains, “they will create more positive customer experiences.”

45 percent: That’s the number of consumers who, after having a negative AI experience, would tell family and friends and urge them not to engage with the organization. Nearly four out of ten (39 percent) would switch from the AI channel to a higher-cost human channel, and just over a quarter (27 percent) said they would stop dealing with the organization or trust it less.

Artificial intelligence has emerged as an increasingly important component of IT management.
In the past, planning and decision-making were based on performance data generated by the various machines in a data center. The expertise and experience of IT employees were key for using the available data for actual planning and decision-making activities. AI now provides an additional layer of experiential thinking that can synthesize many different metrics and data into intelligence that assists planning and decision-making.







Within data management, AI uses a variety of engines with programmed experience to analyze activities in many forms and generate actionable intelligence.

Traditional backup vs. backup and AI
AI that integrates with backup and recovery systems can provide a significant edge in planning and decision-making activities. For example, AI can initiate ""what if"" scenarios to address a variety of backup issues. IT administrators can then use this data to make more informed planning decisions.
Data passes through a backup process and routes to a variety of storage devices. The process gathers performance statistics for future review by IT administrators. Stats include what data the organization backs up, locations of the backups, dates and times of backups, and elapsed time needed to complete backups. The data backup system can also serve as the data recovery device if the organization needs stored data for an emergency requirement.






When you integrate backup and AI, the AI component sits between the data backup and recovery process and the performance data output mechanism. Depending on how the organization programs the AI, it can examine performance activities as the business backs up and retrieves data.






AI can provide a broad range of analytics, such as how the organization processes, examines and analyzes performance data. Administrators can then use results for a variety of activities, including resource planning, network planning and even disaster recovery plan development.


Tips for using AI in data backups
If your current backup and recovery systems do not have an AI component, consider whether AI-enabled systems are worth the investment. Perhaps your existing data backup vendor offers an AI upgrade. Key guidelines for integrating backup and AI include:

Determine what additional capabilities you require to enhance planning and decision-making, specifically those capabilities not currently available from existing backup systems.
Research AI capabilities from vendors for availability and additional cost.
Consider launching a test with a vendor to see if its capabilities generate the desired results and adaptability to your requirements.
Examine AI-based systems in use by other organizations.
Conduct an ROI analysis.
Perform a phased rollout of the AI-enabled technology to validate its capabilities based on the defined business requirements.
Ensure that you back up the new system in a secure location so it is protected in the event of a disaster.
Add the AI system to existing technology DR plans.
Include the AI system in future DR plan tests.

Earlier in 2020, Apple reportedly purchased Barcelona startup Vilynx, gaining expertise and technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.


Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report on Tuesday claims that the Barcelona, Spain based startup was purchased to enhance Apple's artificial intelligence work as a whole. A mission statement about the company says that the company can ""add rich metadata to enable search and social sharing."" 
The company also claims that the metadata makes convent instantly discoverable. Tailored information is provided to creators by the company's software to determine ""which portions of the video have the most views and which are not getting attention.""
The CrunchBase profile of the company was recently updated to reflect that the company is now in Palo Alto, California.

Co-founder Juan Carlos Riviero was interviewed in 2018, discussing the company and what it does.
""To be truly valuable to media companies, AI must offer an understanding of their content—  not just reams of crunched data or recognition of faces and buildings. That's exactly what the self-learning Vilynx brain does,"" said Riviero. ""Yes, it analyzes faces, processes speech, reads text and identifies buildings and places—  but then it takes the crucial step of putting all this into context.""
In a report on Tuesday, Bloomberg stated that Apple is intending to apply the technology to Siri and search. Apple's Photos could be improved with the technology to search stored video, and also, possibly for News and Apple TV apps for a recommendation engine.
The purchase is just the latest in a long chain of AI-related acquisitions that started with Perceptioin 2015. Apple went on to buy out Turi and Tuplejump in 2016, and Laserlike in 2019.
In January 2020, Apple purchased Xnor.ai, a specialist in low-power edge-based artificial intelligence. Later in the year, Apple purchased Inductiv, bringing AI to automatically identify and correct errors in large data sets.

Every day we are likely to interact with some form of artificial intelligence (AI). It works behind the scenes in everything from social media and traffic navigation apps to product recommendations and virtual assistants. 
AI systems can perform tasks or make predictions, recommendations or decisions that would usually require human intelligence. Their objectives are set by humans but the systems act without explicit human instructions.   
As AI plays a greater role in our lives both at work and at home, questions arise. How willing are we to trust AI systems? And what are our expectations for how AI should be deployed and managed?   
To find out, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of more than 2,500 Australians in June and July 2020. Our report, produced with KPMG and led by Nicole Gillespie, shows Australians on the whole don’t know a lot about how AI is used, have little trust in AI systems, and believe it should be carefully regulated. 
Most accept or tolerate AI, few approve or embrace it
Trust is central to the widespread acceptance and adoption of AI. However, our research suggests the Australian public is ambivalent about trusting AI systems. 
Nearly half of our respondents (45%) are unwilling to share their information or data with an AI system. Two in five (40%) are unwilling to rely on recommendations or other output of an AI system.

Further, many Australians are not convinced about the trustworthiness of AI systems, but more are likely to perceive AI as competent than to be designed with integrity and humanity.
Despite this, Australians generally accept (42%) or tolerate AI (28%), but few approve (16%) or embrace (7%) it.
Research and defence are more trusted with AI than business
When it comes to developing and using AI systems, our respondents had the most confidence in Australian universities, research institutions and defence organisations to do so in the public interest. (More than 81% were at least moderately confident.) 
Australians have least confidence in commercial organisations to develop and use AI (37% no or low confidence). This may be due to the fact that most (76%) believe commercial organisations use AI for financial gain rather than societal benefit.

These findings suggest an opportunity for businesses to partner with more trusted entities, such as universities and research institutions, to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in an ethical and trustworthy way that protects human rights. They also suggest businesses need to think further about how they can use AI in ways that create positive outcomes for stakeholders and society more broadly.

Regulation is required
Overwhelmingly (96%), Australians expect AI to be regulated and most expect external, independent oversight. Most Australians (over 68%) have moderate to high confidence in the federal government and regulatory agencies to regulate and govern AI in the best interests of the public.
However, the current regulation and laws fall short of community expectations.  
Our findings show the strongest driver of trust in AI is the belief that the current regulations and laws are sufficient to make the use of AI safe. However, most Australians either disagree (45%) or are ambivalent (20%) that this is the case. 

These findings highlight the need to strengthen the regulatory and legal framework governing AI in Australia, and to communicate this to the public, to help them feel comfortable with the use of AI. 
Australians expect AI to be ethically deployed
What do Australians expect when AI systems are deployed? Most of our respondents (more than 83%) have clear expectations of the principles and practices they expect organisations to uphold in the design, development and use of AI systems in order to be trusted. 
These include: 

high standards of robust performance and accuracy
data privacy, security and governance
human agency and oversight
transparency and explainability
fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination
accountability and contestability
risk and impact mitigation.

      Will we ever agree to just one set of rules on the ethical development of artificial intelligence?




Most Australians (more than 70%) would also be more willing to use AI systems if there were assurance mechanisms in place to bolster standards and oversight. These include independent AI ethics reviews, AI ethics certifications, national standards for AI explainability and transparency, and AI codes of conduct. 
Organisations can build trust and make consumers more willing to use AI systems, when they are appropriate, by clearly supporting and implementing ethical practices, oversight and accountability.
The AI knowledge gap
Most Australians (61%) report having a low understanding of AI, including low awareness of how and when it is used. For example, even though 78% of Australians report using social media, almost two in three (59%) were unaware that social media apps use AI. Only 51% report even hearing or reading about AI in the past year. This low awareness and understanding is a problem given how much AI is being used in our daily lives.

The good news is most Australians (86%) want to know more about AI. When we consider these factors together, there is a need and an appetite for a public literacy program in AI. 
One model for this comes from Finland, where a government-backed course in AI literacy aims to teach more than 5 million EU citizens. More than 530,000 students have enrolled in the course so far.

Overall, our findings suggest public trust in AI systems can be improved by strengthening the regulatory framework for governing AI, living up to Australians’ expectations of trustworthy AI, and strengthening Australia’s AI literacy.

Whenever new technologies change the way we work, some worry that their jobs are in jeopardy. And sometimes, new technologies do make certain jobs obsolete. Artificial intelligence is an emerging force in the business world that has the potential to either replace humans in certain industries or empower humans with better tools, depending on how the technology is utilized. And in the high-unemployment COVID era when the terms “outsourcing” and “AI” stoke fears for workforce stability and opportunity, there needs to be a more human-centered approach to workforce training and development.


Samasource, a training data and validation company based in San Francisco, believes AI can enhance how we work and is advocating for “human-in-the-loop,” a work model that requires human involvement even with advanced technology. “It's really this combination of human and artificial intelligence, or human-in-the-loop and machine learning, that will allow us to bring best-in-class technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges,” says Heather Gadonniex, the VP of Marketing & Strategic Partnerships at Samasource.

I spoke with Gadonniex as part of my research on purpose-driven business and to learn about how Samasource is using its advanced technology to enhance human-centered work and provide job opportunities to marginalized communities. Samasource is a Certified B Corporation, a company that has met certain social and environmental standards as verified by the nonprofit B Lab.

PROMOTED
Christopher Marquis: Some people worry that artificial intelligence will ultimately replace humans in the workforce. How is Samasource ensuring that AI is used to enhance human-centered work and not fully replace it?

Heather Gadonniex: Our philosophy is to use artificial intelligence to power and empower the human workforce. We firmly believe in up-skilling. We firmly believe in cross-skilling. And we firmly believe that artificial intelligence, or machine learning, is not necessarily going to negate the need for human involvement but will simply remove more mundane tasks from day-to-day workloads so that humans can focus on tasks that require higher cognition and focus on higher value areas of work.

It's really this combination of human and artificial intelligence, or human-in-the-loop and machine learning, that will allow us to bring best-in-class technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges. And in my opinion, we have enough challenges that need to be solved that we shouldn't shy away from using the power of technology to do that.

We're really embracing, advocating for, and being a voice in the market for this combination of machine intelligence and human intelligence, and at the same time ensuring that there is up-skilling and that there is cross-skilling. Because without that, you don't really have the ability to create environments or workplaces where people are learning the new skills they need to thrive in the next digital economy, or in today's digital economy even. That's really how we perceive this conflict between human and machine, if you will — less of a conflict and more of a collaboration.
Marquis: Can you share examples of up-skilling? What does that look like in practice?
Gadonniex: We have a very robust education program internally, called SamaU. So we use a combination of technology platforms plus face-to-face training, and we provide basic digital skills to get people familiarized with working in the digital economy. Because the majority of the workforce that we employ have never had a formal job before they are working in areas that are typically not exposed to the digital economy. For most of them, this is their first full time job that pays living wages. And that, in and of itself, has the power to transform economies, not just lives but full economies.
So, we provide our workers with basic digital skills, and then from there we actually provide ongoing training around topics that focus on machine learning, general artificial intelligence, and soft skills as well, like: How do you manage your finances? How do you become a better boss? How do you work in a professional environment? Many of them have never had the opportunity to learn how to actually manage a paycheck. Oftentimes, they've never even had a steady paycheck. So that soft skill training is equally important to the digital up-skilling and the technology skill training.
We also just completed a randomized control trial with MIT to validate the efficacy of this model. People who received training and employment at Samasource reported 10% lower unemployment rates and wages that are, on average, more than 25% higher than our control group. Our up-skilling programs, our full-time employment programs, and paying living wages had a particularly significant effect on women who received earnings 30% higher than the control group. If you look at economic development as a whole, that is so powerful.
Marquis: How has your business adapted during COVID? And do you have any recommendations for other businesses looking to adapt to these challenges? 
Gadonniex: We launched multiple initiatives through 2020 to ensure our employees were able to safely maintain their jobs and continued to deliver the secure, high quality training data that we're known for in the midst of this pandemic. Business continuity was extremely high on the priority list of our customers, especially during the start of COVID. And I think that that makes total sense given the situation. 
To ensure continuity, we create a program called Samahome, a partnership between Samasource and local hotels in Kenya and Uganda. We enabled our employees to work in safe environments during the height of the pandemic in these live-work arrangements. 
Our team members could opt in to live and work at Samahome. Before they entered the Samahome, everyone was checked to make sure they were healthy. We conducted ongoing health checks, practiced social distancing, and ensured that there were sanitization measures in place. 
We recently launched our work-from-home initiative, which actually provides our employees with the necessary resources to effectively work from home. We also have a few teams that are starting to work from our secured delivery centers again, and we're continuing to transition back for certain teams while maintaining social distancing protocols and health checks. The pandemic shifted our business model, so we are exploring maintaining a work-from-home model because this allows us to expand the amount of opportunity that we can provide to the communities in which we operate.

Did NASA Accept That Sanskrit Is The Best Suited Language For Computer Programming?

By Smriti Chaudhary -   October 30, 2020   






Share
FacebookTwitterWhatsAppReddIt










Social media is abuzz with hailing Sanskrit as the “best language” for computers, citing a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) researcher’s paper.
Were Haiti, Lebanon & Now Turkey Subjected To A Man-Made Earthquake Via HAARP Technology?

While there’s no backing for this claim, several netizens have believed it and even shared it. There’s no concrete information as to how the language can be used for coding or programming. 









Rick Briggs, a researcher at NASA wrote a paper in 1985 titled “Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence” that was published in AI Magazine.
The text from the paper reads – “There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigour until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence.”

He further explained the aim of the paper was to “demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been reinventing a wheel millennia-old”.








Sanskrit Text
It is important to understand that humans and computers understand different languages. “Natural Languages” are the languages understood by humans like English, Hindi and even Sanskrit. On the other hand, “Machine/Artificial languages” include Lisp or C or Prolog. The major goal of AI at that time was to reach a point where computers understand “natural languages”. 
Briggs just directed the attention towards Sanskrit as one of the natural languages that have existed for a very long time and have its expanse literature. Nowhere does Briggs said that it was “the best” or “the most suitable” language for computers.
NASA has not approved any such claims doing the rounds on social media. “Much of AI research has happened in Lisp, for example, because of its ability to manipulate words and sentences – but Lisp is nearly unheard of outside AI,” wrote Dilip D’Souza of The Scroll. 
He further emphasized that if Sanskrit had been a suitable language, there would have been a software written in Sanskrit by now. 
“Certainly the rigorous rules of Sanskrit grammar have lessons for AI, but writing software is another challenge altogether. The way computers are built requires a certain clear and unmistakable logic in how we give instructions to them. Nobody has yet found a way to do that in any natural language, whether Sanskrit or English,” he added.





However, Indian politician and economist, Subramanian Swamy had blamed the Americans “for globalized use” of the English language and that claimed that Sanskrit will replace English in fifty years.
While the validity of Mr. Swami’s claim will be known in the next fifty years, it can be conclusively said that the claim that Sanskrit is the “most suitable” or the “best” language for computers or AI is false.

Of all the areas of life where artificial intelligence will have an impact, the biggest might well be education. This is because learning is so important, and also because current provision often leaves a lot to be desired.


This is not generally the fault of teachers. They are the active ingredient in today’s education system, but they are expensive, and not scalable. In most countries they are under-valued, and burdened by absurd paperwork. They are also human, which means they are variable. Think back to your own school days: how many of your teachers were positively inspirational? As many as 10%? How many were unacceptable? That probably leaves a large majority somewhere between OK and mediocre. One of the tragedies of modern education is that constructive feedback for teachers is rarely given or sought.

The pedagogical dark ages
Classrooms today would be recognisable to the Victorians who invented them. A few decades from now we may look back on this period as the final years of the pedagogical dark ages. Some would even say that schools today are abusive: sitting still and quiet in military ranks for hours at a time is the absolute opposite of what children are hard-wired to do.

PROMOTED
As Donald Clark says in his new book, Artificial Intelligence for Learning, “Education is a bit of a slow learner.” Clark co-founded Epic Group in 1986, and made it the UK’s leading player in online learning. He floated it in 1996, and sold it again in 2005, since when he has been an investor, adviser, and commentator.

Flipped lessons
Clark lists a number of tools which are already available to improve the situation. With flipped lessons, students watch a video of a lecture for homework (and there is no reason why it can’t be the best such lecture ever given), and then put what they have been told into practice in the classroom. The teacher acts as coach and mentor, a more interactive role than lecturing. Competency-based learning requires students to have mastered a skill or a lesson before they move on to the next one; students within a class may progress at different speeds, and your educational stage is not rigidly determined by your age. As Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, points out, this means that everyone should get an ‘A’.

There is much we could already be doing to gamify the learning process, and to turbocharge it by having learners teach each other and learn from each other.

Another of the tools which should already be improving education is online learning. Julia Begbie is a director of KLC, the UK’s leading private design college, based in Chelsea, in London. She has spent a decade establishing KLC’s online learning capability, and she is an enthusiast: “Conventional wisdom says that online learning is characterised by isolation, plagiarism, low retention rates, shallow learning, poor quality teaching materials, and meaningless qualifications. Some of this was true in the past; increasingly it is simply wrong.”

KLC’s investment in online learning capability paid huge dividends this year. Like most educational institutions, it had to close its doors to students in March. “During the Easter holidays, we switched the entire school to online delivery. It was a huge challenge, but it worked. Not only did it ensure our ongoing success, but it also demonstrated to both staff and students that online learning has a number of positive advantages over the traditional, in-person variety. The results of our students who graduated in July 2020 have now been ratified by external examiners, and they are just as impressive as those of previous cohorts.”
One of these advantages is that every online learning communication, however insignificant, is captured and can be read, listened to, or watched again and again. As Donald Clark puts it, “online learning lies naked on the screen, open to scrutiny in a way that is rarely true in the classroom or lecture hall. This forces you to be clear, precise and accurate.”
Private schools ahead
The advantages of online learning, especially during a pandemic, have not been lost on the UK’s private schools (confusingly known as public schools, because their children are educated away from home, instead of by live-in governesses, or tutors making house calls.) Private schools have been pioneering with flipped lessons for years, and many of them maintained a far higher level of continuous education for their students during lockdown than state schools were able to. As a result, the UK’s education gap between the privileged 7% or so and the rest has surely widened this year.
Nevertheless, online learning is still young, and must improve. According to Donald Clark, It “remains stubbornly primitive, almost behavioural in approach. Even the gamification of content can be doggedly Pavlovian. … Most EdTech projects are mosquito projects: lots of buzz, tricky to spot, and short-lived.”
AI will transform education
Artificial intelligence will help. Indeed, in the coming decades, AI will transform education. Clark is confident that “AI can result in accelerating and reducing the cost of learning–even basic skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic–on a global scale. It will make past improvements in pedagogy look like rounding errors.” It is being kick-started by initiatives like the X Prize for Education, which awarded $15m of prizes last year to software startups who created scalable solutions that enable children to teach themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic within 15 months.
Clark says that bots (software robots) will take over an increasing range of education-related activities, including the recruitment of students, onboarding them in schools and universities, reminding and cajoling them to submit coursework, assessing some of their work, and even providing a certain amount of Socratic tuition. IBM provided the famous example of a teaching assistant chatbot named Jill Watson, (mis-named after legendary IBM CEO Tom Watson’s wife - her name was actually Jeanette). Students at Georgia Tech, a computing college, were guinea pigs in an experiment to see whether they would notice that one of their nine teaching assistants was a robot. Interestingly, when they finally twigged that “she” was too efficient to be human, they were not annoyed. Instead, they recommended “her” for a teaching award.
These chatbots are but a pale shadow of the astonishingly effective teachers and guides that our digital assistants will become. The descendants of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and the rest will have an encyclopedic knowledge of the curriculum we need to master, and they will understand better than we do which approach to learning suits us best, which times of day we are most receptive, and which times we are best left to relax or rest. Education will be less regimented, more flexible, and much more closely tailored to our individual preferences and needs. Above all, it will be more fun. And your digital assistant will find you just as endlessly fascinating as you find yourself.
Personalization is perhaps the greatest gift that AI will bring to learning. As KLC’s Julia Begbie puts it, “digitisation places commissioning control in the hands of the consumer.”
Virtual and augmented reality
AI will also help by enabling related technologies to realise their educational potential, including virtual reality and augmented reality. It will be much more compelling to learn about Napoleon by experiencing the battle of Waterloo, rather than by reading about it, or listening to a lecturer describe it. It will be much easier for a teacher to explain the molecular structure of alcohol by escorting her pupils around a VR model of it.
Perhaps ironically, AI could render education more natural, as well as more effective and more fun. Higher education in particular has become an exercise in intensive paper farming, with an exponential growth of text output. Talking is more natural for humans than writing, and advanced natural language processing technology can give us back frictionless dialogue.
Unfortunately, none of this will make learning trivially easy. Until we have advanced brain-computer interfaces, we won’t be able to simply upload knowledge and skills into our minds, like Neo learning Kung Fu in the Matrix. Elon Musk is surely over-optimistic in thinking that anything like that will be available in the next decade or three. We will still have to practice active recall to establish and strengthen memory.
Vacational, not vocational
But in a shorter time frame than that, we may well develop an economy of abundance, where the cost of everything you need for a very good standard of living is close to zero. The economy of abundance is probably what we need in order to survive and thrive when technological unemployment arrives. In a system of fully automated luxury capitalism, education will become “vacational” not “vocational”, and much more important than it is today. Maybe, when you meet someone at a party, instead of asking what they do for a living, you will ask them what they are learning.

Notably, the pandemic is expected to significantly accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Have you read?5 charts showing the jobs of a post-pandemic future – and the skills you need to get themWhat you need to know about education, skills and life-long learningHow artificial intelligence is redefining the role of managerThis is because the coronavirus crisis forced people to stay at home and minimize contact to contain the spread of infection. As a result, contactless technology will become even more widespread in society.The technologies that will disseminate fastest are in digital transformation (DX), including online conferencing, virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR), robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones and automated driving. It was the Fourth Industrial Revolution that supported the rapid development of all these technologies.So, what are the consequences of this acceleration the Fourth Industrial Revolution caused by the coronavirus crisis? Massive unemployment will occur because the technologies of robotics, AI, drones and automated driving that are proliferating in society in response to the crisis. This revolution will take jobs away from many workers in a variety of occupations.Those who are engaged in simple manual work that can be replaced by technologies such as robots, drones, and automated driving will lose their jobs. However, these people can probably get new jobs by learning slightly more advanced skills in manual labour, even if their jobs are eliminated.A more serious unemployment issue created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the prospect of many workers previously engaged in the knowledge economy losing their jobs to rapidly developing AI.Notably, many of those to be thrown out of work are people engaged in jobs that depend on the application of professional knowledge and judgement based on logical thinking – two skills in which AI has an overwhelming advantage. Lawyers, accountants, doctors, pharmacists, and other professions are no exception.There’s widespread belief that robots will take the jobs of humans. Image: Mckinsey & CompanySo what kind of abilities should we develop in the coming years, given the rapid progress of the Fourth Industrial Revolution? And what abilities should nations and businesses focus on in their human resource development?While a broad range of discussions have taken place at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, and the Global Agenda Council, many experts are in agreement over the three advanced abilities that cannot be substituted by AI: hospitality, management and creativity.In reality, however, rapidly developing AI technologies are going to replace these three abilities at rudimentary levels. Therefore, we need to acquire and refine more sophisticated abilities in these areas so they cannot be replaced by AI.With regards to hospitality, AI can easily take over standardized services based on verbal communication, such as reception and information services. For this reason, humans will need to acquire more advanced hospitality skills.First is the ability to undertake non-verbal communication. In other words, we need to improve our ability to listen to the silent voice of customers, to grasp what they are feeling and communicate warm feelings that transcend words. Second is the ability to show deep empathy to customers. This is the most important ability that enables us to exercise our non-verbal communication skills at the highest level. Needless to say, these two skills can never be replaced by AI.Secondly, with regards to management, AI is set to replace workers in tasks such as financial management, materials management, human resource management and project management, areas in which AI’s abilities are expected to exceed those of humans in the future. This will direct people towards more advanced management tasks that cannot be replaced by AI. The following two abilities play a key role in this area.First is the ability to undertake growth management. This is the ability to support organization members to develop their skills and grow professionally, and this is founded on coaching ability.Second is the ability to employ mind management. This is the ability to support the recovery of organization members in distress when they suffer from issues arising from interpersonal relationships or other problems, and it is founded on counselling skills. Both of these skills, which can never be replaced by AI, will be extremely important for managers and leaders in the workplace in the forthcoming Advanced Knowledge Society.Regarding creativity, AI will never be able to substitute genius: comprising skills such as the invention of innovative technology and the proposition of novel designs. Such abilities are, however, out of reach for most individuals. So what constitutes creativity, which everyone can demonstrate in the age of AI? First is the ability to perform collective intelligence management. This is the ability of leaders to manage organization members by putting them together, encouraging them to share their knowledge and wisdom, and facilitating the emergence of new knowledge and wisdom arising from that process. The vital elements that enable the demonstration of this skill are the ability to express a vision that excites members of your organization; and the ability to undertake ego management, creating a forum where members can transcend the individual and cooperate with one another. Second is the ability to realize new ideas in an organization. This is the ability to go beyond simply proposing new ideas, to attractively explain the idea, skillfully persuade the boss, and move the organization forward smoothly to implement the idea.In fact, the creativity that is truly required in a corporate organization involves much more than the ability to propose new ideas. It also requires the two other abilities that can never be replaced by AI: the ability to perform collective intelligence management and the ability of realizing new ideas in an organization.DiscoverWhat is the World Economic Forum doing about the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

Enterprises seeing real success with artificial intelligence have something in common: they are capable of learning quickly from their successes or failures and re-applying those lessons into the mainstream of their businesses.


Of course, there’s nothing new about the ability to rinse, learn and repeat, which has been a fundamental tenet of business success for ages. But because AI is all about real-time, nanosecond responsiveness to a range of things, from machines to markets, the ability to leap and learn at a blinding pace has taken on a new urgency.

At this moment, only 10% of companies are seeing financial benefits from their AI initiatives, a survey of 3,000 executives conducted by Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review finds. There is a lot of AI going around: more than half, 57%, piloting or deploying AI — up from 46% in 2017. In addition, at least 70% understand the business value proposition of AI. But financial results have been elusive.

PROMOTED
So, what are the enlightened 10% doing to finally realize actual, tangible gains from AI? They do all the right things, of course, but there’s an extra piece of the magic thrown in. For instance, scaling AI — seen as the path to enterprise adoption — has only limited value by itself. “Adding the ability to embed AI into processes and solutions improves the likelihood of significant benefits dramatically, but only to 39%,” the survey shows.

Successful AI adopters have figured out how to learn from their AI experiences and apply them in forward-looking ways to their businesses, the survey report’s authors, led by Sam Ransbotham, conclude. “Our survey analysis demonstrates that leaders share one outstanding feature — they intend to become more adept learners with AI.” This ability to learn and understand the potential and pitfalls of AI enable them to “sense and respond quickly and appropriately to changing conditions, such as a new competitor or a worldwide pandemic, are more likely to take advantage of those disruptions.”

In other words, they give executives and employees the space they need to better understand, adjust and adapt to AI-driven processes — and figure out their roles in making it all work. Automation is not thrust upon them with no preparation or training. “Realizing significant financial benefits with AI requires far more than a foundation in data, infrastructure, and talent,” the researchers state. “Even embedding AI in business processes is not enough.”

Those organizations that lead the way with AI success pursue the following strategies:
They facilitate systematic and continuous learning between humans and machines. “Organizational learning with AI isn’t just machines learning autonomously. Or humans teaching machines. Or machines teaching humans,” Ransbotham and his co-authors state. “It’s all three. Organizations that enable humans and machines to continuously learn from each other with all three methods are five times more likely to realize significant financial benefits than organizations that learn with a single method.”
They develop multiple ways for humans and machines to interact. “Deploying the appropriate interaction modes in the appropriate context is critical,” the co-authors state. “For example, some situations may require an AI system to make a recommendation and humans to decide whether to implement it. Some context-rich environments may require humans to generate solutions and AI to evaluate the quality of those solutions.”
They change to learn, and learn to change. Successful initiatives “don’t just change processes to use AI; they change processes in response to what they learn with AI.”
AI has great potential to expand our visions of where and how businesses can deliver greater service in the months and years ahead. But it requires more than simply installing new systems and processes and waiting to see the results. It’s a continuous process of improvement and innovation,

 How Artificial Intelligence helps Huawei build green data centres



Mark Bowen | 23 October, 2020









Huawei tells Intelligent CIO how and why it is using Artificial Intelligence in data centres to promote green tech adoption, reduce repetitive work, monitor and manage fragmented resources which might otherwise easily be overlooked.
Data centres are being overhauled, revamped and modernised to support Digital Transformation and the power-hungry cloud deployments they contain.
Artificial Intelligence is a key part of this overhaul as energy conservation – to address both cost and environmental concerns – becomes a top consideration for data centres. AI solutions are being deployed in the push to get data centres to become more energy efficient as well as safer and more reliable.
The growth in data traffic volumes shows no sign of letting up, nor does the global demand for high-performance computing. This comes with an increase in high-density servers, the use of graphics processing units and specialised AI processing chips and all of these generate significantly more heat than traditional CPUs. It leads data centres then to require even more power to dissipate the heat they generate. It’s no surprise then that heat dissipation and energy management have become a vital topic for the data centre industry.
A data centre’s power usage effectiveness or PUE, is seen as a key indicator for evaluating its energy efficiency. The PUE value rises as the data centre becomes less efficient. Huawei’s cloud data centre in Ulanqab, for example, achieves an annual PUE as low as 1.15, and is seen as a good example of how green data centres should be built.
Huawei has leveraged Machine Learning to develop its iCooling intelligent thermal management solution for data centre infrastructure and address the energy consumption issue. The iCooling system incorporates Deep Learning to analyse historical data and identify key factors which affect energy consumption and create a PUE prediction. An optimisation algorithm then establishes the ideal parameters which are transmitted to various control systems.
At Huawei’s cloud data centre Langfang in China, the deployment of iCooling has resulted in a PUE that is eight percent lower than it previously was, meaning a big saving in annual power costs. And at a China Mobile data centre in Ningxia the introduction of iCooling technology has reduced the data centre’s total energy consumption by 3.2%, saving more than 400,000 kWh of electricity a year. According to Huawei, as data centre loads increase and AI learning capability improves, six million kWh of electricity will be saved in the data centre every year, the equivalent to a reduction of about three million kilogrammes of carbon dioxide emissions.
While improved power management is a striking example of the value of AI to the data centre industry, Artificial Intelligence is proving hugely valuable in the management of data centres in other ways. It’s used to improve the safety and reliability of data centres.
Prior to the introduction of AI, fault detection would need to be done on a case by case basis, isolating the faulty component. By collecting information from the power supply and distribution systems, AI can predict impending device and component failure, warn operations and maintenance personnel and furnish additional information to assist decision making.
Huawei’s iPower intelligent power supply and distribution technology, for example, can detect and isolate faults and then recover from them at sub-second speeds, improving the reliability of the data centre’s power infrastructure and reducing the risk of fire. iPower also accurately predicts battery life span and health, allowing preventative maintenance before any failure occurs.
Artificial Intelligence can also be used to in the data centre to reduce repetitive work and to monitor and manage fragmented resources which might otherwise easily be overlooked. Huawei’s iManager data centre infrastructure management system uses intelligent hardware and IoT sensors to manage power, cooling and space to optimise utilisation, with AI managing the allocation and operation of assets. It’s estimated that iManager increases the resource utilisation rate by 20%. iManager also supports network management, with centralised management for multiple data centres across different locations. As edge data centres increase in popularity, iManager can be used to reduce the need for site visits, thus improving the efficiency of data centre management.
Research from the McKinsey Global Institute finds that AI has the potential to add about US$13 trillion to global economic activity by 2030, and to boost global GDP by 1.2 percent a year. AI is spurring profound and potentially disruptive changes in the world, and data centres are no exception. The use of AI is leading to safer, more reliable, energy efficient and cleaner data centres. And with the data centre industry forecast to grow by as much as 15% over the next five years, according to M Capital Group, this can only be a good thing.

As I settled into my new life, I found myself spending more hours with my laptop than with any other human being.
I felt isolated and incredibly homesick. Chatting online with my family back home, I was often in tears, but they had no idea how I was feeling behind my screen (with the exception of a sad face emoticon that I would send).
I realised then that our technology and devices – which we consider to be “smart"", and helpful in many aspects of our lives – are emotion blind. Technology has a high IQ, but no EQ, no emotional intelligence, and that comes with a cost.
Face-to-face, people share so much emotion and meaning beyond the words they say, through facial expressions, gestures, vocal intonations.

Why is social isolation so hard?
Why social media makes us so angry, and what you can do about it

But online, we’re relegated to texts, emojis, and one-dimensional expressions of how we feel. All of the richness of our communication disappears in cyberspace, making it more difficult to meaningfully and empathetically connect with one another.
That issue is even more pressing now that we’ve all been separated from each other by social distancing. We’re leaning on technology to stay in touch with loved ones, to work and learn remotely, and everything in between. But we all know it doesn’t feel the same. This begs the question: what can we do to preserve our humanity and our emotions in a digital world?
I believe that we can harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to redesign technology to not mask these elements of what makes us human, but emphasise them. I’ve staked my career on this idea, and believe that AI with emotional intelligence – “Emotion AI” – will become ingrained in the fabric of the devices we use every day.

There’s a rapidly evolving market around Emotion AI: software that can detect nuanced human emotions and complex cognitive states from people’s facial and vocal expressions.
As with any new technology, we need to be thoughtful about how Emotion AI is developed, and where it is deployed, given the highly personal and private nature of people’s emotions. But I fundamentally believe that this technology has the power to amplify our empathy, online and offline, if applied mindfully and deliberately.
So, what would an emotionally intelligent digital world look like?
One area I’ve been thinking a lot about recently is online conferences and virtual meetings. Like everyone else, I have spent more than my fair share of hours on Zoom over the past few months while my company, Affectiva, is remote, and many conferences where I was scheduled to speak have shifted to virtual.

When I’m leading a team meeting or presenting a keynote in person, I’m able to take a pulse on how the audience is feeling based on the energy in the room.
I can riff off of signs of interest or excitement if I see people’s faces light up at an idea; or I can change course if I sense that people are becoming bored or zoning out. But presenting online is like being in a vacuum. I have no idea how people are reacting to what I’m saying, or if they’re even paying attention.
If online video platforms were built with Emotion AI, we could restore some of the energy and emotion that’s lost, and make meetings and conferences much more engaging as a result. If participants were willing to turn on their device’s camera, and opted in to using Emotion AI, the technology could decipher people’s emotional expressions and aggregate that data in real time.
Picture an emotion newsfeed or graph that skyrocketed when attendees were excited or smiling, and tapered off when they became bored or disengaged. Not only would that insight help me as a presenter; but also, it could give attendees a sense of the energy in the (virtual) meeting room, helping restore the camaraderie we feel at in-person events or meetings.

The applications of Emotion AI aren’t limited to our work lives, though. Equally, if not more exciting, is its potential to bolster our interpersonal communications, and help us interact with each other more meaningfully. That drove one of the very first applications of Emotion AI that I explored: building an Emotion AI application for autism.
People on the autism spectrum often struggle with recognising and responding to non-verbal communications and emotions. But Emotion AI could be used as a tool to help people learn to navigate challenging social and emotional situations. Picture smart glasses with Emotion AI built in, that could give the wearer insight into the emotions of people they’re interacting with.
Companies are already turning this idea into reality. For example, a company called Brain Power is developing the world’s first augmented smart glass system (powered by Emotion AI) for kids and students on the autism spectrum.
The results are powerful: parents recount stories of being able to connect with their kids on an emotional level that was previously unimaginable, and the impact that has is incredibly moving.Rana el Kaliouby © Remi Carlioz Photography
Another exciting application is in the automotive industry, where Emotion AI can improve road safety. Each year, dangerous driving behaviour (such as drowsy and distracted driving) causes thousands of accidents and fatalities in the UK alone.
Automakers are turning to Emotion AI to address these issues, by developing in-vehicle systems that use Emotion AI to detect signs of distracted or drowsy driving. The idea is that, if a vehicle recognised that its driver was starting to doze off, or was becoming distracted, the system could send an alert to remind the driver to keep their eyes on the road or pull over if the behaviour reaches a dangerous point.
Beyond making our roads safer, Emotion AI could also improve the transportation experience. Automakers are exploring in-cabin sensing systems that can understand the state of the driver, the cabin, and the occupants in it, in order to optimise and personalise the ride.
For example, after a long day at work, your car might be able to sense if you’re tired or stressed. Perhaps it could play soothing music, or recommend stopping for take-out from your favourite restaurant on the way home.

Future technology: 22 ideas about to change our world

When I think about the future with Emotion AI, I envision a world where the de-facto human-machine interface more closely mirrors the way humans interact: through conversation, perception and empathy.
I believe this technology will be built into the fabric of the devices we use each day, ranging from our phones to our cars, our smart fridges to our smart speakers… in turn, making our lives safer, healthier and more productive; while making our interactions with others more meaningful and empathetic.
Still, we cannot ignore the potential risks of AI. We need to be deliberate in recognising them and mitigating them. Human-centric AI systems – including Emotion AI – deal with data that is highly personal, and we may not (and should not) always be okay with that.
For example, I feel strongly that AI should not be deployed for use cases like security or surveillance, where there is no opportunity for people to opt-in and consent. Beyond considering how AI is deployed, it’s critical for the tech industry to examine how AI is developed.

The risk of bias in AI is a significant concern: if AI is not built with diverse data, and by a diverse team, they will fail to recognise all people, and stand to disenfranchise those they interact with.
It’s up to tech leaders to come together and establish standards for AI ethics, and to advocate for thoughtful regulation. The industry still has a ways to go, but this movement is critical in order to realise the positive potential of this technology.
At the end of the day, we need to put the human before the artificial – both in arming our technology with emotional intelligence and in determining the role it will play in our world.

Humans have been teaming up with machines throughout history to achieve goals, be it by using simple machines to move materials or complex machines to travel in space. But advances in artificial intelligence today bring possibilities for even more sophisticated teamwork — true human-machine teams that cooperate to solve complex problems.
Much of the development of these human-machine teams focuses on the machine, tackling the technology challenges of training AI algorithms to perform their role in a mission effectively. But less focus, MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers say, has been given to the human side of the team. What if the machine works perfectly, but the human is struggling?
""In the area of human-machine teaming, we often think about the technology — for example, how do we monitor it, understand it, make sure it's working right. But teamwork is a two-way street, and these considerations aren't happening both ways. What we're doing is looking at the flip side, where the machine is monitoring and enhancing the other side — the human,"" says Michael Pietrucha, a tactical systems specialist at the laboratory. 
Pietrucha is among a team of laboratory researchers that aims to develop AI systems that can sense when a person's cognitive fatigue is interfering with their performance. The system would then suggest interventions, or even take action in dire scenarios, to help the individual recover or to prevent harm. 
""Throughout history, we see human error leading to mishaps, missed opportunities, and sometimes disastrous consequences,"" says Megan Blackwell, former deputy lead of internally funded biological science and technology research at the laboratory. ""Today, neuromonitoring is becoming more specific and portable. We envision using technology to monitor for fatigue or cognitive overload. Is this person attending to too much? Will they run out of gas, so to speak? If you can monitor the human, you could intervene before something bad happens.""
This vision has its roots in decades-long research at the laboratory in using technology to ""read"" a person's cognitive or emotional state. By collecting biometric data — such as video and audio recordings of a person speaking — and processing these data with advanced AI algorithms, researchers have uncovered biomarkers of various psychological and neurobehavioral conditions. These biomarkers have been used to train models that can accurately estimate the level of a person's depression, for example.
In this work, the team will apply their biomarker research to AI that can analyze an individual's cognitive state, encapsulating how fatigued, stressed, or overloaded a person is feeling. The system will use biomarkers derived from physiological data such as vocal and facial recordings, heart rate, EEG and optical indications of brain activity, and eye movement to gain these insights.
The first step will be to build a cognitive model of an individual. ""The cognitive model will integrate the physiological inputs and monitor the inputs to see how they change as a person performs particular fatiguing tasks,"" says Thomas Quatieri, who leads several neurobehavioral biomarker research efforts at the laboratory. ""Through this process, the system can establish patterns of activity and learn a person's baseline cognitive state involving basic task-related functions needed to avoid injury or undesirable outcomes, such as auditory and visual attention and response time.""
Once this individualized baseline is established, the system can start to recognize deviations from normal and predict if those deviations will lead to mistakes or poor performance.
""Building a model is hard. You know you got it right when it predicts performance,"" says William Streilein, principal staff in the Lincoln Lab's Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division. ""We've done well if the system can identify a deviation, and then actually predict that the deviation is going to interfere with the person's performance on a task. Humans are complex; we compensate naturally to stress or fatigue. What's important is building a system that can predict when that deviation won't be compensated for, and to only intervene then.""
The possibilities for interventions are wide-ranging. On one end of the spectrum are minor adjustments a human can make to restore performance: drink coffee, change the lighting, get fresh air. Other interventions could suggest a shift change or transfer of a task to a machine or other teammate. Another possibility is using transcranial direct current stimulation, a performance-restoring technique that uses electrodes to stimulate parts of the brain and has been show to be more effective than caffeine in countering fatigue, with fewer side effects.
On the other end of the spectrum, the machine might take actions necessary to ensure the survival of the human team member when the human is incapable of doing so. For example, an AI teammate could make the ""ejection decision"" for a fighter pilot who has lost consciousness or the physical ability to eject themselves. Pietrucha, a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force who has had many flight hours as a fighter/attack aviator, sees the promise of such a system that ""goes beyond the mere analysis of flight parameters and includes analysis of the cognitive state of the aircrew, intervening only when the aircrew can't or wont,"" he says. 
Determining the most helpful intervention, and its effectiveness, depends on a number of factors related to the task at hand, dosage of the intervention, and even a user's demographic background. ""There's a lot of work to be done still in understanding the effects of different interventions and validating their safety,"" Streilein says. ""Eventually, we want to introduce personalized cognitive interventions and assess their effectiveness on mission performance.""
Beyond its use in combat aviation, the technology could benefit other demanding or dangerous jobs, such as those related to air traffic control, combat operations, disaster response, or emergency medicine. ""There are scenarios where combat medics are vastly outnumbered, are in taxing situations, and are as every bit as tired as everyone else. Having this kind of over-the-shoulder help, something to help monitor their mental status and fatigue, could help prevent medical errors or even alert others to their level of fatigue,"" Blackwell says.
Today, the team is pursuing sponsorship to help develop the technology further. The coming year will be focused on collecting data to train their algorithms. The first subjects will be intelligence analysts, outfitted with sensors as they play a serious game that simulates the demands of their job. ""Intelligence analysts are often overwhelmed by data and could benefit from this type of system,"" Streilein says. ""The fact that they usually do their job in a 'normal' room environment, on a computer, allows us to easily instrument them to collect physiological data and start training.""
""We'll be working on a basic set of capabilities in the near term,"" Quatieri says, ""but an ultimate goal would be to leverage those capabilities so that, while the system is still individualized, it could be a more turnkey capability that could be deployed widely, similar to how Siri, for example, is universal but adapts quickly to an individual."" In the long view, the team sees the promise of a universal background model that could represent anyone and be adapted for a specific use. 
Such a capability may be key to advancing human-machine teams of the future. As AI progresses to achieve more human-like capabilities, while being immune from the human condition of mental stress, it's possible that humans may present the greatest risk to mission success. An AI teammate may know just how to lift its partner up.

The rise of AI in the workplace has the potential to improve some aspects of work – such as repetitive and dangerous tasks – but much of the public discussion has focused on AI’s potential to displace workers and the grave impacts this could pose to their livelihoods and quality of life.Less discussed – but equally important – is how AI can also be part of the solution to train, upskill, and reskill employees, future-proofing and preparing them for the future of work. Disruption and automationThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2020 found as automation increases, the amount of time spent on tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal in just five years. According to the report, 85 million jobs will be displaced across 26 countries and 15 industries by 2025, and more than 80% of employers expect to make wider use of remote work and to digitize work processes. In other words, even with no further advances of AI, today’s workers will face enormous disruptions as labour markets are transformed by automation tools already on the market.The challenge ahead will be even greater for two reasons: First, COVID-19 has taken an enormous toll on the global economy, leading to an estimated loss of 14% of working hours or approximately 400 million full-time jobs in the second quarter of 2020. Second, far from remaining static, automation technologies are being developed and commercialized at an accelerating pace during the pandemic, and their capacities are expanding as they harness growing quantities of data, computing power, and experience. A positive futureDespite these significant headwinds, AI holds great potential for workers and the future of labour. The Future of Jobs Report found that 97 new million jobs that are adapted to the new division of labour between humans and machines could be created by 2025. Instead of worrying about job displacement, we should get to work creating the new, high-quality jobs of tomorrow while massively expanding our upskilling and reskilling efforts to transition displaced workers into these new opportunities. This is where AI can help solve some of the very problems it helped create. Fortunately, a new cohort of purpose-driven AI innovators has begun mobilizing to ensure that workers around the world share not only in the risks that AI poses but also its powerful benefits. Here are four ways that AI is helping create a just transition to a positive future of work:1. Invest in reskilling and upskillingSome AI start-ups are focused directly on reskilling and upskilling today’s workers, using AI algorithms to create personalized training programmes that build on workers’ existing skillsets to prepare them for future opportunities that leverage technology. For example, California-based EdCast combines a detailed assessment of workers’ skills with data-driven analysis of future labour market needs, allowing users to identify potential future jobs and gain the skills and qualifications they need to secure them.2. Embed learning into everyday activitiesOther innovators are focused on embedding learning into everyday work activities so that workers are continuously growing their skillsets and expanding their capacity to fulfil future workforce needs. For example, Canadian start-up Axonify has pioneered the idea of ‘microlearning’ in which employees spend three to five minutes per shift on learning and performance improvement activities that are matched to their individual needs by an AI algorithm.3. Match workers to new opportunitiesWhile AI-driven reskilling can help prepare workers for the disruptions underway, there is still an enormous need to match workers to new opportunities being created. AI can help here too, and start-ups like SkyHive and Kalido have created AI-driven platforms that connect workers to new opportunities within and outside their current organizations, based on their individual skillsets, career goals, and retraining needs.4. Prepare the next generation of workersAI is not only being used to future-proof today’s workers and match them with tomorrow’s opportunities but also to prepare the next generation of workers for a future disrupted and transformed by technology. Recent years have seen an explosion in AI-powered education technology (EdTech) tools to improve learning outcomes at the K-12 level, primarily in the developed world but increasingly amongst less privileged populations. For example, New Delhi-based start-up ConveGenius has targeted the 100 million students in India with the most limited access to quality teaching, using AI to assess each student’s learning needs and deliver the educational content they need to succeed as workers and citizens. Scores of other start-ups are racing to address this significant business challenge and seize the opportunity to upskill and reskill workers for the future. AI as part of the solution No single technology will solve all the problems facing workers today. Achieving a just transition to a positive future of work will require smart government policies, ambitious corporate programs, and individual action by workers in addition to new technologies. But as we work to improve our responses to the disruptions underway, we should encourage innovators and entrepreneurs to focus on new ways to use AI technologies to empower the workers of today and create exciting new opportunities for the workers of tomorrow.Don't miss any update on Davos AgendaSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Earlier this year, I discussed how IoT and internet access companies are working to better understand how to provide better service in the connected home. This article moves up stream to look at how the cable industry is working to provide better infrastructure support through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). As the current pandemic is showing, many people were not prepared for the change of network demand that moved from offices to home, and the industry is looking at improving services even as demands become more variable and the underlying technology changes.


Internet broadband access has become a required utility. The pandemic has, hopefully, pointed out to elected officials the importance of that critical infrastructure. Chris Bastian, CTO, SCTE•ISBE (The Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers, International Society of Broadband Experts), says that 80% of US households now have access to 1gbs broadband access. Those missing it are primarily rural and in the inner city, so are most at risk of being left behind as the digital divide expands.

As the nation works on expanding high speed access, the cable industry is working to ensure they can meet the needs and provide appropriate service levels. On the pure hardware side, fiber continues to move into the backbone, but is also still a problem in the “last mile”, in the connectivity to homes. That means there are nodes near residences that convert between fiber and coaxial cable. Mr. Bastian points that there are more than 70 types of fiber/coax node enclosures, with some service providers having more than 40 in their systems. Downstream of those nodes are, of course, the wide variety of modems that exist in household and businesses, and the operators must be able to identify and work with those. While SCTE•ISBE is working with industry members to develop a standard fiber/coax node, managers in all industries can all understand that this issue isn’t one that will disappear tomorrow.

PROMOTED
SCTE•ISBE has created a working group to look at multiple aspects of where AI and machine learning (ML) can help diagnose issues to improve routing, preventative maintenance and problem diagnostics. In support of the importance of AI to the industry, the working group includes network operators such as Charter, Comcast, Cox, Rogers and more. Even IBM, Fujitsu, and other non-industry companies have joined in order to both bring their expertise and understand where the cable industry is heading.

An example of some early work on the problem was provided by Elad Nafshi, Senior Vice President, Next Generation Access Networks, Comcast. Prior to the pandemic, the company developed a system called Octave to collect and analyze network information. Mr. Nafshi said they tested the system checks modem usage and can adjust network and modem performance in order to optimize network performance.

Performance adjustments aren’t only based on demand. “Without machine learning, LTE interference on networks is a transient issue that is hard to track, and could be even harder to resolve,” said Elad Nafshi. “In other cases noise can originate in a loose connector in one household and then propagate upstream to impact neighborhood performance. The ability of our Octave platform to quickly identify those issues and have the network adapt in real time based on the automated analytics engine is extremely valuable to ensure that we’re delivering the best performance and maximum possible capacity to customers.”

An interesting comment by Mr. Nafshi was how Comcast is trying to balance in-house code versus calls to AWS tools, as the latter have a direct cost that drives OPEX. The ROI decisions between build versus buy have not left us in the AI age and will remain a challenge for companies of all sizes.

It helps you prepare them for higher duties — all of which can lead to business growth..However, just like in most things in life, employee training needs to be done the right way..The often-methodical and homogenized nature of employee training sessions disrupts your employees' learning pathways..This makes your training ineffective,widening your workplace skills gap and preventing them from fully attaining your desired training outcomes.If that describes your company's state right now, then it's time you level up your personnel's learning rates with an innovative solution: artificial intelligence..See eight ways AI plays a tremendous role in your employee training:.1. Enhances staff training.AI enhances your employee training sessions with unique and innovative learning methods. It can even offer feedback on your workers' areas for improvement..For instance, leverage the AI's machine learning capabilities with speech-to-text. This lets you comment on your staff's presentation in terms of their speaking speed, number of word fillers said, mentioned keywords, and others..You can even use augmented reality for practical ways to develop your staff's soft skills and give immediate feedback on their presentation..Additionally, program bots to pick up on lessons opened up by employees, tag them contextually, and disseminate them to others who previously hinted their interest in the subject..2. Improves learning efficiencies.AI-powered tutors can streamline and increase the efficiency of your staff training and learning processes.&nbsp;.As digital tutors, AI can imitate the interaction between a veteran professional and a beginner.&nbsp;.With its Natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, AI can engage in conversations that sound humanlike and suitable to your staff, relaying pieces of knowledge effectively..The result is that you shorten your employees' learning curves and the duration it takes for them to become experts in your required technical skills, boosting their work performance and helping you reach your business goals sooner..3. Personalizes employees' learning track.Every year since 2014, Donald Taylor, Chair of the Learning and Performance Institute, has asked leadership and development (L&amp;D) professionals through the Leadership and Development Global Sentiments Survey what they think the L&amp;D growth area and trend will be next year..For 2019, one of the respondents' top answers was personalization.&nbsp;.This shows how L&amp;D professionals think a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach isn't going to be as effective anymore in learning as before. After all, each person learns best using their preferred learning styles and methods..Thankfully, AI helps in delivering personalized learning and training sessions.&nbsp;.For instance, AI empowers the educational sector with individualized student behavior profiles, training materials, and teaching methods based on pupils' capacities and experiences..AI can do the same for the L&amp;D category and your employee training..It can better comprehend learning behaviors and forecast needs through its machine learning abilities through content positioning and recommendation based on those past behaviors..That way, employees will receive different training approaches based on their job responsibilities, previous learning styles and experiences, educational background, etc..AI also makes your training sessions more flexible. For instance, it can transcribe video tutorials into narratives for some employees, offer learning videos for others, gamify the lessons, give audio-guided presentations, train in person, and more..AI can even customize training quizzes and assessment measures. Able to evaluate individual capacities and learning progress, AI can tailor the next course content according to the test results..Doing so shortens your employees' learning curve and ensures they effectively absorb the knowledge you're relaying, so they can correctly use it to improve their work performance..4. Boosts completion rate.Completion rates in online training classes are often low. On Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), data shows that fewer than 4% of all their learners finished the entirety of courses in 2017 to 2018..Maximize trained AI and machine learning to give relevant training content in your employees' desired learning formats (such as audio, text, video, etc)..That way, they can more easily retain their interest in the session, digest the lessons, and finish the whole course productively..5. Scales your training content building.Researching, developing, and finding extensive training content consumes much time and effort, especially for dynamic organizations..That is why they often end up getting training materials externally to save more time. These resources, though, are not always perfectly suited to your company's needs..With a properly trained AI system, you can instantly design content or obtain the right resources both internally and online, resulting in interactive, applicable training lessons..For instance, if your employee needs to study how a conveyor belt works, the AI scours the Internet for research papers and other reliable materials. It then displays snippets from the sources for quicker learning..What's more, AI can dig for and extract relevant details and transform them into readable formats appropriate for studying.&nbsp;.With this automated process, the AI does most of the grunt work of course development, so your instructors can devote more time and attention to course design and delivery..6. Increases training accessibility.Developing training courses in ways convenient for your disabled employees takes numerous hours, which is why most content is better designed for the able-bodied staff..AI can provide accessible learning courses and experiences. Through advanced web or app accessibility features, AI adapts to the employees' impairment and enables their functioning senses in learning..Like YouTube, use AI to create and display captions instantly, automate text translation to several foreign languages, and others..Another example is Microsoft's Seeing AI app, which acts as the third pair of visually disabled people's eyes. It describes the scenes, currencies, other persons and their emotions, documents, short texts, colors, and more, wherever their smartphone camera is faced..Through AI, you help your disabled staff catch up with the other employees to develop and upgrade the skills needed for their jobs..7. Provides more objective feedback.AI removes any personal biases involved in various aspects of your employee training processes.&nbsp;.For instance, managers can create course assessments with only easy questions or subject fields they prefer the most..They can also grade and evaluate learners based solely or majorly on their background, personalities, or other limiting factors..Because of this subjective approach, your training and the learning process become ineffective in enhancing your staff's skills, performance, and, eventually, reaching your company goals..AI, however, uses concrete data to create courses and assess learning accurately and objectively..AI collects data, such as your staff's individual learning styles and behaviors, previous knowledge background, and others, and analyzes them pragmatically..It uses these data and insights to recommend the best-suited course content, design, and assessments, leading to more sensible, efficient learning paths..Keep in mind, though, that you should also be impartial when programming your AI and machine learning models and inputting variables and datasets..8. Offers data measuring your training effectiveness.Among AI's chief roles in employee training are the constant monitoring of learning progress, estimating the staff's comprehension of the topic, and tailoring courses to their needs..From the data that the AI system uncovers, you gain critical insights, such as how your employees learn and when they can best retain what was taught to them..AI also guides you in ways to ramp up learning productivity. For example, if you notice more employees having poorer assessment results, course completion rates, etc., AI can collect significant data supporting the reasons behind these conditions..You can acquire data factors such as the average duration for module fulfillment, preferred learning formats, and more. Knowing these helps you fill in the gaps and avoid repeating the same issues later on..Strengthen your employee training with AI..AI has incredible potential to upgrade your employee training, leading to their productivity, retention, growth in your company, and more..Employ a more staff-centric, data-backed path to your employees' learning with AI-powered tools. Soon, you'll reap its benefits and see the difference AI makes in their performance.&nbsp;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

One of the most frequently-used phrases at business events these days is “the future of work.” It’s increasingly clear that artificial intelligence and other new technologies will bring substantial changes in work tasks and business processes. But while these changes are predicted for the future, they’re already present in many organizations for many different jobs. The job and incumbents described below are an example of this phenomenon. Steve Miller of Singapore Management University and I co-authored the story.


Since the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S. in 1970, banks around the world have been held accountable by governments for preventing money laundering, suspicious cross-border flows of large amounts of money, and other types of financial crime. DBS Bank, the largest bank in Singapore and in Southeast Asia, has long had a focus on anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crime detection and prevention. According to a DBS executive,

“We want to make sure that we have tight internal controls within the bank so the perpetrators, money launderers, and sanctions evaders do not penetrate into the financial system, either through our bank, through our national system, or internationally.”

PROMOTED
Like other large banks, the area of DBS that focusses on these issues, called “Transaction Surveillance,” has taken advantage of artificial intelligence for many years to do this type of work. The people in this function evaluate alerts that are raised by a rule-based system. The rules assess transaction data that come from many different systems across the bank including those for consumers, wealth management, institutional banking and their payments, and the various channels within each of these major areas. These transactions all flow through the rule-based system for screening, and the rules flag transactions that match conditions associated with an individual or entity doing suspicious transactions with the bank—those involving a potential money laundering event, or another type of financial fraud. Rule-based systems—in the past known as “expert systems”—are one of the oldest forms of AI, but they are still widely used in banking and insurance, as well as other industries.

At DBS and most other banks across the world, these types of rule-based financial transaction surveillance systems generate a large number of alerts every day. The primary shortcoming of rule-based surveillance systems is that most—up to 98%—of the alerts generated are “false positives.” Some aspect of the transaction triggers a rule that leads it to be flagged on the alert list. However, after follow-on investigation by the human analyst, it turns out that the alerted transaction is actually not suspicious.

The transaction surveillance analysts have to follow up on each and every alert, looking at all the relevant transaction information. They also consider the profiles of the individuals involved with the transaction, their past financial behaviors, whatever they have declared in “Know Your Customer” and Customer Due Diligence documents, and anything else the bank might know about them. Following up on alerts is a time intensive process. Having an automated system that generates a large number of alerts, most of which turn out to be false positives, does not save human labor.

If the analyst confirms that a transaction is justifiably suspicious or verified as fraud, the bank has a legal obligation to issue a “Suspicious Activity Report” (SAR) to the appropriate authorities. This is a high-stakes decision so it is important for the analyst to get it right: if incorrect, law-abiding bank customers could be incorrectly notified that they are being investigated for financial crimes. On the other side, if a “bad actor” is not detected and reported, it leads to problems related to money laundering and other financial crimes.

For now at least, the rule-based systems can’t be eliminated because the national regulatory authorities in most countries still require them. But DBS executives realized there are many additional sources of internal and external information available to them that, if used correctly, could be used to automatically evaluate each alert from the rule-based system. This could be done using machine learning (ML), which can deal with more complex patterns and make more accurate predictions than rule-based systems.
A few years back, DBS set out on a project to apply the new generation of AI/ML capabilities in combination with the existing rule-based screening system. The combination would enable the bank to prioritize all of the alerts generated by the rule-based system according to a numerically calculated probability score indicating the level of suspicion. The ML system was trained to recognize suspicious and fraudulent situations from recent and historical data and outcomes.
The new ML based filtering system (see figure below) has been in use for just over one year. It reviews all of the alerts generated by the rule-based system, assigns each alert a risk score, and also categorizes each alert into higher, medium, and lower risk categories. This type of “post-processing” of the rule-based alerts enables the analyst to decipher which ones to immediately prioritize (those in the higher and medium risk categories) and which ones can wait (those in the lowest risk category). An important capability of this ML system is that it has an explainer that shows the analyst the evidence used in making the automated assessment of the probability of being a suspicious transaction. The explanation and guided navigation given by the AI/ML model helps the analyst make the right risk decision.Model to recommend ""hibernation"" of the AML alertDBS
DBS also developed other new capabilities to support the investigation of alerted transactions, including a “Network Link Analytics” system (Fig.2) for detecting suspicious relationships and transactions across multiple parties.Analysis of the networks among DBS accountsDBS
In parallel, DBS has also replaced a labor-intensive approach to investigation workflow with a new platform that automates for the analyst much of the support for surveillance-related investigation and case management called CRUISE that integrates the outputs of the rule-based engine, the ML filter model, and the network link system. Additionally, the CRUISE system provides the analyst with easy and integrated access to the relevant data from across the bank needed to follow up on the transactions they are investigating. Within this CRUISE environment, the bank also captures all the feedback related to the analyst’s work on the case, and this feedback helps to further improve DBS’s systems and processes.
Impact on the Analyst
Of course, this all makes analysts much more efficient in reviewing alerts. Few years ago, it was not uncommon for a DBS transaction surveillance analyst to spend two or more hours looking into an alert. This included the front end preparation time to fetch data from multiple systems and to manually collate relevant past transactions, and the actual analysis time to evaluate the evidence, look for patterns, and make the final judgement as to whether the alert seemed to actually be a suspicious transaction or not.
After implementation of multiple tools including CRUISE, Network Link Analytics, and the ML based filter model, analysts are able to do about a third more cases in the same amount of time. Also, for the high-risk cases that are identified using these tools, DBS is able to catch the “bad actors” faster than before.
Commenting on how this differs from traditional surveillance approaches, a senior DBS manager shared:
“In traditional transaction surveillance settings, it is very challenging for an analyst to get all of the information they needed across the various parts of the bank in order to follow up on alerts because of the abundance and variety of data involved. An analyst has to close out a review within a certain specified time period. Within this time, there is only so much data the analyst can acquire across the bank and make sense of, but the analyst just has to make a decision on the alert within that time period. Sometimes that decision is right. Sometimes it is wrong. But that is the best that could be done under the circumstances. 
Today at DBS, our machines are able to gather the necessary support data from various sources across the bank and present it on the screen of our analyst. Now the analyst can easily see the relevant supporting information for each alert and make the right decision. The analyst does not have to search through 60 different systems to get the supporting data. The machines now do this for the analyst much faster than a human can. It makes the life of the analysts easier and their decisions a lot sharper.
In the past, due to practical limitations, transaction surveillance analysts were only able to collect and use a small fraction of the data within the bank that was relevant to reviewing the alert. Today at DBS, with our new tools and processes, the analyst is able to make decisions based on instant, automatic access to nearly all the relevant data within the bank about the transaction. They see this data, nicely organized in a condensed manner on their screen, with a risk score and with the help of an explainer that guides them through the evidence that led to the output of the model.”
DBS invested in a skill set “uplift” across the staff who were involved in creating and using these new surveillance systems. This included the transaction surveillance analysts who had expertise in detecting financial crimes and were trained in using the new technology platform  and in relevant data analytics skillsets. Staff from these teams were cross-trained in the other two areas  (product specialists and technology specialists) so they could more effectively work with their counterparts in those areas. These teams helped to design the new systems, beginning with the front-end work to identify risk typologies. They also provided inputs to identify the data that made most sense to use, and where automated data analytics and ML capabilities could be most helpful to them.
When asked how the systems would affect human transaction analysts in the future, a DBS executive said:
“Efficiency is always important, and we must always strive for higher levels of it. We want to handle the transaction-based aspects of our current and future surveillance workload with fewer people, and then reinvest the freed-up capacity into new areas of surveillance and fraud prevention. There will always be unknown and new dimensions of bad financial behavior and bad actors, and we need to invest more time and more people into these types of areas. To the extent that we can, we will do this through reinvesting the efficiency gains we achieve within our more standard transaction surveillance efforts.”
The Next Phase of Transaction Surveillance
The bank’s overall aspiration for AML transaction surveillance is to become more integrated as well as more proactive. Rather than just relying on alerts generated from the rule-based engine, executives want to make use of multiple levels of Integrated Risk Surveillance which enables the bank to monitor holistically from ‘transaction to account to customer to network to macro’ levels. This combination would help the bank to find more bad actors, and to do so more effectively and efficiently.
A DBS senior manager elaborated:
“It is important to note that money launderers and sanctions evaders are always finding new ways of doing things. Our people need to work with our technology and data analytics capabilities to stay ahead of these emerging threats. We want to free up the time our people have been spending on the tedious, manual aspects of reviewing alerts, and use that time to keep pace with the emerging threats.” 
Human analysts will continue to play an important role in AML transaction surveillance, though the way they use their time and their human expertise will continue to evolve.
The senior manager at DBS also shared a perspective on AI :
“It’s really augmented intelligence,  rather than automated artificial intelligence in risk surveillance. We do not think we can remove human judgement from the final decisions because there will always be a subjective element to evaluations of what is and is not suspicious in the context of money laundering and other financial crimes. We cannot eliminate this subjective element, but we can minimize the manual work that the human analyst does as part of reviewing and evaluating the alerts.”

With larger projects, delays become more expensive. McKinsey projects that on-site mismanagement costs the construction industry $1.6 trillion a year. But you might usually only have five managers overseeing construction of a building with 1,500 rooms, foresees Founder and CEO of British- Israeli startup Buildots Roy Danon. &quot;There's no way an individual can control that much of detail.&quot;.Mr. Danon thinks that artificial intelligence (AI) can help developing an image recognition system, which monitors every detail of an ongoing construction project. It also flags up delays or errors automatically. Along with Buildots, the two biggest building firms in Europe, including UK construction giant Wates is using this system in large residential builds. Construction is significantly a kind of manufacturing. If high-tech factories adopt AI to manage their processes, it the high time for construction sites to start using it..Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to change various aspects of construction, ranging from design to self-driving diggers. Some companies even offer a kind of overall AI site inspector, which matches images taken on-site against a digital plan of the building. Buildots is now making that process easier and feasible than ever by using video footage from GoPro cameras ascended on the hard hats of workers..When managers visit the site once or twice a week, the camera on their head captures video footages of the entire project and then uploads it to image recognition software. It compares the status of many thousands of objects such as electrical sockets, and bathroom fittings on-site with a digital replica of the building..Artificial intelligence also uses the video feed to find out where the camera in the building within a few centimetres so that it can spot the exact location of the objects in each frame. Mr. Danon claims that the system can track the status of approximately 150,000 items several times a week. AI can identify which of three or four states it is in for each object, from not yet begun to fully deploy..Sophie Morris, a civil engineer at Buildots, says, &quot;Site inspections are slow and tedious.&quot; Buildots developed AI to get rid of many repetitive tasks and allows people to focus on making important decisions. &quot;That's the job people want to do where one doesn't have to go and check whether the walls have been painted or someone's drilled too many holes in the ceiling,&quot; says Morris..Another advantage is the way the tech works in the background. It records data without the requirement to walk the site with spreadsheets or schedules, explains Operations Director of Wates, Glen Roberts, whose firm is now planning to roll out the Buildots system at other locations..The complete status of the project and its digital plan has a big difference. It has been found after comparing it several times a week during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although construction sites were shut down in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the essential on-site workers, managers on various Buildots projects kept tabs on progress remotely..Artificial intelligence will not replace these essential workers anytime soon. Humans are still creating buildings, not AI. &quot;At the end of the day, this is an extensive labor-driven industry, and this fact won't change,&quot; foresees Morris..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

What Is GPT-3 And Why Is It Revolutionizing Artificial Intelligence?Adobe Stock

GPT-3 has been created by OpenAI, a research business co-founded by Elon Musk and has been described as the most important and useful advance in AI for years.

But there’s some confusion over exactly what it does (and indeed doesn’t do), so here I will try and break it down into simple terms for any non-techy readers interested in understanding the fundamental principles behind it. I’ll also cover some of the problems it raises, as well as why some people think its significance has been overinflated somewhat by hype.

What is GPT-3?

Starting with the very basics, GPT-3 stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 – it’s the third version of the tool to be released.
In short, this means that it generates text using algorithms that are pre-trained – they’ve already been fed all of the data they need to carry out their task. Specifically, they’ve been fed around 570gb of text information gathered by crawling the internet (a publicly available dataset known as CommonCrawl) along with other texts selected by OpenAI, including the text of Wikipedia.

What can GPT-3 do?
GPT-3 can create anything that has a language structure – which means it can answer questions, write essays, summarize long texts, translate languages, take memos, and even create computer code.
In fact, in one demo available online, it is shown creating an app that looks and functions similarly to the Instagram application, using a plugin for the software tool Figma, which is widely used for app design.
This is, of course, pretty revolutionary, and if it proves to be usable and useful in the long-term, it could have huge implications for the way software and apps are developed in the future.
As the code itself isn't available to the public yet (more on that later), access is only available to selected developers through an API maintained by OpenAI. Since the API was made available in June this year, examples have emerged of poetry, prose, news reports, and creative fiction.
This article is particularly interesting – where you can see GPT-3 making a – quite persuasive – attempt at convincing us humans that it doesn’t mean any harm. Although its robotic honesty means it is forced to admit that ""I know that I will not be able to avoid destroying humankind,"" if evil people make it do so!
How does GPT-3 work?
In terms of where it fits within the general categories of AI applications, GPT-3 is a language prediction model. This means that it is an algorithmic structure designed to take one piece of language (an input) and transform it into what it predicts is the most useful following piece of language for the user.
It can do this thanks to the training analysis it has carried out on the vast body of text used to “pre-train” it. Unlike other algorithms that, in their raw state, have not been trained, OpenAI has already expended the huge amount of compute resources necessary for GPT-3 to understand how languages work and are structured. The compute time necessary to achieve this is said to have cost OpenAI $4.6 million.
To learn how to build language constructs, such as sentences, it employs semantic analytics - studying not just the words and their meanings, but also gathering an understanding of how the usage of words differs depending on other words also used in the text.
It's also a form of machine learning termed unsupervised learning because the training data does not include any information on what is a ""right"" or ""wrong"" response, as is the case with supervised learning. All of the information it needs to calculate the probability that it's output will be what the user needs is gathered from the training texts themselves.
This is done by studying the usage of words and sentences, then taking them apart and attempting to rebuild them itself.
For example, during training, the algorithms may encounter the phrase “the house has a red door.” It is then given the phrase again, but with a word missing – such as “the house has a red X.""
It then scans all of the text in its training data – hundreds of billions of words, arranged into meaningful language – and determines what word it should use to recreate the original phrase.
To start with, it will probably get it wrong – potentially millions of times. But eventually, it will come up with the right word. By checking its original input data, it will know it has the correct output, and “weight” is assigned to the algorithm process that provided the correct answer. This means that it gradually “learns” what methods are most likely to come up with the correct response in the future.
The scale of this dynamic ""weighting"" process is what makes GPT-3 the largest artificial neural network ever created. It has been pointed out that in some ways, what it does is nothing that new, as transformer models of language prediction have been around for many years. However, the number of weights the algorithm dynamically holds in its memory and uses to process each query is 175 billion – ten times more than its closest rival, produced by Nvidia.
 What are some of the problems with GPT-3?
GPT-3's ability to produce language has been hailed as the best that has yet been seen in AI; however, there are some important considerations.
The CEO of OpenAI himself, Sam Altman, has said, ""The GPT-3 Hype is too much. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just an early glimpse.""
Firstly, it is a hugely expensive tool to use right now, due to the huge amount of compute power needed to carry out its function. This means the cost of using it would be beyond the budget of smaller organizations.
Secondly, it is a closed or black-box system. OpenAI has not revealed the full details of how its algorithms work, so anyone relying on it to answer questions or create products useful to them would not, as things stand, be entirely sure how they had been created.
Thirdly, the output of the system is still not perfect. While it can handle tasks such as creating short texts or basic applications, its output becomes less useful (in fact, described as ""gibberish"") when it is asked to produce something longer or more complex.
These are clearly issues that we can expect to be addressed over time – as compute power continues to drop in price, standardization around openness of AI platforms is established, and algorithms are fine-tuned with increasing volumes of data.
All in all, it’s a fair conclusion that GPT-3 produces results that are leaps and bounds ahead of what we have seen previously. Anyone who has seen the results of AI language knows the results can be variable, and GPT-3’s output undeniably seems like a step forward.

The digitalisation of work, despite its potential, risks becoming an impersonal means by which employers tilt the balance of power.
Oliver Suchy
Since we have come to live with the coronavirus around the globe, ‘digital work’ has been enjoying an unprecedented boom. To ensure social distance, we had to work in a kind of isolation for months (and still have to or will have to again), but it works. Thanks to digitalisation, we use more and more tools to work, communicate and collaborate productively, even from home. Yet realising the goal of ‘good mobile work’ depends closely on the labour-law framework and collective agreements—including over working time, privacy and surveillance and individual circumstances such as childcare. 
We are working on bridging this gap. And at least employers have to admit now that flexible work, allowing employees more self-determination, is successful and doesn’t ruin the company. Prejudices regarding the motivation and work discipline of ‘home-office’ workers have not been confirmed. That’s the good message.
Turning the tables
But employers are already starting to turn the tables: companies are reducing office spaces, to create a ‘more distributed workforce’—and to cut costs, because, as we know, work at home works. But what does it mean for the future of office work? Do employees have to work out of office because they have lost the daily ‘hot-desking’? Shall we have to book a ticket for the use of an office? And will the further availability of working space or equipment for employees depend on their performance—all monitored by artificial-intelligence (AI) systems?

The nature of ‘mobile work’, including work at home as an opportunity for self-determined flexible work, would then change fundamentally. Under German labour and constitutional law, it is not possible simply to transfer work to the private rooms of employees. If employees work at home regularly it has to be linked to certain provisions, to safeguard occupational health and safety, which means additional efforts on the part of employers. 
Employers are trying to prevent exactly this. They are declaring ‘home office’ as mobile work—suggesting a new, limitless freedom—to circumvent regulation.
Dealing with the digitalisation of work, we witness the power of employers to set ‘the facts’, as we have known it for ages. At the same time, technology is being used to change work, and power, structures. And the coronavirus crisis seems to be being exploited as an accelerator, to enforce employers’ or shareholders’ interests—particularly through job cuts via automation and a new level of surveillance.

Massive job losses
On the one hand, many companies are obviously under pressure due to the pandemic. So while the digital push can engender new, collaborative forms of work, managers can use the opportunities offered by digitalisation to cut jobs as far as possible via automation. Trade unions and workers are already facing massive job losses and job security is a high priority in many areas. The pressure will likely only increase.
This scenario is linked to the new wave of AI systems at workplaces. It’s no coincidence that there are initiatives such as IBM’s ‘Human Friendly Automation’, demanding a higher awareness of the impacts of AI in the workplace, especially regarding the number and quality of jobs. ‘Change impact plans’ to assess the consequences of AI systems for employees, as proposed in March by the German trade union confederation, the DGB, are not mandatory but they should be—and the sooner the better. 
While policy-makers focus on assistance systems and the much-invoked human-centred design, corporate strategies seems to have changed significantly. The assumption of increasing risks to workers makes regulation all the more necessary—for example, in relation to AI systems affecting workers’ rights and job security—as proposed in the European Commission White Paper on Artificial Intelligence. 
The crisis shows in particular that a shift in the balance of power at the expense of employees must be countered politically. This applies to the legal framework, especially regarding co-determination and the negotiating position of employees, works councils and unions.
Surveillance software
On the other hand, the upheaval caused by the pandemic has been accompanied by increasing use of surveillance software. Here we can witness a link to AI systems, too: the ‘spyware’ is not only being used to track or control employees but offers opportunities to measure individual productivity and workers’ behaviour. This form of ‘management by algorithm’ shows that new, remote-control systems are emerging.
Disguised as support for the workforce, it’s as if workers are themselves being turned into machines. And while AI systems provide an appearance of objectivity, this cannot be verified appropriately due to the lack of transparency. If such systems were to be established in the world of work on a large scale, there would be far-reaching consequences in terms of the balance of power, remuneration systems, occupational health and safety and so on. 
Of course, there are safeguards in data-protection law (GDPR) and certain co-determination rights (in Germany), although there are loopholes and gaps. But experience shows companies tend to test the limits and often breach them. Moreover, not all employees are protected by collective agreements or works councils.
This is not painting a future dystopia but the evidence of today. Managers talk about a ‘new normal’ in the world of work but this must not mean that appropriate regulation is no longer required. German employers’ associations have been calling for a softening of labour law for years—and are exploiting the crisis to assert these claims from the last century.
Appropriate framework
Policy-makers have to act and set out an appropriate framework to foster good digital work by using technology. Here we can see another gap, however—between the political discourse and the reality created by business. The lively debate on the use of AI at work is engendering much dialogue but no tangible results, in terms of regulation to resolve what are inevitably conflicting goals.
There is an urgent need for a modern framework for the work of the future: fostering transparency and traceability of technology, bargaining on an equal footing, protecting privacy adequately and empowering workers. In this context, additional training opportunities for employees should be supported and publicly funded to a much greater extent. 
So far digitalisation has been a great promise on the political stage. It would be a disaster if it turns out to be an empty one—and the much-vaunted possibilities for self-determination result in more insecurity, alienation and inequality.

“Congratulations, you have been selected for an interview for the professional minigamer position at Open Mind Corporation,” a robotic voice announces over a blank screen. “My name is Alex. I will be guiding you through the interview. The whole process will take no more than 10 minutes. Let’s hear your voice. … Smile for the camera. … Welcome to the interview.”
This is the start of An Interview With Alex, a dystopian online interactive experience taking viewers through a “job interview” conducted by an A.I. hiring manager—one that measures tone to score users on a “State of Mind Index.” Carrie Sijia Wang, the multimedia artist behind the project, writes that her work is meant to “criticize the present by speculating about the future.” But it’s not that far off how your next job interview might look, if you’re applying for high-volume, low-skilled roles (or even some high-skilled ones). A growing number of real-life recruiters are turning to A.I.-led job interviews, using programs that interview and assess candidates before a human recruiter even lays eyes on them.

Odds are, if you’re applying for the kinds of jobs that attract lots of applicants, you’re going to be interviewed by an A.I. eventually.

Alex won’t be interviewing you, but it might be Hubert, or Ella, or Tengai, or Phai, or simply automated words on a screen. Most of the bots aren’t running the decision-making process from end-to-end (although sometimes they are—see Ryan Fan’s OneZero article “I Got a Job at an Amazon Warehouse Without Talking to a Single Human”). Instead, recruiters generally use A.I. at the “top of the funnel” to sort or rank candidates before they reach a still human-run stage. Like humans, these bot recruiters have their own unique styles of interviewing. Some are merely seeking logistical information, like availability and ongoing interest, while others might be looking to assess drive, initiative, team-working skills, adaptability, or even your tendency to job hop. Some will ask everyone the same set of questions in the same order, while others will tailor their questions to you, verifying that you can really do the things you say you can.

For many positions, every single applicant receives an automated interview link. Applicants are free to log into the “interview” on their own time, and there will often be practice questions they can try before they face the official questions. Some are text-based, while others require applicants to record themselves on video. Questions, posed by a bot or prerecorded message (or, in one case, a disembodied head), are usually fairly stock standard probes: Tell us about your previous experience, why are you interested in this company? But there is no human listening. The answers are recorded and analyzed by A.I., marking the candidate’s suitability on certain traits, before human recruiters use this analysis to decide whom to invite to another interview or hire. By the time answers are reviewed by a human (if at all), A.I. has already passed judgment.

Odds are, if you’re applying for the kinds of jobs that attract lots of applicants, you’re going to be interviewed by one eventually. It’s so prevalent that Fast Company ran an article telling readers about “4 things you must do to prep for an AI-powered job interview,” while LinkedIn runs a free A.I. video interview practice tool. And as much as the companies behind them tell me otherwise, you might not love it.

Artificial intelligence has played a growing role in recruiting and hiring for some time, as both a timesaver and a matchmaker. A.I. has been used to generate job descriptions, to post and share jobs, to automate candidate searches, and to scan résumés and cover letters, leading some to hide keywords in white text on their applications. (Don’t do that.) Candidates may not have even noticed this shift, and perhaps it makes very little difference to most whether a job is promoted by a faceless HR manager or a faceless bot. But it’s one thing to have A.I. “read” your résumé—it’s quite another to have to answer its questions.

These systems are now being used by major companies, including Unilever, Vodafone, Intel, L’Oréal, Mars, and Citibank, to name but a few. Kevin Parker, CEO of Utah-based HireVue, one of the more prominent platforms in the space, tells me that one of the company’s customers, “a large grocery chain in the U.S.,” used the platform to interview about 20,000 people a day for stocker and cashier jobs. But A.I. interviews are also being used for internships and professional positions, especially in the age of social distancing.

The startups behind these platforms are all quick to point out their unique ability to improve efficiency and fairness, cutting out human bias and inconsistency. A.I. can avoid many human interviewer foibles: It is immune to charisma and distractions, never gets tired or cranky, and will remain on-script, ensuring consistent interviews and meritocratic decision-making. Plus, this way, 20,000 candidates a day can be interviewed and assessed by the same “interviewer.” While efficiency features prominently on these platforms’ websites (PredictiveHire has a free tool calculating how much time and money automating interviews can save), almost all of them make some mention of eliminating unconscious bias, overcoming societal preferences for certain races, genders, ages, and appearances. But algorithms have often been found to replicate human bias, especially if fed with human data sets, and certain characteristics may be unfairly associated with hirability. (In 2015, Amazon abandoned an “experimental” A.I. recruiting tool, which analyzed résumés rather than interviews, because it was discriminating against women for technical roles based on previously skewed hires. It preferred “masculine” words to feminine ones.) A.I. recruitment companies argue that with the right amount of auditing of data, these biases can be drawn out and removed. “We can look to see how the questions impact different groups,” says HireVue’s Parker. “Are men scoring differently than women, are Asians scoring different than Caucasians, are African Americans impacted differently? There’s a whole series of tests and statistical analyses that we go through to make sure that the algorithms aren’t introducing bias.”

Many of the companies behind these systems also market themselves on their “candidate experience.” While the hiring company is ultimately their true customer, A.I. firms are acutely aware of the impact a bad interview experience can have for a company, especially one that wants to keep its failed candidates as customers, and use this as a selling point. Hubert+1, a Swedish startup, notes that “a full 11% of candidates with bad experiences will sever all business relations with the company in question” and boasts that its “Hubert,” on the other hand, provides “a candidate experience fit for a king.” (As though kings are applying to jobs!) PredictiveHire, an Australian company that runs chat-based A.I. interviews, shares positive candidate reviews on its website. Parker says that HireVue’s average net promoter score, measuring if the candidate had a good experience, is “somewhere in the high 60s, low 70s”; Hubert+1’s website brags of 92 percent candidate satisfaction, PredictiveHire of 99 percent. “And if I gave you access to any hundred interviews and asked you to watch them with the sound off well, what you’d probably see most often is people smiling,” says Parker.

But I wanted to hear more from the people who have actually done one of these interviews—and there are quite a few complaining about the process online. To be fair, these anecdotes may be skewed: People who had perfectly fine experiences aren’t likely to tweet about them. It’s clear, however, that many find it difficult, disrespectful, and dehumanizing. Reddit is full of rants about HireVue, one of the most prominent platforms in the space, with posters calling it “the worst interviewing experience” or “a pure waste of time.” (Others use more colorful language.) Many say they won’t be taking them again.  “This is a hard pass,” wrote one user.

Lauren, a 23-year-old college grad who has been applying for jobs since May 2019, told me that getting one of these interview requests isn’t the same feeling as landing a real interview. “You get the email and it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh I landed an interview!’ ” she says. “And then you realize it’s an A.I. thing and you’re like, ‘OK. Sigh. I guess we’ll just do this and hopefully get an actual interview.’ ”

“One wrong thing and the A.I. could just kick you out. … Or something. I don’t know how they work.”

      —
      Lauren
    

Part of the problem is that bot interviews create more work for applicants, asking even those who are unlikely to get hired to invest the time. Jade, a recent college grad looking for work in retail, told me: “We have to do all this song and dance for A.I., or a robot, or whatever it is before we even talk to an actual person—if that ever happens.” Aurora, a job-hunting friend of mine who worked in the travel industry prior to COVID-19, says this addition takes up “so much time.” Despite being done alone and from the comfort of your own home, for video interviews, you’re still encouraged to look presentable every time—whether because the A.I. will judge now or a human reviewer will later. “You have to do your hair and your makeup and your clothes and get your background right,” she says. “That makes it extra exhausting, because you’re doing that every couple of days, just so that you can be seen on a screen in a professional manner.” (When I pointed this out to the A.I. firms, they were quick to argue the opposite: that this gives everyone a chance and allows applicants to complete on-demand interviews at their convenience.)

Others saw a different problem with A.I. sorting the initial pool: that it is being used to eliminate people before applications even reach a human. “It’s almost like they are trying to trip people up, that’s the feeling I got with a couple of them,” Aurora says. “That they were trying to get rid of people by making them have a certain kind of answer.” Lauren also got the feeling the A.I. was just waiting for her to slip up. “One wrong thing and the A.I. could just kick you out. … Or something. I don’t know how they work.”

One person who does understand how they work is Kat, a 33-year-old software engineering student who was recently offered two different HireVue interviews in her search for an internship. She tweeted about her concerns as a dark-skinned Black woman, because A.I. is known to perpetuate bias against people of color or fail to recognize them at all. She says most who responded to her viral tweet advised her to decline the interviews, although a number of recruiters showed up to reassure her. “One of my Twitter buddies, she actually does ethics and A.I., and she was like, ‘This is … this is … like, no. Absolutely not,’ ” she says. Kat did do the interviews in the end, against most of her friends’ advice. What put her mind at ease, she says, was learning that not all recruiters that use HireVue to automate questions actually use the A.I. tool analyze the answers. (Some merely use it to interview en masse, with human recruiters still watching and scoring them.) But she was disappointed to later read the terms and conditions and realize one of her interviews did use A.I. analysis; she plans to decline the next time she receives one. “It just felt like I was not valued as a human,” she says. “It just makes me feel like a collection of data points.”

But even when the answers aren’t analyzed by A.I., the automated interview process was still dispiriting to the candidates I spoke with. “It’s all one-way,” says Kat. “I think a lot of these recruiters and companies forget that the hiring process is a conversation between two parties. When you have a one-way recorded interview, I can’t ask them questions.” She, along with many people I spoke to, says it makes for a terrible first impression of a company. “If you don’t even take the effort to invite me to a company presentation, a meet-and-greet, or any sort of interaction before you throw me into your, you know, recruitment machine, then it’s a reflection of what your company culture is like.” Aurora, who hung up on a stilted A.I. interview with questions that made little sense, says this job hunt has been more demoralizing than her last. “The bot really upset me,” she says. “I feel like I need a job, but I’m just waiting for one to be an actual person that interviews me, so that I feel like I’m valued. I have a very clear idea of my worth, what I want to be paid, how I want to be treated—and that’s not how I want to be treated.” Lauren agreed: “It’s like you’re talking to a wall almost.” It’s no surprise that many of these automated hiring processes seem to be connected to the sorts of jobs that treat humans as machines anyway.

Parker acknowledges the lack of natural flow can be difficult but at least candidates have the opportunity to do retakes, unlike in real life. Plus, he adds, “we’re not looking for movie stars here. This isn’t a screen test.” (Jade, however, described it as feeling “like an audition reel.”)
This was, for me, the worst part of the mock interview HireVue sent me to try—an interview for a customer support representative with a made-up paper company. Although the questions were posed to me by cheerful fake staff from the company in prerecorded messages, I felt entirely alone—and I was, sitting in my bedroom trying to sell myself to A.I. Despite being given 30 seconds to prepare before answering each question, it was difficult to give full and engaging answers to no one, and my mind often went blank staring at either the timer or my own face. (This could be switched off, but I found the blank screen even worse.) What’s more, it was hard to quell my (very real) nerves without the niceties and introduction and small talk upfront.

That lack of chit-chat, Parker says, is actually one of the many advantages of these systems. “If we’re going to be hiring for you, everybody’s going to get the same experience, everybody’s going to get the same questions,” he says. It erases the advantage of some applicants being able to connect with an interviewer based on cheering for the same sports team or being from the same town, he says. There are other real benefits to A.I. interviews, too—as every single CEO I spoke to explained. Interviews can be done on demand, with no need for scheduling, meaning those currently working another job can interview without having to take time off. A typical Sunday for HireVue currently sees around 10,000 people interview, most on a mobile device. Many mentioned being able to make sure every candidate actually hears back, even the rejected ones. (Lauren says she never heard back from her HireVue, although it was just before the pandemic kicked off.) There is also an opportunity to provide automated, personalized feedback to every candidate—something PredictiveHire prides itself on. The company’s chatbot, Phai, is able to create and share constructive “insights” with a candidate almost immediately following an interview (“you take a logical and planned approach,” “you are independent minded”), along with “coaching tips” to work on particular attributes (“practice speaking your opinion”). CEO Barb Hyman wants to get this feature into the hands of students, and even those applying for jobs not being recruited by Phai.

And while many are concerned about these platforms’ ability to replicate existing bias, others are excited about the ability to overcome it—if done right. There’s one group that both HireVue and PredictiveHire mentioned as really enjoying their interviews when polled: those in the twilight years of their career.
After speaking to many of these A.I. firms, I believe that some of them do care about the candidate experience. HireVue has worked to improve its candidate experience based on the feedback of 1.5 million surveyed candidates. PredictiveHire’s “hiring with heart” sounds rather hollow, but Hyman and I spoke at great length about the need for humanity and empathy, especially now. “In a world of unemployment, how do you create some sort of dignity and some humanity when actually, life is pretty hard.” She said they avoided using video for this very reason.

But as much as these firms might try to ease the process for candidates, A.I. interviews exist because they are a cost-saving measure for recruiters. Viktor Nordmark, co-founder of Hubert+1 (with its “candidate experience fit for a king”), was rather blunt when I asked how he would respond to people who may feel undervalued by the process. “As companies you always seek to make more money,” he said. “I think it’s really hard to change that basic principle.”

The fact that these automated interviews are economically rational makes them no less upsetting for those who might be stuck doing them over the coming months and years. Maybe this is something we’ll all get used to, the way we’ve gotten used to Zoom; maybe HireVue’s smiling candidates really are having a fantastic time and are not just desperately trying to please the opaque A.I. But I keep thinking about a scene from the Netflix improv show Middleditch and Schwartz. When the comedians asked audience members for fodder from their everyday lives to kick things off, one offered up his A.I. job interview. Thomas Middleditch’s outraged horror said it all. “What the fuck is that?” he cried. “That’s so mean!”

This article is based on insights from Infosys’ recent Leadership in the Age of AI research report. View the report itself to learn more, and to read about the research methods used. As businesses around the world continue to produce new use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), the technology’s ability to foster or eliminate a level playing field creates a growing concern about its overall power and influence on the future workforce. While most agree AI holds vast potential to unlock discoveries we haven’t yet conceived, for many, AI strikes concerns over job displacement, economic instability and skills shortages. Elon Musk has been vocal on his perspective of AI, illustrating worst-case scenarios that pin humans versus robots in a battle for jobs and control of human destiny. Yet despite passionate concerns and potential implications of AI, the technology holds enormous potential for human empowerment and gives us the tools necessary to automate redundant tasks, spot patterns within new and existing data and uncover important insights that have the potential make our lives better (in medicine, in finance, and everyday life). AI’s Return on Investment  According to a recent global survey on AI*, a majority of organizations began deploying AI to automate or improve routine or inefficient processes. In fact, 66 percent of those surveyed are leveraging AI technologies primarily for business process automation, often viewed as a good starting point as it can deliver quick improvements. While AI is still in its infancy, 9 out of 10 C-level executives reported tangible benefits from the artificial intelligence applications in their companies. In addition to security and privacy issues, respondents also reported that because their organization’s data is not ready from a support standpoint, they are unable to deploy the AI technologies they want. As a result, expect to see continued investment in data management as companies aggressively adopt AI technologies.  Leadership in the Age of AI 2 Integrating AI into the Workforce With nearly half of all respondents reporting that their organization’s AI deployment is greatly outpacing the accuracy and productivity of comparable human activity, it is clear that AI is already matching human capabilities in certain areas. And business leaders are well aware of AI’s potential ethical and human dilemmas, as 69 percent of C-level executives reported that their employees are concerned that AI technologies will replace them. To fully integrate employees into a successful AI deployment, organizations will need to leverage AI to augment existing human skills and make employees better at their work as well as focus on employee training to help them develop adaptable skills for the future. Leadership in the Age of AI 3 Leaders Embracing Greater Presence of AI As AI is integrated into more operations within organizations, the fundamental components of leadership must be refined across several levels, including overall strategy, customer experience and leveraging technology and human capital. Recognizing this shift in leadership, four out of five C-level executives surveyed said that their future business strategy will be informed through opportunities made available with AI technology. Tellingly, 80 percent of C-level executives were also confident that their organization’s executive team has the ability to adapt their leadership skills as AI technologies are adopted within their business. Along with a belief in leadership strength, 70 percent of all C-level executives surveyed strongly agreed that AI will benefit employees at all levels of their organization. Leadership in the Age of AI 1 While many leaders take a positive view, the data also revealed an area of concern with AI among business leaders in losing transparency into their business due to the technology’s ability to run autonomously. As a result, 52 percent of the CEOs surveyed said they are fearful that leadership will have less transparency into their business due to AI and automation. Concluding Thoughts Some organizations are already experiencing the benefits of AI as it becomes mainstream in business, and there is a fear those who are not already experimenting with AI will be left behind (given a long enough time horizon, this will likely be the case). In order to remain competitive, businesses investing in AI should also invest in their employees. And as AI increases in scale and drives further change, businesses that embrace training and re-skilling current employees will realize tangible benefits. Transparency about AI initiatives and their benefits can also improve AI effectiveness: Business leaders can uncover new opportunities and head off potential risks before they cause serious problems or harm to the company’s customers, employees or reputation. Because AI will bring continuous change, training cannot be a one-time initiative. The most successful organizations will be those that adopt a culture of lifelong learning and facilitate opportunities for staff to continuously develop new skills. Business leaders will also need to evolve their skills to gain a deeper understanding of the technologies that are driving their business forward in the years to come.   *In the Infosys report, “artificial intelligence” is defined as “software technologies that make a computer or robot perform equal to or better than normal human computational ability in accuracy, capacity and speed. Examples can include Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, Automated Reasoning, Machine Learning, Robotics, Rational Agent and Chatbots.

According to a study by an international team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Center of Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, whether people perceive artificial intelligence (AI) as the ingenious creator of art or simply another tool used by artists depends on how information about AI art is presented. The results were published in the journal iScience.In October 2018, a work of art by Edmond de Belamy, which was created with the help of an intelligent algorithm, was auctioned for 432,500 USD at Christie's Auction House. According to Christie's auction advertisement, the portrait was created by artificial intelligence (AI). The media often described this as the first work of art not created by a human but rather autonomously by a machine. The proceeds were not given to the machine but instead to the French artists' collective Obvious. This collective had fed an algorithm with pictures of real paintings by human painters and trained it to create images autonomously. They then selected a certain picture, printed it, gave it a name, and marketed it. However, the programmers who developed the artificial neural networks and algorithms used were not mentioned, nor did they receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the painting.""Many people are involved in AI art: artists, curators and programmers alike. At the same time, there is a tendency - especially in the media - to endow AI with humanlike characteristics. According to the reports you read, creative AI autonomously creates ingenious works of art. We wanted to know whether there is a connection between this humanization of AI and the question of who gets credit for AI art"", Ziv Epstein, PhD student at the MIT Media Lab and first author of the study, explained.To this end, the researchers informed almost 600 participants about how AI art is created and asked who should receive recognition for the work of art. At the same time, they determined the extent to which each participant humanizes AIs. The individual answers varied greatly. But on average, people who humanized AI and did not perceive it merely as a tool also felt that AI should receive recognition for the AI art and not the people involved in the creation process.When asked which people deserve the most recognition in the process of creating AI art, recognition was initially given to the artists who provided the learning algorithms with data and trained them. Only then were curators named, followed by technicians who programmed the algorithms. And finally, the ""crowd"" (i.e. the mass of Internet users who produce the data material with which AIs are often trained) was mentioned. Respondents who humanized the AI gave more recognition to the technicians and the crowd, but proportionally less to the artists. A similar picture emerges when respondents are asked about who is responsible, for example when an AI artwork violates copyright. Here, too, the ones who humanized the AIs placed more responsibility on the AIs.A key finding of the study is that it is possible to actively manipulate whether people humanize AIs by changing the language used to report on AI systems in art. The creative process can be described by explaining the fact that AI, supported only by an artistic collaborator, conceives and creates new works of art. Alternatively, the process can be described by explaining the fact that an artist conceives the artwork and that the AI executes simple commands given by the artist. The different descriptions changed the degree of humanization and thus also to whom the participants attributed recognition and responsibility for AI art from among the human actors.""Because AI is increasingly penetrating our society, we will have to pay more attention to who is responsible for what is created with AI. In the end, there are humans behind every AI. This is particularly relevant when the AI malfunctions and causes damage - for example, in an accident involving an autonomous vehicle. It is therefore important to understand that language influences our view of AI and that a humanization of AI leads to problems in assigning responsibility"", says Iyad Rahwan, director of the Center for Humans and Machine at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and co-author of the study.Reference: Epstein Z, Levine S, Rand DG, Rahwan I.

It's thought that since B2C companies have more customers, they have more data to leverage to make AI impactful. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. AI is as relevant to a B2B company as it is to a B2C company. It's important for every B2B company to evaluate the ways AI can help them produce better products, provide better services, and improve business processes. Here are just a few of the ways some B2B companies are using artificial intelligence today.
How Is Artificial Intelligence Used In B2B Companies: Here Are Powerful ExamplesAdobe Stock

Better Products

One of the ways artificial intelligence supports B2B companies is by helping to create better products. In healthcare, AI is behind many innovative tools such as the CT scanner created by Siemens Healthineers that is powered by AI algorithms. This tool assists radiologists with step-by-step instructions specific to each patient to acquire the best images possible. With the support of AI, clinical decision-making can be more quantitative and accurate. Artificial intelligence also enables predictive maintenance, which helps improve product performance and reduces costly downtime.

Better Services

There are many businesses that use artificial intelligence to provide better services to their clients. At Autodesk, intelligent design software changes how to design and build things. With machine learning, Autodesk provides its customers in manufacturing, architecture, engineering, and construction automated generative design technology. Artificial intelligence is also behind Salesforce Einstein, a customer relationship management system that features machine learning, natural language processing capability, and predictive analytics. This can help catapult the sales and marketing services of businesses. When it comes to transaction processing and data warehousing Oracle’s autonomous databases help reduce operational costs. 
PROMOTED
Better Business Processes
One of the most powerful ways artificial intelligence supports any company, including B2B organizations, is by improving business processes. B2B businesses must adopt AI technologies if they want to remain competitive in their industries. AI is changing the game with business processes from support services such as marketing, recruiting/human resources, finance, manufacturing, and more. In addition, automation of a variety of tasks in multiple functions also helps reduce costs.
Manufacturing
When it comes to manufacturing, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been revolutionary. Everything from supply chain and inventory management to predictive maintenance was improved or resulted from Industry 4.0 innovations for manufacturing. With the adoption of machine learning, McKinsey predicted a drop in forecasting errors by as much as 50 percent, and there are similar cost and time savings throughout every stage of the manufacturing process.

Trump 2024 Election Polls: Biden Narrowly Leads Trump In Virginia, After 10-Point Win There In 2020
Marketing
Once artificial intelligence is put to work in the sales and marketing processes, data from websites, social media accounts, and contact databases can be analyzed for insights to help improve the number of leads generated as well as the quality of those leads. The hyper-personalization of marketing campaigns that's possible thanks to AI technology and machine learning can also boost B2B business results in part because relevant content can be delivered at the right time. Now that chatbots and other AI-powered communication systems can provide customer service 24/7, there’s a lot of heavy lifting already completed before your human workforce needs to engage with your customers.

Human Resources
Is there room for AI in human resources? Absolutely! While the HR function is focused on humans, the reality is that AI can help optimize and analyze HR efforts just as it does for other disciplines. If you’ve applied for a job using a digital platform, you’ve experienced AI at work. Algorithms scan your credentials to spot relevant terms on your resume that might indicate a fit for the open position. But it’s not just recruiting that benefits from AI integration. Insights from AI can help HR departments understand employee referrals and analyze feedback from employees to make data-driven decisions. Responding effectively and accurately to employee feedback can improve the employee experience.

Finance
The finance arena is a natural fit for AI and machine learning applications since they already rely heavily on digital workflows and databases. Certainly, one of the biggest cost centers and areas that AI can help out finance departments is in the prevention and detection of fraud. AI is able to quickly process and learn from historical data to apply that learning to current reality and spot fraud. Also, AI can automate many mundane tasks associated with finance and accounting to free up human professionals to do tasks they are more qualified for.
Robotic Process Automation
Another way B2B companies can adopt AI technologies is through robotic process automation (RBA)—basically, RBA automates the tasks of workers. Solutions such as those from Automation Anywhere makes it easy for any company—not just those leading in the tech space or who have tech talent on staff—to get an out-of-the-box solution for RBA.
As you can see, there are a plethora of ways B2B companies can use artificial intelligence to their advantage. To learn more about how Ai is reshaping our world have a look at my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Here's What You Need To Remember: Russia, along with China, has continued to explore ways of utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in weapons platforms—a move that the Pentagon has considered dangerous, as AI may not be able to properly separate civilians from targets in hostile zones.

Even as Russia continues to overcome production issues with its Su-57 stealth fighter, Moscow reportedly has its eyes set on a sixth-generation fighter jet, which could be developed under the MiG-Sukhoi joint brand. Such a fighter could build on the best features of the MiG-21, which has become the most-produced supersonic jet in aviation history; and the very capable MiG-35, as well as the Su-57. 

“Possibly, this will be so: the fighter produced by the MiG-Sukhoi,” Rostec Aviation Cluster Industrial Director Anatoly Serdyukov told Tass on Tuesday. “But so far, all the work is at the stage of discussions and it is early to speak about details.”
This is not the first time that Russia has suggested a sixth-generation fighter jet could be developed in the near future. In March 2016, then-Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Rogozin, announced that Russia had launched work on the sixth-generation combat plane. Rogozin said at the time that the Sukhoi Design Bureau had even submitted a preliminary project “for creating the sixth-generation fighter.”





While the delivery of the Su-57 has been slowed, in part due to problems in the advanced aircraft’s development, the fifth-generation fighter is still intended to succeed the MiG-29 and Su-27 in the Russian Air Force. It is unclear how the Su-57 would fare against the American Lockheed Martin-built F-35 Lightning II, which has become the world’s most dominant multi-role fighter. The F-35’s detection range, geolocation, threat identification, and system response capabilities allow the jet to precisely fix and destroy the most advanced threats in the world including every layer of Russia's latest SA-20 surface-to-air missile (SAM) system.

Instead of going on all-in with the Su-57, Moscow could now be turning its attention to a sixth-generation fighter, which specialists have noted would have the capability to perform combat missions without human participation and use its artificial intelligence along with the availability of a radio-photonic radar to reach a target. Such a fighter aircraft would also likely have the ability to utilize hypersonic speed and fly into the near-Earth space and employ weapons based on new physical principles. 
Russian Aerospace Force Ex-Commander-in-Chief, Chairman of the Federation Council’s Defense and Security Committee Viktor Bondarev previously told TASS that the Russian Armed Forces would be switching to sixth-generation hardware, including strike drones, smoothly and gradually, after being convinced in the reliability of previous-generation aircraft.

Russia, along with China, has continued to explore ways of utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in weapons platforms—a move that the Pentagon has considered dangerous, as AI may not be able to properly separate civilians from targets in hostile zones.
Moscow is not alone in its announcement of the next generation of fighter aircraft. The United States, China, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and France have all made progress on the jet fighter of the future. A common element to emerge at this point is more of modular design that could enable the aircraft to tackle a variety of missions, while swarms of drones or similar mini-aircraft could work to provide defense and reconnaissance for the fighter.
However, it will likely still be a decade or longer before any actual aircraft even comes into focus.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the tremendous need for worldwide digital transformation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has become apparent. With the help of on-site UN Volunteers and Online Volunteers, an SDG Artificial Intelligence Lab in Turkey is developing and implementing digital solutions to address the challenges of achieving the 2030 Agenda in a context of widening digital inequality.

The SDG AI Lab is introducing big data and artificial intelligence into the everyday work of the UN agencies and other development partners. A partnership between the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme, UNDP amd the Istanbul International Centre for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD) has faciliated this process.
The SDG AI Lab has mobilized volunteer data scientists, and now 10 on-site UN Volunteers and Online Volunteers collaborate in developing and implementing digital transformation projects.

Two on-site UN Volunteer Data Scientists, Jonas Nothnagel (Germany) and Ken Y. Jung (funded by the Republic of Korea) drive the large teams of Online Volunteer data scientists. As we have found this an effective solution, we plan to recruit more on-site UN Volunteers and mobilize even more online data scientists. --Mr Gökhan Dikmener, SDG AI Lab Technical Advisor

The data scientists specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and come from diverse backgrounds and different countries. They delivering services ranging from social media content analysis during crises to portfolio sense-making software to improve efficiency in UNDP programmes.
To manage the teams of Online Volunteers, on-site UN Volunteers Data Scientists Ken Jung and Jonas Nothangel come with solutions for coordinating and operating the tasks.

We were able to build up international volunteer teams consisting of PhD students, data scientists employed in both the public and private sector and aspiring students from all around the world. This is both beneficial for the volunteers to learn to work in teams beyond borders and for us, as we got the benefit of creating a fruitful network of international data scientists. --Jonas Nothangel, UN Volunteer Data Scientist

The process works in an agile framework, where Online Volunteers are divided into small teams. Each team works on a specific task for a limited time, called iteration. Each iteration consists of clearly stated inputs and outputs, which allows the monitoring of progress and guidance throughout the whole process. To coordinate volunteers and ensure effective communication, on-site data scientists rely on technologies such as GitHub repositories, online team spaces and more.

Even after the pandemic challenge is resolved through vaccination and cure, the need for digital collaboration skills is here to stay-- Ken Y. Jung, UN Volunteer Data Scientist

The value of online volunteerism lies in the opportunity it provides to gain problem-solving skills without limitations like distance or time difference. These obstacles do not exist in a virtual environment. Online Volunteers spare time in exchange for their contribution to the public good, and can use this experience to append projects to their data science portfolio.
Since volunteering online relies primarily on having an internet connection, its strongest asset is that it enables teamwork among volunteers with different skillsets and from different parts of the world. These are also highly motivated professionals interested in serving with the international UN team.
Nathan Rouff (France/Switzerland) currently working on his Master's degree, has been supporting the SDG AI Lab’s “Twitter Analysis Framework: COVID-19 use” project for four months. The project analyzes Twitter posts using Big Data techniques to explore the trends and correlation between social media usage and crises response. Nathan shares, ""I was very excited to explore the potential of using Artificial Intelligence methods on social media data.""
Oumaima Hourrane (Morocco) is a Computer Science Ph.D. student interested in machine learning and natural language processing.

I find it exciting to work with my volunteer team on distilling insights, brainstorming solutions and turning these ideas into real-world applications. --Oumaima Hourrane, Online Volunteer

Another project, UNDP Project and Programme Portfolio Sensemaking, uses topic-modelling techniques to analyze UNDP project portfolios. This allows the automatic creation of cluster insights and key features from past projects to revisit the results and reframe the strategic direction of the organization for the future. Data scientist Stephen Okya Shisoka (Kenya) has been supporting the project for three months.

Digital volunteering is helpful both on the demand and supply side. As a volunteer, I get flexible working conditions, while my team benefits from my skills. --Okya Shisoka, Online Volunteer

As it is not yet clear when the COVID-19 situation and measures will end, the demand for online volunteer assistance to accelerate the SDGs around the world is increasing.
The SDG AI Lab will continue to enable young volunteers to gain experience in data science and help them to develop their careers, while simultaneously contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. Thus, UNV Turkey and IICPSD/SDG AI Lab plan to explore how to leverage their complementary strengths in managing projects, AI technologies, volunteers’ deployment to bring digital solutions to Turkey and UNDP country offices.

Digital volunteerism connects projects and competent and motivated people, while removing the constraints of physical distance. It presents an opportunity to engage with professionals with diverse expertise from different parts of the world, while sharing the perspective and goal of giving back to society. --Reshma Elizabeth Roy Kurian (France), Online Volunteer

The SDG AI Lab continues to play an active role in introducing artificial intelligence methods and their implementation through UNV mechanisms. The next intake of volunteer data scientists is planned to take place in late September and early October.

UN Volunteers and other volunteers always stand as leaders of innovation for sustainable development. We highly appreciate the outstanding contributions of our volunteers to boost unique digital solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals within the SDG AI Lab initiative, as a response to COVID-19. --Dmitry Frischin, Regional Manager, UNV Regional Office in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States

																Luminar AI Uses Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence for A Faster Editing Experience							





David J. Crewe,
                                    
                                                                            4 years ago                                            






With traditional photo editors, creating the perfect photo is a time-consuming process that involves moving dozens of sliders. Many seek to use presets to speed this up, but there are severe limitations. Presets tend to only work on images that are virtually identical to the original.


To change this tedious and frustrating process, innovative companies race to embrace Artificial Intelligence. But some creatives have been skeptical about its effectiveness and limitations. Their fears center around a loss of control and a homogenization of creative output. This does not need to be the case if AI is properly trained.

With LuminarAI, Artificial Intelligence is woven throughout the entire editing process. The AI has been trained with expert input from artists, photographers, colorists, and scientists. LuminarAI offers creatives the ability to save time and obtain consistent quality throughout their images. LuminarAI brings the perfect balance of technology and human innovation.

“With LuminarAI, we wanted to ensure that AI not only was easy to use, but that it also provided creatives a way to express themselves. Through our unique 3D depth-mapping and segmentation technologies, we’re able to recognize the contents of a photo, recommend edits and then allow creatives to refine every aspect of that recommendation,” said Alex Tsepko, CEO of Skylum. “Doing this lets creatives retain their unique style in their edits without tedious, manual work. Professional results, but in a fraction of the time.”


With LuminarAI, Artificial Intelligence is applied from the moment you open a photograph for editing. The contents of a photo are identified, problems analyzed and the depth of a photo calculated. After an analysis of the subject matter and issues, LuminarAI makes editing suggestions. These improvements come in complete workflows — through an approach called Templates — as well as suggestions in the AI tools. Instead of blindly guessing and clicking on a list of presets, the user chooses from a list tailored to their image’s needs.

With Templates, beginning editors can choose to get inspired through recommendations on how to edit their photographs. At the same time, experienced editors can choose to have more control, selectively applying AI tools as they edit their images. They can then create their own templates, and save up to 90% of their time spent editing.

Guide Your Edits and Apply Artificial Intelligence
As experienced editors create an image, they can selectively choose which AI tools to utilize. This radically speeds up the editing process by removing the need for selections and masks. LuminarAI learns how creatives modify things like lighting, composition, detail and color. Creatives can also take advantage of Local Adjustments, letting them make targeted edits to specific areas of their image.

Once the first image is edited, artists can sync their adjustments across a group of images. LuminarAI recognizes the intent of the edit — the visual outcome — and adaptively conforms the other images to match the creative’s goal. This leads to massive time savings without the loss of creative control. AI tools adapt to the artist’s desires and can handle variation in lighting and subject. The edits can also be saved as a custom template for future use.

Get Inspired Through LuminarAI
For those that might feel challenged by photo editing or uninspired, LuminarAI is the perfect tool. Images are analyzed for content, and then recommendations are presented for editing. Edits for selections, color, tone, and more are built by top artists and photo editors, giving creatives a professional look and feel to their own images.

Creatives can audition each Template presented to them and use them, or they can select and refine the edits. Built-in Template Collections are catered to the subject of the image — things like wildlife, macro, astrophotography, underwater, and more. This inspires artists by providing ideas that they might not have thought of initially. And each recommended Template can be previewed in less than a second to see its results.
This also lets the creative learn what LuminarAI can do for their images. Exploring a Template reveals which technologies were used. This helps the newer editor learn the tools in a contextual manner that dramatically improves the efficacy of editing.
An Ongoing Journey of Creativity
Creatives who choose to take advantage of LuminarAI Templates can modify and refine the AI tools to create their own look. They can update built-in Templates to refer back to, and apply them across a series of images.

And for those that build their own AI-powered solutions, they can save their own Templates.  Giving them the desired combination of control and time savings.
Skylum will also continue to release new Templates designed in partnership with photographers and artists across the world. These updates will inspire users to continue their creative evolution.
With these different workflows, Skylum is committed to bring quality images to creatives no matter what their experience level is. With LuminarAI, users can capture and preserve human intelligence into the next generation of AI photo editing.

The technology is capable of construing data contextually to provide requested information, supply analysis, and push events based on findings. Simultaneously, businesses need to meet social, investor and regulatory requirements regarding how they use advanced technologies like AI. Significantly, it is also crucial that organizations must commit to using the technology with a purpose, which leads to the way of sustainable development..In its recent study, the Allen Institute for AI argued the prioritization of &quot;Green AI&quot; efforts that focus on the energy efficiency of AI systems. The study was based on many high-profile advances in AI that have wavered carbon footprints. According to an OpenAI blog post, the amount of compute required for the largest AI training runs has been surged exponentially by 300,000 times since 2012. This increase in computational requirements leads to the pessimistic environmental impacts of artificial intelligence..Associate Director of the USC Center for AI in Society and a member of the Association for Computing Machinery, Bistra Dilkina said that environmental problems typically involve complex processes that scientists do not yet fully understand, and for which we have limited available resources. With advances in machine learning and deep learning, we can now tap the predictive power of AI to make better data-driven models of environmental processes to improve our ability to study current and future trends, including water availability, ecosystem wellbeing, and pollution..AI can also play a key role in enhancing environmental decisions and policy-making work, by bringing an algorithmic approach to that work, she added..What is Green AI?.Green AI refers to the part of a broader, long-standing interest in environmentally-friendly scientific research. AI research can be computationally expensive in numerous ways; however, each provides opportunities for efficient improvements. For example, research papers could be required to plot accuracy as a function of computational cost and training set size, giving a baseline for more data-efficient research in the future. Reporting the computational price tag of finding, training, and running models is a key Green AI practice..Solving Sustainability Challenges with AI.AI has the potential to solve several environmental problems. Google, for instance, uses its own AI expertise to improve its energy efficiency, leveraging DeepMind's machine learning capabilities that have reduced the amount of energy needed to cool its data centers by 40%..As noted by Deloitte, delivering societal and environmental well-being through artificial intelligence are key strategic considerations of the European Commission, who acknowledge that &quot;AI systems promise to help tackle the most pressing concerns, including climate change and environmental degradation&quot;. To this context, the UK Government has observed that AI can assist addressing the country's Grand Challenges that are four transformative global trends set out in the UK Industrial Strategy, which include issues related to climate change..The efforts include £200 million of funding towards 1,000 new Ph.D. places over the next five years to study AI that could help industries become more sustainable. On the other side, following the publication of the AI Sector Deal in April 2018, collaborations between the UK Government Office for AI, the Open Data Institute and Innovate UK have supported many sustainable initiatives, including global food waste reduction efforts. Considering these efforts, it is clear that the government shows an increased interest in implementing Green AI, particularly in Smart Cities such as around energy network management..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

VanderSchans/Released)										





Lt. Gen. Michael Groen has been confirmed by the Senate to be the new director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, the Department of Defense’s hub for fielding AI technologies.
The general’s confirmation comes with a promotion to major general as he assumes a DOD position with important oversight of emerging technologies. Groen comes to the JAIC at a critical time as the center expands some of its key work around warfighting initiatives and transitioning away from some of its earlier, lower-risk projects.
“The @DoDJAIC welcomed our new Director, Lieutenant General Michael Groen, USMC, to the team today. We look forward to his leadership!” The JAIC tweeted Oct. 1. Groen was confirmed by voice vote at the end of September.
Groen has a long history of working with military technology and intelligence. Before his appointment he served as the chief of Marine Corps intelligence and on the Joint Staff in senior positions. The general most recently came from the National Security Agency, where he led computer network operations.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of India’s most valued private company Reliance Industries, believes that AI is “indispensable” to India for achieving its “digital destiny.”

“The time is ripe, and the tools are ready to make India a world leader in artificial intelligence, and to make AI work for all Indians,” Ambani said at the Responsible Artificial Intelligence for Social Empowerment summit (RAISE 2020) yesterday (Oct. 5).

The 63-year-old second-generation businessman, who has started dabbling in all things internet over the last few years, said AI could help India achieve its goals across economic growth, agriculture modernisation, affordable healthcare, and world-class education.

Ambani’s push for AI comes at a time when his digital business vertical, Jio Platforms, has been emerging as one of the youngest and fastest-growing tech firms in the world. The business has attracted investors such as Facebook and Google, which are considered pioneers in AI.

Ambani’s data and AI play

Calling them a part of a “fourth industrial revolution,” Ambani said technologies such as AI could help achieve a “strong, sustainable, and equitable new India.”

This is ironic, given the fact that Ambani’s growing digital clout has raised some fears of monopoly and unfair competition.

Afterall, Reliance Industries has in recent years become a treasure trove of data about Indians through its several industry-leading businesses. Reliance’s retail arm, Reliance Retail, for instance, is India’s largest organised retail chain, while the group’s telecom venture, Reliance Jio, is the country’s largest telecom operator. And Jio Platforms is fast becoming a leader across new technologies with significant investments across broadband connectivity, smart devices, cloud and edge computing, big data analytics, AI, internet of things, augmented and mixed reality, and blockchain.

However, in his speech yesterday, Ambani called for “sound data regulations” in India, when he said:

“We now have all the crucial components in place to make India a premier digital society. Together, our economy and society will generate data at an explosive and exponential rate.

Data is the raw material for artificial intelligence. Intelligent data is digital capital. It is a vital national resource. In the past, nations have competed on physical capital, financial capital, human capital and intellectual capital. But, in the coming decades, nations will increasingly compete on digital capital…We are confident that the government will introduce a sound data regulation framework to protect this national resource and ensure data privacy.”

India to become global hub for Artificial Intelligence: PM
National Programme on AI will be used for solving the problems of society: PM

Distinguished guests from India and abroad, Namaste!
Welcome to RAISE Responsible AI for Social Empowerment Summit. This is a great effort to encourage discussion on Artificial Intelligence. You all have rightly highlighted aspects relating to technology and human empowerment. Technology has transformed our work places. It has improved connectivity. Time and again, technology has helped us solve key challenges. I am sure this merge between social responsibility and AI will enrich AI with human touch. 
Friends,
Artificial intelligence is a tribute to human intellectual power. The power to think enabled humans to make tools and technologies. Today, these tools and technologies have also acquired the power to learn and think! In this, one key emerging technology is AI. The teamwork of AI with humans can do wonders for our planet.

 | 

Friends,
At every step of history, India has led the world in knowledge and learning. In today's age of IT as well, India is making outstanding contributions. Some of the brightest tech leaders belong to India. India has also proved to be the power-house of the global IT services Industry. We will continue to digitally excel and delight the world.
Friends,
In India, we have experienced that technology improves transparency and service delivery. We are home to the world's largest unique identity system- Aadhaar. We also have the world's most innovative digital payments system-UPI. This has enabled providing access to digital services, including financial services, like Direct Cash Transfers to the poor and marginalised. In the pandemic situation, we saw how India's digital readiness was of great help. We reached out to people with help, at the earliest and in the most efficient manner. India is rapidly expanding its optical fibre network. The aim is to provide every village with high speed internet connectivity.
Friends,
Now, we want India to become a global hub for AI. Many Indians are already working on this. I hope many more do so in the times to come. Our approach to this is powered by core principles of: Teamwork, Trust, Collaboration, Responsibility and Inclusivity.

Friends,
India has recently adopted the National Education Policy 2020. It focuses on technology-based learning and skilling as a major part of education. E-courses will also be developed in various regional languages and dialects. This whole effort will benefit from Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities of AI platforms. We launched Responsible AI for Youth program this year in April, under this programme, more than 11000 students from schools completed the basic course. They are now building their AI projects.
Friends,
The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) is being formed. This will create an
e-Education unit to boost the digital infrastructure, digital content and capacity. Virtual labs are being established to provide hands-on experience to learners. We have also launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Through these steps, we aim to keep pace with emerging technologies for people's benefit.
Friends.
I would also like to mention about the National Programme on Artificial Intelligence. This will be dedicated towards rightful use of AI for solving problems of society. It will be implemented with the support of all stakeholders. RAISE can be a platform to brain storm in this regard. I invite all of you to actively participate in these efforts.
Friends,
There are a few challenges that I would like to pose to this august audience. Can we use Artificial Intelligence for the optimal management of our assets and resources? At some places, resources are idle. While in other place, there is a shortage of resources. Can we dynamically reallocate them to find optimal use? Can we delight our citizens with proactive and prompt delivery of services at their doorsteps.?
Friends,
The future belongs to the youth. And, every youngster matters. Each child has unique talents, capabilities and aptitudes. At times, the right person ends up at the wrong place.
There is a way we can change that. How about every child observing him or herself while growing up? Can parents, teachers and friends- carefully observe children? Observe them from their childhood to the start of adulthood. And, keep a record of them. This will go a long way in helping a child discover his or her natural calling. Those observations can be effective guiding forces for youngsters. Can we have a system which gives an analytic report on the aptitude of each child? This would open doors of opportunity for many youngsters. Such human resource mapping will have long-lasting benefits, in governments and businesses.
Friends,
I see a big role for AI in empowering Agriculture, healthcare. Creating next generation urban infrastructure. And, addressing urban issues like: reducing traffic jams. Improving sewage systems and Laying our energy grids. It can be used for making our disaster management systems stronger. It can even be used to solve the problem of climate change.
Friends,
Our planet is blessed with several languages. In India, we have several languages and dialects. Such diversity makes us a better society. As Professor Raj Reddy just suggested, why not use AI to seamlessly bridge language barriers. Let us think about simple and effective ways of how AI can empower Divyang sisters and brothers.
Friends,
Why not use AI for knowledge sharing? There are few things as empowering as making knowledge, information and skills easily accessible.
Friends,
It remains our collective responsibility to ensure trust in how AI is used. Algorithm Transparency is key to establishing this Trust. Equally important is accountability. We must protect the world against weaponistion of AI by Non-State Actors.
Friends,
While we discuss AI, let also have no doubts that human creativity and Human emotions continue to be our greatest strength. They are our unique advantage over machines. the smartest of AI cannot solve mankind's problems without blending with our intellect and empathy. We should also think of how we will retain this intellectual edge over machines? We should ensure that we take care so that human intelligence is always a few steps ahead of AI. We should think about how AI can help humans to increase their own capacities. I want to state again:- AI will unlock the unique potential of each person. It will empower them to contribute more effectively to the society.
Friends,
Here at RAISE 2020, we have created a global forum for the world's leading stakeholders. Let us exchange ideas and chart a common course for the adoption of Artificial Intelligence. It is critical that all of us work together as partners for this. I thank you for coming together to participate in this truly global event. I wish the Global Summit all success. I am sure that the discussions over the next four days will help create an Action Roadmap for Responsible AI. A roadmap that can truly help transform lives and livelihoods across the world. My best wishes to you all.

But Duolingo, self-proclaimed as “the world’s best way to learn a language” and seconded by reviewers at the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, is set to change that with an assist from artificial intelligence (AI). Duolingo launched in 2011, and through a powerful mix of personalized learning, immediate feedback and gamification/rewards, it has become one of the most downloaded educational apps today. Let's take a look at how artificial intelligence helps the company deliver personalized language lessons to its 300 million users.
The Amazing Ways Duolingo Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Deliver Free Language Learning Adobe Stock

Duolingo on a Mission to Offer Free Language Education

Founded in Pittsburgh by Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist Luis von Ahn, who is renowned for creating CAPTCHA, Duolingo’s mission is to “make education free and accessible to everyone in the world.” Today the company’s more than 300 million users receive personalized training on more than 30 distinct languages ranging from Spanish to Navajo to Klingon through its cross-platform app. Learning a language is time-intensive—the U.S. State Department estimates it can take 600 to more than 1,100 class hours to learn a language. Duolingo breaks this effort down into manageable chunks that can be done anywhere at any time individualized for each user and infused with fun and a points-based reward system. Users can access the app for free, but those who don’t want ads can sign up for premium service through a monthly subscription.

AI Powers Duolingo’s Mission

Artificial intelligence is behind Duolingo’s mission to make language education accessible and free to everyone. It starts with an AI-driven placement test to determine the starting knowledge of each user for the language they want to study. For example, if someone signed up to learn French and they have four years of instruction in high school, they will likely be able to start Duolingo’s lessons further along than a user who had never been exposed to French before. To determine exactly where each user’s understanding of the language begins, the placement test adapts as it continues based on if the user answered the previous question correctly or not. In a mere five minutes, this test gives the app a good sense of where each user should start the course. This ability contributes to a positive user experience and reduces the number of those with some knowledge bowing out due to boredom at the beginning.
PROMOTED
Another core feature of the Duolingo app that uses artificial intelligence is known as spaced repetition. This concept delivers personalized language lessons over longer intervals for optimal learning rather than cramming lessons into a short period of time. Additionally, the “lag effect” is also important to Duolingo’s learning techniques. If the gap between practice sessions is lengthened, users improve more. All of this content delivery is controlled on the backend by artificial intelligence.
As learning expands and language proficiency is gained, the user interacts with the content in different ways. AI algorithms using deep learning predict at any given moment the probability of a user being able to recall a word in a given context and then can figure out what that user needs to keep practicing. The algorithms analyze user data to then personalize the learning experience.

In fact, Duolingo generates a wealth of data that is critical when creating predictive models. The amount, type, and uniqueness of the data was one of the reasons the company's AI and research lead Burr Settles decided to join the company in 2013 over bigger, more established companies. Duolingo’s half-life regression statistical model operates based on analyzing error patterns of millions of language learners to inform content delivery that’s relevant for each user and their learning needs.

In an effort to ensure an engaging experience, Duolingo has AI-powered chatbots that help teach language through automated text-based conversations with users who are in the app. Not only do the bots help users improve their language skills by helping them practice conversing in a language, but they get smarter the more they are used. The company has also considered the possibility of expanding into virtual reality technologies to deliver a more immersive experience.

			Using artificial intelligence for image recognition		

 October 13, 2020 
 
				Dominic Lill			

  AI,  artificial intelligence,  Image,  image recognition

Do you find robots cool? Well, don’t we all, until they take over our entire race and have us enslaved. But that is not going to happen because we have the circuit board in our hands. That will happen only if we mess up. When we talk about artificial intelligence, robots are the only things that come to mind.
But you need to understand that artificial intelligence is much more than that. AI is an entire field of science with the purpose of digitizing human qualities in order to enhance the machines to work more like us to get tasks, like image recognition, done on time. Make sense? 
Well, in simple terms, it is like giving human qualities to a machine. Not all of them, just the specific ones required to get the job done. This is exactly what we do when we tend to use AI for image and video processing. We are all aware of how AI can help analyze text, but with a bit of enhancement, it can work for image recognition as well. Wondering how? Continue reading to find out how it is used in everything from web scraping to guiding self-driven cars. 
What is image recognition?
In the context of machines and computers, the term image recognition refers to the ability of a mechanical device to interpret different characteristics in an image. In simple terms, evaluate the image similar to how our brain evaluates it. 
For instance, an image of a scenic place would just be an image for your laptop because of the JNG format type. But when the element of Ai is added to your laptop, it gets an additional brain that helps it identify objects in the image such as mountains, people, places, objects, writing etc. You can give the ability to identify specific characteristics to a machine using AI, and that is what image recognition means. 
How AI helps with image recognition?
Unlike us, machines do not have a brain of their own. Their brain isn’t a ball of neurons but a chipset that you design, which gives them the precise ability of what you want them to do. Using AI for image recognition requires you to design software trained to analyze millions of pre-labeled pictures from different angles, edges, and perspectives to identify specific components. Various algorithms are set in place to precisely do what is told!  
Common examples of image recognition
Using AI for image recognition has become more common than you think. You might not realize it, but you use the feature almost every day. For instance, when you use images to search on Google, the AI of the search engine scraps the web by identifying the objects in the photo you added by matching them with the other images with the same objects on the internet. 
Similarly, online retailers have the same feature in their apps. Social media sites use it for target marketing. Your photo library uses it for a smart photo library feature. It is also used in self-driving cars, autonomous robots and for adding meta-tags to images. In short, it is used in almost all industries today.

Over a billion people around the world are at high risk for retinal eye diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. And yet more than 75 percent of these people do not receive regular screenings.
The reasons vary but, in general, visiting an ophthalmologist can be expensive (depending on insurance coverage), impractical (requiring time off from work) and inconvenient (it can sometimes take months to get an appointment).
But what if the ability to do an eye scan moved from a specialist to your family doctor or local hospital clinic?
That’s what Israeli startup AEYE Health hopes to accomplish with its camera-based artificial intelligence software for quickly diagnosing retinal disease.

The problem is significant. Over 80% of people with diabetes will develop retinopathy within 15 years. Glaucoma, which can be prevented if diagnosed early, is the leading cause of avoidable blindness over the age of 60. The risk of getting age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can also be vision-threatening, is 30% after the age of 75.
AEYE Health (pronounced A-Eye, like AI – artificial intelligence) simplifies the screening process by removing the ophthalmological middleman.
The company’s software can process and deliver the results of a scan of the fundus (the lower part of the eyeball opposite the pupil) in just a couple of minutes from any type of camera – including, eventually, the cameras on standard smartphone – and from any type of medical office.

“We can train statistical models to discriminate between the two groups,” Zack Dvey-Aharon, the company’s CEO, tells ISRAEL21c. Once the models are up and running, “you just need to activate them. They’re already trained to make a fast call.”
Artificial intelligence in the medical space has generally been used more for decision support than actual diagnosis, but when it comes to ophthalmology, where there is both a shortage of professionals and long wait times for appointments, there is a push toward allowing autonomous AI to do full “diagnostic screening, where the AI makes a medical decision,” Dvey-Aharon says.

Only if the retina scan is flagged as worrisome would you be referred to an eye specialist.

Opening the door to diagnosis
Software algorithms can outperform human ophthalmologists in some areas.
“AI can look at a retinal image and tell the age of a patient,” Dvey-Aharon says, “something even the best doctor can’t do.”
And it can catch hidden problems. “The eye is the only place in the body that, without doing any cutting, gives you a direct view to the blood vessels and nervous system,” Dvey-Aharon says.
“That opens the door to diagnosis of many systemic conditions. You can detect problems like hypertension, cardiovascular issues, different types of cancer, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.”

The Covid-19 pandemic has only increased the need for technologies like those from AEYE Health. One way the novel coronavirus has been shown to spread is through the eyes, leading some patients to forego a visit to the eye clinic. Might they be more willing to come in for a test through their general practitioner?
AEYE Health’s location in Israel has been a key advantage for the 14-person company, which has its R&D in the heart of Tel Aviv.

“It’s not easy to find top data scientists” in other parts of the world, not to mention finding a group of the real stars in the space, Dvey-Aharon points out. Location and expertise have helped AEYE Health raise $3 million since the company was founded in 2018.
Dvey-Aharon says he isn’t worried by the fact that Google and IBM are crunching data in an effort to make sense of health scans. He sees giant companies more as possible collaborators, pointing out that neither has released a commercial application for retinal scanning.
Clinical trials
AEYE Health is currently conducting clinical trials in the United States. The company hopes to receive FDA certification by the end of 2020.
That would enable the company to sell its software to hospitals, which Dvey-Aharon says are the most suitable environments for AEYE Health’s offering, since you’ll find specialists in geriatrics, endocrinology (who deal with diabetes) and ophthalmology under one roof.
While AEYE Health has developed a software solution, the company plans to partner with hardware manufacturers to offer an integrated bundle to potential customers.
In July, AEYE Health announced a new partnership with UMass Health Care in Massachusetts. The partnership is backed by a BIRD Foundation grant just shy of $1 million.

“The idea is to make sure this works for a large hospital setting,” Dvey-Aharon explains.

Using AEYE Health’s software, clinics can upload data from the camera into the hospital’s system, schedule appointments automatically, generate billing paperwork and transfer results to a patient’s electronic medical record.
Dvey-Aharon envisions a subscription model that would make AEYE Health a “one-stop shop,” he says.
AEYE Health is also eyeing underserved countries “where access to ophthalmologists is very limited,” Dvey-Aharon adds. “Saving people from blindness is important anywhere. And screening is the most important phase.”
He explains that the brain “does amazing things bypassing local problems, so that by the time people don’t see well, it’s too late to treat.”
Dvey-Aharon, an alumnus of the IDF’s 8200 intelligence unit, has a PhD in machine learning. He founded AEYE Health with Danny Margalit, the former founding partner of Aladdin Knowledge Systems, where for 24 years he was the company’s CTO.

It’s really important that leaders don’t ignore this AI- and data-driven revolution – what I call the “intelligence revolution” – or allow other leaders in the organization to ignore it. Working out how to use AI, dealing with people-related challenges, avoiding the ethical pitfalls of AI, making sure you have the right technology in place, and so on – all are key considerations for the business leaders of today and tomorrow.
10 Essential Leadership Qualities For The Age Of Artificial Intelligence Adobe Stock

This technology revolution will change what it means to be a good leader. It makes sense, then, that business leaders in the intelligence revolution will need to adapt. The way we run businesses will change, and the successful leaders of the future will need a slightly different skillset from the traditional skills associated with leaders.

What sort of skills are we talking about? I believe successful leaders in the intelligence revolution will need to cultivate the following 10 leadership skills:



PROMOTED
1. Agility. The pace of change, particularly with AI, is astonishing. Leaders must therefore be able to embrace and celebrate change (including new technologies). And, importantly, they should not view change as a burden, but see it as an opportunity to grow and innovate, both at an individual and organizational level.

2. Emotional intelligence. As more and more workplace activities become automated, softer skills like emotional intelligence and empathy will become more critical for human workers. And if we expect the workplaces of the future to prioritize such human skills, it stands to reason that leaders must model these behaviors themselves.

3. Cultural intelligence. The workplaces of the future will be even more diverse, global and dispersed than they are today. Effective leaders will be able to appreciate and leverage the differences individuals bring to the table, and to respect and work well with people from all backgrounds – even when they share a different world view.

4. Humility. Confidence will still be an important trait in leaders, but the successful leaders of the future will be able to strike a balance between confidence and humility. They will see themselves as facilitators and collaborators, rather than critical cogs to success. In other words, they’ll encourage others to shine.

5. Accountability. Flatter organizational structures, more project-based teams, partnership working – all of these things will lead to organizations becoming more transparent and collaborative. Leaders will therefore need to be more transparent and hold themselves accountable. What’s more, their actions must be in clear alignment with the company’s goals.

6. Vision. To understand the impact of AI on the business and all of its stakeholders, leaders in the intelligence revolution will need that big-picture vision. How will AI transform the organization and lead to new business opportunities? It’s up to leaders to determine this, while managing stakeholders’ needs effectively.

7. Courage. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what AI can do, so leaders will need the courage to face the uncertain, the courage to fail fast, and the courage to change course when the situation calls for a new strategy. As part of this, they’ll need the courage to identify their own weaknesses and be open to coaching and learning. (In fact, as skills become outdated even more quickly in the future, successful leaders will need to cultivate a culture of learning right across the business.)

8. Intuition. There’s no doubt that data-driven decision making is the way forward, but that doesn't mean intuition and instinct will become obsolete, far from it. Particularly as workplaces undergo rapid change, leaders will still require that uniquely human skill of intuition, of being able to “read” what’s not being said.

9. Authenticity. Any new technology brings with it issues around ethics and misuse, not to mention issues around change management. Leaders in the intelligence revolution will therefore need to be able to build trust with customers, employees, and other stakeholders – and that means exuding authenticity. This will become especially important in times of uncertainty, change, or failure.

10. Focus. Finally, with the incredible pace of change, and the continual need to adapt, future leaders will need to maintain a laser-like focus on the organization’s strategic objectives. They’ll need to be able to cut through the chaos and hype to identify what’s really important – especially the initiatives and technology that will help the organization deliver on its goals.

The key takeaway here is that human leadership skills will be just as important in the intelligence revolution, if not more so. People are, and will remain, the most important asset for any business. But what we prize as key leadership skills in the future may look very different to the traditional leadership skills that are valued today. I predict that these softer, more human skills – things like humility and emotional intelligence – will become much more important going forward.

When the Department of Defense rolled out the Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2018, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) was at its core and established the same year. The Naval Postgraduate School is hosting the JAIC’s director, Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, U.S. Air Force (Retired); and chief operating officer, Mr. Nand Mulchandani, on Tuesday, 13 October to address the topic “Harnessing AI for National Security.” Ahead of this Secretary of the Navy Guest Lecture series event, Lieutenant Commander Karen Kutkiewicz, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Naval Institute Executive Fellow, interviewed Mr. Mulchandani.
Proceedings: What is the role of Joint Artificial Intelligence Center? How does it interact with the services? 
Mulchandani: The JAIC (pronounced “Jake”) is a center for excellence for AI. The DoD established the JAIC in 2018 and Lieutenant General Shanahan was the plankowner. I joined the team about six months later. Our primary mission initiatives benefit America’s national security, and our servicemembers. My background is as an entrepreneur in the Silicon Valley. The JAIC is a fusion between the U.S. Military and Silicon Valley. This level of teaming together is unique, with tech and military.
Our goal is to deliver AI-enabled capabilities at scale that transforms the DoD for the digital era. We use the best of what is there with the best of new ideas and thinking and merge them together. It is two-sided. On one hand, we know that new technology is rapidly evolving. Just like in the tech industry, there are pathfinders that try everything out, that is our job for the DoD. What new technologies would most benefit us? On the other hand, we get a demand signal from our customer, whether it is a need for business process transformation, innovative health solutions, predictive maintenance, or AI-enabled warfighting capabilities. At the JAIC, our job is to survey the demand side, bring the tech side, and create a solution.
There are three million members in DoD. At the JAIC, we employ 180 people. We cannot drive change ourselves. We need everyone in the DoD to bring their needs to light. We leverage our tech background and thinking. The JAIC’s job is to not make something once. Highly successful business models are leveraged, repeatable, and scalable. That is how we bring AI capability to the entire organization. We are building platforms open to all users of the DoD, and operating at an industrial scale. We research, test, prototype, mechanize, evaluate, and package AI, all for the precise use of our Armed Forces.
Our relationships with the services and combatant commands continue to grow and thrive, and we think of them as our customer base. We have a mission team, and their job is to engage and interact with the combatant commands and the services to understand the command demand signals side of the equation. As we are building out the relationships, we are learning from them what their needs and requirements are to execute their mission. We have service representatives and subgroups for AI policy, testing and evaluation, ethics, education and training, and AI governance. We find common elements to the problems they are having and develop generic solutions that are customizable for their particular use case. The heart of our customer engagement mission is to learn the service’s needs and requirements, take our technological expertise, to create efficiencies for American competitive advantage. 







Proceedings: What advance/s are you most excited to see come to fruition? 
Mulchandani: My aspirational vision is the ability of us as a department to develop crucial software that will be the key determinate to victory in a  future fight. This software will be our literal ability to access and compute data to build more advanced AI products. Software for predictive maintenance will predict failure or success in the field. In the next couple of months, we will be seeing an early version of the breakthrough ‘Joint Common Foundation’, to enable servicemembers at scale to use the technology that we make. The Joint Common Foundation is a cloud-enabled AI platform that will build momentum across the entire DoD enterprise. It will accelerate AI development, testing, and evaluation of new capabilities. General Jack Shanahan has a great analogy for this, the department of electricity. There is no department of electricity anymore but there are electricians. When we do our jobs right, the JAIC will leave behind only power stations and electricians. We will have AI integrated into the fabric of what we do as an organization. This improves the DoD, and that is the win.
Proceedings: Does China or Russia have an advantage in AI? If yes, what are their advantages and what can we do about it?  
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: First, AI is not a single technology. It is a collection of algorithms and modeling. AI used to be called statistics- a collection of technology, string, and numerical data to make predictions. Saying China or Russia is very broad. One country is too wide to be characterized. Tech matures and grows where we focus, where we invest our manpower and resources. There are certain fields where each country is more heavily invested. Look at the great fire wall in China, filtering on key words in searches, facial recognition for tracking of citizens. China does have the lead in certain areas that they care most about, population control, law enforcement, etc. We, as the United States, have not necessarily focused on these areas. 
As Americans, we are the ones innovating, the universities conducting the extensive research, publishing, and implementing technology to scale. There is no question that United States still has the advantage. The challenge is that the Chinese work is in house and the PLA gets the first fruits.  At the JAIC, we work with industry, take their first fruits, and integrate that into our system. The real challenge is that sometimes the military can be rigid. But in our short two-year existence, we are paving the way toward integration and improving the day-to-day life of each servicemember.
Proceedings: What are some ways AI will significantly change our day-to-day lives or day-to-day operations for the military?  
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: We are building a leveraged business model where 180 people hope to change a three-million-person organization.  Our job is to do something so that every marginal piece of inputs or work that can affect 10,000 or 20,000, or 100,000 people. That is the leverage business model and that becomes the heart what the JAIC is aspiring which is by being a Center of Excellence by building a platform that can open to all users in the DoD. We customize the platform to them, and it grows more precise with more data and input. When we are taking about lethality and warfare, we need precision. And not just precision one time, but repeatable precision. AI is becoming woven into the fabric of our personal and professional lives. The JAIC is delivering AI-enabled solutions to our everyday problems that affect our troops around the globe.
Proceedings: Last month, the Center hosted the first-ever International AI Dialogue for Defense, what were the biggest takeaways?
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: For me, the biggest takeaway was that we are closer to our allies than we are apart with respect to systems and ethics. We may be different culturally, but the more we engage with our partners and allies, the more we learn that we agree on most principles and ideas. The resulting dialogue strengthened our alliances. We, the U.S. and the JAIC, are the ones who are leading and sparking this discussion as the host nation. Thirteen countries came together for the AI Dialogue for Defense. Ethics and AI go hand in hand. We agreed upon and used an ethical framework to facilitate open dialogue. That was marked success.One of the biggest challenges to solve in AI is unintended consequences and a primary topic of the Dialogue. Basically, if I can’t explain it, I can’t test it, I can’t trust it, then it would be unpredictable, and have unintended consequences. But if I can explain, test, trust, predict, then it would produce the intended consequences that we expect. Most AI in the world has been productionalized. That is, where the consequences of being wrong is very low, like Siri, Netflix, etc. You can try to change your voice or add more data points to try to fix it, but if it is wrong you watch Tiger King instead of Stranger Things. To date, AI has low consequences as we have deployed AI based cognitive assistance systems without the serious consequences. Now we are dealing with weapons systems. That is why we here at the DoD are spending so much time to ensure excellence that is aligned with America’s laws and values. The problems that we are dealing with have life and death consequences. We are even working on a Search and Rescue product for the Coast Guard. The stakes are high for us to complete our mission. What improvements we do today to accelerate and deliver AI to the warfighter is a game-changer. As I said before, this will be the difference between winning and losing whatever comes next.

Optimizing your training with artificial intelligence

The AI Endurance app helps athletes train smarter to get the most out of themselves ahead of goal races and runs

Markus Rummel got into endurance sports in 2012, and for a while, he had no issues fitting training into his schedule. But he was in university at the time, and after graduating, finding a job and getting married, he struggled to work in as many training sessions as he had before. “I had way less time to train, so I wanted to be more optimal about it,” he says. To do this, he created an app called AI Endurance that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to prepare personalized training plans to help athletes optimize their workouts and perform at their best on race day. 


Today, AI Endurance is used by many athletes around Canada and the world, but when he first designed it, Rummel was the app’s lone client. “Last year, I trained half of my usual load and still got PBs everywhere,” he says. Rummel, who has a PhD in theoretical physics, is an avid triathlete. After several years in the sport, he noticed that everyone has different approaches to training. “Some people go hard a lot and others take it way easier,” he says. “We all fight about what is ‘right,’ but it’s different for everyone. What has worked for me over the years is so different from what’s worked for my friends.”

With AI Endurance, the guesswork is taken out of training, and each user can each finally find their perfect formula for success. So how does it work? After connecting your AI Endurance profile to your Strava, Garmin or other training files, the app will analyze your athletic history and determine what will work best for you. Then, you can edit your weekly availability. If your schedule changes and work or anything else prevents you from training one day, you can simply move a workout to another day in the week. Next, you input your plans for any upcoming races.

“So let’s say you have a race six weeks from now,” Rummel says. “The app will figure out the best thing you can do with your time limitations to get the best possible results.” The app’s AI will not only create a plan for you, but it will constantly update it based on your steady flow of workout data. This ensures that, no matter what changes occur in your life, your training will be optimized and personalized for you.

“With my app, you know that if you do the work, you’re going to see good results,” Rummel says. He adds that even though in-person races are largely on hold for the time being, there’s no reason not to start training with AI Endurance now. “Everyone wants to do well, especially when races come back. Even now you want to improve. The app can do that for you, and it does it in a motivating way. You know that if you put the work in, you’ll get a certain result instead of guessing.”

The graphic’s purpose was to bring together elements of the USAF and USSF to explain the mission while giving a nod to history. At the center of the patch is a T-7A Red Hawk, the USAFs new advanced jet trainer. Half of the aircraft has nodes of a neural network, the fundamental building blocks of machine learning algorithms. This represents a key component of the work at the Accelerator. The USAF logo and the USSF are in formation alongside the aircraft. This represents teamwork to address challenges, while working on broader ethical, moral and societal ramifications. The red rocker below the aircraft connects the T-7A namesake, “Red Hawk,” to the original Tuskegee Airmen and their Red Tail Squadron. The Accelerator builds upon the momentum of the Tuskegee Airmen to help lead the world in Artificial Intelligence development. (U.S. Air National Guard graphic by Staff Sgt.
