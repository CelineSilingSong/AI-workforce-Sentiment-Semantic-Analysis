For all the progress that’s been made in the field of artificial intelligence, the world’s most flexible, efficient information processor remains the human brain. Although we can quickly make decisions based on incomplete and changing information, many of today’s artificial intelligence systems only work after being trained on well-labeled data, and when new information is available, a complete retraining is often required to incorporate it.
Now the startup Nara Logics, co-founded by an MIT alumnus, is trying to take artificial intelligence to the next level by more closely mimicking the brain. The company’s AI engine uses recent discoveries in neuroscience to replicate brain structure and function at the circuit level.
The result is an AI platform that holds a number of advantages over traditional neural network-based systems. While other systems use meticulously tuned, fixed algorithms, users can interact with Nara Logics’ platform, changing variables and goals to further explore their data. The platform can also begin working without labeled training data, and can incorporate new datasets as they become available. Perhaps most importantly, Nara Logics’ platform can provide the reasons behind every recommendation it makes — a key driver of adoption in sectors like health care.
“A lot of our health care customers say they’ve had AI systems that give the likelihood of somebody being readmitted to the hospital, for example, but they’ve never had those ‘but why?’ reasons to be able to know what they can do about it,” says Nara Logics CEO Jana Eggers, who leads the company with CTO and founder Nathan Wilson PhD ’05.
Nara Logics’ AI is currently being used by health care organizations, consumer companies, manufacturers, and the federal government to do things like lower costs and better engage with customers.
“It’s for people whose decisions are getting complicated because there’s more factors [and data] being added, and for people that are looking at complex decisions differently because there's novel information available,” Eggers says.
The platform’s architecture is the result of Wilson’s decision to embrace the complexities of neuroscience rather than abstract away from them. He developed that approach over more than a decade working in MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, which has long held the mission of reverse engineering the human mind.
“At Nara Logics, we think neuroscience is on a really good track that’s going to lead to really exciting ways to make decisions that we haven't seen before,” Wilson says.
Following a passion
Wilson attended Cornell University for his undergraduate and master’s degrees, but once he got to MIT in 2000, he stuck around. Over the course of a five-year PhD and a seven-year postdoc, he created mathematical frameworks to simulate brain function.
“The community at MIT is really focused on coming up with new models of computation that go beyond what computer science offers,” Wilson says. “The work is connected with computer science, but also considers what our brain is doing that could teach us how computers work, or how computers could work.”
On nights and weekends during the final years of his postdoc, from 2010 to 2012, Wilson was also beginning to translate his algorithms into a commercial system in work that would be the foundation of Nara Logics. In 2014, his work caught the attention of Eggers, who had led a number of successful businesses but had grown jaded about the hype around artificial intelligence.
Eggers became convinced Nara Logics’ AI engine offered a superior way to help businesses. Even back then the engine, which the company refers to as Nara Logics Synaptic Intelligence, had properties that made it unique in the field.
In the engine, objects in customers’ data, such as patients and treatments, organize into matrices based on features they share with other objects, in a structure similar to what has been observed in biological systems. Relationships between objects also form through a series of local functions the company calls synaptic learning rules, adapted from cell- and circuit-based neuroscience studies.
“What we do is catalog all the metadata and what we call our Connectomes go in and mine the database of unstructured data and build links across all of it that relate these things,” Wilson explains. “Once you have that background, you can go in and say, ‘I like this, this, and this,’ and you let the engine crunch the data and give you matches to those parameters. What you didn’t have to do is have any notion of what the right answer was for lots of similar people. You skip that whole step.”
Each object in Nara Logics’ Synaptic Intelligence stores its properties and rules locally, allowing the platform to adjust to new data by updating only a small number of associated objects. The bottom-up approach is believed to be used by the brain.
“That’s totally different than deep learning or other approaches that just say, ‘We’re going to globally optimize everything, and each cell does what the global algorithm tells it,’” Wilson explains. “Neuroscientists are telling us each cell is making decisions on its own accord to an extent.”
The design allows users to explore relationships in data by “activating” certain objects or features and seeing what else gets activated or suppressed.
To give an answer, Nara Logics’ engine only activates a small number of objects in its dataset. The company says this is similar to the “sparse coding” believed to be used in higher brain regions, in which only a small number of neurons are activated in any given moment. The sparse coding principal allows the company to retrace its platform’s path and give users the reasons behind its decisions.
As the company has matured, Wilson has stayed plugged in to the MIT community’s research, and Nara Logics participated in the STEX25 startup accelerator, run by the MIT Startup Exchange.
Leveraging a mind-like AI
Manufacturers are already using Nara Logics’ platform to better understand data from internet-of-things devices, consumer companies are using it to better connect with customers, and health care groups are using it to make better treatment decisions.
“We’re focused on a specific algorithm, which is the mechanics of decision making,” Wilson says. “We believe it’s something you can codify, and we believe it’s something that’ll be insanely valuable if you can get that process right.”
As Covid-19 disrupted industries and underscored the need for organizations to invest in adaptive software tools, Nara Logics nearly doubled its customer base. The founders are thrilled to be scaling a solution they feel is more collaborative and responsive to humans than other AI systems.
“We think the most important difference we’re contributing to is building an AI where people participate and people are in the loop — they’re cognizant and understanding and aware of what it’s doing,” Wilson says. “That helps them make smarter decisions every day, and those add up to make a big difference.”

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.When you hear about artificial intelligence, stop imagining computers that can do everything we can do but better.My colleague Cade Metz, who has a new book about A.I., wants us to understand that the technology is promising but has its downsides: It’s currently less capable than people, and it is being coded with human bias.I spoke with Cade about what artificial intelligence is (and isn’t), areas where he’s hopeful and fearful of the consequences and areas where A.I. falls short of optimists’ hopes. Shira: Let’s start with the basics: What is artificial intelligence?Cade: It’s a term for a collection of concepts that allow computer systems to vaguely work like the brain. Some of my reporting and my book focus on one of those concepts: a neural network, which is a mathematical system that can analyze data and pinpoint patterns.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIf you take thousands of cat photos and feed them into a neural network, for instance, it can learn to recognize the patterns that define what a cat looks like. The first neural networks were built in the 1950s, but for decades they never really fulfilled their promise. That started to change around 2010.What changed?For decades, neural networks had two significant limitations: not enough data and not enough computer processing power. The internet gave us reams of data, and eventually scientists had enough computing power to crunch through it all.Where might people see the effects of neural networks?This one idea changed many technologies over the past 10 years. Digital assistants like Alexa, driverless cars, chat bots, computer systems that can write poetry, surveillance systems and robots that can pick up products in warehouses all rely on neural networks.Sometimes it feels that people talk about artificial intelligence as if it’s a magic potion.Yes. The original sin of the A.I. pioneers was that they called it artificial intelligence. When we hear the term, we imagine a computer that can do anything people can do. That wasn’t the case in the 1950s, and it’s not true now.People don’t realize how hard it is to duplicate human reasoning and our ability to deal with uncertainty. A self-driving car can recognize what’s around it — in some ways better than people can. But it doesn’t work well enough to drive anywhere at any time or do what you and I do, like react to something surprising on the road.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat downsides are there from neural networks and A.I.?So many. The machines will be capable of generating misinformation at a massive scale. There won’t be any way to tell what’s real online and what’s fake. Autonomous weapons have the potential to be incredibly dangerous, too.And the scariest thing is that many companies have promoted algorithms as a utopia that removes all human flaws. It doesn’t. Some neural networks learn from massive amounts of information on the internet — and that information was created by people. That means we are building computer systems that exhibit human bias — against women and people of color, for instance.Some American technologists, including the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, say that the United States isn’t taking A.I. seriously enough, and we risk falling behind China. How real is that concern?It’s legitimate but complicated. Schmidt and others want to try to make sure that the most important A.I. technology is built inside the Pentagon, not just inside giant technology companies like Google.But we have to be careful about how we compete with a country like China. In the United States, our best technology talent often comes from abroad, including China. Closing off our borders to experts in this field would hurt us in the long run.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTip of the WeekHow to be an informed online shopperA reader named Eva emailed On Tech asking about small software programs known as browser extensions, plug-ins or add-ons for Chrome, Safari and Firefox that claim they will save her money.“I keep seeing ads for these browser add-ons like Honey (from PayPal) and Capital One Shopping,” she wrote. “They claim they will automatically find and apply promo codes to save you money whenever you shop online. This sounds terrific, but I keep wondering, What’s in it for them? They’re not just doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. Before I sign up for these services, I want to know what the trade-off is. Can you help me find out?”Brian X. Chen, the New York Times personal technology columnist, has this response:Yes, there is always a trade-off. With free software, your personal data is often part of the transaction.I’d advise taking a few minutes to research the company’s business model and privacy policy.More than a year ago, Amazon warned customers to remove the Honey add-on because of privacy concerns. Honey’s privacy policy states: “Honey does not track your search engine history, emails or your browsing on any site that is not a retail website (a site where you can shop and make a purchase).”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRead between the lines: That means Honey can track your browsing on retail websites. (Honey has said that it uses data only in ways that people expect.)The privacy policy for Capital One Shopping is more explicit: “If you download and use our browser extension, we may collect browsing, product and e-commerce information, including but not limited to product pages viewed, pricing information, location data, purchase history on various merchant websites and services, the price you paid for items, whether a purchase was made, and the coupons that you used.”That’s a lot of information to hand over for software that automatically applies coupons. Whether or not that’s a fair trade is up to you.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBefore we go …So. Much. Money.

Panel: Pentagon Needs High-Level Attention on AI, Digital Workforce to Keep Up With China

Pentagon leaders need to set clear digital readiness performance goals this year as a first step in revamping the requirements process so the United States can maintain its military technological advantage, the vice chairman of a national panel on artificial intelligence said Friday.
Robert Work, former deputy secretary of defense and undersecretary of the Navy, told a joint hearing of the House Armed Services cyber, innovative technologies and information systems subcommittee and the House Oversight and Reform national security subcommittee that, if the Defense Department doesn’t take these steps, China will overtake the United States technologically in the next decade.
The panel laid out recommendations directly affecting the Pentagon in the 700-plus-page report from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Work said the important reforms would require “top-down leadership” that starts with a “high-level steering committee on emerging technology.” Co-chairing that committee would be the deputy secretary of defense, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the principal deputy director of national intelligence. “They set the priorities,” he said.
In short, without that kind of leadership, the report states, “uneven adoption of AI will threaten military interoperability and the political cohesion and resiliency of U.S. alliances.”
That also translates into having the under secretary of defense for research and engineering become the co-chair and chief science advisor to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, where critical decisions are made on what systems to buy.
At the combatant commander level, the report recommends following the example of Adm. Craig Faller, head of U.S. Southern Command, in having an AI operations advocate to advise him and staff on what capabilities they have on hand and also what AI can and cannot do for them. The report notes the advisory role would be similar to the role played by staff judge advocates.
The goal is to have all this in place and running by 2025.
“AI will improve intelligence analysis,” Gilman Louie, venture capitalist and former head of the CIA’s venture capitalist operation In-Q-Tel, said during the hearing.
Work said the Pentagon and other governmental agencies need “to establish a common digital ecosystem” with the private sector, universities and research institutions. The report notes that “a lack of national urgency is dangerous at a time when underlying weaknesses have emerged in our AI ecosystem that impair innovation and when viewed against the backdrop of China’s state-directed AI progress.”
Louie viewed the situation now as “a gathering storm” where China and Russia are using cyber attacks and harvesting data from open Western sources to their advantage. All too often, the Defense Department, governments at all levels and much of private industry do not realize that “software and AI are joined at the hip” and should not simply be added on to big programs. Instead, they are “to be consumed like fuel.”
Eric Schmidt, commission chairman and former head of Google, said “the real strength of our nation will come from software and AI.” He then stressed the importance of attracting home-grown talent to these fields and retaining immigrants who come to American universities for advanced science and technology degrees. As he told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month, the United States holds a slim technological lead over China in part because it offers opportunities that Beijing does not.
“We want entrepreneurs,” Louie said in answer to what kind of immigrants the United States should retain. The report offers suggested legislation on how to attract and retain these immigrants who are doing doctoral work at American universities. “Talent comes to democracies,” he said.
Schmidt said “it’s stupid” to send these graduates back abroad to compete with the United States. Earlier in the hearing, he said China is America’s “pacing competitor” for software, hardware and talent.

Organizational reform and an emphasis on AI are not enough to retain technological edge in high-technology fields, panel members noted.
Former Federal Communications Commissioner Mignon Clyburn told the joint hearing “the military needs expertise in and out of the uniform.” After reviewing Pentagon personnel policies and career paths, she argued that the Defense Department “is unlikely to develop that expertise on its own.”
Worse yet, the Pentagon often loses its uniformed personnel with software development and artificial intelligence skills because there is no sure path for promotion by staying in those fields.
“We must stop bleeding talent,” she said.
Along with that change, she said the services must train “junior leaders … on when to trust machine learning” in their decision-making early in their careers. The military could also incentivize experimentation with and early adoption of AI tools by having that work help officers looking for promotions to more senior positions, much the way the military incentivizes education and other skills by incorporating them via the promotion board process.
Committee members repeatedly questioned the recommendations for a Digital Corps, a Digital Reserve Corps and the establishment of a degree-granting Digital Academy.
Clyburn told the members “we have a clogged pipeline” to entering government service when a candidate with digital skills is interested in joining the workforce, and retaining them is also difficult because promotion opportunities can be limited.
“The Digital Corps is modeled on the Army’s Medical Corps” and organized along specialized lines. It would have its own personnel policies, guidelines for promotion, training opportunities and continued certification.
Clyburn compared the civilian National Reserve Digital Corps to the National Guard or the services’ reserve components. They would meet monthly and have a two-week annual obligation as well: 38 days total. As the report notes, “they can help improve AI education, perform data triage and acquisition, help guide projects and frame digital solutions” across the government.
She added there would be a commitment to serve for a specified time and there would be scholarship inducements to attract recruits.
The Digital Academy would offer a highly-concentrated seven-year technological curriculum. Like the military services academies, there would be no tuition charges but rather an obligation to serve in the Digital Corps for five years upon graduation, Clyburn said.
Cost is definitely a factor as to whether Congress agrees to go ahead with the academy recommendation. Schmidt said, “there are universities helping us with this.”
Several times in his opening statement and later in questioning, Work, like other commission members, said “AI adoption has to be accelerated” and it has to be done with allies and partners to present a united, democratic response to China and Russia.
“We want to be exploiting homegrown talent” as well as attracting graduate students from abroad, he said.
Looking at the Pentagon itself, Work added “there’s a lot of talent in the department. They will rock the world” if barriers are broken down and career paths created. “Give them a classifier” so they can be identified and promoted.
“Computer science is the number-one major, not economics” in American universities, Schmidt said. The problem is these graduates “are coming into the private sector because they can work in it,” which is something that’s currently difficult to do in uniform or civilian government service.

Event Recap: Addressing Inequality in Artificial Intelligence
BY: NATALIE GOLD
When you open your phone with facial recognition or notice suggested products on your social media accounts, that is artificial intelligence (AI) at work. Though AI is useful and can help complete a variety of tasks that usually require human intelligence, it is also laced with problems of inequality and bias. BU’s Hariri Institute for Computing hosted three guest speakers at the forefront of creating change in the field of AI as part of the inaugural Distinguished Speaker Series: AI & Inequalities-Creating Change. Sabelo Mhlambi, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Whittaker presented individually on topics ranging from the colonial values embedded in AI to AI ethics at big tech companies, and then came together for a public panel event.
Sabelo Mhlambi talked about applying the Ubuntu framework to AI research.
Sabelo Mhlambi, a Technology and Human Rights Fellow at Harvard Carr’s Center for Human Rights and founder of Bantucracy, was the first presenter in the series. Mhlambi discussed how AI researchers can reject colonial values by reversing the dehumanization that has been caused by racism, capitalism, and colonization. Mhlambi proposed incorporating an Ubuntu framework into AI. Ubuntu is a sub-Saharan African moral philosophy that posits a person is connected to other persons of the past, present, and future, and is a person because of these connections. Mhalmbi suggests that the Ubuntu framework can help build machines and systems that reflect and value the well-being of communities. “Solutions require the active involvement of all those concerned,“ said Mhlambi.
Timnit Gebru spoke about the hierarchy of knowledge in machine learning.
Timnit Gebru, a computer scientist and co-founder of Black in AI, spoke about her journey to realizing that technology and science are not separate from society. A hierarchy of knowledge, where some ideas are seen as more important than others, can happen when researchers don’t address societal issues in their work. Ideas from areas such as history and critical race theory may be perceived as unimportant. Work that incorporates these ideas and addresses social issues are therefore seen as lesser. Gebru now tries to incorporate ideas from outside the computer science discipline into her AI research. Incorporating social perspectives into computer science research can reveal some of the biases in AI. “Gatekeeping is always done by those in power,” said Gebru. 
Meredith Whittaker explained the relationship between big tech companies and academic institutions.
Meredith Whittaker, Minderoo Research Professor at New York University, founder of Google’s Open Research Group, and co-founder of the AI Now Institute, addressed the intertwining of academia with big tech companies. Only a handful of companies have the means to build and scale AI due to their vast computational power, wealth, and datasets. Many computer science programs across colleges and universities rely on these companies for infrastructure and funding. In return, companies rely on the schools to train and educate the talent that they will eventually hire. This entanglement makes it difficult for criticisms of the tech industry. Whittaker explained that she has seen the same pattern over and over again: researchers ask critical questions of tech companies, conduct research that might threaten the companies, and then face opposition designed to silence their work. “Google is now sure enough of its power that it is no longer pretending to tolerate criticism of its work,“ said Whittaker.
On March 5 2021, the three distinguished speakers came together to answer questions about the role of big tech in AI research, how AI is intertwined with social and labor movements, and what researchers entering the field of AI should know. All the speakers encouraged students to bring their whole selves to their fields of research, including their personal backgrounds and experiences. Whittaker spoke to the power of collective action, specifically pointing to the power of choosing not to work for a certain company. Whittaker suggested that those who have the privilege to choose not to work somewhere should explain why, and amplify their message. Gebru noted that collective movements can support and defend critical research and Mhalmbi echoed these sentiments, suggesting that the rejection of broken systems becomes possible only when the push comes from a larger movement.
These kinds of discussions are just the beginning for addressing biases and inequalities in AI. The Hariri Institute’s inaugural Distinguished Speaker Series highlighted the importance of not only addressing these problems at conferences or lectures, but also in the AI field, itself. Considering how fast the field of AI is growing, solutions for more ethical AI and technology need to be implemented sooner rather than later.

The next Distinguished Speaker Series: Machine Learning for Model-Rich Problems will begin on Friday, April 16th at 11:00 AM. For details and event registration, please visit here.

Online game developed by researchers shows challenges facing the world of work in the future












March 16, 2021


We live in a world where robots increasingly build our cars, algorithms trade stocks and computers translate texts. Robotics, digitalization and artificial intelligence are transforming numerous professions. Some jobs are disappearing, while other new ones are being created. The online game ‘The Automated Life’ now enables users to try out how they might survive in an increasingly automated world of work. The game was developed in the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.

What will the future of work look like when artificial intelligence and robots do many of the tasks previously performed by human beings? What knowledge and skills will be in demand in the future? Which jobs will no longer be required? Which new ones will be added? These are the issues addressed by the online game ‘The Automated Life’, designed and developed by Alex Rutherford of the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. Players start out with a job that is severely threatened by automation. They have to save up for further training and apply for new jobs, which in turn offer new options for further training programs and careers. Meanwhile, automation relentlessly advances as jobs are constantly eliminated by new technological developments. Bearing in mind how many more years there are to go before they retire and keeping an eye on their bank balance, players have to be quick to make smart decisions so as to win out against automation – and finally enjoy a well-deserved retirement.
“We’re seeing time and again how the accelerating pace of automation is causing people a lot of stress and generating a sense of fear about the future. Our aim was to capture this in a game and show how people in low-paid jobs experience automation,” says Alex Rutherford, Senior Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. At the Center for Humans and Machines, he leads a working group on the future of work, conducting research at the intersection between network science, labor economics and artificial intelligence. Alex Rutherford himself had the idea for the game and he was in charge of the creation process, which also involved New York based game developer Francis Tseng. “In computer games, the developers set the rules – players can only make limited decisions. So in fact it’s rather similar to automation in working life,” says Francis Tseng.
The team at Center for Humans and Machines has caused a stir in the past with its scientific online games. MyGoodness, led by Associate Research Scientist Edmond Awad, is a game about altruism that rates people based on how generous they donate, while BeeMe, led by CHM Research Scientist Niccolo Pescetelli, was an immersive “social game” played on a huge scale at Halloween in 2018 where the crowd collectively controlled a real human being and sent him on an adventure.
The aim of the online game ‘The Automated Life’ will be to analyze players’ data anonymously so as to be able to use it for further research. “Automation in the world of work is an issue that affects us all in some way and confronts society with significant challenges. That’s why research is needed that explores the problems and identifies potential solutions,” says Alex Rutherford.

It is undoubtedly one of the most important inventions of mankind, because it combines important future technologies and will accelerate them. It can also help us to master the greatest challenges of our time.Already today, algorithms using AI are firmly integrated into our everyday life. For example in route calculation with Google Maps, in conversations with Alexa/Siri or our personalized Netflix recommendations.However, artificial intelligence is (still) far from being a general problem solver. Its applications are currently limited to individual areas in which it is constantly improving.“The rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.” — Stephen HawkingThe artificial intelligence known from science fiction movies such as Ex Machina, Blade Runner or Star Trek, which dominates our world, is thus far from being reality. However, anyone who only deals with the subject a little will quickly recognize the opportunities, but also the risks, of this future technology. It is the motor for perhaps the greatest change in human history …Big Data JobsSummary: Artificial intelligence as the brain of our future?Artificial intelligence gives machines the ability to analyze data and make independent decisions and perform human-like tasks intelligently.In fact, most people have already had contact with an AI. Be it through the personalized feed on Instagram, filtered spam in Gmail or the proposed Spotify playlist.AI is especially suited for analyzing and detecting patterns in large amounts of data. It is also able to make accurate predictions based on historical data.The research of artificial intelligence comprises a multitude of sub-areas. These include computer science, neuroscience and linguistics.It is highly controversial among researchers whether artificial intelligence will develop humanity for the better or for the worse. What is certain is that AI will exponentially accelerate either one or the other.WTF is artificial intelligence?To answer the question, when a machine is intelligent, the Turing test is used in general. Simplified: A machine is to consider as intelligent, if its behavior (e.g. in chat-answers) is not distinguishable from a human being.A milestone in this context is the passing of the Turing Test of Google Duplex in May 2018. The further development of the Google Assistant arranged a hairdresser appointment without her counterpart noticing that she was talking to a machine on the phone. Creepy? This is just the beginning.Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Co: Subareas of AIPeople make around 20,000 decisions a day. Most of them unconsciously. What we decide for depends strongly on our past experiences (the data).But what is everyday life for us is incredibly difficult for machines. Over the past 70 years, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence have made considerable progress, opening the door to many areas. For example, computer science, with its complicated computer models, is just as much a part of AI as the neurosciences, which have brought a great deal of knowledge from the human brain — in the form of neural networks, for example — to the study of smart machines. The results are self-learning machines. But learning also involves the reception of information, which confronted scientists with questions about how we communicate with each other and generally process information. Questions upon questions.Trending AI Articles:1. Top 5 Open-Source Machine Learning Recommender System Projects With Resources2. Deep Learning in Self-Driving Cars3. Generalization Technique for ML models4. Why You Should Ditch Your In-House Training Data Tools (And Avoid Building Your Own)The main areas of artificial intelligence can be summarized as follows:Machine Learning: Applications make decisions based on data. A distinction is made between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning requires pairs of inputs and outputs. As soon as the system has been trained with enough data, it is able to create connections on its own. In unsupervised learning the application creates its own model with its own classifiers.Deep Learning: is a subset of Machine Learning. Also called the supreme discipline of AI. It is used to examine large amounts of data for patterns and trends — e.g. in face, object or speech recognition. So-called neural networks are used for this purpose, which are inspired by the biological neural networks of our human brain. The networks are able to learn on their own and to link what they have learned with new content again and again. The human being does not intervene any more. In contrast to machine learning, which works with fixed model groups, deep learning algorithms develop the models independently.Computer Vision: Enables applications to understand images or videos. A common application is face recognition — whether for marking friends on Facebook or identifying suspects. Other applications can be found in medicine, where algorithms can recognize x-rays, compare them with huge amounts of data, and provide doctors with diagnoses and recommendations for action.Natural Language Processing, NLP for short: Attempts to process natural language on a computer. This should enable applications to be controlled by speech. Everyone who has ever talked to Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana has been an NLP user.Graphic: https://media.g2crowd.comWeak vs. strong artificial intelligenceIn addition, a general distinction is made between weak AI and strong AI.Weak AI (also called Narrow AI) is limited to individual application problems, whereby they are capable of self-optimization or learning within their limited problem. All AIs existing today fall into this category. Examples can be found in speech recognition via Siri & Alexa, navigation systems like Google Maps but also in the individualized control of advertising.Strong AI (or general AI) is also called super intelligence and fulfills all the clichés of Hollywood movies. The goal is to achieve or even exceed the same intellectual abilities of people. Such artificial intelligence no longer acts only reactively, but of its own accord, intelligently and flexibly.http://www.xmind.net/m/4nrkujHow artificial intelligence is shaping our present and futureArtificial intelligence in the form of intelligent machines is not a specter of the future! For many people, it is already usable in the here and now — be it with Google Maps navigation, Facebook’s news feed or a Spotify playlist personalized for you.It’s important to make a distinction here: We’re only talking about “weak” AI here. All of our artificial intelligences in 2020 are to be classified as weak. They are only applicable to individual application areas. A strong AI, on the other hand, knows everything, can do everything and acts on its own initiative. It is superior to humans in every respect. Such a thing exists (so far, fortunately) only in our imagination. After all, would you trust the same people who demonstrated against Corona security measures during the Corona pandemic to make rules for AIs? I have my doubts if we are ready for that.“A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.”- Alan PerlisIn this article, we’ll take a look together at some of the most important areas of our lives and how AI could disrupt them. One thing in advance: The future will be incredible — whether incredibly good or incredibly bad remains to be seen.Where is AI already being used and what could our future look like with it?The ideal area of application for AI is the analysis and recognition of patterns in large amounts of data. AI systems can make predictions after recognizing the patterns — in the meantime better than humans. Among other things, this opens up the possibility of automating everyday tasks.There are hardly any limits to the use of artificial intelligence. The first applications of simple AI are already firmly integrated into our everyday lives — often without us noticing. But what potential does the new technology offer beyond that?EducationAs the saying goes, “You never stop learning.” Yet our current education system has changed little over the past decades, learning from the changes in our world. Most of the time, someone still stands in front and talks. The rest have to listen. On average, there are 65 students per professor in Germany. At the elementary school, there are “only” 16 students per teacher. This makes it almost impossible to promote the strengths and weaknesses of the students individually. In addition, not everyone learns in the same way (keywords: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, communicative) and not at the same time of day.AI Tutors: Already more than fictionHowever, it has been recognized that digitization is not a passing fad. Providing funding alone is not enough, however, as the DigitalPakt’s €5 billion scope makes clear. The digitization of the education system in Germany is already failing because many of the teachers do not even have e-mail addresses. In addition, many schools in this country are still WLAN-free zones.But leaving aside these “teething troubles,” the education system — along with its students and teachers — is poised for a never-before-seen wealth of fascinating opportunities.Pupils/StudentsPersonalized course plans (“smart content”): artificial intelligence can recognize what type of learner you are and tailor learning content to make it easier to remember. Visual learners watch more video content, auditory learners are introduced to topics via podcasts, and communicative learners are brought together in groups. Media companies will have exciting business models in the future to market a variety of quality content per learner type.On-demand learning: Especially in the tech industry, there are many “night owls” who are more productive in the evening than in the early morning. Why should students be any different? Instead of treating everyone the same, artificial intelligence will also be able to determine the optimal time for learning and thus support learners.AI tutors: some subjects are just not that easy to understand. Whereas in the past you might have been able to intercept a family member with questions, nowadays, for one thing, the topics have become more complex and, for another, there isn’t always someone at home. Artificial intelligence-controlled tutors (like chatbots only with a visual appearance) could help with queries and give learners a hand at any time.TeachersLesson & test preparation: Teachers invest a large part of their work in preparing the topics to be taught. However, it would be a Herculean task to consider the preparation for the different learning types completely separately. Artificial intelligence can do this. In addition, smart machines can also assign students to their type and react to changes in response. Students who need to catch up on certain topics could be given additional support through, for example, smaller interim tests, instead of being pushed to their limits only with the final test.Highlighting student weaknesses: While AI takes the daily grunt work away from teachers and professors, they would have time to devote to creativity, weaknesses as well as supporting learning. In doing so, AI can provide summaries of performance so that subsequently the teacher can work on it with the learner.Encourage engagement: Teacher and learner collaboration could experience a new level. Instead of talking about Rome in 44 B.C., you could engage all types of learners by walking through the historic city in virtual reality. You could experience together how the United States Declaration of Independence is signed. Students could also be placed into levels through gamification and receive benefits for certain achievements. Similar to the principles in our video games.The possibilities are fabulous! Teachers are given powerful tools through artificial intelligence to infect learners with their knowledge and give them a lifetime of opportunities. That these are no longer just fantasies is shown by our research today. Startups like Knewton, Century Tech and Thinkster Math are already creating the education system of the future that learners can look forward to.HealthcareIn healthcare, the three areas of diagnosis and treatment, medical imaging and health management are leading the way in the use of artificial intelligence. That our system needs support is shown by the data: By 2050, one in five Europeans will be over 65.Photo by Piron Guillaume on UnsplashA lot of medical data is already available today. However, this data is hardly used and is often not accessible to patients. This applies both to the selection of doctors and to patients’ own medical records. Another problem is administration. Many appointments canceled at short notice remain vacant, while new patients have to prepare for long waiting times. There is an additional significant workforce gap in the European healthcare sector.Artificial intelligence will be able to take over adminstrative tasks such as appointment management, make predictions about expected treatments and maintain (digital) patient records in the short term.In addition, AI will assist physicians such as nurses with treatment. Artificial intelligence can use image recognition in combination with Deep Learning to diagnose diseases early (see freenome and PathAI) and make recommendations to physicians. In addition, AI can be used to treat diseases preventively. In biotechnology, AI is generating new compounds and testing them at speeds not previously possible. Researchers at MIT, for example, developed AI that can identify new antibiotics. But startups BenevolentAi and Insitro are also conducting research in this area.The goal of artificial intelligence in healthcare is to create freedoms so that doctors and nurses can be brought closer to patients and their individual treatment. The tasks will undoubtedly change, but the jobs will become more important than ever.Photo by Sajjad Ahmadi on UnsplashMobilityThe fact that environmental pollution is very advanced, our cities are overcrowded and thousands of traffic deaths occur every year due to human error is forcing people to rethink. Hardly any other topic has been as hyped in recent years as mobility. The field of autonomous driving in particular is very popular with the public, not least thanks to Elon Musk’s Tesla.Artificial intelligence can take over traffic management in our major cities in the future. Traffic jams can be avoided if all road users communicate with each other in real time. Accidents will be reduced to a minimum if human distraction is eliminated.It’s not just autonomous cars that can be controlled by artificial intelligence as if by magic, but also trucks, public transportation, airplanes, and shipping and rail traffic. Startups like Waymo, Aurora and Einride are already sending autonomous vehicles out on the roads and collecting billions in data. Even new modes of transportation like air cabs are no longer just science fiction, but are being implemented by startups like Lilium. Yet automated driving is not the same as driverless driving. Experts distinguish between five levels, from driver assistants to autonomous driving. Technologies such as AI, cloud computing and blockchain will also make it easier to operate autonomous vehicles like robots remotely in the future. Experts can intervene in special situations without having to be on site.Thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) in combination with machine learning, vehicles such as aircraft will also be able to be maintained proactively and autonomously in the future. Errors can thus be ruled out in advance, as wear and tear will be detected and avoided in good time.One future scenario could be that people will no longer want to leave their vehicle unused 95 percent of the day. They could switch to car-sharing providers whose vehicles can use machine-learning prediction models to calculate expected usage and thus autonomously meet demand in cities. The free space created by fewer and fewer vehicles could be redesigned and used more efficiently in the smart cities of the future.E-CommercePhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashIn marketing & especially in e-commerce, market leaders like Amazon and Alibaba are already using smart machines and algorithms from customer contact to automated logistics. Simple artificial intelligence, as in the personalized recommendation of products, has long been used by smaller companies as well.In the future, applications for AI are likely to be found in almost every area of online commerce.Customer relationship management (CRM): Even the smallest online retailers collect lots of customer data. Maintaining this data and linking it in a way that leads to a better understanding of the customer and concrete market advantages for the company is very difficult for humans. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, finds this data management easier. It can divide customers into segments and serve them recommendations and content based on these segments.AI Support: Great companies are characterized by their world-class customer support. Artificial intelligence is already supporting our businesses today in the form of chatbots. In the future, however, we could also have digital shopping assistants advising us in the form of virtual people. That these are likely to be indistinguishable from real people is demonstrated by the startup Soul Machines and Samsungs’ NEON.IoT + AI: Probably everyone has heard of the refrigerator that will reorder milk when it is empty in the future. The technology behind this is called the Internet of Things (IoT). Combined with artificial intelligence, this opens up completely new possibilities for online retail in the future. Subscriptions to groceries could be rethought, as could the autonomous repair of items.Last-mile delivery: making deliveries as fast as possible is an important issue for retailers. Thanks to artificial intelligence, drone deliveries and autonomous last-mile delivery vehicles are within the realm of possibility.This is just a small sample. Start-ups like Coveo and Narvar are working on applications that will make shopping easier for us in the future and make it seem even more personalized.Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashIndustryArtificial intelligence is already an integral part of our modern industry. It enables machines to perceive their environment, make their own decisions and learn on their own. AI is driving robots, which have become an integral part of production for decades — especially in the automotive industry.But artificial intelligence will also play an important role beyond that.Automation: In factories, products go through multiple processes. Many of these tasks are recurring and can therefore be automated. Modern robots can recognize objects, assign them and act on them.On-demand production control: New technologies such as 3D printing will make it possible to produce on demand in the future. Artificial intelligence can predictively control production based on demand and with predictive models.Error detection & quality assurance: Machines make fewer errors. This also applies to the thoroughness of their work. There are already machines in factories that ensure the quality of products.Product development: Artificial intelligence can be used, for example through topology optimization, to calculate new structures that, based on their function, deliver better performances with fewer materials.Danger of conflict — Why artificial intelligence is and should always be critically questionedThe use of artificial intelligence opens up previously unimaginable opportunities for mankind, but also risks. For all this to succeed, AI needs one thing above all: structured, detailed data from as many sources as possible.The falsification of data by us humans is problematic, as project “Tay” shows. This chatbot AI from Microsoft was fed conversations from Twitter users. It took just one day for the bot to become both racist and anti-feminist. But the tested AI also reached the wrong conclusions in experiments conducted by the American police. Because the AI was trained with “dirty data” from decades of police misconduct, it caused officers to disproportionately patrol and sweepingly suspect African-American neighborhoods.Another much-discussed issue is the ethics of machines. Because of the unprecedented scope of new technologies, machines will inevitably make life-and-death decisions. The example of autonomous driving raises the question of who gets to live: the child who runs a red light in front of a vehicle or the two pensioners in the vehicle who, if they swerve, will themselves be killed. The MIT Media Lab has used the Moral Machine to create scenarios to test for yourself.Perhaps the greatest concern, however, is the fear of omnipotent (powerful) artificial intelligence overtaking humanity in the Singularity and subsequently suppressing it. Even if, according to the current state of science, such an AI is far from being in the realm of feasibility, the question remains, how can we ensure that strong AIs are good in character? Only so much: The discussion would go beyond this framework.Cool stuffHow will machines — e.g. autonomous cars — decide in critical situations in the future? Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have designed the Moral Machine. Critical situations are shown — for example: children on the roadway vs. an elderly couple in the vehicle — and you have to make a moral decision about life and death. How would you decide, and only then how should the machine judge that:Moral MachineA platform for public participation in and discussion of the human perspective on machine-made moral decisionsmoralmachine.mit.eduSamsungs’ NEON virtual assistants — based on artificial intelligence — give a pretty impressive taste of the future. Whether as tutors in education, customer support in retail or as a virtual friend — they seem amazingly real:Machine learning combined with automation: Strateos Cloud Lab offers scientists the opportunity to have their tests performed autonomously in a lab automated by artificial intelligence and robotics. This involves defining the tests and then running them autonomously.

Artificial Intelligence and the Art of Culinary Presentation




How to preserve the creative process behind haute cuisine is explored in an online GSAPP event.

Photos of plates at L'Arpège by Emily L. Spratt and Alain Passard









On February 16, 2021, Emily L. Spratt, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Data Science Institute, gave an online presentation, “AI and the Art of Culinary Presentation: Gastronomic Algorithms between Alain Passard and Giuseppe Arcimboldo,” sponsored by the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation’s Historic Preservation Program.
Historic Preservation Program Director Jorge Otero-Pailos introduced Spratt, and commended her work for reimagining cultural heritage through the use of artificial intelligence.
“Even if we’re not experts in French cuisine, but just in preservation in general,” Otero-Pailos said, “how can we think of preservation as an expression, as something that needs to be created, and something that we all experience aesthetically?”
Spratt explored the creative process behind the platings, or presentations of food, by Alain Passard, chef and owner of the Paris-based, three-star Michelin restaurant L'Arpège. Her interest in his work was piqued by her observation that his dishes resemble paintings.

A prolific collage artist, Passard is known for employing the medium as an inspiration for his dishes. Computer scientist Thomas Fan and the staff of L'Arpège also contributed to the gastronomic algorithms project, which is notably the first application of Generative Adversarial Networks to the world of haute cuisine. 
“Although the recent developments of artificial intelligence to generate visual content with deep learning techniques, especially GANs, have offered radically new possibilities for its creative applications in the visual medium, there has been little investigation into its use as a tool to explore the engagement of the senses beyond vision alone,” Spratt said. 
Preserving Gastronomy as an Intangible Heritage
Spratt spoke about the preservation of culinary traditions and the history of gastronomic cultural heritage, showing photographs of menus from the Titanic and diagrams illustrating 17th-century linen folding techniques. Although tangible artifacts such as these reveal associations of a particular culinary experience, she pointed out their insufficiency in capturing the full experience of a meal. 





""Vertumnus,"" Guiseppe Arcimboldo, 1591





How can culinary traditions be preserved, Spratt asked, when food is ultimately meant to be consumed? UNESCO recognizes French cuisine as an intangible heritage, which it defines as “not the cultural manifestation itself, but rather the wealth of knowledge and skills that is transmitted through it from one generation to the next.” 
The gastronomic algorithms project, in contrast, emphasizes the cultural manifestation itself. Specifically, the project focuses on the artistic dimension of plating through Passard’s use of collages to visually conceive of actual plates of food. Taking this one step further, the project also explores how fruit-and-vegetable-embellished paintings by the Italian Renaissance artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1526-1593) could be reproduced through the use of artificial intelligence tools. 
Spratt then asked the leading question of her research: “How could GANs, a generative form of AI, emulate the culinary images, and would doing so visually reveal anything about the creative process between the chef’s abstracted notions of the plates and collages, and their actual visual execution as dishes?”
Experimenting With Datasets
Although Passard’s collages are a source of inspiration for his platings, a one-to-one visual correlation between the appearance of both does not exist. The dataset initially comprised photos posted by Passard on Instagram, images provided by the restaurant’s employees, and photos captured by Spratt at L'Arpège during each of the different seasons. This was later supplemented by images of vegetables and fruits on plates, as well as sliced variations procured from the internet using web scraping tools. 


To imitate aspects of Arcimboldo’s food-filled portraits, Spratt relied on a dataset of 300 portraits generated by a GANs-based model. Following initial tests, the dataset and algorithms were fine-tuned to increase the differentiation of individual fruits and vegetables characteristic of the platings designed by L'Arpège.
“The GANs-produced dishes have at once both an alluring aesthetic quality and a frightful one, as a tomato carpaccio seems to be able to open eyes and wink, and vegetable flourishes appear to have grown wisps of hair,” said Spratt.
Aiming for a more abstract version, Spratt added collages—created by both Passard and an artificial-intelligence algorithm—to the preexisting image dataset. Unique combinations such as these set the project apart from other AI-generated artworks.  
The Creativity Behind Culinary Art
Otero-Pailos asked Spratt to speak about the division between documentation and artistic expression in culinary art. “Does the line for you necessarily need to be blurred in this form of documentation? Or would you be okay with just a simple photograph of the plate as a record?”
The project, said Spratt, intentionally challenges the UNESCO definition of intangible heritage. Beyond mere documentation, the crux of the project focuses on the creativity behind culinary art. “How could that creative process [undertaken at L'Arpège] be codified as intangible heritage? How do we capture that?”

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has recommended introducing contemporary subjects like Artificial Intelligence in the curriculum, at relevant stages. The National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) has initiated the process for the preparation of a new National Curriculum Framework for School Education in pursuance of the NEP, 2020 during which the possibility of introducing an introductory course on Artificial Intelligence (AI) at secondary level would also be explored.
Meanwhile, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced Artificial Intelligence as a subject in class IX from session 2019-2020 and in Class-XI from session 2020-2021 in their affiliated schools.
Artificial Intelligence has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. Artificial Intelligence can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline administrative tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability.

By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for Artificial Intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students.
All AICTE approved institutions have been suggested to offer Artificial Intelligence as an elective in B.Tech. courses and also start B.Tech course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to augment the human resource in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics.  So far as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are concerned, their Acts and Statutes allow them to have their own curriculum, academic & research collaboration with Institutions and Universities across the world.
Most of the IITs offer various Artificial Intelligence related courses such as Deep Learning Foundations & Applications, Foundation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence, Predictive & Prescriptive Data Analytics, Deep Learning, System Identification, Cyber-Physical Security, Digital Image Processing, etc. Besides, IITs also organize short term programmes, inter-alia, on Artificial Intelligence for the working professional and interested students.
The information was given by the Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

Meanwhile, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced Artificial Intelligence as a subject in class IX from session 2019-2020 and in Class-XI from session 2020-2021 in their affiliated schools.

Artificial Intelligence has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems.

Your Next Job Interview May Be With a Robot—Whether You Realize It Or Not
Major companies such as Hilton and Unilever have used AI interview software, and an estimated 83 percent of US companies use some form of AI in their HR processes.

Many companies have turned to artificial intelligence to lead hiring processes and cherry-pick job applicants… Welcome to the ‘Wild West of Hiring.’ Pixabay
When Emily applied for her dream job, she expected to ace her interview. She knew the company inside and out and had prepared to explain why she would be perfect for the role. When she received an invitation to a video platform that would record her responses to a series of questions, she was slightly thrown—she was applying for a people-facing role and had hoped to be able to build rapport with the hiring manager. Still, she hoped that she could still show her personality, even in pre-recorded clips.

What Emily didn’t realize until after the interview was that the third-party company that hosted the video software used facial analysis technology to screen candidates. Her interview would be assessed by an algorithm that used people’s facial expressions, intonation and word choice to evaluate whether Emily was right for the role.
The use of artificial intelligence has become increasingly widespread in recruitment over the last few years. Candidates are often asked to complete video interviews or online tests without any awareness that an algorithm will be the first assessor of their application. Major companies such as Hilton and Unilever have used AI interview software, and an estimated 83 percent of US companies use some form of AI in their HR processes.
“HR decision-making has always been based on the prior experience of recruiters and their intuition about a candidate,” says Prasanna Tambe, an Associate Professor of Operations, Information and Decisions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “Technology has made it easier than ever to apply for jobs, so recruiters have increasingly large stacks of applicants to evaluate, which takes time. Tools that can help recruiters sort through even larger numbers of applicants and make well-informed decisions are very attractive.”
The use of AI in recruitment ranges from video software to chatbots that answer basic queries from candidates and algorithms that screen resumes for keywords. The technology integrates seamlessly with existing HR processes—research shows that 73 percent of candidates could not tell that they were interacting with a chatbot when they reached out to companies to ask questions, and in most cases, candidates have no way of knowing that AI was used to screen their application.

But algorithm-driven application processes are not without their problems. In 2018 Amazon abandoned a computer program that used machine learning to score candidates after developers realized that the tool discriminated against female candidates.
“Algorithms can be biased and unfairly discriminate against some groups in the recruitment process,” explains Tambe. “AI systems learn to make predictions based on data, and so predictions are generally more accurate for groups which have more data available. The industry does seem to be becoming increasingly sensitive to this issue, and some tools and methods are being designed to try and mitigate these problems.”
The issue of bias remains a pressing problem in AI recruitment, but some experts argue that human-centered hiring processes have similar issues. Kevin Parker is CEO of industry-leading video interview company HireVue. HireVue has paved the way when it comes to AI-driven candidate assessments, but its video interview facial analysis tool was abandoned in late 2020 after significant public pushback, including a complaint to the FCC in 2019, and an independent audit. The company still uses automation technology including online assessments and chatbots to vet candidates, and Parker believes that although AI systems are vulnerable to bias, they also mitigate issues of interviewer discrimination.
“Humans are notoriously inconsistent and are subject to huge amounts of both conscious and unconscious biases,” he explains. “By utilizing AI, and committing to regular audits and tests of these AI systems, hiring teams can be sure that they are consistently and fairly evaluating all of their candidates based on what actually matters—their work-based skill set.”
Parker thinks that the current economic climate will only speed up the shift to AI-powered recruitment as hiring teams are bombarded with dozens of applications for a single role. But he also stresses the importance of using machine learning to support human-led decisions rather than replace them. He believes that one of the most important uses of automation could be found in refining how talent is utilized within companies, matching current employees with relevant internal vacancies and minimizing the time that candidates spend applying for multiple roles by identifying which jobs they are best suited to.
“AI could be key in ensuring that employees are continuing to develop,” he says. “It can give an accurate understanding of an employee’s current skill set and encourage organizations to reward loyalty and good performance by hiring from within.”
AI recruitment is now so common that some colleges are offering lessons in how to complete AI-powered interviews or applications for the best results, and there is an inevitable risk that algorithms could transform the recruitment process into a box-ticking exercise. Oliver Quie is an HR expert and co-founder of innerworks, an application that uses AI-driven personality tests to predict company-employee fit. Quie believes that as machine-based recruitment becomes increasingly popular, there is a risk that candidates might try to “game” the system—but he argues that this isn’t beneficial for candidates or employees.

“Bringing your own unbiased and differentiated ‘data’ to an interview is still the best way to stand out,” he says. “‘Data’ includes factors such as experience, personality, and raw intelligence. These are factual and measurable, and are less easy to game than factors such as appearing to interview well in an AI environment.”
Yet in spite of sticky issues around candidate comfort with the process and the possibility for system manipulation, the use of machine learning in hiring decisions is already becoming the norm. So what should you look out for in future interviews and applications? Parker suggests that although algorithms might feel slightly alien, they usually evaluate similar measures to a traditional interview and application process.
“As you would with any other job interview, take the necessary time to research the company, job role and the team that you would be working with,” he says. “Answer questions using the STAR framework: respond to questions by outlining the situation, the task, the activity at hand and the results of your work. And don’t panic over technology—technical hiccups happen. If the last year has taught us anything, it’s that we’re all doing the best we can—a glitch in your audio or a cameo from a roommate isn’t going to ruin your shot at a place that you want to work.”

The first challenge that IT pros need to beat when job-hunting is to get past the front door. Those doors, now more than ever, are often virtual: online job boards, networking sites like LinkedIn, corporate application tracking systems (ATS), and so forth.
That’s no secret. What’s more opaque is the behind-the-scenes pre-screening that is applied – often in automated fashion – to a virtual pile of resumes. This typically leads to the culling of multiple potential candidates from consideration before a human hiring manager or recruiter even gives their resumes a passing look. (And when we say “passing look,” we mean it: An oft-cited 2018 eye-tracking study conducted by the careers site Ladders found that human recruiters spend an average of just 7.6 seconds reading a resume during an initial review before moving on to the next one.)

Why companies use AI resume screening tools
For job hunters, it's useful to think about the why behind this process.
For job hunters, it’s useful to think about the why behind this process. Recruiters and hiring managers spend a lot of their time reading resumes. As is the case with a lot of repetitive, time-consuming work, it can literally pay to find ways to become more efficient, and HR tasks are no exception. (This becomes increasingly true for companies that receive hundreds of applications for a single position, especially when some of the resumes they receive simply don’t possess the qualifications required for the job.)
Some folks will point out that there are multiple HR processes ripe for automation. The software vendor UiPath states that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can enable HR pros to reclaim as much as 40 percent of their time.
That’s the main idea behind automatically pre-screening resumes based on certain criteria. The automation piece is commonly referred to as Artificial Intelligence (AI), but whether or not it’s actually AI or a different (but related) technology such as RPA, the principle remains more or less the same: Depending on where and how you apply for your next IT job, your resume may have to pass through some kind of automated test before it gets a chance to be reviewed by human eyes.
[ Made it to the interview stage? Also read: IT careers: Top IT job interview questions for 2021 ]
To be clear, not every organization does this. We reached out to one in-house recruiting executive at a tech firm who said their firm isn’t currently leveraging AI in their hiring processes, for example. But if you’re directly applying for jobs through a corporate ATS or other online application channels, there’s a growing chance there are some kind of automated filters in place.
How to build a resume that gets past AI screening tools: 5 tips
We asked two experienced IT recruiters who review virtually countless resumes as part of their work with both individual job seekers and hiring companies to shed some light on “beating the AI” – whether the system is actually leveraging AI or another form of automation. These are the tips and tricks they shared for getting past the first step and boosting your odds of success during a job hunt.
1. Don't go overboard trying to ""beat the system""
It’s important for job seekers who are applying online to understand that this is indeed a thing. Not realizing that an ATS or similar channel might be automatically pre-screening resumes is not all that different than submitting a resume full of typos. It might indicate a lack of effort or care.
That said, don’t stress out about it or become obsessive about trying to game the system.
“It can be hard to ‘beat the AI’ without knowing the phrases it’s looking for,” says Matt Deneroff, branch manager for Robert Half Technology in Washington, D.C. “Every system is different and you don’t want to appear to be trying to simply beat the system when applying.”
It can actually be counterproductive if your resume reads like a game of keyword bingo. 
In other words, going overboard isn’t necessarily productive since there’s a black box element to this process. These are typically rules-based engines, especially if RPA is involved – and you probably don’t know the rules. And it can actually be counterproductive if your resume reads like a game of keyword bingo and, as Deneroff notes, gives a human hiring manager the sense that you’re trying to fake your way through the process or are otherwise overselling your qualifications.
2. Tailor your resume to specific job descriptions
This is smart resume advice overall: Customize (not to be confused with “exaggerate” or “fabricate”) your resume for specific positions.
In the case of an ATS that uses some form of automated prescreening, doing so will have the added benefit of increasing the likelihood that the text in your resume hits the mark in terms of screening criteria the company may be using.
“Our best advice is that tailoring your resume to a specific job description [is the best way to get past initial screening phases],” Deneroff says. “Not only will you be tailoring it – including specific buzzwords that were mentioned in the job description, [for example] – but you’ll also be showing the hiring manager that you have the experience [they’re specifically looking for], which is most important.”
The job description itself is providing you a working vocabulary as a foundation for tailoring your resume accordingly.
Keywords do matter, provided you’re not actually trying to game the application process or mislead someone. As Deneroff indicates, the job description itself is providing you a working vocabulary as a foundation for tailoring your resume accordingly. Read the description closely.
If the job description lists Kubernetes and service mesh experience as important, your resume should, too. (Otherwise, why are you applying for that particular position?) Make sure things are spelled out and spelled correctly, too. Rules-based technologies like RPA aren’t usually smart enough to realize you’ve made a mistake. For similar reasons, don’t rely on too much industry shorthand or jargon; the system might not be set up to recognize or understand it.

3. Make smart formatting choices
RPA bots and other rules-based automation aren’t really ""reading"" resumes so much as ""parsing"" them. 
RPA bots and other rules-based automation aren’t really “reading” resumes so much as “parsing” them. That’s why keywords – spelled properly, among other necessities – matter. As does cutting down or eliminating too much “IT-speak.” In this context, that means terms, phrasing, or abbreviations that few people outside of IT will recognize or use. (“K8s” instead of the full name, Kubernetes, is a useful example here – err on the side of the latter.)
This is also why formatting choices matter – sometimes a lot. Even your resume’s file type can be the difference between getting past an ATS screen or not.
“For a resume to pass screening tools like AI or RPA bots, make sure it is clean, plain, and in a Word document,” says Jenna Spathis, unit manager of the technology recruiting team at LaSalle Network. “I have noticed more mis-parsed information when resumes are submitted as PDFs rather than Word documents.”
“Plain” is a good guiding principle: As in plain, readable text – and little else. That could be counterintuitive to someone in a design-oriented role, such as a UI/UI position. But save the creative flair for a later phase of the process.
“Formatting issues are a big reason for resumes not being passed through an applicant tracking system,” Spathis says.
As an example, someone might have their skills, education, and experience information – all core information on a resume – in different text boxes in a column view.
“I have noticed those resumes also parse incorrectly when going through pre-screening systems,” Spathis says. “RPA bots are in place to pull and parse the most relevant information, including contact information, experience, and education.”
In other words: Even if your creatively designed resume does pass muster, the system might not capture all of the information it’s supposed to – which means that the recruiter or hiring manager might get an incomplete first impression.
“To ensure all relevant information is being pulled, a plain, simple Word document with clear headers is the best course of action,” Spathis says. “Clear headers include Summary, Education, Professional Experience, Certifications, and Skills or Technical Skills.”
Spathis recommends software engineers and other relevant roles include a link to your Github. (Human reviewers will likely want to take a look.) Also, if you do have a more creative or visually appealing version of your resume, you can always share that in a later phase.
4. The ""usual"" resume advice is still widely applicable
The fundamentals still matter in the era of online applications and ATS tools – especially as AI plays an increasing role in the early phases of recruiting. Two big pieces of conventional career wisdom stand out in this light.
Get feedback on your resume. That could be a peer in the industry, a friend, a recruiter, or a professional resume reviewer or career coach. 
First, get feedback on your resume. That could be a peer in the industry, a friend, a recruiter, or a professional resume reviewer or career coach. But there’s never really a bad time to hear input from others who can give you an informed and honest opinion. That’s especially important to remember if you’re applying to lots of places and hearing nothing in response. Ask (or pay) someone to review your resume – there may be something you missed that’s hurting your chances.
[ Learn the non-negotiable skills, technologies, and processes CIOs are leaning on to build resilience and agility in this HBR Analytic Services report: Pillars of resilient digital transformation: How CIOs are driving organizational agility. ]
Second, treat online applications via a corporate ATS or third-party job app as one tool – but not your only tool. Strategies such as tapping your network (and your network’s networks) are as important as ever because with online applications you risk not even getting past the first step. You need a multi-pronged search strategy.
5. Remember: A strong resume is just the first step
Yes, the first step is important, but it’s just that – a first step. Among other reasons (ethical considerations included) why it’s not a good idea to try to flat-out game an ATS or other app is that even if you succeed, you still have a long way to go. Yes, do the above in terms of things like keywords and formatting. But remember that your resume is just a calling card or introduction of sorts.

“Especially in the tech space, there are many people who are smart enough to beat the system,” Denerrof says. “But in the end, it will always come down to experience and how you handle the latter stages of the interview process. While you want to ‘beat AI’ and get past step one, it is important to be setting yourself up for the steps that come after as well.”

AbstractArtificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. However, technology uptake will be largely driven by clinicians, and there is a paucity of data regarding the attitude that clinicians have to this new technology. In June–August 2019 we conducted an online survey of fellows and trainees of three specialty colleges (ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology, dermatology) in Australia and New Zealand on artificial intelligence. There were 632 complete responses (n = 305, 230, and 97, respectively), equating to a response rate of 20.4%, 5.1%, and 13.2% for the above colleges, respectively. The majority (n = 449, 71.0%) believed artificial intelligence would improve their field of medicine, and that medical workforce needs would be impacted by the technology within the next decade (n = 542, 85.8%). Improved disease screening and streamlining of monotonous tasks were identified as key benefits of artificial intelligence. The divestment of healthcare to technology companies and medical liability implications were the greatest concerns. Education was identified as a priority to prepare clinicians for the implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This survey highlights parallels between the perceptions of different clinician groups in Australia and New Zealand about artificial intelligence in medicine. Artificial intelligence was recognized as valuable technology that will have wide-ranging impacts on healthcare.

IntroductionNomograms and clinical algorithms have long played a role in supporting clinical decision-making in medicine. More recently, major advances in research on artificial intelligence (AI) have been applied to medical image analysis with promising results1,2. This technology is now poised for clinical application. In order for AI to fully deliver its potential benefits for healthcare, medical practitioners need to understand and embrace the technology. Equally, patients need to entrust aspects of their healthcare to AI systems.Numerous AI image analysis algorithms have been shown to achieve high level performance, in some instances comparable to human experts, in the detection of a range of diseases in ophthalmology3,4,5, radiology6,7,8, dermatology9,10, and in other fields of medicine. A significant milestone in the clinical application of AI came in 2018 with the US Food and Drug Administration approval of the IDx-DR system for the autonomous detection of referable diabetic retinopathy—the first such approval in any field of medicine2. Although the application of this technology is nascent, it has the potential to transform aspects of healthcare11.As is true for any new medical technology, the extent to which AI algorithms for screening, diagnosis or prognosis are adopted in medicine will be dependent upon the attitudes of clinicians and patients. Consideration of these attitudes and knowledge gaps will therefore be essential for health systems, medical educators, professional bodies, AI developers and regulators. Few studies have examined clinician perceptions of new AI technologies on healthcare provision and the clinical workforce. Those that have been conducted have surveyed the potential impacts of AI in samples of medical students12,13,14, radiology trainees15, radiologists16,17,18, pathologists19, psychiatrists20, general practitioners (GP)21, as well as general physicians, surgeons, and trainees22,23, with contrasting results. Most surveys indicate that clinicians believe that AI will have a positive impact on their profession13,16,17,18,19,22. Psychiatrists and general practitioners indicated that AI would not affect their profession20,21. In contrast, surveys of medical students12 and radiology trainees15 have highlighted concerns about the implications of AI for training and employment prospects24,25,26,27.Areas of medicine that are most reliant on imaging will be amongst the first to be impacted by advances in AI technologies28. These include ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology and dermatology. In this study we conducted a survey of fellows and trainees of these specialty colleges in Australia and New Zealand in order to ascertain their current use, understanding and perceptions of AI.ResultsDemographicsA total of 632 trainees and fellows from three specialty colleges (305 ophthalmology, 230 radiology/radiation oncology, and 97 dermatology) completed the survey (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Completed surveys were received from 20.4% of members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) (1279 fellows, 212 trainees), 5.1% of members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) (4505 fellows and trainees) and 13.2% of members of the Australasian College of Dermatologists (ACD) (621 fellows, 113 trainees). RANZCR members included both radiologists (n = 199; 86.5% of RANZCR respondents) and radiation oncologists (n = 31; 13.5% of RANZCR respondents). ACD respondents were from Australia, whereas RANZCO and RANZCR respondents were from Australia and New Zealand. Incomplete surveys (n = 85/717, 11.9%) were excluded from analyses (Supplementary Table 3). Responses from completed surveys are summarised in Supplementary Table 4.Respondents predominantly practiced in metropolitan areas (n = 460, 72.8%), followed by a combination of metropolitan and rural practice (n = 102, 16.1%) and rural practice only (n = 70, 11.1%). Ophthalmologists were more likely to spend at least part of their time in a rural setting than radiologists/radiation oncologists or dermatologists (32.5%, 21.7% and, 23.7% respectively, p = 0.064). Respondents from each group had similar years of professional experience (p = 0.608) and almost half of all respondents had been in practice for 20 years or more (n = 303, 47.9%) (see Supplementary Table 2).Current knowledge and use of artificial intelligence in clinical practiceAlmost half of respondents (47.6%; n = 301) rated their knowledge of AI as average relative to their peers, with few rating their knowledge as excellent (n = 35, 5.5%) or very poor (n = 31, 4.9%) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4). Responses were similar across the three professional groups (p = 0.542). Most respondents indicated that they had never used AI applications in their work as a clinician (511, 80.9%). Ophthalmologists were more than twice as likely to use AI in their daily clinical practice than radiologists/radiation oncologists or dermatologists (15.7%, 6.1% and 5.2%, respectively, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). Among the 67 ophthalmologists who specified how AI was utilized in their clinics, applications included those for glaucoma progression analysis, optical coherence tomography assessment, diabetic retinopathy image assessment and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation (Supplementary Table 5). Among the 40 radiologists/radiation oncologists who provided details as to how they use AI, applications included those for automated organ and lesion detection using computer aided detection of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (Supplementary Table 5). Among 8 dermatologists, the most common applications included those for skin lesion surveillance and voice transcription (Supplementary Table 5). Respondents who reported using AI had higher self-reported knowledge of AI than those that did not (p = 0.008).Figure 1Self-reported knowledge of artificial intelligence and its application in the respondent’s specialty, relative to peers in that field.Full size imageFigure 2Current frequency of artificial intelligence use in clinical practice.Full size imagePerceived impact of artificial intelligence on the professionMost respondents predicted that the introduction of AI would improve their field of practice (n = 449, 71.0% agreed or strongly agreed, Fig. 3). Almost two thirds (n = 379, 60.0%) of respondents believed that it would be ≤ 5 years before AI had a noticeable impact on their specialty (Fig. 4). No respondents reported that AI would never have a noticeable impact on their profession. Respondents who reported using AI predicted that the impact would be apparent sooner that respondents who did not (p < 0.001).Figure 3Levels of agreement with the statement “the field of [your specialty] will improve with the introduction of artificial intelligence”.Full size imageFigure 4Perceived length of time before artificial intelligence has a noticeable impact on [your specialty].Full size imageThe majority of respondents (n = 452, 71.1%) reported that AI will impact workforce needs ‘somewhat’ or ‘to a great extent’ in these specialty areas of medicine within the next decade. Most (n = 542, 85.8%) respondents believed that AI will impact workforce needs ‘somewhat’ or ‘to a great extent’ beyond the next decade. Radiologists/radiation oncologists were more likely to report workforce needs will be impacted ‘to a great extent’ within the next decade than ophthalmologists or dermatologists (54.4%, 41.6%, and 43.3%, respectively, p = 0.04) (Supplementary Table 4; Fig. 5).Figure 5Estimated impact of artificial intelligence on workforce needs within (< 10 years) and beyond (> 10 years) the next decade for each specialty group.Full size imageThe majority of radiologists/radiation oncologists (n = 202, 87.8%) and dermatologists (n = 53, 54.6%) considered that their medical specialist workforce would be impacted by AI to a greater extent than other health professionals in their field of practice (such as radiographers or general practitioners). In contrast, ophthalmologists considered that the impact of AI on the workforce would be greater for optometrists, than for general practitioners or ophthalmologists. Respondents who reported using AI were more likely to report that the introduction of AI would lead to the need for an increase in workforce numbers than did those who did not use AI (p = 0.006).Acceptable artificial intelligence performance standards and clinical workflowsMost survey respondents considered that AI systems would need to achieve performance that was superior to the average performing specialist when applied to screening for disease (n = 405, 64.1%, Fig. 6A) or for diagnostic decision support (n = 506, 80.1%, Fig. 6B).Figure 6100% stacked bars showing the acceptable level of error for an AI tool used for (A) disease screening and (B) clinical decision support.Full size imageRadiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were twice as likely as ophthalmologists to consider that AI screening systems should have error levels superior to the best performing specialist (21.7%, 20.6%, and 10.5% respectively, p = 0.005, Fig. 6A).Expectations for system performance were even higher when used for diagnostic decision support by specialists. Accordingly, radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were each more likely than ophthalmologists to expect AI systems to be superior to the best performing specialist when used for decision support (30.9% and 23.9% and 19.0% respectively, p = 0.035, Fig. 6B).A hypothetical clinical workflow was proposed as follows: “patient clinical images undergo artificial intelligence analysis. A specialist subsequently reviews both the image and the artificial intelligence findings”. Most respondents would consider using this clinical workflow, however significantly more ophthalmologists and radiologists/radiation oncologists were willing to consider this than dermatologists (82.0%, 82.6%, and 67.0% respectively, p < 0.001).Perceived advantages of the use of artificial intelligenceThe top three ranked potential advantages of AI were (1) improved patient access to disease screening, (2) improved diagnostic confidence, and (3) reduced time spent by specialists on monotonous tasks. The top ranked advantage for ophthalmologists and dermatologists was ‘improved patient access to disease screening’ and the top ranked advantage for radiologists/radiation oncologists was ‘reduced time spent on monotonous tasks’ (Fig. 7).Figure 7Radar plot showing the highest scoring responses for the greatest perceived advantages of the use of artificial intelligence. Responses were selected from a list of set choices. Plot axes represent the average ranks for all respondents, with higher scores indicating a higher ranking/stronger preference.Full size imageConcerns about the use of artificial intelligenceThe top three potential concerns about the use of AI were (1) concerns over the divestment of healthcare to large technology and data companies, (2) concerns over medical liability due to machine error, and (3) decreasing reliance on medical specialists for diagnosis and treatment advice. The top ranked concern for ophthalmologists and radiologists/radiation oncologists was ‘concerns over the divestment of healthcare to large technology and data companies.’ The top ranked concern for dermatologists was ‘concerns over medical liability due to machine error’ (Fig. 8).Figure 8Radar plot showing the highest scoring responses for the perceived concerns or drawbacks of the use of artificial intelligence. Responses were selected from a list of set choices. Plot axes represent the average ranks for all respondents, with higher scores indicating a higher ranking/stronger preference.Full size imagePreparedness for the introduction of artificial intelligence in clinical practiceA minority of respondents (n = 87; 13.8%) felt that the specialist training colleges were adequately prepared for the introduction of AI into clinical practice. Qualitative analysis of a total of 632 open-ended responses was performed, with similar responses grouped according to theme. Examples of verbatim responses are provided for each of the top five themes in Supplementary Table 6. Many respondents (n = 285) highlighted a need for improved training and education of college members about AI via scientific meetings, seminars, and the training curriculum. Some respondents highlighted the need for the colleges to be proactive in their approach in order to safeguard member interests (n = 99), with one participant requesting the college “make sure any changes are in the best interests of patients and [the] profession”. Others endorsed the development of frameworks and/or guidelines for AI implementation by the colleges (n = 30). The formation of sub-committees and working groups with expertise in AI to develop position statements (n = 46) was seen by some as a priority. Other response themes related to colleges taking leadership in relation to AI policy development and licensing (n = 74) and to be intimately involved in the trial and application of emerging AI systems (n = 69). Others called for the development of measures to ensure patient safety (n = 16) and the optimisation of clinical outcomes (n = 17).Ensuring that patient care remains in the realm of (the specialist) (n = 39) was recognized as a priority. In addition, the implementation of measures to assist clinicians in adapting to changes in care delivery (n = 17) was reported as a goal, with one respondent stating that this will “assist trainees to prepare for the AI era”. Some respondents highlighted a need for colleges to support more AI research (n = 69) and engage with industry, regulators and Government (n = 74). A need for clarity regarding the responsibilities of clinicians who will use the technology was also emphasised. Several respondents highlighted the need for a redefinition of the professional scope of specialists and related healthcare provider groups as AI is deployed more widely in clinical practice.Analysis according demographic subgroupsNo statistical differences were found for responses based on location of practice (metropolitan, rural or both, p > 0.149, Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, differences were noted based on years of clinical experience (Supplementary Table 8). Respondents currently in training were more than twice as likely than qualified specialists to consider that AI will impact workforce needs ‘to a great extent’ within the next decade (p < 0.001), despite no differences in self-reported knowledge of AI and its applications between these groups. Similarly, those still in training (n = 44, 66.7%) or with less than 5 years of experience as a specialist (n = 41, 66.1%) were more likely to believe that AI would impact practice ‘to a great extent’ beyond the next decade than were those with 20–30 years of experience or more than 30 years of experience (p < 0.001). Those with more than 30 years of experience were less likely to believe that workforce needs would decrease compared to those with fewer years of practice (p = 0.007).Comparison of responses between radiologists and radiation oncologistsDespite the distinct clinical roles of radiologists and radiation oncologists, no meaningful differences were detected in responses between the two professional groups (p ≥ 0.14), with the exception of knowledge of AI (radiation oncologists were more likely to rate their knowledge as below average compared to their peers, p = 0.02) and the number of years before AI has a noticeable effect on their field (radiation oncologists were more likely to believe that the effect will be noticeable within the next five years, p = 0.01). It is possible that responses from a larger sample of specialists in these fields may identify group differences.DiscussionThis survey was conducted to understand the perceptions of ophthalmologists, radiologists/radiation oncologists, and dermatologists about AI. These groups were selected as image analysis is a core work task for each profession and a variety of AI tools are being developed specifically for these specialties. To our knowledge, this survey is one of the first of its kind to investigate these specialist groups in parallel.Most survey respondents perceived the introduction of AI technology in their respective fields as a positive advance. A recent survey of fellows and trainees of the Canadian Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons had similar findings: 72.2% of 3,919 respondents indicated that AI would have a positive impact on workflow and/or clinical practice and patient experience. Only 17.2% of respondents in the Canadian survey indicated that AI would have either a negative impact on workflow or place their specialty at risk. These generally positive sentiments regarding AI have been echoed across a range of medical specialties in previous surveys13,14,15,16,19,22,23, however, surveys of general practitioners21 and of psychiatrists20 have indicated that the potential of AI may be limited for these groups. Similar to our findings, low rates of clinical AI use by radiologists/radiation oncologists have previously been reported, indicating that AI has not yet been widely adopted in this field15,16. However, it is possible that AI use is underreported in surveys such as this due to a lack of visibility of algorithms that are deployed within imaging platforms or variations in the interpretation of what constitutes AI.Most respondents considered that AI will have a noticeable impact on clinical practice within the next 5 years and on workforce needs within the next decade. In contrast, participants with more years of clinical experience were less likely to believe AI would have an impact on workforce needs within and beyond the coming decade, and current AI users were more likely to believe that workforce needs would increase. The current survey did not explore the basis for these diverging opinions. A survey of radiologists in the United States reported that AI would dramatically influence professional duties, however, the impact on workforce numbers was not ascertained15. Other surveys have indicated that workforce needs would remain stable or increase over the coming decade despite the introduction of AI16,18. Understanding the basis for these different perceptions on the impact of AI on the future medical workforce may be an interesting subject for further study.Improved access to disease screening was reported by ophthalmologists and dermatologists as the greatest perceived advantage to the use of AI. Recognition of the need for increased disease screening capacity may be explained by the combined effects of workforce maldistribution in regional and rural areas versus urban areas and projected increases in the burden of diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer, due to population ageing and growth29,30. The perceived advantage of reducing time on monotonous tasks by radiologists/radiation oncologists is not surprising given the large and growing volume of images viewed by these practitioners. Other studies have similarly identified reduced administrative burden and decreased image interpretation time as advantages of AI use for primary care physicians21 and pathologists16.The adoption of AI tools by clinicians is likely to be influenced by the extent to which they can be integrated into clinical workflows, enhance efficiency and achieve acceptable levels of performance31. The standards set by regulators of AI applications for health may not be directly aligned with the expectations of clinicians in practice. Interestingly, dermatologists were less accepting of a proposed clinical workflow which included AI-assisted diagnosis. This may be attributable to the distinct clinical practices of dermatologists31. Survey respondents had universally high expectations of AI system performance. There are many examples of AI outperforming humans1,2, however, until this study, little was known of the level of performance clinicians expect from AI systems.In keeping with high expectations for AI system performance, respondents were concerned about medical liability due to machine error. Legal processes for dealing with harms arising from new technologies have evolved in parallel with innovation, however the legal, moral and ethical considerations are increasingly challenging as technologies become more autonomous32,33. Lessons learned from autonomous vehicle technologies may provide some guidance, but this remains an area for further research and broad-based consultation33,34.An additional concern of respondents was a reduced reliance on medical specialists as a consequence of AI adoption. This concern is consistent with the impact of the technology on future workforce needs reported in this and other studies15,16,19. It is interesting that the primary concern of respondents was the divestment of healthcare to large technology companies. General mistrust in large technology companies has been documented recently35 and specifically in relation to healthcare36. Accordingly, numerous survey respondents called for leadership from specialist colleges and representative bodies to educate their members and to contribute to frameworks for the development, adoption and regulation of AI technologies in healthcare. The recent survey of fellows and residents conducted as part of the Canadian Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons Taskforce Report on Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Digital Technologies, similarly indicated that digital health literacy standards should be introduced and that governing bodies should take a proactive approach to AI23. Respondents called for improved training and education to improve awareness of AI and to increase proficiency in data science and statistics. Needs for training in ethics and legal aspects of AI ranked second to basic AI proficiency for fellows23.The limitations of this survey warrant consideration. Volunteer response bias means that the results may not be broadly representative of the views of clinicians in Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, the survey may not be generalizable beyond these countries. As response rates from radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists were low, it is not possible to ascertain whether the views of respondents are representative of others in these specialty groups. Finally, the survey design imposes limitations on the scope of response options and thus the survey findings should not be regarded as a comprehensive account of the perceptions of respondents. This limitation was mitigated by the inclusion of open-ended questions.In conclusion, this survey highlights major similarities between the perceptions of ophthalmologists, radiologists/radiation oncologists and dermatologists in Australia and New Zealand about the application of AI in medicine. Overall, AI was regarded as a means to improve patient access to care, as well as to enhance clinical efficiency and performance. Concerns were raised about the influence of large technology and data companies, implications for medical liability and reduced reliance on medical specialists. As the successful implementation of AI in healthcare is dependent on detailed understanding of clinician and patient expectations of the technology, further research in these domains is needed.MethodsThis prospective anonymous online survey was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (HREC 18-1408HL) and was conducted in accordance with the doctrines of the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. Electronic informed consent was obtained from each participant online prior to survey commencement.Survey designStudy data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Centre for Eye Research Australia. Survey questions were developed after a review of previous survey literature and in consultation with ophthalmologists, radiologists and dermatologists to ensure face validity. Example scenarios and related occupational fields differed between surveys designed for each specialty. Draft surveys were circulated to executives from the RANZCO, the RANZCR and the ACD for testing. The survey consisted of 18 multiple choice and open-ended questions (Supplementary Table 1). An additional question was included for radiologists and radiation oncologists to enable differentiation between these professional groups. Questions focused on frequency of AI use, knowledge, workforce impact, preparedness for future AI implementation, acceptable levels of error, individual concerns and barriers. Survey invitations were emailed by college staff to all fellows and trainees of the colleges residing in Australia and New Zealand. Dermatology respondents were from Australia alone. Participation in this anonymous survey was voluntary and no incentives were provided.Data analysisMultiple choice questions were analysed using Stata (v15.1, StataCorp, College Station, Texas). A complete-case analysis was conducted (i.e., incomplete surveys were excluded from the analyses, see Supplementary Table 3). Responses were compared according to profession, location of practice and years of experience using the Pearson’s χ2 test. Two-sided significance testing was conducted with an alpha of 5%. Thematic analysis of the response to “What do you think the college should do in preparation for the deployment of AI?” was undertaken using a ‘bottom up’ approach. Two authors (PR and XH) generated a list of initial codes after reviewing responses. Codes were built into broader categories and recurring themes were developed. Thematic discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Responses to questions regarding advantages and disadvantages of AI were analysed as follows: the first preference of each respondent received a score of 3, the second preference a score of 2 and the third preference a score of 1. Scores were tallied for each response and divided by the number of respondents to provide an overall score for each response. Higher scores indicate higher rankings. Scores were displayed as radar plots (Figs. 7, 8).

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'headline': 'A survey of clinicians on the use of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology, dermatology, radiology and radiation oncology', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. However, technology uptake will be largely driven by clinicians, and there is a paucity of data regarding the attitude that clinicians have to this new technology. In June–August 2019 we conducted an online survey of fellows and trainees of three specialty colleges (ophthalmology, radiology/radiation oncology, dermatology) in Australia and New Zealand on artificial intelligence. There were 632 complete responses (n\u2009=\u2009305, 230, and 97, respectively), equating to a response rate of 20.4%, 5.1%, and 13.2% for the above colleges, respectively. The majority (n\u2009=\u2009449, 71.0%) believed artificial intelligence would improve their field of medicine, and that medical workforce needs would be impacted by the technology within the next decade (n\u2009=\u2009542, 85.8%). Improved disease screening and streamlining of monotonous tasks were identified as key benefits of artificial intelligence. The divestment of healthcare to technology companies and medical liability implications were the greatest concerns. Education was identified as a priority to prepare clinicians for the implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This survey highlights parallels between the perceptions of different clinician groups in Australia and New Zealand about artificial intelligence in medicine. Artificial intelligence was recognized as valuable technology that will have wide-ranging impacts on healthcare.', 'datePublished': '2021-03-04T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2021-03-04T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '10', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84698-5', 'keywords': ['Health care', 'Health occupations', 'Health policy', 'Mathematics and computing', 'Medical research', 'Software', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig3_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig4_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig5_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig6_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig7_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-84698-5/MediaObjects/41598_2021_84698_Fig8_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Scientific Reports', 'issn': ['2045-2322'], 'volumeNumber': '11', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Jane Scheetz', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Philip Rothschild', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University of Melbourne', 'address': {'name': 'Ophthalmology, Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Myra McGuinness', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University of Melbourne', 'address': {'name': 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Xavier Hadoux', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital', 'address': {'name': 'Level 7, Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'H.

It was launched by Craig Raine’s poem “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” (1979). The poem systematically deploys the technique of estrangement or defamiliarization—what the Russian formalist critics called ostranenie—as our bemused Martian wrestles into his comprehension a series of puzzling human habits and gadgets: “Model T is a room with the lock inside— / a key is turned to free the world / for movement.” Or, later in the poem: “In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps, / that snores when you pick it up.” For a few years, alongside the usual helpings of Hughes, Heaney, and Larkin, British schoolchildren learned to launder these witty counterfeits: “Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings / And some are treasured for their markings— / they cause the eyes to melt / or the body to shriek without pain. / I have never seen one fly, but / Sometimes they perch on the hand.” Teachers liked Raine’s poem, and perhaps the whole Berlitz-like apparatus of Martianism, because it made estrangement as straightforward as translation. What is the haunted apparatus? A telephone, miss. Well done. What are Caxtons? Books, sir. Splendid.Estrangement is powerful when it puts the known world in doubt, when it makes the real truly strange; but most powerful when it is someone’s estrangement, bringing into focus the partiality of a human being (a child, a lunatic, an immigrant, an émigré). Raine’s poem, turning estrangement into a system, has the effect of making the Martian’s incomprehension a familiar business, once we’ve got the hang of it. And since Martians don’t actually exist, their misprision is less interesting than the human variety. The Martian’s job, after all, is to misread the human world. Human partiality is more suggestive—intermittent, irrational, anxious. One can crave a more proximate estrangement: how about, rather than an alien sending a postcard home, a resident alien, or a butler, or even a cloned human being doing so?But it’s one thing to achieve that effect in a poem, which can happily float image upon image, and another to do so in a novel that commits itself to a tethered point of view. It would be hard not to personalize estrangement when writing fiction. The eminent Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky was interested in Tolstoy’s use of the technique, noting that it consists in the novelist’s refusal to let his characters name things or events “properly,” describing them as if for the first time. In “War and Peace,” for instance, Natasha goes to the opera, which she dislikes and can’t understand. Tolstoy’s description captures Natasha’s perspective, and the opera is seen in the “wrong” way—as large people singing for no reason and spreading out their arms absurdly in front of painted boards.The twentieth century’s most ecstatic defamiliarizer was Vladimir Nabokov, who had a weakness for visual gags of the Martian sort—a half-rolled and sopping black umbrella seen as “a duck in deep mourning,” an Adam’s apple “moving like the bulging shape of an arrased eavesdropper,” and so on. But in his most affecting novel, “Pnin” (1957), estrangement is the condition and the sentence of the novel’s hapless hero, the Russian émigré professor Timofey Pnin. In Tolstoyan fashion, Pnin is seeing America as if for the first time, and often gets it wrong: “A curious basketlike net, somewhat like a glorified billiard pocket—lacking, however, a bottom—was suspended for some reason above the garage door.” Later, we learn that Pnin must have mistaken a Shriners’ hall or a veterans’ hall for the Turkish consulate, because of the crowds of fez wearers he has seen entering the building.In the English literary scene, both Craig Raine and Martin Amis have been, in their devotion to Nabokov, flamboyant Martians. Such writing is thought to prove its quality in the delighted originality of its rich figures of speech; what Amis has called “vow-of-poverty prose” has no place at the high table of estrangement. Cliché and kitsch are abhorred as deadening enemies. (Nabokov regularly dismissed writers such as Camus and Mann for failing to reach what he considered this proper mark.) Kazuo Ishiguro, a consummate vow-of-poverty writer, would seem to be far from that table. Most of his recent novels are narrated in accents of punishing blandness; all of them make plentiful use of cliché, banality, evasion, pompous circumlocution. His new novel, “Klara and the Sun” (Knopf), contains this hilarious dullness: “Josie and I had been having many friendly arguments about how one part of the house connected to another. She wouldn’t accept, for instance, that the vacuum cleaner closet was directly beneath the large bathroom.” Aha, we say to ourselves, we’re back in Ishiguro’s tragicomic and absurdist world, where the question of a schoolkid’s new pencil case (“Never Let Me Go”), or how a butler devises exactly the right “staff plan” (“The Remains of the Day”), or just waiting for a non-arriving bus (“The Unconsoled”) can stun the prose for pages.But “Klara and the Sun” confirms one’s suspicion that the contemporary novel’s truest inheritor of Nabokovian estrangement—not to mention its best and deepest Martian—is Ishiguro, hiding in plain sight all these years, lightly covered by his literary veils of torpor and subterfuge. Ishiguro, like Nabokov, enjoys using unreliable narrators to filter—which is to say, estrange—the world unreliably. (In all his work, only his previous novel, “The Buried Giant,” had recourse to the comparative stability of third-person narration, and was probably the weaker for it.) Often, these narrators function like people who have emigrated from the known world, like the clone Kathy, in “Never Let Me Go,” or like immigrants to their own world. When Stevens the butler, in “The Remains of the Day,” journeys to Cornwall to meet his former colleague Miss Kenton, it becomes apparent that he has never ventured out of his small English county near Oxford.These speakers are often concealing or repressing something unpleasant—both Stevens and Masuji Ono, the narrator of “An Artist of the Floating World,” are evading their complicity with fascist politics. They misread the world because reading it “properly” is too painful. The blandness of Ishiguro’s narrators is the very rhetoric of their estrangement; blandness is the evasive truce that repression has made with the truth. And we, in turn, are first lulled, then provoked, and then estranged by this sedated equilibrium. “Never Let Me Go” begins, “My name is Kathy H. I’m thirty-one years old, and I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years.” That ordinary voice seems at first so familiar, but quickly comes to seem significantly odd, and then wildly different from our own.You can argue that, at least since Kafka, estrangement of various kinds has been the richest literary resource in fiction—in Kafkaesque fantasy or horror, in science fiction and dystopian writing, in unreliable narration, in the literature of flâneurial travel as practiced by a writer like W. G. Sebald, and in the literature of exile and immigration. Ishiguro has mastered all these genres, sometimes combining them in a single book, always on his own singular terms. Sebald, for instance, was rightly praised for the strange things he did with his antiquarian first-person prose, as his narrators wander through an eerily defamiliarized English and European landscape. But Ishiguro got there before him, and the prose of “The Remains of the Day” (1989) may well have influenced the Anglo-German author of “The Rings of Saturn” (1995). Here, Stevens describes the experience of driving away from familiar territory, as he sets out from Darlington Hall:But then eventually the surroundings grew unrecognizable and I knew I had gone beyond all previous boundaries. I have heard people describe the moment, when setting sail in a ship, when one finally loses sight of the land. I imagine the experience of unease mixed with exhilaration often described in connection with this moment is very similar to what I felt in the Ford as the surroundings grew strange around me. . . . The feeling swept over me that I had truly left Darlington Hall behind, and I must confess I did feel a slight sense of alarm—a sense aggravated by the feeling that I was perhaps not on the correct road at all, but speeding off in totally the wrong direction into a wilderness.This might well be one of Sebald’s troubled intellectuals, his mind full of literature and death, tramping around a suddenly uncanny Europe—a “wilderness.” Stevens is, in fact, just driving to the blameless cathedral town of Salisbury.Klara, the narrator of Ishiguro’s new novel, is a kind of robot version of Stevens, and a kind of cousin of Kathy H. She’s a carer, a servant, a helpmeet, a toy. “Klara and the Sun” opens like something out of “Toy Story” or the children’s classic “Corduroy” (in which a slightly ragged Teddy bear, waiting patiently in a department store, is first turned down by Mother, and finally plucked by her delighted young daughter). Klara is an Artificial Friend, or AF, and is waiting with anticipation to be chosen from a store that seems to be in an American city, sometime in the nearish future. As far as one can tell, the AFs, which are solar-powered and A.I.-endowed, are a combination of doll and robot. They can talk, walk, see, and learn. They have hair and wear clothes. They appear to be especially prized as companions for children and teen-agers. A girl named Josie, whom Klara estimates, in her pedantic A.I. way, to be “fourteen and a half,” sees our narrator in the shopwindow, and excitedly chooses Klara as her AF.Video From The New YorkerCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial SocialismTwo kinds of estrangement operate in Ishiguro’s novel. There’s the relatively straightforward defamiliarization of science fiction. Ishiguro only lightly shades in his dystopian world, probably because he isn’t especially committed to the systematic faux realism required by full-blown science fiction. Still, we must navigate around a fictional universe that seems much like our own, yet where people endlessly stare at, or press, their handheld “oblongs,” where adults are somehow stratified by their clothes (“The mother was an office worker, and from her shoes and suit we could tell she was high-ranking”), and where roadworkers are called “overhaul men.” In this colorless, ruthless place, children are fatalistically sorted into losers and winners; the latter, who are known as “lifted,” whose parents decided to “go ahead” with them, are destined for élite colleges and bright futures. Josie’s best friend, Rick, wasn’t lifted, and it will now be a struggle for him to get a place at Atlas Brookings (“their intake of unlifteds is less than two percent”). The parents of Josie’s privileged peers wonder why Rick’s parents decided not to go ahead with him. Did they just lose their nerve? It seems significant that the lifted Josie has an AF for companionship and solace, while the poorer, unlifted Rick does not.Subtler than this teasing nomenclature are the cloudier hermeneutics that have always interested Ishiguro. Klara is a fast learner, but she’s only as competent as her algorithms permit, and the world outside the shop can overwhelm her. Her misreadings are suggestive, and since she narrates the book, the reader is supposed to snag on them, too. She seems to lack the word for drones, and calls them “machine birds.” She makes a handy phrase out of the fact that Josie’s mother always drinks coffee swiftly in the morning—“the Mother’s quick coffee.” When Klara is taken for a drive, she marvels that cars would appear on the other side of the road “in the far distance and come speeding towards us, but the drivers never made errors and managed to miss us.” She interprets a block of city houses thus: “There were six of them in a row, and the front of each had been painted a slightly different color, to prevent a resident climbing the wrong steps and entering a neighbor’s house by mistake.” When Klara hears Josie crying, the cracked lament is novel to her, and she renders it with naked precision: “Not only was her voice loud, it was as if it had been folded over onto itself, so that two versions of her voice were being sounded together, pitched fractionally apart.”The pathos and the interest of her misapprehensions are deepened by her proximity to us: she’s like a child, or perhaps an autistic adult, looking for signals, trying to copy. As in “The Remains of the Day” and “Never Let Me Go,” Ishiguro has created a kind of human simulacrum (a butler, a clone) in order to cast an estranging eye on the pain and brevity of human existence. Pain enters the world of this novel as it does ordinary life, by way of illness and death: Josie suffers from an unnamed disease. Klara had noticed, at their first meeting at the store, that Josie was pale and thin, and that “her walk wasn’t like that of other passers-by.” We learn that Josie had a sister, who died young. When Klara first hears Josie sobbing in the night (that folded-over sound), the teen-ager is calling for her mother, and crying out, “Don’t want to die, Mom. I don’t want that.” As Josie begins to decline, we realize that Klara was selected to be the special kind of AF who may be required to comfort a young, dying human, and one who may uselessly outlive her human mistress.What sense can an artificial intelligence make of death? For that matter, what sense can human intelligence make of death? Isn’t there something artificial in the way that humans conspire to suppress the certainty of their own extinction? We invest great significance in the hope for, and meaning of, longevity, but, seen from a cosmic viewpoint—by God, or by an intelligent robot—a long life is still a short life, whether one dies at nineteen or ninety. “Never Let Me Go” wrung a profound parable out of such questions: the embodied suggestion of that novel is that a free, long, human life is, in the end, just an unfree, short, cloned life.“Klara and the Sun” continues this meditation, powerfully and affectingly. Ishiguro uses his inhuman, all too human narrators to gaze upon the theological heft of our lives, and to call its bluff. When Pascal wrote that “an image of men’s condition” was “a number of men in chains, all condemned to death, some of whom are slaughtered daily within view of the others, so that those who are left see their own condition in that of their fellows, and, regarding one another with sorrow and without hope, wait their turn,” the vision was saved from darkest tragedy by God’s certain presence and salvation. Ishiguro offers no such promise. We learn, late in the book, that Artificial Friends are all subject to what is called a “slow fade,” as their batteries expire. Of course, we, too, are subject to a slow fade; it might be the definition of a life.Klara wants to save Josie from early death, but she can do this only within her understanding and her means, which is where the novel’s title becomes movingly significant. Because the AFs are solar-powered, they lose energy and vitality without the sun’s rays; so, quite logically, the sun is a life-giving pagan god to them. Klara capitalizes the Sun, and speaks often of “a special kind of nourishment from the Sun,” “the Sun and his kindness to us,” and so on. When Klara joins Josie’s household, she assesses the kitchen as “an excellent room for the Sun to look into.” Before she left the store, a troubling incident had occurred. Roadwork had started outside the shop, and the workers had parked a smoke-belching machine on the street. Klara knows only that the machine’s three short funnels create enough smoke to blot out sunlight. It has a name, Cootings, on its side, so Klara takes to calling it the Cootings Machine. There are several days of smoke and fumes. When a customer mentions “pollution” (which Klara capitalizes), and points through the shopwindow at the machine, adding “how dangerous Pollution was for everyone,” Klara gets the idea that the Cootings Machine “might be a machine to fight Pollution.” But another AF tells her that “it was something specially designed to make more of it.” Klara begins to see the battle between the sinister Cootings Machine and the Sun as one between rival forces of darkness and light: “The Sun, I knew, was trying his utmost, and towards the end of the second bad afternoon, even though the smoke was worse than ever, his patterns appeared again, though only faintly. I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”So Klara begins to construct a world view—a cosmogony, really—around her life-giving god. If the Sun nourishes AFs, it must nourish humans, too. If the Sun is a god, then perhaps one might pray to this god; one might, eventually, bargain and cajole, as Abraham did with the Lord. So Klara prays to the Sun: “Please make Josie better. . . . Josie’s still a child and she’s done nothing unkind.” And she has a specific bargain in mind. She tells the Sun that she knows how much he dislikes Pollution. “Supposing I were able somehow to find this machine and destroy it,” she says. “To put an end to its Pollution. Would you then consider, in return, giving your special help to Josie?” Klara sets about vandalizing the first Cootings Machine she comes across, apparently unaware that it’s not the only one in the world.Other writers might labor to make their science fiction more coherent. Ishiguro seems unconcerned that our AF somehow understands godly mercy and “sin” (“she’s done nothing unkind”) but can’t work out why houses are painted different colors. Another novelist might play up the dystopian ecological implications of a world in which the sun is beset by forces of life-quenching darkness. These implications are certainly present here. But Ishiguro keeps his eye on the human connection. Only Ishiguro, I think, would insist on grounding this speculative narrative so deeply in the ordinary; only he would add, to a description of a battle between sunlight and darkness, Klara’s prosaic and plaintive coda: “I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”Ishiguro invites us to share the logic and the partiality of Klara’s world view by making plain that its logic flows from its partiality—sun equals life equals God—and by making plain how closely her world resembles ours. Her estrangement is ours, a reminder of the provisional nature of our own grasp on reality. No more than Klara can we understand—theologically speaking—why children die, which is why we, from the merely superstitious to the orthodoxly religious, construct our own systems of petition and bargain. If it is time for a child’s slow fade to become an unbearably faster fade, there is nothing, theologically speaking, we can do about it: the sun will continue to shine down—“having no alternative, on the nothing new,” as Beckett had it—on the just and unjust alike. Our prayers evaporate into the solar heat.At one moment in her pleading on behalf of Josie, Klara wheedlingly says to the Sun, “I know favoritism isn’t desirable.” The word has resonance, but weak leverage, in a world premised on systematic favoritism, in which whole classes of society are “lifted” and others are not. In Klara’s world, favoritism is considered not just desirable but apparently essential; she is a product of it. The relation between society’s increasingly invidious, focussed, and sinister patterns of selection (fascism, genetic engineering, “lifting”) and the cosmic arbitrariness of our ultimate destinies has been Ishiguro’s great theme: our nasty efforts at “favoritism” versus God’s or the universe’s inscrutable lack of it. For we die unequally but finally equally, in ways whose randomness seems to challenge all notions of pattern, design, selection. Theology is, in some guises, just the metaphysics of favoritism: a prayer is a postcard asking for a favor, sent upward. Whether our postcards are read by anyone has become the searching doubt of Ishiguro’s recent novels, in which this master, so utterly unlike his peers, goes about creating his ordinary, strange, godless allegories. ♦",,Kazuo Ishiguro Uses Artificial Intelligence to Reveal the Limits of Our Own,,,,,True,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'The New Yorker'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/60370803116ee49573d21356/1:1/w_1839,h_1839,c_limit/210308_r37993_rd.jpg",,"Estrangement is powerful when it puts the known world in doubt, when it makes the real truly strange; but most powerful when it is someone’s estrangement, bringing into focus the partiality of a human being (a child, a lunatic, an immigrant, an émigré).

Two kinds of estrangement operate in Ishiguro’s novel. There’s the relatively straightforward defamiliarization of science fiction. Ishiguro only lightly shades in his dystopian world, probably because he isn’t especially committed to the systematic faux realism required by full-blown science fiction. Still, we must navigate around a fictional universe that seems much like our own, yet where people endlessly stare at, or press, their handheld “oblongs,” where adults are somehow stratified by their clothes (“The mother was an office worker, and from her shoes and suit we could tell she was high-ranking”), and where roadworkers are called “overhaul men.” In this colorless, ruthless place, children are fatalistically sorted into losers and winners; the latter, who are known as “lifted,” whose parents decided to “go ahead” with them, are destined for élite colleges and bright futures. Josie’s best friend, Rick, wasn’t lifted, and it will now be a struggle for him to get a place at Atlas Brookings (“their intake of unlifteds is less than two percent”). The parents of Josie’s privileged peers wonder why Rick’s parents decided not to go ahead with him. Did they just lose their nerve? It seems significant that the lifted Josie has an AF for companionship and solace, while the poorer, unlifted Rick does not.
Subtler than this teasing nomenclature are the cloudier hermeneutics that have always interested Ishiguro. Klara is a fast learner, but she’s only as competent as her algorithms permit, and the world outside the shop can overwhelm her. Her misreadings are suggestive, and since she narrates the book, the reader is supposed to snag on them, too. She seems to lack the word for drones, and calls them “machine birds.” She makes a handy phrase out of the fact that Josie’s mother always drinks coffee swiftly in the morning—“the Mother’s quick coffee.” When Klara is taken for a drive, she marvels that cars would appear on the other side of the road “in the far distance and come speeding towards us, but the drivers never made errors and managed to miss us.” She interprets a block of city houses thus: “There were six of them in a row, and the front of each had been painted a slightly different color, to prevent a resident climbing the wrong steps and entering a neighbor’s house by mistake.” When Klara hears Josie crying, the cracked lament is novel to her, and she renders it with naked precision: “Not only was her voice loud, it was as if it had been folded over onto itself, so that two versions of her voice were being sounded together, pitched fractionally apart.”
The pathos and the interest of her misapprehensions are deepened by her proximity to us: she’s like a child, or perhaps an autistic adult, looking for signals, trying to copy. As in “The Remains of the Day” and “Never Let Me Go,” Ishiguro has created a kind of human simulacrum (a butler, a clone) in order to cast an estranging eye on the pain and brevity of human existence. Pain enters the world of this novel as it does ordinary life, by way of illness and death: Josie suffers from an unnamed disease. Klara had noticed, at their first meeting at the store, that Josie was pale and thin, and that “her walk wasn’t like that of other passers-by.” We learn that Josie had a sister, who died young. When Klara first hears Josie sobbing in the night (that folded-over sound), the teen-ager is calling for her mother, and crying out, “Don’t want to die, Mom. I don’t want that.” As Josie begins to decline, we realize that Klara was selected to be the special kind of AF who may be required to comfort a young, dying human, and one who may uselessly outlive her human mistress.
What sense can an artificial intelligence make of death? For that matter, what sense can human intelligence make of death? Isn’t there something artificial in the way that humans conspire to suppress the certainty of their own extinction? We invest great significance in the hope for, and meaning of, longevity, but, seen from a cosmic viewpoint—by God, or by an intelligent robot—a long life is still a short life, whether one dies at nineteen or ninety. “Never Let Me Go” wrung a profound parable out of such questions: the embodied suggestion of that novel is that a free, long, human life is, in the end, just an unfree, short, cloned life.
Klara wants to save Josie from early death, but she can do this only within her understanding and her means, which is where the novel’s title becomes movingly significant. Because the AFs are solar-powered, they lose energy and vitality without the sun’s rays; so, quite logically, the sun is a life-giving pagan god to them. Klara capitalizes the Sun, and speaks often of “a special kind of nourishment from the Sun,” “the Sun and his kindness to us,” and so on. When Klara joins Josie’s household, she assesses the kitchen as “an excellent room for the Sun to look into.” Before she left the store, a troubling incident had occurred. Roadwork had started outside the shop, and the workers had parked a smoke-belching machine on the street. Klara knows only that the machine’s three short funnels create enough smoke to blot out sunlight. It has a name, Cootings, on its side, so Klara takes to calling it the Cootings Machine. There are several days of smoke and fumes. When a customer mentions “pollution” (which Klara capitalizes), and points through the shopwindow at the machine, adding “how dangerous Pollution was for everyone,” Klara gets the idea that the Cootings Machine “might be a machine to fight Pollution.” But another AF tells her that “it was something specially designed to make more of it.” Klara begins to see the battle between the sinister Cootings Machine and the Sun as one between rival forces of darkness and light: “The Sun, I knew, was trying his utmost, and towards the end of the second bad afternoon, even though the smoke was worse than ever, his patterns appeared again, though only faintly. I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”
So Klara begins to construct a world view—a cosmogony, really—around her life-giving god. If the Sun nourishes AFs, it must nourish humans, too. If the Sun is a god, then perhaps one might pray to this god; one might, eventually, bargain and cajole, as Abraham did with the Lord. So Klara prays to the Sun: “Please make Josie better. . . . Josie’s still a child and she’s done nothing unkind.” And she has a specific bargain in mind. She tells the Sun that she knows how much he dislikes Pollution. “Supposing I were able somehow to find this machine and destroy it,” she says. “To put an end to its Pollution. Would you then consider, in return, giving your special help to Josie?” Klara sets about vandalizing the first Cootings Machine she comes across, apparently unaware that it’s not the only one in the world.
Other writers might labor to make their science fiction more coherent. Ishiguro seems unconcerned that our AF somehow understands godly mercy and “sin” (“she’s done nothing unkind”) but can’t work out why houses are painted different colors. Another novelist might play up the dystopian ecological implications of a world in which the sun is beset by forces of life-quenching darkness. These implications are certainly present here. But Ishiguro keeps his eye on the human connection. Only Ishiguro, I think, would insist on grounding this speculative narrative so deeply in the ordinary; only he would add, to a description of a battle between sunlight and darkness, Klara’s prosaic and plaintive coda: “I became worried and asked Manager if we’d still get all our nourishment.”
Ishiguro invites us to share the logic and the partiality of Klara’s world view by making plain that its logic flows from its partiality—sun equals life equals God—and by making plain how closely her world resembles ours. Her estrangement is ours, a reminder of the provisional nature of our own grasp on reality. No more than Klara can we understand—theologically speaking—why children die, which is why we, from the merely superstitious to the orthodoxly religious, construct our own systems of petition and bargain. If it is time for a child’s slow fade to become an unbearably faster fade, there is nothing, theologically speaking, we can do about it: the sun will continue to shine down—“having no alternative, on the nothing new,” as Beckett had it—on the just and unjust alike. Our prayers evaporate into the solar heat.
At one moment in her pleading on behalf of Josie, Klara wheedlingly says to the Sun, “I know favoritism isn’t desirable.” The word has resonance, but weak leverage, in a world premised on systematic favoritism, in which whole classes of society are “lifted” and others are not. In Klara’s world, favoritism is considered not just desirable but apparently essential; she is a product of it. The relation between society’s increasingly invidious, focussed, and sinister patterns of selection (fascism, genetic engineering, “lifting”) and the cosmic arbitrariness of our ultimate destinies has been Ishiguro’s great theme: our nasty efforts at “favoritism” versus God’s or the universe’s inscrutable lack of it. For we die unequally but finally equally, in ways whose randomness seems to challenge all notions of pattern, design, selection. Theology is, in some guises, just the metaphysics of favoritism: a prayer is a postcard asking for a favor, sent upward. Whether our postcards are read by anyone has become the searching doubt of Ishiguro’s recent novels, in which this master, so utterly unlike his peers, goes about creating his ordinary, strange, godless allegories. ♦",books,,,,,,,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/08/kazuo-ishiguro-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-reveal-the-limits-of-our-own,"In his latest novel, “Klara and the Sun,” the gaze of an inhuman narrator gives us a new perspective on human life, a vision that is at once deeply ordinary and profoundly strange, James Wood writes.","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Magazine', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Literature', 'item': 'https://www.newyorker.com/tag/literature'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Kazuo Ishiguro Uses Artificial Intelligence to Reveal the Limits of Our Own'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The janus face of Artificial Intelligence creating fairness or accelerating bias?

Automation and AI are both supporting businesses to make better decisions but at the same time are embedding age-old biases. As online and HR platforms increasingly turn to AI (artificial intelligence) and data-driven decisions to attract and retain talent we must include the wider society in doing more to achieve fairness. At Gapsquare, we work to ensure that equality takes centre-stage in such developments.
A few decades ago, as I was deciding which university degree to go for and what skills and qualifications I needed for my future career, tech, engineering and maths were not among my options. In fact, if anyone had told me that I would be using statistical regression models and leading a company that builds software to help create more fairness in employment in 2019 I would have seriously questioned them. But I have had to turn to technology, maths, and  artificial intelligence because they enabled by far the best opportunity to solve a global problem: that of unequal and unfair pay in many companies around the world.
What I have learned during years of working in equalities and technology is that software can help companies create fair pay on a scale and magnitude that no other solution can. What I did not expect is that I would find myself in a world where, while tech and artificial intelligence could offer a solution to equality and fairness at work, it also brings one of the biggest roadblocks to equality.
Tech offers up both the issues of ongoing bias, and the opportunity to resolve inequality for good.
As I pondered my options and weighed up my future at the beginning of my educational journey, the conceptualisation and design of AI that engendered biases was already on its way too. The biases in how humans were moved through the workforce and beyond were being engendered, steadily and often unknowingly, into the technologies defining our future. Nowadays, there are a range of examples of tech and AI demonstrating such bias. It is often easy to see that the data we feed our technology – and the teams that work to develop software – are mostly masculine, mostly white and often middle class.
To give an example, you might remember that last year Amazon hit the headlines because of its AI based hiring tool. The platform was developed by a team of data scientists in Edinburgh, Scotland, using CVs from a ten-year period to train models to identify top engineering talent. The models were programmed to recognise some 50,000 terms showing up in past CVs and select candidates based on the use of terms previously associated with ‘successful’ individuals. Perhaps inevitably, the algorithms began to prioritise applications that included more male-dominated language; words associated with success such as: ‘captured’, ‘created’, and ‘lead’. Candidates who used, for example, the word ‘woman’ in their CVs (i.e. women’s soccer club)  were automatically downgraded.
It wasn’t long before this intrinsic bias became apparent. The candidates being selected were unanimously representative of a group already dominant within the workforce. The technology had ruled out gender diversity in particular. When the company realised what was happening it worked on making the terms more gender neutral, taking backward steps to undo historical bias. The program has since been scrapped, there was just no guarantee that it would not continue to discriminate in other ways.
It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up.
Though this may not exactly give you hope about the potential of AI and automation, I believe stories like this should help us to see the potential of technology to do more. Technology that embeds bias reveals itself quickly and signals a need for change. It is inevitable that organisations offering ERP (enterprise resource planning) solutions are going to use more artificial intelligence and data-driven decision making to optimise processes, including HR. But there are a few things that can ensure that biases are accounted for. 
It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up.
At Gapsquare we want to see technology developed to demonstrate a higher level of objectivity and fairness than occurs naturally in human societies (at the moment). But we must all work to make sure that these technologies create fair systems and processes for all. It is time, we think, to question the data going into a system, question the algorithms developed and observe their resultant conclusions. It’s time to take a magnifying glass to the assumptions our technologies are making and build fairer systems from the ground up. In doing so, we ensure that we are embracing the potential and the pay off of building inclusive workplaces and inclusive companies. In doing so we guarantee that the world of tomorrow will look substantially better than the world as we know it today.

Spatial Computing is a blanket term that covers the combined capabilities of some incredibly disruptive innovations in tech that are making their way in the world. These include:Positioning (GPS)Artificial intelligence (AI)The internet of things (IoT)5GMachine learningMixed realityBlockchainRemote sensingGeographic Information Systems (GIS)Spatial Database and Management Systems (SDBMS)Spatial data scienceThe word ‘spatial’ is used, rather than location or geography, because it refers to time as well as physical space. And it is the convergence of our physical and digital worlds. For instance, wearable tech helps monitor our body health as well as tracking our surroundings.

These can then link into Strava or Runtastic to map a ride or run.Meanwhile, professional sports teams are using Catapult (ASX:CAT) wearable tech to monitor players speed, direction, temperature, general wellbeing etc. These measurements are gathered using a mixture of magnetometer, GPS, gyroscopes and accelerometers.An array of possibilitiesThere are now countless navigation apps, ride sharing apps for smart phones and precision agriculture, which each use spatial computing technologies. And these technologies are seeing their use and influence on our lives grow at a rapid pace.Many of these technologies will not be new to you and they’re ingrained within the depths of Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest ETFs, thereby generating further buzz and investment.The reason spatial computing is such a ground-breaking phenomenon is because it offers the potential to revolutionise our world. And in the process, it could very well displace many of the astoundingly successful businesses of today.Here are a few notable businesses currently operating in this space.Augmented Reality: Spatial computing is readily enhancing gaming capabilitiesAugmented reality is rapidly enhancing gaming and entertainment in the consumer space. It also has massive potential for business applications throughout the military, healthcare and manufacturing.Spatial computing is dependent on 3D imaging techniques, such as those experienced through AR/VR headsets, or glasses-free holographic displays. There are many branded products now in this space such as Oculus, Varjo, Pimax, HTC Vive, PSVR, GearVR, Magic Leap, and many more.

This is great fun for immersing children in a physical and virtual learning activity.This week German company TeamViewer (FFT:TMV) acquired US augmented reality software firm Upskill. TeamViewer is a secure remote connectivity solution provider, while Upskill is a pioneer in augmented reality (AR) software for frontline workers. This acquisition greatly enhances TeamViewers global position in providing industry-specific augmented reality solutions. And it follows on from its 2020 acquisition of European wearable software leader Ubimax.China’s ahead of the gameIn China, many companies are coming on leaps and bounds in this arena. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA, HKG: 9988), Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY, HKG:0700), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and JD (NASDAQ:JD) have trained, deployed, and monetized deep learning products at scale.Hong Kong based Artificial intelligence company SenseTime, is leading the way in virtual reality.

Tesla 3D – Photographer: Alexander Shatov | Source: UnsplashThe self-driving car business requires huge sums of money in research and development and is not an easy business to make progress in. Therefore, the big players such as Tesla and Apple are most likely to be the eventual winners.ARK holds Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) in both its ARKF and ARKQ ETFs. Apple has some involvement in spatial computing through its various product development processes. For instance, its new iPads are equipped with LiDAR sensors, which combine lasers and radar to provide spatial depths in the external world. LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It’s widely used in autonomous vehicle technology.Apple’s AirPods Pro feature spatial audio which may be crucial in making advanced AR glasses work.Tesla is a possibly the world’s biggest player in the ‘spatial computing’ space according to Robert Scoble, self-proclaimed ‘Spatial Computing evangelist’ and possible ‘Tesla evangelist’ too.As amazing as the battery was, it really just sets up what is next: data and mapping, which sets up killing Apple and Google maps, which sets up Robotaxis and freaking next level driver assistance capabilities, which sets up killing Uber and Lyft (none of these can react).— Scoble (@Scobleizer) September 24, 2020Data and mapping is the futureElon Musk is dropping hints on Tesla’s AI potential on Twitter:“Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI.

It’s now looking at a market value of around $1 billion.In 2019 AiRXOS, a unit of GE Aviation (LON: GEC, NYSE:GE), successfully delivered a human kidney via drone. It travelled from Baltimore’s St. Agnes Hospital to the university’s medical center 2.7 miles away. Drone delivery is an area of spatial computing getting set to transform how interconnected our world is. AiRXOS is working on shaping a new era of autonomous air transportation.Agricultural TechWhile autonomous vehicles seem new, autonomous tractors have been around for a while. And precision agriculture is another area that’s transforming the way food is produced.John Deere (NYSE: DE) recently entered into an allied distribution agreement with Smart Guided Systems to sell its Smart-Apply Intelligent Spray Control System for use with John Deere tractors in high value crop applications. This system uses LiDAR to help farmers reduce the amount of chemicals they use on their crops.Artificial IntelligenceAI covers computing that develops machines that think and work like humans. This can be in the form of speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.DocuSignARK invest has a 0.21% ownership of DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) and it’s currently in ARKK, ARKW and ARKF ETFs. Contract law improvements and online notarization is growing, and DocuSign is immersing itself in the AI space. DocuSign Insight uses a proven combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies—including natural language processing, machine learning and rules-based logic to help enterprises manage their contracts. This can help reduce the time and cost of reviewing legal documents.MercadoLibreEcommerce company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is found in ARKW and ARKF ETFs. ARK has 0.16% ownership in the Argentinian company. Back in 2018, MercadoLibre acquired Córdoba-based start-up Machinalis, which specializes in the development of machine learning algorithms.MoneyLionFintech company MoneyLion is coming public via a SPAC in a $2.9 billion deal. It’s a modern finance application for individual use. The company uses a combination of artificial intelligence, superior analytics, and machine learning, to analyse customers’ personal finances and deliver uniquely personalized products and services including banking, lending and investing.

H2GO Power, in collaboration with the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) and Imperial College London, are trialling the use of artificial intelligence (AI) software coupled with hydrogen technology. H2GO is looking to launch a crowdfunding campaign in the future.SnowflakeSnowflake is a cloud-based data-warehousing company that went public last year. Harnessing data it powers many vital businesses. Strava, the GPS tracking app and social network for athletes, uses Snowflake to power its business. Snowflake’s Geospatial data support in its Cloud Data Platform is introducing intelligent security solutions helping its customers increase profits while reducing fraud and risks.PalantirPalantir Technologies also publicly listed last year. It’s a US software company serving government agencies and private companies. Founded by Billionaire Peter Thiel, it specializes in big data analytics. In Palantir’s IPO S1 SEC registration it states Spatial Information Management as a software category its platform addresses. It also enhances raw video footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources in its Palantir Gotham video application.ModernaModerna is a US pharmaceutical and biotech company. Moderna’s technology platform inserts synthetic nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) into human cells. AI is a big deal in modern medicine and particularly in R&D. It has the ability to lift success rates to up to 50%, while reducing time-to-market, thereby cost saving and profit enhancing. This has been core at the company’s ability to bring its leading COVID-19 vaccine to achieve efficacy levels of 94.5% in a rapid time frame.Should we be worried about China?Again, China appears to be making strides in AI that are giving cause for concern to the US. According to a new report released by The US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence:“China possesses the might, talent, and ambition to surpass the United States as the world’s leader in AI in the next decade if current trends do not change,”And it’s not just AI technology that China is making strides in, the report also mentions quantum computing, robotics, 3D printing and 5G.A spectrum of possibilitiesSpatial Computing covers an enormous array of possible investments in a multitude of exciting technologies and industries. It offers huge scope for innovative improvements in our lives, but it also comes with ethical concerns around privacy and security.Many big names are already extensively deploying investment in R&D in many of these spatial computing areas. Along with those listed above, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAW:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are all involved in one way or another and public government agencies are getting in on the action too.Weather forecasting, anticipating outbreaks of infectious diseases, making homes safe for the elderly and disabled, reducing road-traffic accidents and friendly fire incidents in combat are all potential benefits to ongoing investment in spatial computing.

Not to kill you with lasers, or beat you in chess, or even to ferry you around town in a driverless Uber.These robots are here to merge purchase orders into columns J and K of next quarter’s revenue forecast, and transfer customer data from the invoicing software to the Oracle database. They are unassuming software programs with names like “Auxiliobits — DataTable To Json String,” and they are becoming the star employees at many American companies.Some of these tools are simple apps, downloaded from online stores and installed by corporate I.T. departments, that do the dull-but-critical tasks that someone named Phil in Accounting used to do: reconciling bank statements, approving expense reports, reviewing tax forms. Others are expensive, custom-built software packages, armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence, that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans.White-collar workers, armed with college degrees and specialized training, once felt relatively safe from automation. But recent advances in A.I. and machine learning have created algorithms capable of outperforming doctors, lawyers and bankers at certain parts of their jobs. And as bots learn to do higher-value tasks, they are climbing the corporate ladder.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe trend — quietly building for years, but accelerating to warp speed since the pandemic — goes by the sleepy moniker “robotic process automation.” And it is transforming workplaces at a pace that few outsiders appreciate. Nearly 8 in 10 corporate executives surveyed by Deloitte last year said they had implemented some form of R.P.A. Another 16 percent said they planned to do so within three years.Most of this automation is being done by companies you’ve probably never heard of. UiPath, the largest stand-alone automation firm, is valued at $35 billion — roughly the size of eBay — and is slated to go public later this year. Other companies like Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism, which have Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola and Walgreens Boots Alliance as clients, are also enjoying breakneck growth, and tech giants like Microsoft have recently introduced their own automation products to get in on the action.Executives generally spin these bots as being good for everyone, “streamlining operations” while “liberating workers” from mundane and repetitive tasks. But they are also liberating plenty of people from their jobs. Independent experts say that major corporate R.P.A. initiatives have been followed by rounds of layoffs, and that cutting costs, not improving workplace conditions, is usually the driving factor behind the decision to automate. Craig Le Clair, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies the corporate automation market, said that for executives, much of the appeal of R.P.A. bots is that they are cheap, easy to use and compatible with their existing back-end systems. He said that companies often rely on them to juice short-term profits, rather than embarking on more expensive tech upgrades that might take years to pay for themselves.“It’s not a moonshot project like a lot of A.I., so companies are doing it like crazy,” Mr. Le Clair said. “With R.P.A., you can build a bot that costs $10,000 a year and take out two to four humans.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCovid-19 has led some companies to turn to automation to deal with growing demand, closed offices, or budget constraints. But for other companies, the pandemic has provided cover for executives to implement ambitious automation plans they dreamed up long ago.“Automation is more politically acceptable now,” said Raul Vega, the chief executive of Auxis, a firm that helps companies automate their operations.Before the pandemic, Mr. Vega said, some executives turned down offers to automate their call centers, or shrink their finance departments, because they worried about scaring their remaining workers or provoking a backlash like the one that followed the outsourcing boom of the 1990s, when C.E.O.s became villains for sending jobs to Bangalore and Shenzhen.But those concerns matter less now, with millions of people already out of work and many businesses struggling to stay afloat.Now, Mr. Vega said, “they don’t really care, they’re just going to do what’s right for their business.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSales of automation software are expected to rise by 20 percent this year, after increasing by 12 percent last year, according to the research firm Gartner. And the consulting firm McKinsey, which predicted before the pandemic that 37 million U.S. workers would be displaced by automation by 2030, recently increased its projection to 45 million.A white-collar wake-up callImageHolly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto, oversees an automation project named “robotic process automation.”Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesNot all bots are the job-destroying kind. Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto Insurance Companies, said that her firm has used automation to do 173,000 hours’ worth of work in areas like underwriting and human resources without laying anyone off.“People are concerned that there’s a possibility of losing their jobs, or not having anything to do,” she said. “But once we have a bot in the area, and people see how automation is applied, they’re truly thrilled that they don’t have to do that work anymore.”As bots become capable of complex decision-making, rather than doing single repetitive tasks, their disruptive potential is growing.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRecent studies by researchers at Stanford University and the Brookings Institution compared the text of job listings with the wording of A.I.-related patents, looking for phrases like “make prediction” and “generate recommendation” that appeared in both. They found that the groups with the highest exposure to A.I. were better-paid, better-educated workers in technical and supervisory roles, with men, white and Asian-American workers, and midcareer professionals being some of the most endangered. Workers with bachelor’s or graduate degrees were nearly four times as exposed to A.I. risk as those with just a high school degree, the researchers found, and residents of high-tech cities like Seattle and Salt Lake City were more vulnerable than workers in smaller, more rural communities.“A lot of professional work combines some element of routine information processing with an element of judgment and discretion,” said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies the labor effects of automation. “That’s where software has always fallen short. But with A.I., that type of work is much more in the kill path.”

Subscribe and listen.Many of those vulnerable workers don’t see this coming, in part because the effects of white-collar automation are often couched in jargon and euphemism. On their websites, R.P.A. firms promote glowing testimonials from their customers, often glossing over the parts that involve actual humans.“Sprint Automates 50 Business Processes In Just Six Months.” (Possible translation: Sprint replaced 300 people in the billing department.)“Dai-ichi Life Insurance Saves 132,000 Hours Annually” (Bye-bye, claims adjusters.)“600% Productivity Gain for Credit Reporting Giant with R.P.A.” (Don’t let the door hit you, data analysts.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTJason Kingdon, the chief executive of the R.P.A. firm Blue Prism, speaks in the softened vernacular of displacement too. He refers to his company’s bots as “digital workers,” and he explained that the economic shock of the pandemic had “massively raised awareness” among executives about the variety of work that no longer requires human involvement.“We think any business process can be automated,” he said.Mr. Kingdon tells business leaders that between half and two-thirds of all the tasks currently being done at their companies can be done by machines. Ultimately, he sees a future in which humans will collaborate side-by-side with teams of digital employees, with plenty of work for everyone, although he conceded that the robots have certain natural advantages.“A digital worker,” he said, “can be scaled in a vastly more flexible way.”The danger of so-so automationImageSelf-checkout machines don’t help customers, they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift.Credit...Andrew Spear for The New York TimesHumans have feared losing our jobs to machines for millennia. (In 350 BCE, Aristotle worried that self-playing harps would make musicians obsolete.) And yet, automation has never created mass unemployment, in part because technology has always generated new jobs to replace the ones it destroyed.During the 19th and 20th centuries, some lamplighters and blacksmiths became obsolete, but more people were able to make a living as electricians and car dealers. And today’s A.I. optimists argue that while new technology may displace some workers, it will spur economic growth and create better, more fulfilling jobs, just as it has in the past.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut that is no guarantee, and there is growing evidence that this time may be different.In a series of recent studies, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, two well-respected economists who have researched the history of automation, found that for most of the 20th century, the optimistic take on automation prevailed — on average, in industries that implemented automation, new tasks were created faster than old ones were destroyed.Since the late 1980s, they found, the equation had flipped — tasks have been disappearing to automation faster than new ones are appearing.This shift may be related to the popularity of what they call “so-so automation” — technology that is just barely good enough to replace human workers, but not good enough to create new jobs or make companies significantly more productive.A common example of so-so automation is the grocery store self-checkout machine. These machines don’t cause customers to buy more groceries, or help them shop significantly faster — they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift. This simple, substitutive kind of automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo wrote, threatens not just individual workers, but the economy as a whole.“The real danger for labor,” they wrote, “may come not from highly productive but from ‘so-so’ automation technologies that are just productive enough to be adopted and cause displacement.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOnly the most devoted Luddites would argue against automating any job, no matter how menial or dangerous. But not all automation is created equal, and much of the automation being done in white-collar workplaces today is the kind that may not help workers over the long run.During past eras of technological change, governments and labor unions have stepped in to fight for automation-prone workers, or support them while they trained for new jobs. But this time, there is less in the way of help. Congress has rejected calls to fund federal worker retraining programs for years, and while some of the money in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Democrats hope to pass this week will go to laid-off and furloughed workers, none of it is specifically earmarked for job training programs that could help displaced workers get back on their feet.Another key difference is that in the past, automation arrived gradually, factory machine by factory machine. But today’s white-collar automation is so sudden — and often, so deliberately obscured by management — that few workers have time to prepare.“The rate of progression of this technology is faster than any previous automation,” said Mr. Le Clair, the Forrester analyst, who thinks we are closer to the beginning than the end of the corporate A.I. boom.“We haven’t hit the exponential point of this stuff yet,” he added. “And when we do, it’s going to be dramatic.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFinding a robot-proof futureThe corporate world’s automation fever isn’t purely about getting rid of workers. Executives have shareholders and boards to satisfy, and competitors to keep up with. And some automation does, in fact, lift all boats, making workers’ jobs better and more interesting while allowing companies to do more with less.But as A.I. enters the corporate world, it is forcing workers at all levels to adapt, and focus on developing the kinds of distinctly human skills that machines can’t easily replicate.Ellen Wengert, a former data processor at an Australian insurance firm, learned this lesson four years ago, when she arrived at work one day to find a bot-builder sitting in her seat.The man, coincidentally an old classmate of hers, worked for a consulting firm that specialized in R.P.A. He explained that he’d been hired to automate her job, which mostly involved moving customer data from one database to another. He then asked her to, essentially, train her own replacement — teaching him how to do the steps involved in her job so that he, in turn, could program a bot to do the same thing.Ms. Wengert wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d known that her job was straightforward and repetitive, making it low-hanging fruit for automation. But she was annoyed that her managers seemed so eager to hand it over to a machine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“They were desperate to create this sense of excitement around automation,” she said. “Most of my colleagues got on board with that pretty readily, but I found it really jarring, to be feigning excitement about us all potentially losing our jobs.”For Ms. Wengert, 27, the experience was a wake-up call. She had a college degree and was early in her career. But some of her colleagues had been happily doing the same job for years, and she worried that they would fall through the cracks.“Even though these aren’t glamorous jobs, there are a lot of people doing them,” she said.She left the insurance company after her contract ended.

Released by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a federal body created to review and recommend ways to use artificial intelligence for national security purposes, the report recommends the use of AI to update America’s defense plans, predict future threats, deter adversaries and win wars.Because AI will be “incorporated into virtually all future technology,” it is easy to recognize that national security threats and opportunities posed by AI should be a catalyst for necessary changes to defense requirements and resourcing processes. In an AI-enabled world, the Defense Department will be unable to modernize the way it recruits talent, trains the force, develops and integrates technology, and funds all of these elements without internal culture shifts and help from Congress.“Unless the requirements, budgeting and acquisition processes are aligned to permit faster and more targeted execution, the U.S. will fail to stay ahead of potential adversaries.” This blunt recommendation to the Defense Department under the heading “Accelerate Adoption of Existing Digital Technologies” makes clear the urgency for cultural and structural updates to the way the department currently does business.RELATED‘Wakeup call’: Report calls for massive AI investments to counter ChinaThe findings, ordered by Congress, include hundreds of recommendations from experts to get the DoD “AI-ready” by 2025.By Andrew EversdenCommission members, who came principally from the academic and business communities, further noted in the report that:“The sources of battlefield advantage will shift from traditional factors like force size and levels of armaments, to factors like superior data collection and assimilation, connectivity, computing power, algorithms, and system security.”“Perhaps the most urgent and compelling reason to accelerate the use of AI for national security is the possibility that more advanced machine analysis could find and connect the dots before the next attack, when human analysis alone may not see the full picture as clearly.” Simply put, AI will revolutionize the practice of intelligence.The life cycle project management phases used in appropriations categories that govern the defense budget run counter to the trial and error process of AI and other software-based technologies. Thus commissioners recommended that the Defense Department should “Modernize the Budget and Oversight Process for Digital Technologies.”The Defense Department should commit to building budgets that invest at least 3.4 percent of the annual defense budget in science and technology and allocate at least $8 billion for research and development of “core AI.”To be able to afford the implementation of this last recommendation, the department would have to change its acquisition and resourcing approaches to get more and faster bang for its buck. The commission recognized this by proposing a pilot program to “test mission-focused budgeting and appropriations.” Ideally this would lead to the establishment of “a single appropriation and budget structure for software and digital technologies by FY 2023.”In comparison to China’s ability to move quickly with resourcing decisions, another new report released last week about competing in time notes that the inflexibility of the Defense Department budget process, which dates back to 1961, makes it more difficult to rapidly move money to innovations that appear promising. In a good, small step in the right direction, Congress supported the software pilot requested by Defense in its 2021 budget to begin addressing this problem.Now is the time to harness federal buying power and leverage the potential momentum of this wide-ranging report to break the mold, and (as described in the report) come to the aid of “visionary technologists and warfighters [who] largely remain stymied by antiquated technology, cumbersome processes, and incentive structures that are designed for outdated or competing aims.”The Defense Department can do many things for itself through the use of existing laws and rules governing how it buys things. It can also encourage and train its workforce to take risks, try new things and abandon them if they don’t work rather than wasting money to follow through on programs that will be out of date before being deployed. The department should foster a culture of a creative “what if we…” approach to problem-solving and iteratively identify how things connect and can be used differently. Integration and sustainment should not be acquisition afterthoughts.Congress can help by alleviating some of the risks with recommended pilot programs to signal support for a more agile approach to both acquisition and oversight. Policymakers and the defense workforce should be able to balance creativity, speed, transparency and stewardship.As the commissioners concluded, “Many countries have national AI strategies. But only the United States and China have the resources, commercial might, talent pool, and innovation ecosystem to lead the world in AI.”Elaine McCusker, a former acting under secretary of defense (comptroller), is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where Emily Coletta is a researcher.Share:More In OpinionSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",,Who will lead the world in artificial intelligence?,,,,,,,C4ISRNet,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",,,,,,,,,Opinion,,,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/opinion/2021/03/01/who-will-lead-the-world-in-artificial-intelligence/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent months, concerns about the economic impact of the pandemic have been closely tied with a spate of panicked automation headlines like, ""Will Robots Take Our Jobs In A Socially Distanced Era??"".But there's a different reality that showcases the importance of having a robust digital transformation strategy.Already we have seen that incorporating new technologies has led to a dramatic shift in the way industries operate worldwide. We are also witnessing a significant rise in interest for robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent automation and artificial intelligence among business leaders who realize that intelligent automation demonstrates strong transformative potential across all industries.



Business leaders are accelerating the adoption of technologies they view as crucial to digital transformation efforts – like intelligent and robotic process automation – to help them thrive in this tumultuous business environment and beyond.Intelligent automation as a competitive differentiatorBusinesses are constantly met with new restrictions and 63% of business decision makers feel they are struggling to meet customer demands. 93% of those decision makers believe intelligent automation will help solve this problem.


Intelligent automation offers a number of key benefits, from time and money savings to improved efficiency. By implementing all capabilities found in RPA and connecting previously silo'ed departments and improving communication, intelligent automation can help businesses focus on more strategic work. For example: One Michigan-based power company serving 2.2 million customers is using a digital workforce to halve the number of bills that need to be reviewed by human workers. By automating this process, and 35 others, the company is saving 250,000 man hours annually.Related: How Artificial Intelligence Is Reshaping the Insurance IndustryImplementation is on the upswingBusiness leaders are looking to intelligent automation to help reap the benefits of a lighter workload and reduced financial burden. In fact, at the start of 2020, 92% of business leaders already had plans to roll out intelligent automation across their organizations – this number will only go up as we continue to experience the lasting impact of the pandemic. 


Many companies have been building an automation-ready business culture and knowledge workers are ready to embrace their digital coworkers. Only 33% of employees still harbor fears about losing their jobs to automation and 81% have a strong understanding of the benefits intelligent automation can bring to their organizations. Overall, the past year has prepared leaders, and employees alike, to welcome technology that will make for a more agile and efficient hybrid workforce.Related: Fintech Start-Ups Are Growing: What's New To Look For In 2020An adapting workforceThe past year has proved that our workforce is resilient, flexible and capable of adjusting to many challenges. As businesses around the globe embrace new work environments and technologies, we've seen a growing level of trust in automation as employees adapt to digital colleagues. They are excited about the opportunities intelligent automation creates, embracing benefits that allow them to focus more on creative, meaningful work. Businesses that provide employees with training and reassurance as these digital workers are introduced enable the smoothest transition. As the financial strain of the pandemic continues, investment management firms are applying intelligent automation to end-to-end processes for loan applications, getting funds to those in need as quickly as possible. Healthcare organizations are automating the patient diagnostic process, reducing clinical risk by ensuring the process is fast and accurate. 


As organizations in industries like healthcare and financial services introduce intelligent automation, they help their workforce adapt and upskill by retraining employees. In fact, 78% of organizations provide training opportunities when they introduce new technologies. Further 80% of knowledge workers feel comfortable reskilling, indicating a willingness to adapt alongside digital colleagues.The coming robot apocalypse has been greatly exaggeratedWhat could the future hold with digital workers operating alongside human workers? Today's intelligent automation is more sophisticated than ever and does not require the level of manual governance it once did. Businesses can train digital workers to do almost anything (payment processing, monitoring data integrity, management, etc.) freeing human workers to engage in more exciting roles.Blue Prism intelligent digital workers are designed to be more accessible and intuitive to non-tech business users. By offering a no-code automation tool, business teams are empowered with agile operational automation capabilities. This vastly expands access and utilization of both in-house and third party technologies, allowing for business processes to become more easily repeatable, secure, auditable and scalable -- ultimately resulting in higher customer satisfaction rates.

 (Tracy Staton)
Virtual drug design tech firm Iktos has set up a new pact with Big Pharma Pfizer to tap its artificial intelligence for its discovery work. Pfizer will use the Paris-based company’s tech for de novo design to “selected Pfizer small-molecule discovery programs,” although the pair did not share specifics of the targets nor of any financials for the pact. “Pfizer has had an active interest in AI for de novo design and we are excited to work with Iktos to use their AI technology on a number of our programs,” said Charlotte Allerton, head of medicine design at Pfizer.The use of AI is fairly broad, but these sorts of deals are designed to help seek out, model and better predict small-molecule activities to help Pfizer know which targets are most likely to get to the finishing line and return millions, if not billions, of dollars. Iktos, founded back in 2016, has similar deals with Janssen, Almirall, Servier, Galapagos and Pierre Fabre. RELATED: Almirall taps Iktos for AI drug discovery work“We are proud to work with Pfizer and to have their scientists use our software in their early discovery programs,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos. “It is our ultimate goal to put our technology in the hands of drug discovery scientists, who have deep knowledge and understanding of their discovery programs. By combining their drug discovery expertise with our algorithmic and data science know-how and experience derived from the many collaborations we have established to date, we believe that the promise of AI to dramatically improve drug discovery will have a better chance to be realized and impact therapeutic development.”

French start-up Iktos has announced a collaboration with Pfizer on the use of its artificial intelligence technology for drug design. This partnership comes in response to the considerable progress in the development of AI algorithms and computing power that has enabled the development of innovative approaches to small molecule drug design.

Founded in 2016, Iktos develops generative AI technology in numerous collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. A fundamental aspect of the technology lies in the exploration of chemical space performed by generating compounds in silico under the constraints of the program’s final objectives, rather than by screening compound libraries. As part of the collaboration, Pfizer has deployed Iktos’ generative AI technology and is applying it to several small molecule research programs.
“Pfizer has an active interest in AI for de novo design and we are pleased to work with Iktos to use their AI technology in a number of our programs,” said Charlotte Allerton, Head of Drug Design at Pfizer.

Earlier this year, Iktos launched Makya™, its de novo AI-based design software for multi-parameter optimization (MPO), available either as a SaaS platform or installed in the customer’s IT environment or virtual private cloud (VPC). Makya’s interface allows it to be used by medicinal or computational chemists. Makya can also be run as a Python package via a Jupyter notebook interface.
“We are proud to work with Pfizer and delighted that their scientists are using our software in their research programs,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos.
“Our ultimate goal is to put our technology in the hands of drug discovery researchers who have a deep knowledge and understanding of their research programs. By combining their drug discovery expertise with our know-how in algorithmic and data science, as well as our experience from numerous collaborations established to date, we believe that AI’s promise to significantly improve drug discovery will have a better chance of being realized and having an impact on therapeutic development”.

The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence today released its report today with dozens of recommendations for President Joe Biden, Congress, and business and government leaders. China, the group said, represents the first challenge to U.S. technological dominance that threatens economic and military power for the first time since the end of World War II.
The 15-member commission calls a $40 billion investment to expand and democratize AI research and development a “modest down payment for future breakthroughs,” and encourages an attitude toward investment in innovation from policymakers akin that which led to building the interstate highway system in the 1950s. Ultimately, the group envisions hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on AI by the federal government in the coming years.

Amplifying ROI: The Impact of Women Leaders in Generative AI Development



The report recommends several changes that could shape business, tech, and national security. For example, amid a global shortage of semiconductors, the report calls for the United States to stay “two generations ahead” of China in semiconductor manufacturing and suggests a hefty tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers. President Biden pledged support for $32 billion to address a global chip shortage and last week signed an executive order to investigate supply chain issues.
“I really hope that Congress deeply considers the report and its recommendations,” AWS CEO Andy Jassy said today as part of a meeting held to approve the report. “I think there’s meaningful urgency to get moving on these needs, and it’s important to realize that you can’t just flip a switch and have these capabilities in place. It takes steady, committed hard work over a long period of time to bring these capabilities to fruition.”
Commissioners who helped compile the report include Oracle CEO Safra Catz, Microsoft chief scientist Eric Horvitz, Google Cloud AI chief Andrew Moore, and Jassy, who takes over as CEO of Amazon later this year. Publication of the final report is the last act of the temporary commission Congress formed in 2018 to advise federal policy.
The 756-page report calling for the United States to be AI-ready by 2025 was approved by commissioners in a vote today. Moore and Horvitz abstained from chapters 2 and 11 of the report due to perceived conflicts of interest.
“I think it bears repeating that to win in AI, we need more money, more talent, stronger leadership, and collectively we as a commission believe this is a national security priority, and that the steps outlined in the report represent not just our consensus, but a distillation of hundreds and hundreds of experts in technology and policy and ethics, and so I encourage the public and everyone to follow our recommendations,” commission chair and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said.
Now, Schmidt and other commissioners said, begins the work of selling these ideas to key decision makers in power.
Recommendations in the report include:

The intelligence community should seek to fully automate many tasks by 2030.
In line with earlier recommendations, the final report calls for the creation of a Digital Corps for hiring temporary or short-term tech talent, and a Digital Service Academy to create an accredited university to produce government tech talent. The report calls failure to recognize the need to develop a government technical workforce shortsighted and a national security risk.
Increase access to open source software for federal government employees in agencies like the Pentagon. The report refers to TensorFlow and PyTorch as “must-have tools in any AI developer’s arsenal.”
Private industry should form an organization with $1 billion in funding in the next five years that launches efforts to address inequality.
Identify service members with computational thinking.
Establish responsible AI leads in each national security agency and branch of the armed forces.
The report also calls for the U.S. State Department to increase its presence in U.S. and technology hubs around the world.
Triple the number of national AI research institutes. The first institutes were introduced in August 2020.
Set policy for agencies critical to national security to allow people to report irresponsible AI deployments.
Double AI research and development spending until 2026, when levels will hit $32 billion.
The report also calls immigration a “national security imperative” and that immigration policy could slow progress for China. Commissioners recommend doubling the number of employment-based green cards, creating visas for entrepreneurs and the makers of emerging and disruptive technology, and giving green cards to every AI PhD graduate from an accredited U.S. university. Leadership in 5G telecommunications and robotics are also referred to as national security imperatives in the report.

Government beyond defenseadvertisement
Within government, the report also goes beyond recommendations for the Pentagon, extending recommendations to Congress for border security and federal agencies like the FBI or Department of Homeland Security. For example, the report criticizes a lack of transparency of AI systems used by federal agencies as potentially affecting civil liberties and calls for Congress to amend impact assessment and disclosure reporting requirements to include civil rights and civil liberty reports for new AI systems or major updates to existing systems.
“For the United States, as for other democratic countries, official use of AI must comport with principles of limited government and individual liberty. These principles do not uphold themselves. In a democratic society, any empowerment of the state must be accompanied by wise restraints to make that power legitimate in the eyes of its citizens,” the report reads.
A statement from ACLU senior staff attorney Patrick Toomey, whose work focuses on national security, said the report acknowledges some dangers of AI in its recommendations, but “it should have gone further and insisted that the government establish critical civil rights protections now, before these systems are widely deployed by intelligence agencies and the military. Congress and the executive branch must prioritize these safeguards, and not wait until after dangerous systems have already become entrenched.”advertisement
The report argues that the consolidation of the AI industry threatens U.S. technological competitiveness in a number of important ways, exacerbating trends like brain drain and stifled competition.
China and U.S. foreign policy
Increases in funding and investment by China to be an AI leader by 2025 means more time is dedicated to China in the report than any other foreign nation. The report concludes that the United States could lose military technical superiority to China within the next decade.
“We have every reason to think that the competition with China will increase,” Schmidt said during the NSCAI meeting today.
To ward off rising models of techno-authoritarian governance like the kind practiced in China, the report calls for the United States to establish an Emerging Technology Coalition with allies. The report calls for high-level, ongoing diplomatic dialogue with China to discuss challenges emerging technology like AI presents in order to find areas for cooperation toward global challenges like climate change. That body could also act as a forum for sharing concerns or grievances about practices inconsistent with American values. Bilateral talks between the United States and China were previously recommended by AI policy expert and former White House economist R. David Edelman.
In defense, commissioners do not support a treaty for the global prohibition of AI-enabled autonomous weaponry since it is “not currently in the interest of U.S. or international security,” and because the report concludes that China and Russia would ignore any such commitment. Instead, the report calls for developing standards for autonomous weaponry.
In other matters related to foreign policy and international affairs, the commissions calls for an international agreement to never automate use of nuclear weapons, and to seek similar commitments from Russia and China.
The need for leadership is stressed throughout the report. For President Biden, the report recommends an executive order aimed at protecting intellectual property, and create a Technology Competitiveness Council in part to deal with intellectual property issues and establish national plans.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz called collaboration within and among Department of Defense, U.S. government, and allies critical, and said that leadership in government is needed. “There’s so many important steps that have to be taken now.”
“It is our great hope that like-minded democratic nations work together to make sure that technologies around AI do not leak into adversarial hands that will give them an advantage over our systems and that we will unite together in the safe and responsible deployment of this kind of technology in military systems,” commissioner and In-Q-Tel founder Gilman Louie said today.
The United States has been working with international groups like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), while last year defense and diplomatic officials from United States allies met to discuss ethical use of AI in warfare.

Ethical AI
New technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), are reshaping our world. They bring powerful opportunities and threats, especially to our human rights. The Final Report sets out a roadmap for Australia to seize the opportunities and address the threats.
Australia should innovate consistently with our liberal democratic values. This means being consultative, inclusive and accountable. New tech should come with robust human rights safeguards.
Technology and human rights
The recommendations in the Final Report are informed by the Commission’s expertise, our research and extensive public consultation with the community, government, industry and academia.
The Final Report aims to foster a deeper understanding of the human rights implications for Australia of new and emerging technologies to ensure ethical AI is designed and deployed.
Final Report
The Final Report is divided into four parts:

Part A: a national strategy on new and emerging technologies
Part B: the use of artificial intelligence in decision making by government and the private sector
Part C: supporting effective regulation through the creation of an AI Safety Commissioner
Part D: accessible technology for people with disability.

The Final Report covers several areas in detail such as facial recognition technology, algorithmic bias and the creation of an AI Safety Commissioner amongst others.

Artificial intelligence algorithm tests, trusted AI, black box effect: interview with Guillaume Avrin from LNE

In the context of our dossier Trusted Artificial Intelligence: From Critical Systems to the Common Good published in issue 3 of the magazine ActuIA currently on newsstands and available in our online shop, we spoke with Guillaume Avrin, Head of the “Artificial Intelligence Evaluation” department at the Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d’Essais (LNE). In February 2021, LNE, which has established itself for several years as a trusted third-party assessor of artificial intelligence, announced that it had obtained government funding for the creation of the world’s first generic platform dedicated to the evaluation of artificial intelligence, called LEIA.
In this interview, Guillaume Avrin explains LNE’s missions in the field of artificial intelligence, what artificial intelligence algorithm testing and the “black box” effect are, but also the challenges of certification.
ActuIA: Could you give us a brief presentation of the LNE?

Guillaume Avrin: The Laboratoire national de métrologie et d’essais (LNE) is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature (EPIC) attached to the Ministry of Industry. It is the national reference body for testing, evaluation and metrology. In support of public policies, its action aims to assess and structure the supply of new products, seeking both to protect and meet the needs of consumers and to develop and promote the competitiveness of national industry (cf. Article L823-1 of the Consumer Code). It also assists manufacturers in their efforts to innovate and become more competitive in many fields of expertise and sectors of activity. LNE carries out work on the characterisation, qualification and certification of systems and technologies to support all breakthrough innovations (artificial intelligence, nanotechnologies, additive manufacturing, radioactivity measurement, hydrogen storage, etc.) for the benefit of the scientific, regulatory and industrial community.
In the emerging field of artificial intelligence, LNE has metrological and methodological expertise in evaluation, which has no equivalent at European level. It has carried out more than 950 evaluations of AI systems since 2008, notably in language processing (translation, transcription, speaker recognition, etc.), image processing (person recognition, object recognition, etc.) and robotics (autonomous vehicles, service robots, agricultural robots, collaborative robots, intelligent medical devices, etc.). It is involved in all the major cross-cutting challenges of AI and, in parallel, ensures the implementation of a solution qualification system based on an efficient and partly internalized national network, particularly in the upstream stages of this deployment and for the development of the metrological, methodological and instrumental models to be implemented.
Are the tests of artificial intelligence algorithms similar to the tests you are used to doing in other specialties, or have they required the development of new skills and protocols? How are they different? How many artificial intelligence experts work for LNE? Do they all work at LNE or do you use independent experts?

The tests that we conduct in AI contribute to estimating fairly and in the absolute (for purposes of development, performance characterization, benchmarking, certification, etc.) the use value, performance, hazards, environmental impact, positive or negative, i.e. also its impact, even indirect, on societies and individual lifestyles: socio-economic consequences, ethical, legal, sociological questioning, etc.
This is a significantly new issue linked to the strong professional and social substitution power of AI, but which also has a metrological specificity: the ability of intelligent systems is to be measured mainly on the functional level and lies above all in their adaptability (a conventional system is on the contrary judged quantitatively on its performance in compliance with a job framework that is perfectly defined from the design stage). It is therefore not only a question of objectively quantifying functions and performance, but also of validating and characterising operating environments (perimeters of use) which are by nature variable, often highly variable, particularly in the case of so-called “open” environments. It is this variability of the situation to be treated, specific to the terrain of the human mind, which confers the quality of intelligence to the system and even measures its degree.
This extensive field of use and experimentation and the at least partially autonomous and often non-convex, non-linear, non-deterministic behaviour of AI systems require the development of sui generis protocols and measurement instruments:

The measurement of intelligent systems is based on a so-called “soft” metrology that is more functional than quantitative, more attentive to robustness than to performance, and using composite and multidimensional metrics capable of accurately and precisely reflecting the magnitude and sensitivities of the environmental field of operation of the component under test.
It is essentially a question of covering a field of use with a necessarily limited but minimal sampling fineness to guarantee the absence of aberrant reactions. The test scenarios to be presented to the system under evaluation are therefore potentially very numerous, some of which may lead to accident or near-accident situations and can only be generated using simulation means. As simulation implies a necessarily reductive modelling of reality, compromises must be found between the needs for completeness and realism.

This compromise imperative directly justifies and structures the “LEIA” (Laboratory for the Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence) initiative coordinated by LNE, which will eventually bring together all national players (research laboratories, test centres, equipment manufacturers and test bench architects, data owners, standardisation bodies, administrations, investors, etc.) to build an initial integrated platform for evaluating artificial intelligence on an international scale. This system will be based on a network that takes into account the existing situation (HR, resources, know-how, statutory missions), operating in a distributed but structured way (at least by AI application sector) to jointly meet the need for system evaluation. This network is built over time by relying on various collaborative projects at national (ANR, Grand défi), European (H2020, CHIST-ERA, COVR, etc.) and international levels.) and international (in particular through its strategic partnership with NIST, which is specific to AI), as well as through LNE’s participation in various standardization committees dealing with AI and robotics (Afnor’s Strategic Orientation Committee for Information and Digital Communication, Afnor’s AI committee, CEN-CENELEC’s Focus Group AI and Section 81 of the Union de Normalisation de la Mécanique on industrial robotics).
To meet this practical and programmatic need, LNE now has some fifteen in-house engineers and PhDs specializing in AI, who are regularly accompanied by post-docs, PhD students and trainees, as well as its own experts in cybersecurity, biology, mathematics and statistics, medical devices, etc. Even if this number of staff is eventually to be doubled, LNE will continue to work to the maximum extent possible in co-contracting with its academic, scientific, industrial and administrative partners, if only to promote technical appropriation and technology transfer.
How many years have you been involved in the measurement of artificial intelligence algorithms and how is this demand evolving? Can we have figures? What types of actors are you working with?
The activity was launched in 2008 as a result of guidance given by the public authorities, in the context of specific sovereignty issues, but it is only three years since artificial intelligence was made one of the top national and international priorities for technological and industrial development, and thus for the LNE.
Since all professional and domestic sectors (medical devices and diagnostics, autonomous mobility, industrial and agricultural robotics, legaltech, fintech, assurtech, etc.) are now included in the scope of the project, the project is now being implemented in the following areas: medical devices and diagnostics, autonomous mobility, industrial and agricultural robotics, legaltech, fintech, assurtech, etc.) which is gradually becoming automated, the spectrum of LNE’s partners and customers has in parallel broadened to include a wide range of institutional (Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of the Armed Forces, Ministry of Research, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Ministry of Ecological Transition, High Authority for Health, DG CONNECT of the European Commission, INC, CEA, etc.) and industrial (Thales, Dassault, Airbus, Facebook, Numalis, etc.) players, and continues to grow.
The difficulty will be precisely to manage this transition from a developing AI to a commercial AI, which could be massive and for which it is therefore necessary to actively prepare, well in advance of commercial maturities and qualification needs. In programmatic terms, this difficulty has been recognized by the EC in a recent White Paper and in its “TEF” test centre project of the order of 3 billion euros, which could be launched at the beginning of 2021, as well as in France in its decision to retain trusted AI as one of its rare “major challenges” financed by the Innovation and Industry Fund.
Data is very important in artificial intelligence: how to ensure that training data is not biased? Their constitution, especially in Deep Learning, requires very large games that can be extremely expensive to collect, is it realistic to expect you to compile such data sets for testing on your own, and if you rely on your clients’ data, aren’t the test results likely to be very far from reality?

The qualification of the data is aimed at verifying their representativeness, i.e. their completeness with regard to the targeted application and their realism, in order to limit the potential associated biases (selection bias, classification bias, etc.).
The completeness of the data is quantified in particular through coverage rate calculations, while compliance with realism requirements is assessed thanks to qualification procedures that are currently being standardised, in particular within the framework of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Artificial Intelligence standardisation committee to which we contribute (cf. ISO/IEC WD 5259 – in preparation – “Data quality for analytics and ML”).
Evaluating completeness requires, in particular, formalizing the use cases, identifying the conditions of use and contraindications, formalizing the influencing factors (weather conditions, luminosity, temperature, etc.) impacting the performance of the system. A corpus analysis can then be carried out in order to verify the proper coverage of application needs.
Several methods exist to generate or artificially augment data to improve the coverage rate of learning and test scenarios, including the addition of perturbations (rain, snow, etc.), noise and sensor defects from models, the application of metamorphic transformations (inversion, rotation, etc.), the automatic production of corner cases by auto-encoders or GANs, etc.
The realism assessment includes checks for meta-information potentially associated with the raw data, called annotations. When these are carried out by humans, they can thus be subject to specific analyses in order to verify the existence of a field truth associated with the data (complete manual examination or random sampling, selection by majority vote, calculation of inter- and intra-anotator agreement rates, etc.). It also includes the identification and analysis of “outliers” (“outliers” or “atypical” values) in order to decide whether they should be maintained/deleted/adapted, or the consistency between the means (sensors, pre-processing chains, etc.) used for the acquisition of learning and test data, and those implemented in real conditions, once the system has been deployed.
Concerning the tools available for corpus exploration, since 2015 LNE has been developing the Matics software platform, free and open source (CeCILL-B licence), dedicated to data visualization and the evaluation of automatic information processing systems. In constant evolution, the software can be used, for example, to automate the evaluation of automatic language processing tasks (translation, transcription, speaker verification, named entity recognition, tokenization, lemmatization, etc.) and image recognition tasks (computer vision).
Both AI system developers and their assessors are concerned by these requirements for realism and completeness in the test databases to be used. Both the physical and logical separation and the precellence of the assessor’s test data must be guaranteed. Depending on the application area, several approaches are currently being considered:

If the application concerns very rare data (for example medical data of orphan pathologies), the AI developer is generally the only one or one of the only ones in the world to have data on the subject. The trusted third-party evaluator will therefore need to be able to access corpuses of the developer that have not been used during learning, which he can “augment” (noise, disturbances, transformations, etc.) in order to limit bias, especially overlearning, for use in evaluations.
If the application concerns common, transapplicable and/or inexpensive to produce data (recognition of everyday objects such as humans, animals, road signs, office equipment, etc.), then it is relevant to set up reference databases (standards for AI) independently of the developer.

These processes are obviously long and costly, and therefore pre-emptive. Their strategic nature cannot therefore be over-emphasised, and some even believe that they could go so far as to call into question the principle of European solidarity as an exception to sovereignty.
In any case, and even though such data may often be of a sensitive nature (personal, professional, military), the LEIA initiative leaves open at this stage the question of the best form of collection and aggregation to adopt, centralised or distributed, public or private. However, since the need is unavoidable and must be met first, it should above all be covered as soon as possible and without waiting for it to start happening across the Atlantic or elsewhere. Because, if behind the race to AI, there is a race to the data, nothing will serve to run, it will especially be necessary to be started at the right time.
We often talk about the “black box” effect of Deep Learning. Does it seem to you to be a real obstacle, or do you believe that a Deep Learning algorithm can still be qualified as “trusted”, i.e. that it meets performance, robustness, explicability and ethical issues, at the end of the tests carried out?

The term “black box” refers to the inaccessibility (physical, logical or simply human understanding) of the internal workings of a system. For AIs of this type, the decisions made are generally not explicable, the decision rules applied are not interpretable and the functionality is not formally demonstrable.
Only the experimental way remains, which incidentally obliges us to better identify the conditions of use by having to carry them out concretely. It is the whole system that is then tested and we can even argue that intelligence is a holistic property of such a black box, i.e. there would be no sense in sharing it between its possible components.
Input-output tests (also called “black box” tests) are then set up to characterize the AI system by soliciting it according to a scenario combining various stimuli and evaluating the quality of its behavior (for example via comparisons to references, to a field truth). The confidence to be placed in these AIs thus depends directly on the results of evaluations conducted on representative test data.
To be reassured, we can note that human beings often function in “black box” mode, the recognition of their environment, for example, appeals more to their intuition than to their reasoning (we immediately recognize a person by their particular features without detailing them formally).
Some tests, usually involving real-time decision-making capabilities, are also used to assess these skills. This is the case of the driver’s licence test. It can also be noted that if a human being passes his driving test in thirty minutes, the autonomous vehicle is required to cover several thousand kilometres before being approved. It is therefore not so much the “black box” nature of the autonomous vehicle that raises the question as the identification of the right size of the test environment (which influencing factors to vary, which sampling step, etc.) to put in place to report on its performance.
Do you have any other examples of areas where you are being asked for help and where this “black box” effect also exists?

Because of its missions, LNE conducts its assessments mainly through tests. The hardness of a material, for example, is assessed experimentally, in addition or when it cannot be calculated from its chemical composition.
It is the very notion of measurement that refers to this usual practice of a posteriori evaluation.
What are the main weaknesses of the artificial intelligence algorithms that you notice during the tests?

The main weaknesses we find are directly related to the existence of measurement instruments to identify, quantify and correct them. As previously mentioned, there is a whole metrology of AI to be set up, making it possible to characterize the operating environments of AI systems beyond the error rate calculations currently carried out. We thus note the lack of robustness (to meteorological variations, rare events, etc.) and resilience (adverse attacks, sensor perturbations, etc.) of the systems we are evaluating.
In the same way, the explicable or ethical nature of decisions made by AI is difficult to assess objectively today, due to the lack of a reference system and tools to quantify them. And we know the weaknesses of current AIs concerning these two aspects.
Deep Learning’s algorithms have proven to be very sensitive to adverse attacks, allowing to deceive a machine vision AI by adding a few almost imperceptible pixels to an image. Have you seen any progress in this area, and if not, isn’t this likely to undermine the reliability of AI systems in an uncontrolled environment, such as an autonomous vehicle?

New approaches appear to have been developed to mitigate the “fragility” of Deep Learning algorithms, including the concepts of robust learning and robust data. To date, we have not seen any real improvement with respect to adversary attacks as a whole.
Nevertheless, it seems to us relevant to differentiate between the adversary examples corresponding to realistic corner squares (the scenario that the data represents could indeed occur in real and nominal operating conditions) and the adversary examples that would result from a malicious attack. While the robustness of Deep Learning algorithms improves when they are trained on databases containing disrupted/enhanced/transformed data, their resilience to attacks seems to be primarily a matter of other types of protection, including cyber security.
Are you in favour of making the certification of artificial intelligence algorithms mandatory, including in systems that are not considered “critical” but whose consequences may be significant for society (for example in the case of recruitment algorithms)? Is there not a risk that the cost of these tests could be a brake on innovation and the emergence of new startups?

In a context of plethoric development, it seems indispensable to give guarantees and objective criteria of choice to the users of AI systems. Certification, which is based on a reference system shared by all and on evaluation results carried out by independent third-party bodies, is an effective tool for building this confidence. LNE, which combines expertise in the field of AI assessment with the expertise of a certification body, has therefore chosen to build a voluntary certification reference system on the subject. This is a first step that will enable developers to acquire and demonstrate the implementation of good practices, attesting to the reliability of the AI systems developed.
Rather than a hindrance, this certification will be a competitive advantage. The working group in charge of building the reference system, made up of representative players in the field (Arcure, Axionable, IRT Railenium, Kickmaker, Michelin, Orange, Proxinnov, Scortex, Thales, etc.), has moreover chosen to build the requirements in terms of results to be achieved and not the means to be implemented, thus avoiding slowing down innovation. The cost of a certification should be quite reasonable in view of the stakes of the conformity assessment carried out.
It is in fact wealth creation that our economy needs, for the domestic market and for our international trade. Wealth is directly linked to demand, it is only a measure of its satisfaction. In order to extend to commercial success an AI market that has so far been driven mainly by supply, it is imperative to anticipate market reactions and to activate as soon as possible the conditions for bringing supply and demand closer together, which is the main purpose of certification.
Thank you to Guillaume Avrin for agreeing to answer our questions.

It will allow job seekers to schedule virtual meetings with career coaches that match their skillsets, connect with prospective employers, participate in training opportunities, and receive help with building effective resumes.Rhode Islanders can access the portal at BackToWorkRI.com.AdvertisementThe initiative, which was launched in July 2020 by Governor Gina M. Raimondo, was meant to be a public-private partnership designed to train, support, and hire Rhode Islanders who have been displaced by the pandemic.Since last March, thousands of Rhode Islanders have lost their jobs, leaving them no other choice but to file for unemployment. Sarah Blusiewicz, assistant director of workforce development for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said she hopes that after filing for unemployment, Rhode Islanders will be using this career center as a tool to get back to work.“COVID-19 has left thousands of Rhode Islanders unemployed and searching for new, sustainable careers,” said Blusiewicz. “Our collaboration with Google Cloud has married accessible technology with government innovation to train and connect workers with the resources they need to access in-demand jobs.”The career center uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to connect the state’s workforce with new career opportunities while using familiar productivity tools within Google Workspace. Some of the features include the AI-powered CareerCompass Rhode Island bot, named “Skipper,” which uses data and machine learning to connect residents with potential new career paths and proven reskilling opportunities.The center also integrates video calling via Google Meet, so job seekers can meet with career coaches and use screen-sharing to review and edit resumes and cover letters in real time. Coaches and job seekers are paired based on the coach’s areas of expertise and language fluency. The center is available in English and Spanish now, but can support multiple languages.Advertisement“Rhode Island is the first state in the country to use AI/ML and Google Workspace to deploy a job search platform at this scale,” said Mike Daniels, vice president of Global Public Sector at Google Cloud. “We hope that the integrated experience provided by our technology will help job seekers hit the ground running.”Here are answers to common questions about the platform:How does applying for a job on this platform help eliminate the implicit bias issues that resume readers have?According to Blusiewicz, the platform will help push forward resumes for skills-based hiring, unlike other platforms that use technology that eliminates job seekers who don’t use the “correct” keywords. In addition, she said since job seekers can book video conferences with employers and recruiters, the portal encourages hiring managers to go above the “resume reader noise.”In conversations with local employers, Blusiewicz said, “For years, the theme has been, ‘We have great job seekers that need jobs.’” Great jobs are out there, she said, but traditional job boards with resume readers that searched only for certain terms, coupled with information overload, eliminated good candidates.How does the platform ensure that Rhode Islanders are using the center, and not people from other states?Users are not required to plug in their address, Blusiewicz said, but the idea is to have this portal connected to Rhode Island’s unemployment insurance system.“As Rhode Islanders are filling out those unemployment claims, we can then direct them to this site as the next step,” she said.AdvertisementThe job I had before the pandemic is probably not going to come back. How will this portal help me?The machine learning aspect of the center will help someone transition into another field. It will scan your profile and the work history that you upload, and pull administrative data on people who have skills similar to yours. Based on your existing skills, it will help match you to other sectors and positions that are available.Will similar platforms be available in other states?Daniels said Google Cloud is in conversations with “a number of states” about developing a similar career center, but he said he believes that this site will pave the way for neighboring states.“I think we’ve really thought deeply in terms of how we could incorporate the human element and how to make this a different feeling for someone, by curating it for them, instead of them simply going out and pounding the job boards,” said Daniels. “This is coming at exactly the right time.”Get Rhode MapA weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State.Enter EmailSign UpAlexa Gagosz can be reached at alexa.gagosz@globe.com.

AI algorithms are used in almost every sector – criminal justice, recruitment, news media, manufacturing, banking, military, law enforcement, etc. With AI being used in diverse areas, there is a growing worry among researchers that bias in AI can threaten human rights and society, coming in the way of free speech, right to resources and information, to name a few. With such risks, the need for ethical, responsible, and transparent AI is obvious..But what more will it take to make AI ethics a priority for businesses? .In 2019, the AI Ethicist role was established as top 5 hires for companies that want to succeed in the digital domain. The need was brought to light as ethical and social implications of AI will only become a matter of greater importance. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) advised that &quot;companies need to create roles for senior-level marketers, ethicists, or lawyers who can pragmatically implement ethically aligned design, both in the technology and the social processes to support value-based system innovation&quot; in IEEE's Ethically Aligned Design Guidelines for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems v2..In the past couple of years, many organizations came forward and expressed their need to hire for this role under different titles like Chief AI Ethics Officer, Chief Trust Officer, and AI Ethics and Governance. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Accenture took a step forward and actually hired for this responsibility. &quot;The call for artificial intelligence ethics specialists is growing louder as technology leaders publicly acknowledge that their products may be flawed and harmful to employment, privacy, and human rights&quot;, highlighted Wall Street Journal..The Need For A Dedicated AI Ethicist .What does an AI ethicist do? This role will be responsible for offering sound advice on ethical AI practice and guards the organization against bias, accidental consequences, and ensures accountability. Sadly, some companies have not realized its implications and consider this role as an add-on..An AI Ethicist works across many disciples of the organization towards having ethical and unbiased AI goals throughout the product life cycle. The AI Ethicist will directly inform corporate leadership and the board of directors about unintended non-technical aspects of AI and the risks it might possess on the organization..IBM has set the right example in taking the lead. IBM Policy Lab proposes a regulatory framework that consists of five policy imperatives for the organization, the first of which is to designate a lead AI ethics official. It goes on to say, &quot;Providers and owners should designate a person responsible for trustworthy AI, such as a lead AI ethics official. This person would be accountable for internal guidance and compliance mechanisms such as an AI ethics board, that oversees risk assessments and harm mitigation strategies. A market environment that prioritizes the adoption of lead AI ethics officials, or other designated individuals, to oversee and manage the increasing complexity could help to mitigate risks and improve public acceptance and trust of these systems, while also driving firms' commitment to the responsible development, deployment, and overall stewardship of this important technology.&quot;.Who Can Be An AI Ethicist? .Now that we know why it is imperative for companies to get on board with hiring an individual to oversee AI ethics, let's understand what is required in an AI Ethicist's background..Diverse Perspective: AI ethics is not just about meeting legislation and compliance requirements or coding a technical solution in a system. As AI is adopted throughout the product life cycle, it is critical for the potential candidate to have experience in every domain where AI can be implemented. Only then the person can have an ethical, social, and political perspective of AI technology..Interdisciplinary Work Experience: Having technical knowledge and skill in areas like privacy legislation and machine learning is a bonus but not everything. An ethicist should be able to see the bigger picture and understand the system to be able to question and assess the consequences of the business processes. For this, interdisciplinary work experience is necessary..Understanding Processes &amp; Policies: A must-have skill for this role is the ability to question a design flow and develop a framework with necessary controls and loops. To reflect this in the work, a potential candidate should have previous experience in developing and structuring processes and policies..Public Speaking Skills: Confidently public speaking and facilitating training workshops is an important part of this role. One has to prepare content for the target audience, host debates and discussions, and meet with customers to advocate for ethical and responsible AI..With an AI Ethicist in charge, who holds these necessary skills, an organization will evade many unnecessary issues that can hinder its growth. Brian Kropp, Chief of Research, HR, envisions that a CAIEO (chief artificial intelligence ethics officer) as a person will create the ethical bill of rights that will be used to govern how an organization uses AI, where it will use it, how the organization will ensure it uses AI is the most appropriate way..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial intelligence engineer Average salary: Dh32,000 per monthWhen AI first entered the market, people feared it would replace workers and result in mass unemployment.Since then, automation has taken over some roles, but there are  human skills it cannot replicate.AI is in use across the UAE, in land and air traffic control systems, government departments, healthcare and education.The UAE has an AI strategy and recently opened the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, which will produce AI engineers.“AI is becoming the key for large private and government organisations to understand consumer sentiments and make decisions. It is a promising career,” Mr Babat said.2. Data scientistAverage salary: Dh32,000 per monthThis profession is in demand and will be so for many years.The Golden Visa, a 10-year residency permit for skilled professionals, is available to data scientists. The role also qualifies individuals to be considered for Emirati citizenship, but they have to be nominated by Royal Court officials.Read MoreVacancies in 2021: Top 10 jobs in UAE that will be in demandLooking for a job in UAE? Top recruiters share their tips on beating the competition“With so much digitisation across industries, data is the new currency. The UAE government’s vision to provide complete digital government services will also make the jobs of data scientists high in demand,” Mr Babat said.3. Management consultantAverage salary: Dh35,000Management consultants help companies solve business problems and maximise growth.By looking at available data they can help to improve a company's performance.With entrepreneurship heavily encouraged in the UAE, management consultants will be in high demand.4. Investment bankerAverage salary: Dh45,000These professionals advise individuals or companies how to invest their money and earn more.“Oil crash, digital disruption and the pandemic have all kept global markets highly volatile,"" Mr Babat said.""These uncertainties have increased demand for professional investment bankers, who help their clients in prudently investing and maximising the value of their money.""5. Principal scientistAverage salary: Dh38,000Principal scientists lead a team in planning, conducting and interpreting experiments.Scientists also qualify for the Golden Visa scheme and notably accomplished individuals can be nominated by the Royal Court for Emirati citizenship.Their area of work can vary widely, from healthcare to energy research, or even taking part in the space programme.6. Medical doctorAverage salary: Dh33,000Doctors are always going to be in demand, but the coronavirus pandemic has reminded governments how important it is to have an effective healthcare system. Naturally, salaries increase or decrease depending on training and specialisation.With the UAE's strong focus on building its healthcare sector, it is likely more vacancies will open up in the future.Specialists, surgeons and consultants can earn several times the average figure of Dh33,000.7. Cyber security engineerAverage salary: Dh30,000Cyber attacks are growing each year, and companies are looking for experienced cyber security engineers who can protect online information.Mr Babat said governments and private firms are looking to develop more secure technologies and would need these professionals.“Due to an increase in cyber attacks globally in recent years, organisations have lost billions of dollars,” he said.Many of these jobs come with a salary of more than Dh40,000.

8. Finance officerAverage salary: Dh33,000While the digital world has created many new job roles, some traditional positions will still be in demand 20 years from now.Mr Mackenzie said finance officer is one of these professions.An experienced candidate can earn between Dh33,000 and Dh35,000, and would oversee the spending of individuals or companies, advising them accordingly.9. Software engineerAverage salary: Dh35,000This is a branch of computer science which includes the development and building of computer system software.“I think software engineering is going to be a huge market, because there's going to be so many bits of software that will run the world,” Mr Mackenzie said.“For example; your car. You don't need technical engineers anymore. Teslas need to be serviced once every five years, and that would be done by a software engineer.”10. Senior human resources officerAverage salary: Dh30,000Human resources officers both hire and look after employees and those in higher ranking positions can earn a good salary.It was believed earlier that AI would replace this particular job, but instead the technology has been assisting their roles, rather than replacing them.What are the highest paid jobs in UAE?Banking - chief compliance

the UAE paves its way to a more digital future, recruiters have highlighted high-paying jobs that will still be in demand in 20 years. Initiatives have been launched to reshape the skills base of workers here, including <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/education/mbzuai-president-lays-out-bold-vision-to-put-uae-on-map-of-ai-superpowers-1.1152633"">an artificial intelligence university</a>, digital governance, autonomous vehicle strategies and <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/uae-in-space"">space exploration</a>. Recruiters said these will open up private sector opportunities for job seekers. ""The UAE is one of very few countries where government is setting an example for private firms to follow, by rapidly adopting digital governance,"" said Hasan Babat, managing consultant at human resources company Tuscan Consultancy.  “It has created an environment that is very conducive to attracting talent from across the world by easing investment rules, providing a transparent legal system and relaxing legislation for residency and citizenship."" David Mackenzie, of recruitment agency Mackenzie Jones Middle East, said <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/comment/how-robots-will-change-the-world-of-work-1.980822"">automation</a> will make certain job roles more popular. Artificial intelligence and software engineering roles are among those expected to increase in demand. ""Artificial intelligence engineers will be a massive area for us, because if you think about all those areas that have to be automated, AI is a key component behind that,"" he told <em>The National</em>. “If you look at my business, part of the assessment of selecting recruitment companies will be taken away from consultants, and AI bots will do that work for them.” However, Mr Mackenzie believes traditional roles such as those in finance, marketing and human resources will still be sought after. With digital transformation picking up pace, <em>The National</em> looks at 10 high-paying careers that will stay in demand far into the future. The list is compiled based on research, estimates and comments from Mr Babat and Mr Mackenzie.    Average salary: Dh32,000 per month When AI first entered the market, people feared it would replace workers and result in mass unemployment. Since then, automation has taken over some roles, but there are  human skills it cannot replicate. AI is in use across the UAE, in land and air traffic control systems, government departments, healthcare and education. The UAE has an AI strategy and recently opened the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, which will produce AI engineers. “AI is becoming the key for large private and government organisations to understand consumer sentiments and make decisions. It is a promising career,” Mr Babat said.  Average salary: Dh32,000 per month This profession is in demand and will be so for many years. The Golden Visa, a 10-year residency permit for skilled professionals, is available to data scientists. The role also qualifies individuals to be considered for Emirati citizenship, but they have to be nominated by Royal Court officials.  “With so much digitisation across industries, data is the new currency. The UAE government’s vision to provide complete digital government services will also make the jobs of data scientists high in demand,” Mr Babat said.  Average salary: Dh35,000 Management consultants help companies solve business problems and maximise growth. By looking at available data they can help to improve a company's performance. With entrepreneurship heavily encouraged in the UAE, management consultants will be in high demand.  Average salary: Dh45,000 These professionals advise individuals or companies how to invest their money and earn more. “Oil crash, digital disruption and the pandemic have all kept global markets highly volatile,"" Mr Babat said. ""These uncertainties have increased demand for professional investment bankers, who help their clients in prudently investing and maximising the value of their money.""   Average salary: Dh38,000 Principal scientists lead a team in planning, conducting and interpreting experiments. Scientists also qualify for the Golden Visa scheme and notably accomplished individuals can be nominated by the Royal Court for Emirati citizenship. Their area of work can vary widely, from healthcare to energy research, or even taking part in the space programme.  Average salary: Dh33,000 Doctors are always going to be in demand, but the coronavirus pandemic has reminded governments how important it is to have an effective healthcare system. Naturally, salaries increase or decrease depending on training and specialisation. With the UAE's strong focus on building its healthcare sector, it is likely more vacancies will open up in the future. Specialists, surgeons and consultants can earn several times the average figure of Dh33,000.  Average salary: Dh30,000 Cyber attacks are growing each year, and companies are looking for experienced cyber security engineers who can protect online information. Mr Babat said governments and private firms are looking to develop more secure technologies and would need these professionals. “Due to an increase in cyber attacks globally in recent years, organisations have lost billions of dollars,” he said. Many of these jobs <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/cybersecurity-jobs-boom-in-uae-with-starting-salaries-of-dh40-000-or-more-1.1148156"">come with a salary of more than Dh40,000</a>.   Average salary: Dh33,000 While the digital world has created many new job roles, some traditional positions will still be in demand 20 years from now. Mr Mackenzie said finance officer is one of these professions. An experienced candidate can earn between Dh33,000 and Dh35,000, and would oversee the spending of individuals or companies, advising them accordingly.  Average salary: Dh35,000 This is a branch of computer science which includes the development and building of computer system software. “I think software engineering is going to be a huge market, because there's going to be so many bits of software that will run the world,” Mr Mackenzie said. “For example; your car. You don't need technical engineers anymore. Teslas need to be serviced once every five years, and that would be done by a software engineer.”  Average salary: Dh30,000 Human resources officers both hire and look after employees and those in higher ranking positions can earn a good salary. It was believed earlier that AI would replace this particular job, but instead the technology has been assisting their roles, rather than replacing them.   ____________  ",UAE,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/10-future-proof-jobs-in-the-uae-with-high-salaries-1.1176383', 'name': '10 future-proof jobs in the UAE with high salaries', 'description': 'A video that illustrates this article - What does the future of the office look like?', 'image': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd27020bajtkr6c.cloudfront.net%2F06-11-2021%2Ft_fdef9f4c5cd0499dbf817102e265101e_name_image.jpg?smart=true&auth=abca0db92a3b635644865ba6b4874f56140fe81ef5d6e22bc5998f55678a1042&width=800&height=450', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd27020bajtkr6c.cloudfront.net%2F06-11-2021%2Ft_fdef9f4c5cd0499dbf817102e265101e_name_image.jpg?smart=true&auth=abca0db92a3b635644865ba6b4874f56140fe81ef5d6e22bc5998f55678a1042&width=400&height=225', 'contentUrl': {'height': 540, 'width': 540, 'filesize': 23637428, 'stream_type': 'ts', 'url': 'https://d3rbxhph9x05o3.cloudfront.net/wp-thenational/20200915/60c27d954cedfd0001bd44f2/t_54906d2d62a548f7ab3c8e5a81e76517_name_main/hd.m3u8', 'bitrate': 1600, 'provider': 'mediaconvert'}, 'duration': 'PT1M42.549S', 'uploadDate': '2021-07-02T04:26:35.192Z', 'dateCreated': '2020-09-15T19:39:30Z', 'datePublished': '2020-09-16T09:11:17Z', 'dateModified': '2021-06-10T21:01:09Z'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'url': 'https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/10-future-proof-jobs-in-the-uae-with-high-salaries-1.1176383', 'name': 'What does the future of the office look like?', 'description': 'A video that illustrates this article - What does the future of the office look like?', 'image': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd27020bajtkr6c.cloudfront.net%2F06-11-2021%2Ft_fdef9f4c5cd0499dbf817102e265101e_name_image.jpg?smart=true&auth=abca0db92a3b635644865ba6b4874f56140fe81ef5d6e22bc5998f55678a1042&width=800&height=450', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd27020bajtkr6c.cloudfront.net%2F06-11-2021%2Ft_fdef9f4c5cd0499dbf817102e265101e_name_image.jpg?smart=true&auth=abca0db92a3b635644865ba6b4874f56140fe81ef5d6e22bc5998f55678a1042&width=400&height=225', 'contentUrl': 'https://d3rbxhph9x05o3.cloudfront.net/wp-thenational/20200915/60c27d954cedfd0001bd44f2/t_54906d2d62a548f7ab3c8e5a81e76517_name_main/hd.m3u8', 'duration': 'PT1M42.549S', 'uploadDate': '2020-09-16T09:11:17Z', 'dateCreated': '2020-09-15T19:39:30Z', 'datePublished': '2020-09-16T09:11:17Z', 'dateModified': '2021-06-10T21:01:09Z'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coronavirus crisis has given rise to fresh concerns about automation in labour markets. With people locked down and social distancing still in place, many businesses around the world have scaled up their investment in artificial intelligence (AI). 
AI’s ability to identify and learn from data patterns, and translate them into useful technologies, has proven to be indispensable for many organisations, from healthcare providers to delivery subscription services, for example, in responding to the pandemic.Business applications of AI over the past 12 months have ranged from those designed to increase productivity and yield, through to customer-service functions.Robots have been rolling in to sanitise UK and US hospital corridors and deliver crucial supplies such as blood samples. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has enlisted mechanical floor scrubber Neo to whizz around and clean its floors every night, freeing up staff to make sure high-touch areas of the terminal are spotless. Following its $300-million acquisition of so-called decision engine Dynamic Yield in 2020, McDonald’s has also got in on the AI action, trailling drive-through systems chaired by smart speakers.Goldman Sachs, L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble are among those that have bet big on less-robotic looking AI tools to meet the challenges posed by a move away from physical consumerism to digital, including technology that predicts people’s financial outlook and “try-before-you-buy” product-matching systems.However, AI’s business impact will outlast COVID-19. Recent data from Grand View predicts the market will be worth $390 billion by 2025, marking 46.2 per cent growth since 2019. McKinsey is showing an appetite to invest in machine learning, with C-suite leaders who are seeing strong results from AI adoption gearing up to boost their spend over the next three years and develop their own solutions in-house.There are implications for humans, though. According to a World Economic Forum forecast, in a shift likely to worsen inequality, half of all work tasks will be handled by machines by 2025. A separate report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology projects AI could replace as many as two million more workers in manufacturing alone by 2025.This shift, coupled with an economic downturn, is paving the way for fresh concerns from employees about how many jobs will be lost to automation, especially for those in the services, electronic and manufacturing industries. In the United States alone, a little over a quarter (27 per cent) of all workers say they are worried the job they have now will be eliminated within the next five years as a result of new technology, robots or AI.However, AI’s automation effect may well be overstated. Analysis using data from the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training reveals that, in the European Union, the share of jobs facing a very high risk of being automated by new digital technologies is close to 14 per cent. However, what two in five EU jobs do face is a high probability of “substantial transformation”.So, while AI might change how humans work, the reality is it’s unlikely to replace most jobs entirely. And, although “robophobia” is on the up, there are several examples of how machine learning is already positively impacting employees across a host of industries.
AI’s role in supporting the workforce
Dr Samer Al Moubayed, chief executive at Furhat Robotics, a conversational-AI social robotics startup that builds tech designed to interact with humans in a natural, fluid way, has overseen the conception of the firm’s namesake robot that can speak, show emotions and maintain eye contact.The past few years have seen Moubayed work with the likes of human resources company Tengai to develop a robot that autonomously performs job interviews, scores the interview according to an established framework and summarises the output for a human recruiter.
Furhat Robotics is also collaborating with Deutsche Bahn to place intuitive travel assistants in train stations that can answer questions related to departure times, delays and more in over 35 languages.Moubayed is firm in his belief that such AI investments can support humans in their day-to-day jobs, working in harmony with the workforce instead of against it. Robotics, he argues, will open up more job opportunities.“Looking at innovations like Tengai, though the solution might reduce the need for recruiters, it won’t remove them from the process entirely,” he explains. “It will also increase the need for robot operators.”The same applies to Deutsche Bahn travel assistants. “Long term, it might lessen the need for hiring multiple customer service agents to cover a broad range of languages, but it will require developers and translators to a higher extent,” says Moubayed.The AI expert cautions that no one is in a position to understand the lasting net effect automation will have on the workforce. But, done right, many of the risks associated with automation can be mitigated in a similar fashion to previous industrial revolutions, through upskilling staff and also upholding a sense of social welfare.“Businesses should focus their AI investments on increasing the average quality of life for workers and customers, rather than simply relying on automation as a tool to cut costs,” he says.
Identifying human gaps, instead of filling them
Marketing giant Publicis Groupe credits the use of its internal AI application Marcel for helping it save 2,000 jobs during the pandemic. As a result, it plans to spend more heavily on the tool, having seen an encouraging impact on its workforce.The smart intranet works by assigning relevant briefs and projects to Publicis’ 80,000 staff. As ad execs everywhere from Tokyo to Toronto shifted to remote working at the outset of 2020, Marcel hosted an internal job mobility platform that allowed people to change agencies, move to different markets and stretch their skillset. 
Suddenly, as some Publicis-owned agencies and markets found themselves working harder and faster to respond to COVID, others were experiencing a slowdown as clients in the hardest-hit sectors, like travel, were incapacitated. 
Marcel enabled those overstretched agencies to post jobs and requests, making use of talent that had time on their hands. Dan Murray, Marcel’s chief executive, says as well as automating the mundane, the tech is enabling the business to identify human gaps for things robots can’t do, like think creatively or communicate effectively. 
“It’s allowed our staff to focus on things that might take a higher-level thought process or more creative mind. It’s also opened opportunities we might not otherwise have had,” he says.
The business is now plotting a lot more additional uses for Marcel’s future, based on AI and machine learning, that will connect people and allow staff to better flex their creative muscle.
Improving the working experience
Tech behemoth Cisco is leveraging AI, machine learning and smart data to enhance the quality of remote working for its 75,000 staff, from engineers to sales reps.With 96 per cent of employees currently working away from the office and a hybrid working model here to stay for the long-term, it has been using deep-learning algorithms to power an “empathetic, inclusive, secure, work-from-anywhere” experience, says senior director of people and communities Gianpaolo Barozzi.Solutions include use of intelligent video so people can move around freely in their workspace and still be available in meetings, as well as real-time meeting transcription and automated debriefs.An AI tool, dubbed People Insights, is also providing individuals and teams with analytics around personal and collective work practices.“This means staff can make better use of their time and take care of their peers,” says Barozzi. “The 21st-century world of work is about connecting people to people, wherever they are, safely and securely. Productivity is no longer a sole matter of efficiency, it’s increasingly achieved through inclusive collaboration, adaptability to unforeseen change and the effective leverage of collective strengths. AI is helping our teams in all these regards.”With most jobs set to involve some form of AI by 2025, he stresses education is key to ensuring staff are comfortable with these types of technologies, rather than fearful of them.Cisco’s standing as a tech firm means its people are largely open to being early adopters, but his advice to other businesses is clear. “Fears are real, so first of all we have to treat them with empathy. We need to be transparent and clear about the opportunities, while not underestimating the risks and challenges,” says Barozzi.
“It’s time to move beyond the paralysing utopia-dystopia dichotomy: as always the future is ours to shape. Digital has already turned from a tool to the environment where our lives happen. Humans and artificial agents will increasingly work together, enhancing and amplifying each other’s capabilities.”

How AI helped Publicis save 2000 jobs
In the immediate months after Covid-19, Publicis Groupe’s revenues declined by 13%. The French advertising network, which owns agencies such as Saatchi&Saatchi, quickly implemented a €500m cost-cutting drive that included a recruitment freeze, elimination of freelance work and cuts to general expenses.
As the business considered the impact of the pandemic on its workforce, however, AI emerged as an unlikely saviour. Its Marcel management tool, aimed at reinventing how the agency communicates internally, was launched in 2018, but in the crisis has truly come into its own.
“We woke up one day and instead of having 80,000 employees we had 80,000 offices,” says Carla Serrano, chief strategy officer of Publicis Groupe. She reveals that Marcel’s global roll-out was accelerated as the company realised the importance of connecting staff with relevant briefs and each other. “We didn’t know it would end up being the saviour of so many people’s jobs,” she says.
The key driver was Marcel’s ‘Gigs’ function. Pre-pandemic it hosted an internal job mobility platform that allowed people to change agencies, move to different markets and stretch their skillset. Amid the crisis, Gigs pivoted to use algorithms to match individuals with briefs based on their skillset and allocating resource to clients where it was most needed.
Key to its has been educating staff on the platform and ensuring the digital experience runs smoothly. Publicis design teams have focused on making the platform as “digestible and personalised” as possible, with work ongoing around the user experience.
Prior to 2020, Serrano admits she had reservations about AI’s impact on the workforce, but is now “bullish” about the benefits it can bring. “It’s immensely benefited our people and culture, as well as learning and discovery. We can use AI for good. There are things we need to be cautious of – like privacy or bias – but we’re certainly learning a lot more about it.”

AI must be used to benefit workers – not as a means to downgrade jobs and pay

We are at a crucial moment in what has become widely known as the fourth industrial revolution. Artificial intelligence is already being used to carry out many human tasks and the pace of change has been turbo-charged by the coronavirus pandemic. AI-powered tools are increasingly being used to manage people who are working remotely. But few of us realise the extent to which AI is being used by employers to make important decisions about people at work. We need to seize this moment to make sure that AI is used to benefit workers – not simply as another means to downgrade jobs and pay.
More and more, AI is making life-changing decisions, like who gets a job, who gets paid what salary and who gets made redundant. And when these decisions are unfair, discriminatory or unsafe, this has huge consequences for people’s lives. But workers tell us that they are often unaware of AI being used in this way, that it’s difficult to challenge decisions and how they feel constantly scrutinised. Yet AI technology is being rolled out at work too fast for employment law to catch up. We believe society and policymakers now have a choice to make about whether we put human values at the heart of this technological revolution, or whether we allow commercial interests alone to drive developments. What we choose to do now matters to all of us.
What should we do? The TUC aims to seize this moment in the AI revolution to put human interests at the heart of technological developments, and to ensure that workers benefit from the opportunities offered by AI. Today, we have published a short manifesto that sets out the values employers, technologists and political parties should adopt to ensure that technology at work benefits all. Alongside these values, we make a series of proposals, including reform to the law, based on recommendations made by leading employment lawyers Robin Allen QC and Dee Masters and TUC research.
The importance of collective bargaining is a key principle that underpins our manifesto. Some of our proposals are non-negotiable red lines that we believe are critical to ensuring dignity at work: AI should only be used to make important decisions about people if these decisions are easy to explain and understand; no unlawful discriminatory decisions should be made using technology; everyone at work should have a say in deciding whether AI is introduced to make important decisions about people at work; it should be clear when AI systems are being used at work; and there should be enough information available to people at work and job applicants to satisfy them that the technology is being used fairly.
To secure our red lines, we propose a series of amendments to data protection, employment and equality legislation, as well as better guidance on how to avoid AI-based discrimination, and a statutory duty to consult trade unions. But we propose increased regulation to target high-risk applications only, not harmless uses of AI at work. We do not want to inhibit innovation, but we do want to make sure that innovation benefits everyone at work. And in order to reassert human agency in the face of technological control, we propose a new right to human review of decisions made using AI, as well as a right to in-person engagement and a right to disconnect from digital devices.
The TUC is also calling on workers and trade unions to harness the power of data and AI, proposing a ground-breaking new right of “data reciprocity” whereby workers could collect and combine workplace data. This could help identify patterns in who isn’t receiving their rights and why that could assist union campaigning for better pay and benefits at work. And we highlight ways in which trade unions could help workers achieve data equality, including adopting a formal data gathering role, engaging data scientists and developing AI-powered tools.
Our vision for the future world of work is one where technology is for the benefit of everyone, and humanity is at the heart of all development and application of artificial intelligence at work. You can join us in making this vision a reality by signing up to the values and proposals in our manifesto.

Among the changes it is calling for is a legal right to have any “high-risk” decision reviewed by a human.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the use of AI at work stood at “a fork in the road”. “AI at work could be used to improve productivity and working lives. But it is already being used to make life-changing decisions about people at work - like who gets hired and fired.  “Without fair rules, the use of AI at work could lead to widespread discrimination and unfair treatment – especially for those in insecure work and the gig economy,” she warned. 2:06How will AI change the future jobs market?Many workplaces already use automated decision making for simple tasks. For example, Uber assigns driving jobs to its drivers automatically, by computer, and Amazon is known to use  AI monitoring systems to watch its staff in its warehouses.  And many firms already use an automated system with no human oversight in the first stage of the hiring process, to narrow the field. The computers rejecting your job application Computer says go: Taking orders from an AI bossBut as AI becomes more sophisticated, the fear is that it will be entrusted with more serious, high-risk decisions, such as analysing those performance metrics to figure out who should be first in line for promotion – or being let go. That can happen even when a human is involved, a TUC report warns, thanks to automated decision making. Human agency“A human might undertake some formal task, such as handling a document, but the human agency in the decision is minimal,” the authors write. “Sometimes the human decision making is largely illusory, for instance where a human is ultimately involved only in some formal way in the decision what to do with the output from the machine.” The TUC’s report, written with the aid of employment rights lawyers and the AI Law Consultancy, argues that the law has failed to stay abreast of quick progress in AI in recent years. The union body is calling for: An obligation on employers to consult unions on the use of “high risk” or “intrusive” AI at workThe legal right to have a human review decisionsA legal right to “switch off” from work and not be expected to answer calls or emailsChanges to UK law to protect against discrimination by algorithmDiscrimination by algorithm has been well-documented in recent years, often as an unintentional side-effect of using systems that fail to account for racial bias.One high-profile example is in facial recognition technology, which has in the past been trained to recognise white faces more easily than those from other backgrounds. Such problems led IBM to abandon some of its efforts with the technology last year, labelling it as “biased”. The TUC also pointed to recent reports of allegations from delivery drivers for Uber Eats who claimed they had been fired because the facial recognition software was unable to recognise their faces. That led to drivers with 100% ratings and thousands of deliveries under their belts being fired for failing to complete an ID check, the affected drivers claimed. Uber denies this, saying a human review is always involved before it drops drivers from its platform. 'Exceptionally dangerous'The authors of the report for the TUC, Robin Allen and Dee Masters from Cloisters law firm, said while AI could be beneficial, “used in the wrong way it can be exceptionally dangerous”. “Already important decisions are being made by machines,” the pair said in a joint statement. “Accountability, transparency and accuracy need to be guaranteed by the legal system through the carefully crafted legal reforms we propose. There are clear red lines, which must not be crossed if work is not to become dehumanised.”Computer says go: Taking orders from an AI bossThe computers rejecting your job applicationWill Covid-19 accelerate the use of robots at work?The algorithms that make decisions about your lifeFacial recognitionTrades Union CongressGig economyArtificial intelligenceEmployment",,AI at work: Staff 'hired and fired by algorithm',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CA1B/production/_117693715_56515827.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of us hadn’t even heard of Zoom until the crisis hit - now that we’re experts we sorely miss meeting colleagues face-to-face.

But the huge growth in remote working is not the only technological shift we have witnessed during Covid-19. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) at work has massively accelerated too – albeit under the radar.

This pandemic has transformed the way millions work.  Many of us hadn’t even heard of Zoom until the crisis hit - now that we’re experts we sorely miss meeting colleagues face-to-face.

But the huge growth in remote working is not the only technological shift we have witnessed during Covid-19. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) at work has massively accelerated too – albeit under the radar.



This is not a niche issue. AI is increasingly making life-changing decisions about our working lives - like who gets hired, how much workers are paid, and crucially who is made redundant from their job.
But as advances in technology gather pace, UK employment law is failing to keep up.
This should concern us all.
The TUC has today published a 100 page legal opinion from leading employment rights lawyers Robin Allen QC and Dee Masters from the AI Law Consultancy.

New Labour MPs To Face Immediate Pressure Over Two-Child Cap

Both are hugely respected practitioners in their field and their message to government and policymakers is clear.
Unless urgent new legal protections are put in place, workings will become increasingly and powerless to challenge “inhuman” forms of AI performance management. We are already seeing examples of this happening – especially in the gig economy.

Put bluntly, there needs to be far more transparency over how AI is being used at work.

 






Put bluntly, there needs to be far more transparency over how AI is being used at work.
TUC research published in November revealed that fewer than one in three (31 per cent) workers are consulted when any new forms of technology are introduced. 
And six in ten (60 per cent) said that unless carefully regulated, AI could increase unfair treatment in the workplace. 
That is why the TUC has today issued a joint call to tech companies, employers and ministers to work with us on a new set legal reforms for the ethical use of AI at work. 
These reforms should include: 

a legal duty on employers to consult trade unions on the use of high risk and intrusive forms of AI in the workplace. 
A legal right for all workers to have a human review of decisions made by AI systems so they can challenge decisions that are unfair and discriminatory. 
Amendments to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and Equality Act to guard against discrimination by algorithm. 
A legal right to ""switch off"" from work so workers can have proper downtime in their lives. 

None of these calls are a roadblock to innovation. But they will provide much-needed protection for workers.
As legal experts Robin Allen and Dee Masters sum up neatly: “Used properly, AI can change the world of work for good. But used in the wrong way it can be exceptionally dangerous. 
“There are currently huge gaps in the law when it comes to regulating AI at work. They must be quickly plugged quickly to stop workers from being discriminated against and mistreated.”
The TUC feels the same. Which is why, in addition to today’s legal report, we are publishing a short manifesto on the fair and transparent use of AI at work.
We hope all political parties sign up to the values and principles it enshrines.
Make no mistake. AI can be harnessed to transform working lives for the better.
But without proper regulation, accountability and transparency, we risk it being used to set punishing targets, rob workers of human connection and deny them dignity at work.

We are at a fork in the road on workplace AI technology. It’s vital that we pick the right path.

He’d been hired to work as a software programmer. One day not long after he started, he was having lunch with several studio veterans of the 1960s and ’70s, the pre-computer era of music recording when songs were captured on a single piece of tape. To make conversation, Clarke asked a seemingly innocent question: Could you take a tape from the days before multitrack recording and isolate the individual instruments? Could you pull it apart?The engineers shot him down. It turned into “several hours of the ins and outs of why it’s not possible,” Clarke remembers. You could perform a bit of sonic trickery to transform a song from one-channel mono to two-channel stereo, but that didn’t interest him. Clarke was seeking something more exacting: a way to pick apart a song so a listener could hear just one element at a time. Maybe just the guitar, maybe the drums, maybe the singer.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENT“I kept saying to them that if the human ear can do it, we can write software to do it as well,” he says. To him, this was a challenge. “I’m from New Zealand. We love proving people wrong.”Trending NowWhere the Sounds From the World's Favorite Movies Are BornThe challenge dropped him at the leading edge of a field known as upmixing, in which software and audio engineers work together to transform old recordings in ways that were once unthinkable. Using machine learning, engineers have made inroads into “demixing” the voices and instruments on recordings into completely separate component tracks, often known as stems. Isolating the components of songs is a surprisingly hard problem—more like unswirling paint than using a pair of scissors. But once engineers have stems, they can take the isolated tracks and “upmix” them into something new and perhaps improved. They might enhance a muffled drum track on an old recording, produce an a capella version of a song, or do the opposite and remove a song’s vocals so it can be used as background in a TV show or movie.As an Abbey Road employee, it was only natural that Clarke would soon focus his experimentation on Beatles songs. But he wasn’t the only one trying to pull apart old music. Around the world, other audio aficionados were tackling the same challenge with their own favorite tracks—and converging on some of the same methods. In the years since Clarke’s fateful lunchtime chat, the number of apps and tools for splitting songs has exploded, as has the community of academics and enthusiasts that surround the practice. For creators of sample-based music, demixing is conceivably the greatest sonic invention since the digital sampler that fueled the explosion of hip hop four decades ago. For karaoke fans, it’s a game changer. For the people (or private equity firms) who own the rights to classic but inferior recordings—or enthusiasts willing to wade into legal gray areas—upmixing presents a whole new way to hear the past. After decades of slow advancement, deep learning has now sent both technologies into overdrive. The uncanny valley is alive with the sound of music.Listen to the full story here or on the Curio app.
New Old SoundsTwo decades ago, one of the first people to experiment with demixing was Christopher Kissel, a professional electronics test engineer from Long Island. Kissel didn’t have easy access to a recording studio. But he was a lifelong music fan, and he dreamed of making old tracks sound new.Until the 1960s, almost all popular music was recorded and listened to monaurally—all the instrumental and vocal parts were recorded onto a single track of tape and played back through a single speaker. Once a song was on tape, it was basically finished. But Kissel had an inkling that it might be possible to update old mono recordings in a profound way.In 2000 he purchased his first Mac for the express purpose of transforming single-track pop songs from the ’50s and ’60s into two-channel stereo versions fit for headphones or properly separated speakers. “Compared to mono, stereo sounds more lifelike and allows you to more viscerally hear and appreciate the interplay between the musicians,” he says. Most listeners probably prefer their music on two speakers (or headphones), and Kissel cared enough to try forcing the old recordings into stereo.Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDThe first night with his new Mac, Kissel used floppy disks to install an early digital audio workstation called sonicWORX. It was the only software capable of running Pandora Realtime, a plug-in that could selectively boost the volume of vocals on recordings. “It was very advanced for its time,” Kissel says. He wanted to see if the tool could do something more interesting. He loaded up Miss Toni Fisher’s 1959 hit “The Big Hurt” and attempted to pull it apart.AdvertisementTinkering with the song using sonicWORX’s waveform visualizer and settings, Kissel says, he was ""able to separate the lead vocal, backing vocals, and strings and move them to the right side, and the rest of the backing instrumentation to the left.” It was crude and a little glitchy, but the effect was powerful. “It was quite thrilling to hear,” he says. Decades later, Kissel remains blown away by that first experience.He experimented with more ’50s and ’60s classics, including the Del Vikings’ “Whispering Bells,” Johnny Otis’ “Willie and the Hand Jive,” and—perhaps most appropriately—the Tornados’ “Telstar,” a futuristic DIY wonder produced and composed by the influential sound engineer Joe Meek.Kissel immersed himself in the developing fields of demixing and upmixing—though the names came later—by moderating forums and maintaining a website chronicling advances in the disciplines. He started playing around with a technique called spectral editing, which allowed people to treat sound as a visual object. Load a song into a spectral editor and you can see all of the recording’s many frequencies, represented as colorful peaks and valleys, laid out on a graph. At the time, audio engineers employed spectral editing to remove unwanted noise in a recording, but an intrepid user could also zone in on specific frequencies of an audio track and pluck them out. When a freeware spectral editing tool called Frequency popped up, Kissel decided to try it out.He spent about 60 hours using Frequency to craft an upmix of the 1951 mono R&B hit “The Glory of Love,” by the vocal group the Five Keys, using the app to carefully target the separate vocalists and spread their voices across the stereo spectrum. With a final polish by disco legend Tom Moulton, Kissel’s friend, it became one of the first spectrally edited upmixes to get released on a commercial album, in 2005. Several labels soon began releasing collections of upmixed mono-to-stereo hits, sometimes licensed, sometimes in the public domain, and sometimes in between.French software company Audionamix started building professional demixing software to help users pull apart tracks on their own, which made this suite of techniques more accessible. In 2007 the company unveiled a major achievement in upmixing, bringing vintage Édith Piaf recordings from mono to theater-ready surround sound for the biopic La Vie en Rose. In 2009, the company opened a Hollywood office to continue courting film, television, and commercial work.Other times, their projects involved focused demixing. When the British online lending company Sunny wanted to use the song “Sunny” by late American R&B singer Bobby Hebb in a commercial, it found that one of the song’s original vocals interrupted the ad’s narration. With Audionamix’s help, the pesky vocals got zapped from existence. The French company also offers a service—originally called “music disassociation,” but now rebranded slightly less ominously as “music removal”—in which old television series and movies are scrubbed of music that might be too expensive to license, so they can be released in the latest format, be it DVD or streaming. According to Nicolas Cattaneo, a researcher at Audionamix, “This is the first thing that began to be really usable,” at least commercially. (Scholars studying music in old films and television shows should probably rely on releases from before 2009 or so if they want to make sure they’re hearing the original soundtracks.)Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDAudioSourceRE and Audionamix’s Xtrax Stems are among the first consumer-facing software options for automated demixing. Feed a song into Xtrax, for example, and the software spits out tracks for vocals, bass, drums, and “other,” that last term doing heavy lifting for the range of sounds heard in most music. Eventually, perhaps, a one-size-fits-all application will truly and instantly demix a recording in full; until then, it’s one track at a time, and it’s turning into an art form of its own.What the Ear Can HearAt Abbey Road, James Clarke began to chip away at his demixing project in earnest around 2010. In his research, he came across a paper written in the ’70s on a technique used to break video signals into component images, such as faces and backgrounds. The paper reminded him of his time as a master’s student in physics, working with spectrograms that show the changing frequencies of a signal over time.Spectrograms could visualize signals, but the technique described in the paper—called non-negative matrix factorization—was a way of processing the information. If this new technique worked for video signals, it could work for audio signals too, Clarke thought. “I started looking at how instruments made up a spectrogram,” he says. “I could start to recognize, ‘That’s what a drum looks like, that looks like a vocal, that looks like a bass guitar.’” About a year later, he produced a piece of software that could do a convincing job of breaking apart audio by its frequencies. His first big breakthrough can be heard on the 2016 remaster of the Beatles’ Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the band’s sole official live album. The original LP, released in 1977, is hard to listen to because of the high-pitched shrieks of the crowd.After unsuccessfully trying to reduce the noise of the crowd, Clarke finally had a “serendipity moment.” Rather than treating the howling fans as noise in the signal that needed to be scrubbed out, he decided to model the fans as another instrument in the mix. By identifying the crowd as its own individual voice, Clarke was able to tame the Beatlemaniacs, isolating them and moving them to the background. That, then, moved the four musicians to the sonic foreground.Clarke became a go-to industry expert on upmixing. He helped rescue the 38-CD Grammy-nominated Woodstock–Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive, which aimed to assemble every single performance from the 1969 mega-festival. (Disclosure: I contributed liner notes to the set.) At one point during some of the festival’s heaviest rain, sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar took to the stage. The biggest problem with the recording of the performance wasn’t the rain, however, but that Shankar’s then-producer absconded with the multitrack tapes. After listening to them back in the studio, Shankar deemed them unusable and released a faked-in-the-studio At the Woodstock Festival LP instead, with not a note from Woodstock itself. The original festival multitracks disappeared long ago, leaving future reissue producers nothing but a damaged-sounding mono recording off the concert soundboard.Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDUsing only this monaural recording, Clarke was able to separate the sitar master’s instrument from the rain, the sonic crud, and the tabla player sitting a few feet away. The result was “both completely authentic and accurate,” with bits of ambiance still in the mix, says the box set’s coproducer, Andy Zax.“The possibilities upmixing gives us to reclaim the unreclaimable are really exciting,” Zax says. Some might see the technique as akin to colorizing classic black-and-white movies. “There’s always that tension. You want to be reconstructive, and you don’t really want to impose your will on it. So that's the challenge.”Heading for the Deep EndAround the time Clarke finished working on the Beatles’ Hollywood Bowl project, he and other researchers were coming up against a wall. Their techniques could handle fairly simple patterns, but they couldn’t keep up with instruments with lots of vibrato—the subtle changes in pitch that characterize some instruments and the human voice. The engineers realized they needed a new approach. “That’s what led toward deep learning,” says Derry Fitzgerald, the founder and chief technology officer of AudioSourceRE, a music software company.Fitzgerald was a lifelong Beach Boys fan; some of the mono-to-stereo upmixes he did of their work, for the fun of it, got tapped for official releases starting in 2012. Like Clarke, Fitzgerald had found his way to non-negative matrix factorization. And, like Clarke, he’d reached the limits of what he could with it. “It got to a point where the amount of hours I spent tweaking the code was very, very time-consuming,” he says. “I thought there had to be a better way.”The WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceSupersmart algorithms won't take all the jobs, But they are learning faster than ever, doing everything from medical diagnostics to serving up ads.By Tom SimoniteThe nearly parallel move to AI by Fitzgerald, James Clarke, and others echoed Clarke’s original instinct that if the human ear can naturally separate the sounds of instruments from one another, it should also be possible to model that same separation by machine. “I started researching deep learning to get more of a neural network approach to it,” Clarke says.He started experimenting with a specific goal in mind: pulling out George Harrison’s guitar from the early Beatles hit “She Loves You.” On the original recording, the instruments and vocals were all laid on a single track, which makes it nearly impossible to manipulate.Clarke started building an algorithm and trained it on every version of the song he could find—radio sessions, live versions, even renditions by tribute bands. “There were quite a few different ones, so plenty of examples to understand how the track should sound,” Clarke says. Using spectrograms, he now also knew how the track should look. The algorithm broke up the audio into individual stems, one for each instrument, but Clarke only had eyes and ears for Harrison’s Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentleman guitar.Over nine months, Clarke sifted through the guitar part a few seconds at a time, virtually hand-cleaning the track phrase by phrase. He listened for stray audio artifacts from other instruments and used spectral editing software to find and eliminate them. For the final step, he set out to recapture the track’s original ambience. That part was easy. As an Abbey Road employee, he could book time in the vaunted Studio Two, where “She Loves You” was originally recorded. He played his track into the room through the in-house speakers and recorded it anew, to capture some of the subtleties of the room’s well-preserved acoustics. In August 2018, Clarke showed off his AI demixing work publicly for the first time.Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDThe occasion was a sold-out lecture series that offered a rare chance for fans to step inside Studio Two, where the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and plenty of others recorded. Visitors were invited to re-create the clattering E-major chord that ends “A Day in the Life” by playing the studio’s pianos at the same time. The audience also received a glimpse of the future.In front of a packed audience, Clarke played the Beatles’ original 1963 recording of “She Loves You.” Then, to pin-drop silence, he played what should have been impossible: the same recording with everything removed except for Harrison’s guitar.Three days later, excerpts of Clarke’s demo made their way onto the web. The truthers quickly descended. Disbelieving audiophiles started trashing Clarke in online forums. “I think it’s a shame that the demonstration to show how good this new technology is happens to be false,” a user who went by Beatlebug wrote.“It's kind of sad that Abbey Road has to mislead people like that,” RingoStarr39 posted in the same thread.Beatlebug, RingoStarr39, and others insisted that the audio segment in Clarke’s lecture was a more easy-to-isolate bit from a later German version of the song, “Sie Liebt Dich,” recorded in stereo. They insisted that James Clarke was a charlatan.But Clarke had merely demonstrated a proof of concept. Perfecting Harrison’s guitar track of “She Loves You” took him approximately 200 hours. He hadn’t even attempted to isolate John Lennon’s guitar. “Not a viable option for projects,” he admits. It was far from automated. But it could be done. And it would be.Up, Up, and AwayThe dam broke fully when French streaming service Deezer released an open source code library called Spleeter that allowed both casual and professional programmers to build tools for demixing and upmixing. Anybody comfortable enough with their computer’s command line interface could download and install software from Github, select an audio file of their favorite song, and generate their own set of isolated stems. People started putting the code library to creative use. When tech blogger Andy Baio played around with it, he was delighted to discover how easy it now was to create mashups, such as when he crossed the Friends theme and Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” “Nobody should have this kind of power,” he tweeted.The first generation of users are demixing and upmixing in creative ways. Some musicians are removing one instrument from a song to create tracks they can practice along to or to generate source material for new music. Podcast producers are cleaning up dialog recorded in noisy environments. Hobbyists are using iPad apps and free sites to create their own mixes or make any song karaoke-ready. Several streaming services in Japan now offer vocal removal in officially licensed form, including Spotify’s SingAlong, where listeners can turn down a song’s vocals, and Line Music, which promises real-time source separation.Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDAlong with established players (Audionamix, James Clarke), the newest company offering professional demixing services is the California-based startup Audioshake.The company will soon launch a service where music rights holders—both musicians and labels—can upload their tracks to the cloud and, within minutes, download high-quality stems ready for licensing in film, broadcasting, video games, and elsewhere. Audioshake claims best-in-field ratings for drums, bass, and vocals, according to benchmarks established by the Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign, an organization made up of audio researchers who track the progress of demixing techniques.But Audioshake is also the first company to figure out how to automatically isolate guitars—or, more precisely, a single guitar. The company is tight-lipped about how it achieved this. “We refined the architecture of our deep-learning network to be specially tailored to the harmonics and timbre of the guitar,” says company AI researcher Fabian-Robert Stöter. Basically, when a user uploads a track to Audioshake, a layer in the company’s algorithm converts the song’s waveform into a numerical representation that makes it easier for the AI model to figure out where a guitar ends and everything else begins.Sign Up TodaySign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.To see it work, I was invited to upload some songs. Within a few minutes, the company’s software was able to pull apart a track of a rock band playing in guitar-bass-drums-vocals power trio format. A track by Talking Heads’ original lineup came back with David Byrne’s 12-string acoustic guitar separated (with minimal artifacts) alongside tracks of Tina Weymouth’s bass and Chris Frantz’s drums. It works equally well on other songs in that exact guitar/bass/drums/vocals configuration. But music is huge, and the power trio format is a tight set of parameters.Outside those parameters is the unclaimed frontier of demixing. The original recording of “She Loves You” comes back from Audioshake with Lennon's and Harrison’s guitars sounding like jangling ghosts. James Clarke’s manual work still can’t be matched by a machine. That said, Audioshake does what couldn’t be done only a few years ago, pointing to a future in which machines will recognize more instruments. They might be unbreachable frontiers. For virtually all producers since the ’60s, a recording studio has been the place to combine unusual instruments and generate wondrous new sounds (and literal overtones) explicitly designed to blend together in the listener’s ears.But what if the artifacts turn out to be art? If a demixing attempt gone awry sounds cool to the right producer, it might become the basis for fantastic new music. Think Cher turning Auto-Tune into a pop trend with “Believe.” As archival producer Andy Zax put it, “Some 16-year-old making hip hop records on a PlayStation is going to figure out some genius use of this thing and create a sound world we've never heard before.”For now, plenty of experimentation is happening in far-flung fan forums, with unofficial upmixes of many equally unofficial recordings. Some fans have been exploring a subgenre that might be called upfakes, fusing, say, George Harrison’s original 1968 demo for “Sour Milk Sea”' with the backing track from a more recent recording by another musician. (Fans are understandably jittery about copyright claims and generally only post their work with quickly expiring links.)As for Clarke, he is still working on the exact AI methodology to pull apart a mono Beatles vocal track. He’s also started an independent company called Audio Research Group to work as demixer-for-hire. Lately he’s been helping to create a set of tracks for a band that lost all its master tapes and has only its LPs.Most PopularGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDGearThe Top 5 Prime Day Apple Deals on Our Favorite GadgetsBy Brenda Stolyar, WIREDGearThe Top 8 Prime Day Laptop Deals for Work and PlayBy Scott Gilbertson, WIREDGearThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersBy Simon Hill, WIREDEven to Clarke, though, many recordings can’t be pulled apart, especially if the instruments are close in frequency or a recording is particularly compressed, as on a radio broadcast or many audience-sourced live recordings. He once tried to demix a 1991 R.E.M. tape from London. “There’s just not enough from a spectral point of view, it’s so squashed,” Clarke says. “You get really fuzzy results.” For now, some blurry aspects of the past are going to stay blurry. But some are going to sound brighter than ever.Let us know what you think about this article.

After decades of slow advancement, deep learning has now sent both technologies into overdrive. The uncanny valley is alive with the sound of music.
New Old Sounds
Two decades ago, one of the first people to experiment with demixing was Christopher Kissel, a professional electronics test engineer from Long Island. Kissel didn’t have easy access to a recording studio. But he was a lifelong music fan, and he dreamed of making old tracks sound new.
Until the 1960s, almost all popular music was recorded and listened to monaurally—all the instrumental and vocal parts were recorded onto a single track of tape and played back through a single speaker. Once a song was on tape, it was basically finished. But Kissel had an inkling that it might be possible to update old mono recordings in a profound way.
In 2000 he purchased his first Mac for the express purpose of transforming single-track pop songs from the ’50s and ’60s into two-channel stereo versions fit for headphones or properly separated speakers. “Compared to mono, stereo sounds more lifelike and allows you to more viscerally hear and appreciate the interplay between the musicians,” he says. Most listeners probably prefer their music on two speakers (or headphones), and Kissel cared enough to try forcing the old recordings into stereo.
The first night with his new Mac, Kissel used floppy disks to install an early digital audio workstation called sonicWORX. It was the only software capable of running Pandora Realtime, a plug-in that could selectively boost the volume of vocals on recordings. “It was very advanced for its time,” Kissel says. He wanted to see if the tool could do something more interesting. He loaded up Miss Toni Fisher’s 1959 hit “The Big Hurt” and attempted to pull it apart.
Tinkering with the song using sonicWORX’s waveform visualizer and settings, Kissel says, he was ""able to separate the lead vocal, backing vocals, and strings and move them to the right side, and the rest of the backing instrumentation to the left.” It was crude and a little glitchy, but the effect was powerful. “It was quite thrilling to hear,” he says. Decades later, Kissel remains blown away by that first experience.
He experimented with more ’50s and ’60s classics, including the Del Vikings’ “Whispering Bells,” Johnny Otis’ “Willie and the Hand Jive,” and—perhaps most appropriately—the Tornados’ “Telstar,” a futuristic DIY wonder produced and composed by the influential sound engineer Joe Meek.
Kissel immersed himself in the developing fields of demixing and upmixing—though the names came later—by moderating forums and maintaining a website chronicling advances in the disciplines. He started playing around with a technique called spectral editing, which allowed people to treat sound as a visual object. Load a song into a spectral editor and you can see all of the recording’s many frequencies, represented as colorful peaks and valleys, laid out on a graph. At the time, audio engineers employed spectral editing to remove unwanted noise in a recording, but an intrepid user could also zone in on specific frequencies of an audio track and pluck them out. When a freeware spectral editing tool called Frequency popped up, Kissel decided to try it out.
He spent about 60 hours using Frequency to craft an upmix of the 1951 mono R&B hit “The Glory of Love,” by the vocal group the Five Keys, using the app to carefully target the separate vocalists and spread their voices across the stereo spectrum. With a final polish by disco legend Tom Moulton, Kissel’s friend, it became one of the first spectrally edited upmixes to get released on a commercial album, in 2005. Several labels soon began releasing collections of upmixed mono-to-stereo hits, sometimes licensed, sometimes in the public domain, and sometimes in between.
French software company Audionamix started building professional demixing software to help users pull apart tracks on their own, which made this suite of techniques more accessible. In 2007 the company unveiled a major achievement in upmixing, bringing vintage Édith Piaf recordings from mono to theater-ready surround sound for the biopic La Vie en Rose. In 2009, the company opened a Hollywood office to continue courting film, television, and commercial work.
Other times, their projects involved focused demixing. When the British online lending company Sunny wanted to use the song “Sunny” by late American R&B singer Bobby Hebb in a commercial, it found that one of the song’s original vocals interrupted the ad’s narration. With Audionamix’s help, the pesky vocals got zapped from existence. The French company also offers a service—originally called “music disassociation,” but now rebranded slightly less ominously as “music removal”—in which old television series and movies are scrubbed of music that might be too expensive to license, so they can be released in the latest format, be it DVD or streaming. According to Nicolas Cattaneo, a researcher at Audionamix, “This is the first thing that began to be really usable,” at least commercially. (Scholars studying music in old films and television shows should probably rely on releases from before 2009 or so if they want to make sure they’re hearing the original soundtracks.)
AudioSourceRE and Audionamix’s Xtrax Stems are among the first consumer-facing software options for automated demixing. Feed a song into Xtrax, for example, and the software spits out tracks for vocals, bass, drums, and “other,” that last term doing heavy lifting for the range of sounds heard in most music. Eventually, perhaps, a one-size-fits-all application will truly and instantly demix a recording in full; until then, it’s one track at a time, and it’s turning into an art form of its own.
What the Ear Can Hear
At Abbey Road, James Clarke began to chip away at his demixing project in earnest around 2010. In his research, he came across a paper written in the ’70s on a technique used to break video signals into component images, such as faces and backgrounds. The paper reminded him of his time as a master’s student in physics, working with spectrograms that show the changing frequencies of a signal over time.
Spectrograms could visualize signals, but the technique described in the paper—called non-negative matrix factorization—was a way of processing the information. If this new technique worked for video signals, it could work for audio signals too, Clarke thought. “I started looking at how instruments made up a spectrogram,” he says. “I could start to recognize, ‘That’s what a drum looks like, that looks like a vocal, that looks like a bass guitar.’” About a year later, he produced a piece of software that could do a convincing job of breaking apart audio by its frequencies. His first big breakthrough can be heard on the 2016 remaster of the Beatles’ Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the band’s sole official live album. The original LP, released in 1977, is hard to listen to because of the high-pitched shrieks of the crowd.
After unsuccessfully trying to reduce the noise of the crowd, Clarke finally had a “serendipity moment.” Rather than treating the howling fans as noise in the signal that needed to be scrubbed out, he decided to model the fans as another instrument in the mix. By identifying the crowd as its own individual voice, Clarke was able to tame the Beatlemaniacs, isolating them and moving them to the background. That, then, moved the four musicians to the sonic foreground.
Clarke became a go-to industry expert on upmixing. He helped rescue the 38-CD Grammy-nominated Woodstock–Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive, which aimed to assemble every single performance from the 1969 mega-festival. (Disclosure: I contributed liner notes to the set.) At one point during some of the festival’s heaviest rain, sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar took to the stage. The biggest problem with the recording of the performance wasn’t the rain, however, but that Shankar’s then-producer absconded with the multitrack tapes. After listening to them back in the studio, Shankar deemed them unusable and released a faked-in-the-studio At the Woodstock Festival LP instead, with not a note from Woodstock itself. The original festival multitracks disappeared long ago, leaving future reissue producers nothing but a damaged-sounding mono recording off the concert soundboard.
Using only this monaural recording, Clarke was able to separate the sitar master’s instrument from the rain, the sonic crud, and the tabla player sitting a few feet away. The result was “both completely authentic and accurate,” with bits of ambiance still in the mix, says the box set’s coproducer, Andy Zax.
“The possibilities upmixing gives us to reclaim the unreclaimable are really exciting,” Zax says. Some might see the technique as akin to colorizing classic black-and-white movies. “There’s always that tension. You want to be reconstructive, and you don’t really want to impose your will on it. So that's the challenge.”
Heading for the Deep End
Around the time Clarke finished working on the Beatles’ Hollywood Bowl project, he and other researchers were coming up against a wall. Their techniques could handle fairly simple patterns, but they couldn’t keep up with instruments with lots of vibrato—the subtle changes in pitch that characterize some instruments and the human voice. The engineers realized they needed a new approach. “That’s what led toward deep learning,” says Derry Fitzgerald, the founder and chief technology officer of AudioSourceRE, a music software company.
Fitzgerald was a lifelong Beach Boys fan; some of the mono-to-stereo upmixes he did of their work, for the fun of it, got tapped for official releases starting in 2012. Like Clarke, Fitzgerald had found his way to non-negative matrix factorization. And, like Clarke, he’d reached the limits of what he could with it. “It got to a point where the amount of hours I spent tweaking the code was very, very time-consuming,” he says. “I thought there had to be a better way.”
The nearly parallel move to AI by Fitzgerald, James Clarke, and others echoed Clarke’s original instinct that if the human ear can naturally separate the sounds of instruments from one another, it should also be possible to model that same separation by machine. “I started researching deep learning to get more of a neural network approach to it,” Clarke says.
He started experimenting with a specific goal in mind: pulling out George Harrison’s guitar from the early Beatles hit “She Loves You.” On the original recording, the instruments and vocals were all laid on a single track, which makes it nearly impossible to manipulate.
Clarke started building an algorithm and trained it on every version of the song he could find—radio sessions, live versions, even renditions by tribute bands. “There were quite a few different ones, so plenty of examples to understand how the track should sound,” Clarke says. Using spectrograms, he now also knew how the track should look. The algorithm broke up the audio into individual stems, one for each instrument, but Clarke only had eyes and ears for Harrison’s Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentleman guitar.
Over nine months, Clarke sifted through the guitar part a few seconds at a time, virtually hand-cleaning the track phrase by phrase. He listened for stray audio artifacts from other instruments and used spectral editing software to find and eliminate them. For the final step, he set out to recapture the track’s original ambience. That part was easy. As an Abbey Road employee, he could book time in the vaunted Studio Two, where “She Loves You” was originally recorded. He played his track into the room through the in-house speakers and recorded it anew, to capture some of the subtleties of the room’s well-preserved acoustics. In August 2018, Clarke showed off his AI demixing work publicly for the first time.
The occasion was a sold-out lecture series that offered a rare chance for fans to step inside Studio Two, where the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and plenty of others recorded. Visitors were invited to re-create the clattering E-major chord that ends “A Day in the Life” by playing the studio’s pianos at the same time. The audience also received a glimpse of the future.
In front of a packed audience, Clarke played the Beatles’ original 1963 recording of “She Loves You.” Then, to pin-drop silence, he played what should have been impossible: the same recording with everything removed except for Harrison’s guitar.
Three days later, excerpts of Clarke’s demo made their way onto the web. The truthers quickly descended. Disbelieving audiophiles started trashing Clarke in online forums. “I think it’s a shame that the demonstration to show how good this new technology is happens to be false,” a user who went by Beatlebug wrote.
“It's kind of sad that Abbey Road has to mislead people like that,” RingoStarr39 posted in the same thread.
Beatlebug, RingoStarr39, and others insisted that the audio segment in Clarke’s lecture was a more easy-to-isolate bit from a later German version of the song, “Sie Liebt Dich,” recorded in stereo. They insisted that James Clarke was a charlatan.
But Clarke had merely demonstrated a proof of concept. Perfecting Harrison’s guitar track of “She Loves You” took him approximately 200 hours. He hadn’t even attempted to isolate John Lennon’s guitar. “Not a viable option for projects,” he admits. It was far from automated. But it could be done. And it would be.
Up, Up, and Away
The dam broke fully when French streaming service Deezer released an open source code library called Spleeter that allowed both casual and professional programmers to build tools for demixing and upmixing. Anybody comfortable enough with their computer’s command line interface could download and install software from Github, select an audio file of their favorite song, and generate their own set of isolated stems. People started putting the code library to creative use. When tech blogger Andy Baio played around with it, he was delighted to discover how easy it now was to create mashups, such as when he crossed the Friends theme and Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” “Nobody should have this kind of power,” he tweeted.
The first generation of users are demixing and upmixing in creative ways. Some musicians are removing one instrument from a song to create tracks they can practice along to or to generate source material for new music. Podcast producers are cleaning up dialog recorded in noisy environments. Hobbyists are using iPad apps and free sites to create their own mixes or make any song karaoke-ready. Several streaming services in Japan now offer vocal removal in officially licensed form, including Spotify’s SingAlong, where listeners can turn down a song’s vocals, and Line Music, which promises real-time source separation.
Along with established players (Audionamix, James Clarke), the newest company offering professional demixing services is the California-based startup Audioshake.
The company will soon launch a service where music rights holders—both musicians and labels—can upload their tracks to the cloud and, within minutes, download high-quality stems ready for licensing in film, broadcasting, video games, and elsewhere. Audioshake claims best-in-field ratings for drums, bass, and vocals, according to benchmarks established by the Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign, an organization made up of audio researchers who track the progress of demixing techniques.
But Audioshake is also the first company to figure out how to automatically isolate guitars—or, more precisely, a single guitar. The company is tight-lipped about how it achieved this. “We refined the architecture of our deep-learning network to be specially tailored to the harmonics and timbre of the guitar,” says company AI researcher Fabian-Robert Stöter. Basically, when a user uploads a track to Audioshake, a layer in the company’s algorithm converts the song’s waveform into a numerical representation that makes it easier for the AI model to figure out where a guitar ends and everything else begins.
To see it work, I was invited to upload some songs. Within a few minutes, the company’s software was able to pull apart a track of a rock band playing in guitar-bass-drums-vocals power trio format. A track by Talking Heads’ original lineup came back with David Byrne’s 12-string acoustic guitar separated (with minimal artifacts) alongside tracks of Tina Weymouth’s bass and Chris Frantz’s drums. It works equally well on other songs in that exact guitar/bass/drums/vocals configuration. But music is huge, and the power trio format is a tight set of parameters.
Outside those parameters is the unclaimed frontier of demixing. The original recording of “She Loves You” comes back from Audioshake with Lennon's and Harrison’s guitars sounding like jangling ghosts. James Clarke’s manual work still can’t be matched by a machine. That said, Audioshake does what couldn’t be done only a few years ago, pointing to a future in which machines will recognize more instruments. They might be unbreachable frontiers. For virtually all producers since the ’60s, a recording studio has been the place to combine unusual instruments and generate wondrous new sounds (and literal overtones) explicitly designed to blend together in the listener’s ears.
But what if the artifacts turn out to be art? If a demixing attempt gone awry sounds cool to the right producer, it might become the basis for fantastic new music. Think Cher turning Auto-Tune into a pop trend with “Believe.” As archival producer Andy Zax put it, “Some 16-year-old making hip hop records on a PlayStation is going to figure out some genius use of this thing and create a sound world we've never heard before.”
For now, plenty of experimentation is happening in far-flung fan forums, with unofficial upmixes of many equally unofficial recordings. Some fans have been exploring a subgenre that might be called upfakes, fusing, say, George Harrison’s original 1968 demo for “Sour Milk Sea”' with the backing track from a more recent recording by another musician. (Fans are understandably jittery about copyright claims and generally only post their work with quickly expiring links.)
As for Clarke, he is still working on the exact AI methodology to pull apart a mono Beatles vocal track. He’s also started an independent company called Audio Research Group to work as demixer-for-hire. Lately he’s been helping to create a set of tracks for a band that lost all its master tapes and has only its LPs.
Even to Clarke, though, many recordings can’t be pulled apart, especially if the instruments are close in frequency or a recording is particularly compressed, as on a radio broadcast or many audience-sourced live recordings. He once tried to demix a 1991 R.E.M. tape from London. “There’s just not enough from a spectral point of view, it’s so squashed,” Clarke says. “You get really fuzzy results.” For now, some blurry aspects of the past are going to stay blurry. But some are going to sound brighter than ever.

Marco, you are Professor and Scientific Director at IDSIA, the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Lugano. What is your main research focus at the institute?
IDSIA has a very broad range of research interests, spanning most of Artificial Intelligence as it is understood today: machine learning, including deep learning/neural networks, control and signal processing, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, search and optimisation, and more fundamental questions in uncertainty, probability, statistics, causal inference.

To give an example, we have a 4-year Data project funded by the National Science Foundation as part of Switzerland’s National Research Programme 75 “Big Data”. In this project we deal with Gaussian processes, which can be understood as statistical neural networks, which can then provide uncertainty estimates relating to their own predictions – unlike traditional neural nets. This is very important in applications where we are evaluating risks. For example, a self-driving car needs to know whether the car’s sensors are reliably warning of a potential accident ahead rather than a a person safely crossing the street. Therefore Gaussian processes have definite advantages over traditional neural nets, but they also have one big disadvantage: they are far too slow to learn from big data. In this project we are designing powerful new algorithms for Gaussian processes that allow them to scale up to millions of data points far faster than was previously possible, opening up a huge number of potential applications for these tools. For instance, we are working at present with Meteosuisse, the Swiss meteorological body, on improving rain estimates in Switzerland by using Gaussian processes.














IDSIA is known worldwide for its Artificial Intelligence research. What different tech applications and innovations has IDSIA brought to the world? 
IDSIA is very well known for its research on optimisation algorithms – for example, in routing, supply chains and scheduling – inspired by the behaviour of ants: so-called ant-colony optimisation. This research eventually also inspired swarm robotics, where very simple robots create complex swarm behaviour through indirect communication between them, in the way ants do. Technically this process is called stigmergy.
Other than this, we have a very long history of applied projects developed with companies and numerous special innovations have been developed while working on these projects.
A pretty fashionable topic at the moment is LSTM (long short-term memory), a type of neural network invented in 1997 in a joint collaboration between IDSIA and the Technical University of Munich. This is probably the most used type of neural network today in the world, with all the big players using it, such as Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.














What are the most important recent trends in Artificial Intelligence and where do you see growth potential for AI applications?
Natural language processing has been growing a lot recently on the back of the incredible progress achieved by the use of deep learning. I am talking for instance of OpenAI's GPT3. We see numerous requests to work in this field, especially by companies in the banking and insurance sector, and in general where texts and regulations abound. There is also increasing use of AI in Industry 4.0 and the internet of things, which is growing rapidly in manufacturing industries.
More generally speaking, I think all industrial sectors and companies should be growing dramatically at this time because of AI. If that is not happening, there's a problem and we ought to understand better where that problem lies to remove possible roadblocks. In other words, my point is that AI is already ready to help and make businesses grow. It's our fault if we haven't seized the opportunity yet.














Know-how and technology transfer is an important part of your work. That sounds very attractive to companies. How do you collaborate with Swiss and international corporations?
Yes, know-how does excite companies. We usually collaborate with them through Innosuisse, the Swiss innovation agency, which funds joint work between research centres and private companies. This offers a great opportunity for companies, especially those that cannot afford to invest in innovation through applied research. These projects last typically for a year and a half and can greatly help companies to innovate.
But there are also many companies that prefer to give us a direct mandate, to speed up the work, for example. One way or the other we typically have about 20 applied projects in progress at all times. UBS, Mastercard , Novartis, Roche, Georg Fischer and Bystronic are among the companies with which we have worked or are working. 














Switzerland’s success as a business location has a lot to do with strong R&D capabilities and activities – in universities, research institutes and corporates. How would you evaluate Switzerland’s current position as a R&D knowledge hub compared to other countries? 
I can give you many objective reasons why Switzerland is very well positioned:

First and foremost, the government's annual investment in R&D as a percentage of GDP  tops the world ranking;
the quality of its polytechnics and the myriad high-profile research centres distributed all over the country;
the big private sector players, such as Roche, Novartis, UBS and ABB, invest massively in research – so that Switzerland's number of patent applications per inhabitant also tops the world ranking;
Switzerland's dense fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises that are best in class in their fields;
Switzerland's two-track education system, one more academic, the other more applied, which is regularly praised worldwide as an example of a good education system.

But most of all, for me, Switzerland owes its success to its liberal and pragmatic mentality. Bureaucracy is kept to a minimum, the State trusts its citizens, innovation is welcome and favoured, no matter where it originates. I, for example, came here from Italy as a fresh PhD graduate, knowing nobody and not yet well positioned in worldwide research. And yet I have been given freedom to do my research, and given lots of research funding. I have been able to form a large group of researchers, and eventually become scientific director of IDSIA as well as a Professor.













What would you say could be done to increase Switzerland’s attractiveness as an AI research hub? 
Sad to say, money definitely plays a role. Chief scientists in AI companies can earn several million dollars per year in the US. Postgraduate students, even without a PhD, can easily start work on a salary of $150,000. The average salary for researchers is around $350,000. Are these researchers worth that much? That’s debatable but if we want to have top AI scientists in Swiss companies we should consider the financial aspects, too, and not rely on the other benefits of being here.
We also need more aggressive, risk-taking investors. In fact, big investments are key to this process, not just public but also private investment. Look at the very big companies in AI: they are all either in the US (e.g., Amazon, Google, and Facebook) or in China (e.g., Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba). There are none in Switzerland or Europe. My feeling is that we ought to be asking ourselves why.
My own answer to this question is that what's lacking is a bit of strategic policy-making (as well as vision) that encourages companies and centres to work together to promote strong business growth in this area. That would also involve developing some infrastructure, such as a well consolidated and aggressive investor chain; support and organisation from the Cantonal and Federal government; joint tables where government, academia and big players in the industry and also in the public sector, like the Federal railways, aviation, etc., can continuously discuss means to grow/invest/innovate together. And why not have a ministry for AI? They have had one up and running in the Emirates since 2017.














Can Switzerland be an R&D hub for AI?   
There’s a big opportunity. But the AI train is moving fast and is easy to miss, despite our past successes. We have to start running now to catch it. The answer is not just to appoint new AI professors in a polytechnic. It's much more than that. The country’s system has to embrace change overall. You might ask why I am saying all this about AI and not some other field of innovation. The answer is that AI, unlike other innovation sectors, will pervade every other field. Global AI business revenues in the current decade are estimated at around 13 trillion dollars. We're talking about our future wealth and well-being.

Well, is artificial intelligence a job-killer or not? We keep hearing both sides, from projections of doom for many professions that will necessitate things such as universal basic income to help sidelined workers, to projections of countless unfilled jobs needed to build and manage AI-powered enterprises. For a worker losing his or her job to automation, knowing that an AI programming job is being created elsewhere is of little solace.


Perhaps the reality will be somewhere in between. An MIT report released at the end of last year states recent fears about AI leading to mass unemployment are unlikely to be realized. “Instead, we believe that—like all previous labor-saving technologies—AI will enable new industries to emerge, creating more new jobs than are lost to the technology,” the report’s authors, led by Thomas Malone, director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, conclude. “But we see a significant need for governments and other parts of society to help smooth this transition, especially for the individuals whose old jobs are disrupted and who cannot easily find new ones.”

The future of AI and job growth — or losses — may be nuanced, a recent report from BCG and Faethm suggests. “Though these technologies will eliminate some jobs, they will create many others,” the report’s team of authors, led by BCG’s Rainer Strack. “Governments, companies, and individuals all need to understand these shifts when they plan for the future.”

PROMOTED
What needs to be understood? For starters, “the net number of jobs lost or gained is an artificially simple metric to gauge the impact of digitization,” Strack and his co-authors state. “For example, eliminating 10 million jobs and creating 10 million new jobs would appear to have negligible impact. In fact, however, doing so would represent a huge economic disruption for the country—not to mention for the millions of people with their jobs at stake.”

There’s even a paradox in play. Computers tend to perform well in tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming to do, “but they tend to work less effectively in tasks that humans find easy to do,” the report notes. Also, in many areas, technologies “will improve the quality of work that humans do by allowing them to focus on more strategic, value-creating, and personally rewarding tasks.”

In other words, AI can’t take over many of the soft skills essential to businesses growth — initiative, intuition, passion, and ability to sell ideas and concepts. Add that to more technical abilities needed to build and maintain AI and digital environments — and keep them focused on what the business needs. “In many sectors, severe shortages of skilled workers will mean that growth in demand for talent will be unmet,” Strack and his co-authors state. “This is particularly true for computer-related occupations and jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math, since technology is fueling the rise of automation across all industries. This is why the computer and mathematics job family group is likely to suffer by far the greatest worker deficits.”

At the same time, there will also be increasing demand for jobs requiring compassionate human contact, such as health care, social services, and teaching, they add.
Along with the BCG-Faethm’s observations, it should be noted that AI cannot replicate the entrepreneurial skills that will be pulling together technology solutions and platforms to connect to the needs of markets. Humans are the innovators.
What to do? Strack and his team urge people to take charge of their professional development through lifelong learning. “Individuals will have to take greater responsibility for their own professional development, whether that means through upskilling or reskilling,” they state. “Pay attention to sources of information and update skills accordingly, either by searching out high-quality providers of education or by charting your own course amid the vast amount of online-learning offers.”
The BCG-Faethm team also makes the following recommendations from a corporate perspective:


Think strategically in terms of hiring. “A company should regularly assess the current size, composition, and development of its workforce. It should also evaluate future demand on the basis of strategic direction and determine the gaps for certain jobs and specific skills.”
Support upskilling and reskilling. “Given the rapid shifts in skill requirements and the number of entirely new tasks and roles that are emerging, the labor market will be unable to supply sufficient new talent to fill available positions. Companies therefore need to supplement external hiring with internal development initiatives and on-the-job training.”
Create a lifelong learning culture. “Corporate training used to consist of certifications or intermittent training programs, but the digital economy will demand a constant upgrading of skills. Content and skill upgrades should be delivered in a variety of formats so that they can be integrated into the daily routine of every employee, ensuring a nimble and agile workforce.”
Rethink talent recruitment and retention strategies. “Companies may need to shift the recruitment focus from hiring for skill to hiring for will: as some of the skills needed in the future (such as coding computer languages) will most likely be self-taught or come without an explicit certification, HR professionals will need to view candidate criteria with a more open mind and embrace diverse curricula. Companies may also opt to create an employee pool to which people with new skills can be added without yet knowing which field of operations they’d be best suited for.”

A major call centre company has refuted claims that specialist webcams will be fitted to check up on employees while they are working from home. 
According to an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, French company Teleperformance had informed employees that the cameras are connected to an artificial intelligence system that can scan for and detect “infractions” such as looking at their phones or eating. It claims that if workers need to leave their desks, they will need to click on “break mode” in the system and give a reason in order to avoid being reported for a breach.

Policy on mobile telephone use 

The system is called TP Observer, and can be programmed to take photos every time a breach of pre-set rules is detected. This could include an ‘unknown person’ sitting at the desk (facial recognition software knows who should be there), a period where there have been no keystrokes or unauthorised mobile phone usage.
Teleperformance operates in 34 countries and employs around 380,000 people. According to a spokesperson, 85% of the UK workforce (or 8,000 employees) are currently working from home.
The spokesperson said the claims raised by the newspaper were not true, adding: “We absolutely trust [staff] to do their jobs in a professional manner. It is important to reaffirm that regardless of the new technologies, tools and third-party providers that are being used, our work-at-home tools and processes ensure that the processing of our employees data complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable regulations.”  
The webcam would purely be used for collaboration purposes in the UK and South Africa, and “at no time will we be using the tools to spy on our staff”. 
“Use for collaboration purposes means use for meetings and training sessions and for scheduled video calls between team managers and work-at-home employees and voluntary use by our work-at-home staff in team-building activities, to embrace the social aspect of online work, to connect with coworkers, and to promote healthier working environments,” they said. 
“Use for security purposes means use of webcams to ensure that employees who are processing personal and sensitive personal data of customers on behalf of clients maintain an adequate level of security, as well as a clean desk policy, in line with our office environment. Such monitoring will only be carried out on an intermittent or random basis and not over the entire employee shift.  It will always take place with the employee’s knowledge and at no time be used to conduct covert surveillance on our people.”
AdvertisementEnd of ad break in 37 sYou can close Ad in 4 sThe Guardian had reported that around 10,000 staff in the UK were told last week that the cameras and scanning system would be installed next month while they continued to work from home. Teleperformance’s UK clients include NHS Digital, the Student Loans Company and Vodafone.
Last week the TUC called for new legislation to address “huge gaps” in protection for employees in the use of artificial intelligence at work.

Artificial intelligence presents itself in both grand and mundane ways. It accelerates the scientific process, leading most recently to the development of Covid-19 vaccines at record speed. It runs self-driving cars, allowing them to smoothly navigate downtown streets. And it manages our emails and online calendars, improving our productivity and well-being.But A.I.’s potential for transforming human learning and experience also sparks unease and raises fundamental questions. Who should control the creation and use of these tools? Are we comfortable handing a small group of technologists the keys to our social and economic development engine? And what role should philanthropy play in protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring that A.I. benefits the greater good?Controversies over facial recognition, automated decision making, and Covid-19 tracking have shown that realizing A.I.’s potential requires strong buy-in from citizens and governments, based on their trust that the technology is built and used ethically.To explore these challenges, we recently brought together a group of 20 senior philanthropic leaders representing institutions including the Schmidt Family Foundation, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, and the Berggruen Institute at a virtual convening of the World Economic Forum. Our conversation reflected philanthropists’ profound interest in both the positive potential for A.I. and the need to more deeply understand how to harness, steer, and govern these tools to prevent misuse and ensure they are deployed for social good. Those conversations contributed to the launch of a new Global AI Action Alliance — a platform for philanthropic and technology leaders to engage in the development of ethical A.I. practices and tools. They also led to the creation of an action plan that can help pave the path forward for deeper philanthropic participation in the effective, safe, and equitable use of A.I. to address societal need. The plan encompasses four key areas:


ADVERTISEMENT





A commitment to learning. While some foundations are tech-savvy, philanthropy as a field is not at the forefront of digital transformation. But we shouldn’t leave philanthropy’s response to A.I.’s challenges and potential to a handful of foundations focused on technological innovation. A broad swath of philanthropic organizations, regardless of their focus, need to invest in learning about A.I., sharing their perspectives across the field and with grantees, and adapting traditional strategies to incorporate these technologies.We need to be honest about our organizational blind spots and commit to building internal capacity where needed. That means learning from and hiring data scientists and A.I. practitioners. The Rockefeller Foundation has led the way in this area, hiring a chief data officer early on and convening working groups on the design and implementation of responsible A.I.And today, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, which one of us — Vilas Dhar — heads, deepened its own knowledge base by announcing plans to merge with Silicon Valley-based Cloudera Foundation to provide greater A.I. resources and expertise to grantees. Cloudera’s $9 million endowment and $3 million in existing grants, along with its staff and CEO, Claudia Juech, will form a new Data and Society program within the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation.Integration of A.I. into key grant-making areas. Rather than relegating topics involving A.I. and data to the IT team, foundation leaders should consider how these technologies affect their key focus areas. Educational outcomes, for example, can be addressed through A.I. technologies that provide better language translation, increased access to online learning platforms, and interactive teaching tools. A.I. can also play an integral role in addressing issues such as food insecurity. For example, a nonprofit called the Common Market uses A.I. to improve its food supply chains between farmers, growing networks, and food banks across Texas, the Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic.At each stage of the decision making and programming process, philanthropic leaders should be asking, “What is the potential application of A.I., and what are the benefits and risks?”

Investment in safe data sharing. Philanthropic institutions have the advantage of looking across a wide range of organizations in a particular field or region and are well positioned to support the aggregation and sharing of data and technical knowledge. The fact that they rarely do so is a missed opportunity. A.I. tools rely on massive amounts of data to learn and pinpoint patterns on issues such as policing, homelessness, and public health. But for many nonprofits, it is challenging to amass data in meaningful quantities or to securely store and analyze the data they gather, especially since funding for such internal operations is typically scarce.Philanthropic organizations should play a central role in supporting efforts to make data more accessible to grantees through vehicles such as data cooperatives and data trusts. These entities link data held by otherwise separate groups, providing even small nonprofits with robust data and analysis capabilities. Unlike many commercial data-gathering sources, they also address privacy concerns by ensuring that data is held confidentially and applied only for its intended use.The Himalayan Cataract Project, for example, which seeks to cure blindness around the world through simple and inexpensive cataract surgery, is building a shared framework for how patient data is gathered, distributed, and used among ophthalmologic health organizations. This common standard not only gives health workers better insights on how to treat patients who may be served by multiple organizations but also ensures their privacy by imposing strict guidelines on how the data is used.Diversification of voices. The conversation about development, ownership, and use of technology should expand to include philanthropists, activists, policy makers, and business leaders. In recent A.I. gatherings, we’ve brought together social-change activists and business leaders to facilitate discussions between those who understand the problems facing society and those who can build the solutions. Platforms such as data.org, launched by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, are furthering this type of dialogue by highlighting and funding A.I. solutions from around the world on issues such as improving economic well-being and creating safe and sustainable cities.During our roundtable conversation at the World Economic Forum, Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing and board chair of the MacArthur Foundation, observed that “A.I. can help us leapfrog some of the societal challenges we face, but we have to design it to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘good technology’ in and of itself — we have to make it work for us.”

Philanthropy occupies a position of financial privilege, moral responsibility, and public leadership. We must use that position as a platform for collaboration among those inside and outside of our field to build a future in which A.I. works safely and effectively to help solve humanity’s greatest challenges.

Several research groups have recently tried to apply machine learning to large databases of artworks to sort and describe them in a meaningful way. 

First, researchers from Zhejiang University of Technology in Hangzhou, China, compared different neural networks to find out how well they perform at art classification. They used images from WikiArt and other digital collections to train the neural networks to learn what images of a certain art style look like. Then they asked the different neural network models to identify the art style of other images. 


This is quite a tricky task, even for humans. Some art styles are easy to recognize from the way the image is created. Learning which artworks fall under the cubism genre wasn’t a problem for the neural networks. But some genres are quite similar to each other and occurred around the same time. That made it difficult for the programs to learn which is which.

The art classification neural networks also had trouble with tasks that humans wouldn’t find very difficult at all, such as understanding the difference between cityscapes and landscapes. The difference between buildings and nature is obvious to us, but to a computer, they both look like images with similar elements of “outside”. It doesn’t have a way of knowing that the clouds and sky in these images are not the key defining factor of these two categories.  

For human art lovers, learning which style or category a piece of art falls in is a relatively straightforward and objective task. Like the neural networks, we can learn how to do that by looking at a lot of art and finding patterns. But there’s something humans do that computers don’t: we also form opinions about the art and can share in words how looking at it makes us feel. Computers can’t do that yet - or can they?

Artificial intelligence is only as good as its training data, so to be able to teach an AI to form opinions and emotional statements about art, you need a vast collection of human-created descriptions of different artworks. That’s exactly what researchers from Stanford University, Ecole Polytechnique and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have done. They created the ArtEmis dataset which includes over 400 thousand emotional attributes and descriptions for over 80 thousand images indexed in WikiArt.

To create ArtEmis, the team asked volunteers to share their main emotion about an artwork, and to explain that in a sentence. As you would expect, people’s reactions varied widely. One person might find a painting of a field peaceful while someone else finds it slightly ominous. In fact, having both positive and negative reactions to the same painting was so common, this happened to 61% of the images in the ArtEmis database.

So what does an AI make of all those human descriptions of art? When trained on the ArtEmis dataset, different systems started creating their own captions for given artworks. Some of them were very convincing, but others missed the mark. AI-generated descriptions of Rembrandt’s painting “The Beheading of John the Baptist” included “the woman looks like she is having a good time” and “the man in the middle looks like he is in pain”. Any human would recognize these descriptions as complete nonsense (or at the very least a major understatement) considering the scene in the painting.An AI algorithm creating descriptions of images based on replicating human emotion said of ... [+] Rembrant's ""The Beheading of John the Baptist"" that “the woman looks like she is having a good time” and “the man in the middle looks like he is in pain”.WikiArt / public domain
About half of the computer-generated descriptions passed the Turing test, which means that AI’s can indeed learn to create new (and believable) descriptions of art, but it’s still far from perfect. That’s not surprising, considering it’s already a challenge to teach an AI whether a painting is a landscape or a cityscape. 
Art can be hard to classify and people’s opinions about paintings are highly subjective, which makes it even harder for artificial intelligence to understand the patterns of our classifications and descriptions. But the experiments done in these two new studies show that computers are getting better at these tasks. Humans are still better at categorising and describing art, but AI programs are learning quickly.

The way AI is advancing, we should prepare ourselves for the future where we will coexist with machines that will imitate human behavior and perception. While the work for such a future is already a reality, this disruptive technology won't just be able to capture the human element by the virtue of automation and decision-making but will also be able to emote like humans and read emotions accurately. That's the road to emotional AI or emotional artificial intelligence. .The process of building a layer of EQ or emotional quotient on top of artificial intelligence is called affective computing. How does this work? For an AI program to demonstrate emotions (to become an emotional AI program), it needs to see emotions, hear our voices, and feel our anxiety. For this, emotional AI must be able to extract emotional data from humans through conversational means by eye-tracking, skin response, voice, and written word analysis, brain activity via EEG, facial mapping, etc. .This technology can be used for hiring talent, sports personality traits analysis, advertising, marketing, event planning, predicting purchase behavior, finding a companion, security, amongst many others. Here is a list of the top 15 global emotional AI companies that are creating a global disruption. .Promobot + Neurodata Lab.Promobot is an autonomous service robot for business and is designed to work in places that have an increased concentration of people, and helps people with navigation as it autonomously moves, communicates, and answers any questions. The company in collaboration with Neurodata Lab, an Emotion AI hub is enabling the robot to better understand and interpret human emotions, and engage in human-like conversations and interactions..Promobot shows promotional materials and remembers everyone it has communication with. Promobot is programmed to work as an administrator, museum guide, promoter, and host. Promobot can operate in crowded places like cinemas, convention centers, exhibition halls, museums, shopping malls, business centers. Promobot's increased applications can boost the quality of service, financial performance, and customer loyalty of companies where these robots operate. .Emotibot.Founded in 2015, by Mr.Kenny Chien and two angel investors, Emoitbot brings the unlimited potential of AI technology to achieve higher business values. Emoitbot is the only artificial intelligence company with image, language multimodal emotion recognition technology, and voice triple human-computer interaction technology. Emotibot aims to build an Artificial Intelligence companion that can read, see, listen, remember, self-learn, and understands the user's emotion to understand the affective states, emotions, and intentions of the speaker. Through automatic learning of user preferences and habits, Emotibot's AI bots provide users with over 30 services and functions like travel planning, hotel reservations, and so on. The platform supports fast access to mobile phones, websites, App, intelligent devices with an aim to closely connect people with the world..Affectiva.Affectiva is an emotion measurement technology company incepted and developed at MIT's Media Lab to recognize human emotions based on facial cues or physiological responses. This emotion recognition technology is used to commercially help brands improve their marketing messages and advertising targets. Affectiva partnered with Millward Brown, in 2011 for political polling estimates. The company's technology enables software applications to use a webcam in order to track a user's smirks, furrows, smile, and frowns to measure the levels of surprise, confusion, and amusement. Affectiva's technology allows a person's heart rate to be measured from a webcam without the need of the user to wear a sensor. This is accomplished by tracking the color changes in the person's face, which pulses each time the heartbeats..Affectiva's Affdex technology can be used to train a webcam on users while they are watching ads, to track their furrows, smirks, smiles, and frowns to measure their levels of surprise, amusement, or confusion throughout a commercial. This helps for a comparison with other viewers across different demographics. The company has developed the first online face tracking system for an evaluation of the advertising effectiveness, a technology, whose clients include Coca-Cola and others..Beyond Verbal.Founded in 2012, Beyond Verbal based in Tel Aviv, Israel uses Voice and AI technology to extract human emotions and reveal Vocal Biomarkers including acoustic features which indicate various health conditions.

(This article is part of a series on Artificial Intelligence for Board Members and Senior Executives.)


Elon Musk has famously said, ""AI is far more dangerous than nukes."" His statement has some truth to it, and it has succeeded in raising our awareness of the dangers of AI.

As leaders, part of our job is to ensure that what our companies do is safe. We don't want to harm our business partners, employees, customers, or anyone else we are working with. We can manage AI to reduce risk even before regulatory bodies step in to force us to do so.

Most industries have regulations to govern how we manage risks to ensure safety. However, in the world of AI, there are very few regulations applying to AI as it relates to safety. We have regulations around privacy, and those are extremely important to the AI world, but very few regulations around safety.

PROMOTED
AI has the potential to be dangerous. As a result, we need to create ways to manage the risk presented by AI-based systems. Singapore has provided us with a Model AI Governance Framework. This framework is an excellent place to start understanding the key issues for governing AI and managing risk.
The two main factors in this framework consist of:
● The level of human involvement in AI

The first main factor: the level of human involvement
At times, AI will work alone, and many times, AI will work closely with humans in making decisions. Let’s look at three ways this can manifest itself.

Skip Ad
 
Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
Human-out-of-the-loop: This AI runs on its own, without human oversight. The AI system has full control, and the human cannot override the AI's decision.
An example of AI where we are comfortable with the human-out-of-the-loop is for most recommendation engines, such as what song to listen to next or what piece of clothing to look at next on an e-commerce website.
Human-in-the-loop: This AI runs only to provide suggestions to the human. Nothing can happen without a human command to proceed with a suggestion.
An example of AI where we really want a human-in-the-loop is medical diagnostics and treatment. We still want the physician to make the final decision.
Human-over-the-loop: This AI is designed to let the human intercede if the human disagrees or determines the AI has failed. If the human isn't paying attention, though, the AI will proceed without human intervention.
An example of where we want a human-over-the-loop system might be AI-based traffic prediction systems. Most of the time, the AI will suggest the shortest route to the next destination, but humans can override that decision whenever they want to be involved.

The second main factor: the potential harm caused by AI. 
In thinking about managing risk, we need to ask about the severity of harm and the probability of harm. Let's use a matrix to look at how this could work.Should a human be in the loop?Glenn Gow
Quadrant 1: Human-over-the-loop
Probability of harm is low; Severity of harm is high
Example: you have important corporate data, but that data is not only protected behind strong firewalls, but it is encrypted as well. It’s unlikely that hackers can both penetrate your firewalls and decipher the encrypted data as well. However, if they do, the severity of that attack is high.
You will want a human-over-the-loop approach where your AI-based cybersecurity solution handles these types of attacks quite well. In certain circumstances, like discovering a particularly insidious brand-new attack, you will want humans to keep a close eye on what is happening. (See If Microsoft Can Be Hacked, What About Your Company? How AI is Transforming Cybersecurity.)
Quadrant 2: Human-in-the-loop
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is high
Example: your corporate development team uses AI to identify potential acquisition targets for the company. Also, they use AI to conduct financial due diligence on the various targets. Both the probability and severity of harm are high in this decision.
AI can be extremely helpful in identifying opportunities humans can't see. Also, AI can provide excellent predictive models of how a potential acquisition will work out. You will want a human-in-the-loop for this type of decision. AI is useful for augmenting the decision, not making it.
Quadrant 3: Human-out-of-the-loop 
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is low
Example: any recommendation engine that helps consumers make product-buying decisions. Many e-commerce sites will help a consumer find the products they are most likely to buy. Also, companies like Spotify will recommend what songs you might want to hear next.
For recommendation engines, the probability of harm is quite low, and the severity of looking at a shoe you don't like or listening to a song you don't like is also low. Humans are not needed.
Quadrant 4: Human-over-the-loop 
Probability of harm is high; Severity of harm is low
Example: some AI systems can help with compliance audits. The probability of harm is high because the systems may not yet be perfect. Yet, the severity of harm is low because the company may be allowed to correct the non-compliance or suffer a small fine as a result.
Some compliance audits are more important than others. A human can decide where they should be involved depending on how important that particular compliance issue is to the company.
The Modern AI Governance Framework gives boards and management a starting place to manage risk with AI projects. While many other factors determine the best risk-management approach, this framework has the advantage of being very easy for the non-AI executive to help drive the best risk management approach for the company.
AI could be dangerous, but managing when and how humans will be in control enables us to reduce our company's risk factors greatly.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, and how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, I encourage you to stay tuned.

At least with AI, the intelligence behind the screen would still be there..Artificial intelligence is transforming education, but it remains an open question whether AI can replace live, in-person instructors entirely..The Digital Classroom.Already, classrooms are moving toward a digital future. Many companies provide software platforms that let a single instructor oversee massive numbers of students, managing their learning remotely with the help of digitized lessons and grading software. Some schools use AI to analyze and identify their students' strengths and weaknesses in order to tailor the curriculum to their needs. So-called &quot;adaptive assessment&quot; programs can make homework questions easier or harder depending on individual students' success. In such software, the program uses student performance to develop what is essentially a personalized curriculum. In that sense, this type of machine-based learning can be compared to artificial intelligence engaging students in real learning. .However, there are problems that have emerged in the digital classroom. Some studies have found that students do not engage as completely with digital learning and AI instruction as they do with real-world instruction. As a result, their performance doesn't always measure up. .So why do students treat digitized learning differently?.Where AI Doesn't Measure Up.One of the most important differences between in-person and AI learning is that an AI instructor isn't a real human being. Evolution has honed the human mind to respond to other humans, but when the instructor is just text on a screen—or we know it isn't human—we don't empathize with it the same way, or develop the same sense of engagement. Similarly, it's difficult to imagine a computer caring about us the same way a real instructor might empathize with us and care about us. All told, this make it difficult for students to engage with a machine with the same level of involvement as a human..Some argue, too, that robots aren't able to inspire students the same way that a real person might. For example, in a classroom, a student might ask a challenging question that inspires the instructor to make cross-connections, go off in a unique direction, or discuss the topic in ways that are unexpected. A machine, however, can't go off on a tangent or connect to other areas of learning and will instead answer the question in a rote way, providing information but not inspiration..In the end, learning isn't just about delivering facts and information. It's about creating meaning. While machines can teach skills effectively, they have yet to develop an ability to create meaning. A machine can gather data about students, but it can't yet understand a student holistically in order to appeal to that student, understand the student's needs, and show how learning can be meaningful to them..Where AI Is Going Next.So, while AI isn't going to completely replace the role of the educator anytime soon, it is going to change how educators work with students—and it might well threaten the job of teaching assistants. AI might not be able to empathize with the students, but it sure can process data and push through grades and evaluations, and computer analytics. We already use computers to mechanically grade multiple-choice quizzes, and services like Turnitin evaluate papers to search for signs of plagiarism. Even gradebooks are now digitized, calculating final grades from data inputted during the term. .In the coming years, AI will continue to take over the routine tasks of teaching. Already, some instructors have developed AI interfaces that can handle routine student inquiries, freeing instructors to focus their limited time on complex or unique student queries. In Japan and South Korea, artificial intelligence-powered robots are used in language instruction, giving students the opportunity to practice their language skills by engaging AI in chats..Many believe that the future of AI in the classroom is as an enhanced digital assistant, proctoring tests, handling routine inquiries, providing data and supporting information, and tailoring assignments in response to student needs. But a real person will still need to be there to watch over it all..However, as more homework is graded by machine, more students will make use of professional online academic writing services in order to get help with their papers and essays written by someone from scratch. An expert team of legitimate essay writers from Write My Paper Hub services will write papers for students, and more college students will feel free to use and pay them online to get ahead. After all, if no human actually reads assignments, does it matter who wrote them or what they say? As long as the machine grades it well, isn't that enough? This is one ethical issue that AI can't solve on its own..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

AI, or artificial intelligence, seems to be on the tip of everyone’s tongue these days. While I’ve been aware of this major trend in tech development for a while, I’ve noticed AI appearing more and more as one of the most in-demand areas of expertise for job seekers.


I’m sure that for many of us, the term “AI” conjures up sci-fi fantasies or fear about robots taking over the world. The depictions of AI in the media have run the gamut, and while no one can predict exactly how it will evolve in the future, the current trends and developments paint a much different picture of how AI will become part of our lives. 

In reality, AI is already at work all around us, impacting everything from our search results, to our online dating prospects, to the way we shop. Data shows that the use of AI in many sectors of business has grown by 270% over the last four years.

PROMOTED
But what will AI mean for the future of work? As computers and technology have evolved, this has been one of the most pressing questions. As with many technological developments throughout history, the advancement of artificial intelligence has created fears that human workers will become obsolete. 

The reality is probably a lot less dire, but maybe even more complicated.

Before we do a deep dive on the ways in which AI will impact the future of work, it’s important to start simple: what is AI? A straightforward definition from Britannica states that artificial intelligence is “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.”

“AI” has become a catchall term to describe any advancements in computing, systems and technology in which computer programs can perform tasks or solve problems that require the kind of reason we associate with human intelligence, even learning from past processes.

This ability to learn is a key component of AI. Algorithms, like the dreaded Facebook algorithm that replaced all our friends with sponsored content, are often associated with AI. But there is a key distinction.
As software journalist Kaya Ismail writes, an algorithm is simply a “set of instructions,” a formula for processing data. AI takes this to another level, and can be made up of a set of algorithms that have the capacity to change and rewrite themselves in response to the data inputted, hence displaying “intelligence.”
AI will probably not make human workers obsolete, at least not for a long time 
To put some of your fears to bed: the robots are probably not coming for your jobs, at least not yet. 
Given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, in particular in some of our favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that AI will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce. After all, as technology has advanced, many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated. It’s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it. 
But, I don’t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic. A recent paper published by the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence And The Future of Work,” looked closely at developments in AI and their relation to the world of work. The paper paints a more optimistic picture. 
Rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor, the paper predicts that AI will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs.
While AI has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks, there are still major limitations. In particular, AI programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence, meaning they can solve only one problem, and execute only one task at a time. Often, they can be rigid, and unable to respond to any changes in input, or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming. 
Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” with the kind of problem solving, abstract thinking and critical judgement that will continue to be important in business. Human judgement will be relevant, if not in every task, then certainly throughout every level across all sectors. 
There are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in AI. AI often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data, calling into question the availability of the right kind of data, and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data. There is also the limitation of computation and processing power. The cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model AI was estimated at $4.6 million. 
Another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias, and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data. If there is bias in the data that is inputted into an AI, this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the AI. 
There has even been a bill introduced into Congress entitled the Algorithmic Accountability Act with the goal of forcing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the use of any new AI technology for the potential to perpetuate bias. 
Based on these factors and many others, the MIT CCI paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which AI is comparable to human intelligence, and could theoretically replace human workers entirely.  
Provided there is investment at all levels, from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—AI has the potential to ultimately create more jobs, not less. The question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity. 
This paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into AI and the many potential directions in which it may lead.
AI Is becoming standard in all businesses, not just in the world of tech
A couple times recently, AI has come up in conversation with a client or an associate, and I’m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it. There seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world.
In case you hadn’t noticed, the tech world is the world these days. Don’t ever forget when economist Paul Krugman said in 1998 that “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” You definitely don’t want to be behind the curve when it comes to AI. 
In fact, 90% of leading businesses already have ongoing investment in AI technologies. More than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of AI-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity.
AI is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular:
Medical:
The potential benefits of utilizing AI in the field of medicine are already being explored. The medical industry has a robust amount of data, which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare. Additionally, AI has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts. 
Automotive:
We’re already seeing how AI is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation. AI will also have a major impact on manufacturing, including within the automotive sector. 
Cybersecurity:
Cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders, especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020. Attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home, on less secure technological systems and Wi-Fi networks. AI and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. AI will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance, given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud. 
E-Commerce:
AI will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future, in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution. We can expect that moving forward, AI will continue to drive e-commerce, including through the use of chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation.
AI can have a big impact on the job search
If you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application, you might be in for a rude awakening. AI already plays a major role in the hiring process, so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system, or ATS, before they even reach a human being.  
In the past, recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates. Data from LinkedIn shows that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one successful hire. 
Increasingly, however, resume scanning is being done by AI-powered programs. In 2018, 67% of hiring managers stated that AI was making their jobs easier.
Despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, many have been critical of the use of certain types of AI by hiring managers, based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring. 
One particular example is illustrated by HireVue, a startup whose initial services included technology which aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice. HireVue discontinued use of facial recognition software in early 2021, and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing.
It’s clear that the use of certain types of AI in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops. However, if potential employers are using AI to process your application, there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage. 


Jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager. By comparing your resume to a job description, Jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position, with the goal of “beating” an application tracking system (ATS). 
Jobseer is a browser add-on, and another great AI-based tool for those on the job market. Based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs, Jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience. For each listing, you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting, as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience.
Rezi: Now, as a disclaimer, I would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot. But Rezi is an awesome AI-based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems. This is a great jumping off point to kickstart a new resume.  Another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume, and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up, and identify some areas for improvement. 


AI is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career, or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market, especially when you consider that AI will have such far-reaching impacts across many industries.
AI and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today's job market. Jobs requesting AI or machine-learning skills are expected to increase by 71% in the next five years. If you’d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena, consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on AI skills. 
If you are tech savvy, it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the AI space. If your skills lie elsewhere, it is important to recognize that AI will have a big impact, and to the extent of your abilities, you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors. 
AI is definitely here to stay, whether we like it or not. Personally, I don’t think we have anything to be afraid of. The best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us, AI included.

SmithPublished Feb. 23, 2021Updated March 9, 2021This article is part of our new series, Currents, which examines how rapid advances in technology are transforming our lives.I wake up in the middle of the night. It’s cold.“Hey, Google, what’s the temperature in Zone 2,” I say into the darkness. A disembodied voice responds: “The temperature in Zone 2 is 52 degrees.” “Set the heat to 68,” I say, and then I ask the gods of artificial intelligence to turn on the light.Many of us already live with A.I., an array of unseen algorithms that control our Internet-connected devices, from smartphones to security cameras and cars that heat the seats before you’ve even stepped out of the house on a frigid morning.But, while we’ve seen the A.I. sun, we have yet to see it truly shine.Researchers liken the current state of the technology to cellphones of the 1990s: useful, but crude and cumbersome. They are working on distilling the largest, most powerful machine-learning models into lightweight software that can run on “the edge,” meaning small devices such as kitchen appliances or wearables. Our lives will gradually be interwoven with brilliant threads of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOur interactions with the technology will become increasingly personalized. Chatbots, for example, can be clumsy and frustrating today, but they will eventually become truly conversational, learning our habits and personalities and even develop personalities of their own. But don’t worry, the fever dreams of superintelligent machines taking over, like HAL in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” will remain science fiction for a long time to come; consciousness, self-awareness and free will in machines are far beyond the capabilities of science today.Privacy remains an issue, because artificial intelligence requires data to learn patterns and make decisions. But researchers are developing methods to use our data without actually seeing it — so-called federated learning, for example — or encrypt it in ways that currently can’t be hacked.Our homes and our cars will increasingly be watched over with A.I.-integrated sensors. Some security cameras today use A.I.-enabled facial recognition software to identify frequent visitors and detect strangers. But soon, networks of overlapping cameras and sensors will create a mesh of “ambient intelligence,” that will be available to monitor us all the time, if we want it. Ambient intelligence could recognize changes in behavior and prove a boon to older adults and their families.“Intelligent systems will be able to understand the daily activity patterns of seniors living alone, and catch early patterns of medically relevant information,” said Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University computer science professor and a co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence who was instrumental in sparking the current A.I. revolution. While she says much work remains to be done to address privacy concerns, such systems could detect signs of dementia, sleep disorders, social isolation, falls and poor nutrition, and notify caretakers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStreaming services such as Netflix or Spotify already use A.I. to learn your preferences and feed you a steady diet of enticing entertainment. Google Play uses A.I. to recommend mood music that matches the time and weather. A.I. is being used to bring old films into focus and bring black-and-white into color and even add sound to silent movies. It’s also improving streaming speed and consistency. Those spinning animations that indicate a computer is stuck on something may soon be a relic of the past that people will recall with fondness, the way many of us do with TV “snow” today.Increasingly, more of the media we consume will actually be generated by A.I. Google’s open-source Magenta project has created an array of applications that make music indistinguishable from human composers and performers.The research institute OpenAI has created MuseNet, which uses artificial intelligence to blend different styles of music into new compositions. The institute also has Jukebox, which creates new songs when given a genre, artist and lyrics, which in some cases are co-written by A.I.These are early efforts, achieved by feeding millions of songs into networks of artificial neurons, made from strings of computer code, until they internalize patterns of melody and harmony, and can recreate the sound of instruments and voices.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMusicians are experimenting with these tools today and a few start-ups are already offering A.I.-generated background music for podcasts and video games.Artificial intelligence is as abstract as thought, written in computer code, but people imagine A.I. embodied in humanoid form. Robotic hardware has a lot of catching up to do, however. Realistic, A.I.-generated avatars will have A.I.-generated conversations and sing A.I.-generated songs, and even teach our children. Deepfakes also exist, where the face and voice of one person, for example, is transposed onto a video of another. We’ve also seen realistic A.I.-generated faces of people who don’t exist.Researchers are working on combining the technologies to create realistic 2D avatars of people who can interact in real time, showing emotion and making context-relevant gestures. A Samsung-associated company called Neon has introduced an early version of such avatars, though the technology has a long way to go before it is practical to use.Such avatars could help revolutionize education. Artificial intelligence researchers are already developing A.I. tutoring systems that can track student behavior, predict their performance and deliver content and strategies to both improve that performance and prevent students from losing interest. A.I. tutors hold the promise of truly personalized education available to anyone in the world with an Internet-connected device — provided they are willing to surrender some privacy.“Having a visual interaction with a face that expresses emotions, that expresses support, is very important for teachers,” said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and the founder of Mila, an artificial intelligence research institute. Korbit, a company founded by one of his students, Iulian Serban, and Riiid, based in South Korea, are already using this technology in education, though Mr. Bengio says it may be a decade or more before such tutors have natural language fluidity and semantic understanding.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are seemingly endless ways in which artificial intelligence is beginning to touch our lives, from discovering new materials to new drugs — A.I. has already played a role in the development of Covid-19 vaccines by narrowing the field of possibilities for scientists to search — to picking the fruit we eat and sorting the garbage we throw way. Self-driving cars work, they’re just waiting for laws and regulations to catch up with them.Artificial intelligence is even starting to write software and may eventually write more complex A.I. Diffblue, a start-up out of Oxford University, has an A.I. system that automates the writing of software tests, a task that takes up as much as a third of expensive developers’ time. Justin Gottschlich, who runs the machine programming research group at Intel Labs, envisions a day when anyone can create software simply by telling an A.I. system clearly what they want the software to do.“I can imagine people like my mom creating software,” he said, “even though she can’t write a line of code.”Craig S.

Artificial intelligence ensuring human rights at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals
 

10 March 2021






      Share
    





























 
How do you manage ever-growing amounts of human rights guidance, including almost 180,000 individual observations and recommendations from UN human rights mechanisms, and ensure easy access to everyone, including the general public, governments, NGOs and UN agencies? At the same time, how do you ensure this guidance has a real and positive impact on human rights worldwide?
One of the solutions, for UN Human Rights, lay in an innovative partnership with the Danish Institute of Human Rights and a Danish social enterprise called Specialisterne (“The Specialists”), an organisation which works with consultants on the autism spectrum who are skilled in solving challenging data puzzles.
When the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015, one of UN Human Rights’ aims was to make human rights guidance available to inform the national policies needed to implement them.
The result is that today, the Universal Human Rights Index (UHRI), the world’s largest and most comprehensive human rights database of guidance from the human rights mechanisms, is being powered by artificial intelligence, showing the links between this guidance and the SDGs.
Prior to this, the tens of thousands of observations and recommendations the Universal Periodic Review, Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures were being manually tagged, with OHCHR staff spending hours, days, weeks and months analysing and inputting information.
While this work is gradually being replaced by artificial intelligence, Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, Director of Human Rights Council and Treaty Mechanisms Division at UN Human Rights, explains that “While we are expecting to save thousands of hours in manual work, human rights experts will continue to undertake quality checks at every stage, which in turn further refines the precision of the algorithm.”
A common goal to make human rights more accessible 
The partnership between UN Human Rights, the Danish Institute of Human Rights and Specialisterne began in 2017. It brought together a great diversity of skills, knowledge and approaches.
“We are talking about a level of information that no one human being can possibly digest,” says Birgitte Feiring, Director of Human Rights and Sustainable Development at the Danish Institute for Human Rights. “In pulling together these three very different organisations, at the end of the day, our common goal is to make human rights more accessible to rights holders, and to help them bring governments to account.”
For Feiring, the new algorithm makes human rights analysis, programming and planning much easier for governments. “When governments have to design a plan for sustainable development, for example, or for sustainable recovery from COVID-19, in a few clicks, they can find out what are the human rights problems facing older persons, or what the issues are related to access to healthcare and vaccines. They are also directed to the solutions, as advised by the various human rights mechanisms.”
The brain behind the algorithm
The individual who developed the algorithm – called ‘TextClassify’ – is physicist Niels Jørgen Kjær. Previously employed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the capacity of High Energy Physicist, he now uses his expertise working for Specialisterne.
“The most challenging part of the algorithm was to make it scalable to very large data sets,” explains Kjær.
He says the central ingredient was the development of a fast multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, called ‘Mahjong.’ Mahjong evaluates an optimisation step in about 10 microseconds, and makes tests on millions of word combinations feasible.
The result is an algorithm that Kjær says can “handle millions of text snippets and thousands of categories, and still run everything in seconds on a PC.”
A key contribution from people on the autism spectrum
Specialisterne is a self-described ‘socially innovative company’ where the majority of staff have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. The company was founded in 2003 with the objective of providing better jobs and working conditions for neurodiverse talent.
According to CEO Carsten Lassen, autistic individuals are often known to find creative solutions and unusual perspectives in problem-solving when in the right work environment.
“I often hear autistic persons say that their brain works like an algorithm, in that it tends to work in a more binary way than the neurotypical brain: if it’s not absolutely right, then it’s wrong. That’s exactly how algorithms are built and that’s the foundation for all programming,” Lassen says.
What does the algorithm do?
Because of the new algorithm, it is now possible to easily explore how human rights guidance can boost implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by country, theme, or group of affected persons.
The UHRI now shows the concrete linkages between individual recommendations issued by UN human rights mechanisms and the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda.
“For us it has been of great support to benefit from the innovations developed by our partners,” says Mahamane Cissé-Gouro, UN Human Rights. “Machine learning can dramatically improve efficiency and enable us to analyse and present the human rights work of the mechanisms in more accessible and visual ways.”
A high degree of transparency

“We are proud to be part of a project where we can show the potential of this technology to promote human rights work,” says Cissé-Gouro. “We are particularly happy that the algorithm we are using has been developed in a way that provides a high degree of transparency and enables meaningful human oversight.”
For the future? UN Human Rights will continue to expand its work using the algorithm.

Since the beginning of large-scale industrialization, automation has led to massive, widespread job losses. Whole cities like Detroit fell victim to this when the car industry replaced large numbers of humans with robots. Today, many of the hardest-hit places are barely a shadow of their bustling and blossoming past selves.
Adding robots to the economy displaces workers. A study from the University of Chicago found that adding just one machine per 1,000 workers to the economy causes the employment rate to decrease by at least 0.18 percent. This may not sound like much, but in a country the size of the United States, it corresponds to about half a million layoffs. That’s the equivalent of a medium-sized city of workers without a job.
Those workers face an immediate, direct crisis as they have to find new jobs or maybe even new fields entirely. Their unemployment also has downstream effects on the broader economy as they cut down on spending for the duration of their time out of the workforce. Unemployment affects everyone who participates in the economy.
With the fourth industrial revolution in full blast, the fear is palpable yet again. Artificial intelligence has the potential to automate even very complex tasks, to say nothing of the simple and repetitive ones. That labor-saving potential only sounds great before you think about the social consequences. No city wants to end up muddled in bankruptcy and decline. No workers want to lose their livelihood, boring and repetitive though some parts of their jobs may be.
But the news isn’t all bad. Without robots in the automotive industry, the innovative products made by companies like General Motors or Tesla wouldn’t even exist in our wildest dreams. Without the robots in tech factories, the device that you’re reading this article on wouldn’t exist either. And without an AI-based recommendation algorithm, you might never have stumbled upon this article.
Stories like the decline of Detroit are gut-wrenching. But there’s reason to believe that history won’t repeat itself when it comes to the AI-fueled revolution.

Companies That Adopt Robots Hire More Workers
On a macroeconomic level, the logic seems simple: If AI makes workers obsolete, then adopting it will make unemployment rise. At first sight, a study from France confirms that suspicion. The authors found that a 20 percent increase in robots in a given industry leads to a 1.6 percent decline in employment there. Of course, robots are a way more general term than AI, but we can assume AI would lead to similar results.
The reality is different, though, when shifting perspective from the national economy to individual corporations. Somewhat counterintuitively, companies that adopt robots hire more workers. Admittedly, this data might be a bit misleading because companies with stronger growth can afford more robots sooner, which makes them scale even faster.
There are, however, a couple of compelling reasons to believe that robots help companies expand their human workforce. The French study suggests that, if workers and robots share the workload, then the value added per worker goes up.
For example, consider a company that employs five workers to manufacture a product worth $100. On average, every worker contributes $20 to the final product. After experiencing some growth, this company buys some robots and now only needs two workers per product because the robots are doing the rest. As a result, the remaining two workers contribute $50 each to the final product. Since this is a dramatic increase in efficiency, the company might expand its activities and hire additional workers, who can also now contribute $50 each thanks to the improved efficiency — compared to $20 in the pre-robot stage. This mechanism increases a company’s labor demand, so it might decide to hire more workers to expand its palette of products and services.
Robot-adopting businesses also grow their headcount because providing products and services usually becomes cheaper when they’re not handmade. Sure, buying machines is an upfront investment and some maintenance work is necessary. Robots don’t get tired, sick or need to go on vacation, however. In the long run, this efficiency pays off. The reduced cost makes it easier for these companies to snap up more market share in their industry because they can offer higher quality products at the same price or keep the same quality but offer lower prices than the competition.
Research from Canada, Denmark and Spain comes to similar conclusions. Although no such study has been undertaken in the U.S. as yet, companies need to invest in robots if they want to stay competitive, even if employment in their sector goes down as a result.
We should keep in mind, however, that every AI-system can be viewed as a robot, but not every robot contains AI. Investing in AI might lead to more corporate growth just like general robotics. Fortunately, though, unlike other robots, AI might not lead to an industry-wide decline in employment.
A Dutch study comes to a similar conclusion as the French, Canadian, Danish and Spanish ones, namely that more automation — meaning more robots — leads to more unemployment. Despite this, computerization, under which we can safely count AI, doesn’t have an effect on unemployment.
In other words, although physical robots do eliminate jobs to some extent, computers and AI don’t have the same effect. What this study doesn’t show, though, is the link between AI and economic growth. But other studies have.
 
AI Is Poised to Fuel Explosive Growth
Those readers who are old enough to have witnessed the rise of the internet (the author was too small back then) might remember how it raised similar concerns about unemployment. Even though it became widespread a mere 20 years ago, it has already created millions of jobs since and comprises 10 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Perhaps more importantly, the internet hasn’t been responsible for the decline of cities like automation in the car industry has.
Currently, 63 percent of CEOs believe that AI will have an even larger impact than the internet, according to PwC. In their global AI study, PwC estimates that by 2030, the global GDP will have increased by 26 percent due to AI alone. That’s more than the current GDP of China and India combined.
PwC isn’t the only optimist in the room. The World Economic Forum estimates that 97 million new jobs will be created through AI by 2025. They also estimate that some 85 million jobs will be lost in the same period, but that’s still a net surplus of 12 million jobs.
That being said, the distribution of these jobs might be unequal. In Sweden and the U.S., productivity is projected to increase by more than 35 percent by 2035 due to AI. For France and Spain, however, the gains might be less than 20 percent.
This effect might not be as enormous as it sounds, though. The World Economic Forum estimates that only 40 percent of the AI-related economic growth by 2030 will come from an increase in productivity; the other 60 percent will come from consumption. In other words, a little less than half of the growth will come because workers get more efficient or get replaced by AI. The rest of the growth will come from the fact that people will be using products with AI, such as social networks or streaming services. One caveat to this point is that we’re comparing two different time spans here, as one projection was for 10 years and another 15. Nevertheless, it’s clear that productivity is only a part of the equation that contributes to overall economic growth.
Despite legitimate fears, it seems as if the adoption of AI will lead to sustained economic growth, which in turn spurs employment rates. The important part will be to make this growth fair and equitable to as many citizens as possible both within and across nations. Within a nation, this means making sure that marginalized communities such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, overweight people, people with disabilities and people of color get access to training and education in AI. We must also strive to eradicate currently existing algorithmic biases. On an international level, this means enabling access to computing resources for low-income countries and fostering collaborations and research across different countries.
More on Artificial Intelligence19 Examples of AI Shaking Up Business as Usual 
AI-Based Management Might Be Unhealthy
Before you get overly enthusiastic about the findings by the World Economic Forum, though, consider that economic growth doesn’t mean more riches for everybody. At the risk of sounding overly socialistic and European (it’s OK, that’s where I’m from) let me say that workers’ rights are routinely squeezed to death by AI.
The Verge reports this clearly: It’s OK to use AI to take over boring and repetitive tasks. But what if you promote an algorithm to a middle manager? The algorithmic manager is fixated on KPIs and has no mercy or humanity. The machine’s only goal is to achieve desired results as efficiently as possible. The result is that it cuts breaks, raises objectives and might end up laying off workers.
We’ve already seen negative results from AI management. Workers routinely burn out under AI managers. Some even get severe physical injuries. AI-managed productivity metrics also don’t seem to be effective. For instance, algorithms are used to measure the productivity of software developers. Paradoxically, that measurement doesn’t seem to increase productivity, but rather destroy it.
If we’re employing algorithms not as lowest-level workers but rather as managers, we should at least teach them some human decency. For example, include some hard borders in an algorithm that specify how many breaks an employee is eligible for. Also, even without AI, it’s common practice to animate workers to outperform the best in the team. But how about animating them to just be slightly above average and implementing that goal algorithmically?
These kinds of approaches may sound like a waste of resources in the short term, but my intuition is that they will pay off eventually. In fact, if we don’t adopt a more moderate approach toward productivity, we’ll likely end up with swathes of job-, income- and futureless workers, not because they’ve been laid off but because they’ve been drilled beyond their breaking points.
It’s incredibly important to emphasize the capabilities of AI in creating new jobs. These, however, must be humane, or it’s a moot point.
 
How to Prevent an AI Apocalypse
I’m not raising the point of social equality because I’m a guardian angel. I’m just a regular, egotistical human. But I believe that, as humans, we profit if others around us are doing well. When unemployment goes down, that saves the government a ton of money and opens up new opportunities in the future. After all, maybe one or two of these low-level workers whose job is saved will one day be the Steve Jobs or Elon Musk of the decades to come.
And there’s another issue: If, like the World Economic Forum suggests, 97 million jobs get created through AI and only 85 million jobs get destroyed, there’s no guarantee that the 85 million laid-off workers will be in the pool of the 97 million lucky ones. Populations grow, people migrate, and so the 97 million jobs may be quite a scarce resource after all.
In order to give the 85 million laid-off workers a perspective, it’s imperative to re- and upskill them, ideally long before they lose their old jobs. AI can be part of the solution here since a learning bot could automate this curriculum of continued education. AI algorithms should also be created to match workers to new opportunities and to equip brand-new workers with the necessary skills, ideally even before they’ve left college.
AI will create more jobs than it will destroy. But we’ll need AI to ensure a fair distribution of these new jobs.
 
Invest in Your Workers
Luckily enough, governments are starting to understand what’s going on. France, for example, takes the AI-led world of tomorrow very seriously. In a report from 2019, France Stratégie proposes to train more AI experts and workers that really understand what AI means for tech, law, economy and society as a whole.
In addition, France Stratégie proposes “improving schemes for safeguarding career paths in the sectors and subsectors that are set to be heavily impacted by the risk of automation.” In other words, some smart decision-makers in business and government need to get together and map out plans for workers in a rapidly shifting landscape, sector by sector. I applaud this approach.
This requires a lot of foresight and nobody has a crystal ball. We’ll make mistakes. But if we, as a society, want to move forward, we need to address the fundamental fear of decline, of not keeping pace with shifting technologies. AI will bring prosperity to many and doom to few, but we need to act now to curb the doom and spread prosperity to every single worker.

Sifting through job applications, analyzing X-ray images, suggesting a new track list—interaction between humans and machines has become an integral part of modern life. The basis for these artificial intelligence (AI) processes is algorithmic decision-making. However, as these are generally difficult to understand, they often prove less useful than anticipated. Researchers at Paderborn and Bielefeld University are hoping to change this, and are discussing how the explainability of artificial intelligence can be improved and adapted to the needs of human users. Their work has recently been published in the respected journal IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems. The researchers describe explanation as a social practice, in which both parties co-construct the process of understanding.





Explainability research
""Artificial systems have become complex. This is a serious problem—particularly when humans are held accountable for computer-based decisions,"" says Professor Philipp Cimiano, a computer scientist at Bielefeld University. Particularly in the area of medical prognosis or legal contexts, we need to understand how machine-driven decisions are made, continues Cimiano. He points out that while there are already some approaches that address the explainability of such systems, they do not go far enough. Professor Katharina Rohlfing at Paderborn University agrees that further action is urgently needed: ""Citizens have the right for algorithmic decisions to be made transparent. There are good reasons why this issue is specifically mentioned in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation."" The goal of making algorithms accessible is central to what is known as ""eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)"": ""In explainability research, the focus is currently on the desired outcomes of transparency and interpretability,"" says Rohlfing, describing the latest research.
Understanding how decisions are made
The team involved in this research study go one step further and are investigating computer-based explanations from various different perspectives. They start from the assumption that explanations are only understandable to the users if they are not just presented to them, but if the users are involved in formulating them: ""As we know from many everyday situations, good explanations are worth nothing if they do not take account of the other person's knowledge and experience. Anyone who wonders why their application was rejected by an algorithm is not generally interested in finding out about the technology of machine learning, but asks instead about how the data was processed with regard to their own qualifications,"" explains Rohlfing.
""When people interact with one another, the dialogue between them ensures that an explanation is tailored to the understanding of the other person. The dialogue partner asks questions for further explanation or can express incomprehension which is then resolved. In the case of artificial intelligence there are limitations to this because of the limited scope for interaction,"" continues Rohlfing. To address this, linguists, psychologists, media researchers, sociologists, economists and computer scientists are working closely together in an interdisciplinary team. These experts are investigating computer models and complex AI systems as well as roles in communicative interaction.






Explanation as a social practice
The Paderborn and Bielefeld researchers have developed a conceptual framework for the design of explainable AI systems. Rohlfing says: ""Our approach enables AI systems to answer selected questions in such a way that the process can be configured interactively. In this way an explanation can be tailored to the dialogue partner, and social aspects can be included in decision-making."" The research team regards explanations as a sequence of actions brought together by both parties in a form of social practice.
The aim is for this to be guided by 'scaffolding' and 'monitoring.' These terms come originally from the field of developmental studies. ""To put it simply, scaffolding describes a method in which learning processes are supported by prompts and guidance, and are broken down into partial steps. Monitoring means observing and evaluating the reactions of the other party,"" explains Rohlfing. The researchers' objective is to apply these principles to AI systems.
New forms of assistance
This approach aims to expand on current research and provide new answers to societal challenges in connection with artificial intelligence. The underlying assumption is that the only successful way to derive understanding and further action from an explanation is to involve the dialogue partner in the process of explanation. At its core, this is about human participation in socio-technical systems. ""Our objective is to create new forms of communication with genuinely explainable and understandable AI systems, and in this way to facilitate new forms of assistance,"" says Rohlfing in summary.

Despite years of hype, virtual reality headsets have yet to topple TV or computer screens as the go-to devices for video viewing. One reason: VR can make users feel sick. Nausea and eye strain can result because VR creates an illusion of 3D viewing although the user is in fact staring at a fixed-distance 2D display. The solution for better 3D visualization could lie in a 60-year-old technology remade for the digital world: holograms.
Holograms deliver an exceptional representation of 3D world around us. Plus, they’re beautiful. (Go ahead — check out the holographic dove on your Visa card.) Holograms offer a shifting perspective based on the viewer’s position, and they allow the eye to adjust focal depth to alternately focus on foreground and background.
Researchers have long sought to make computer-generated holograms, but the process has traditionally required a supercomputer to churn through physics simulations, which is time-consuming and can yield less-than-photorealistic results. Now, MIT researchers have developed a new way to produce holograms almost instantly — and the deep learning-based method is so efficient that it can run on a laptop in the blink of an eye, the researchers say.
“People previously thought that with existing consumer-grade hardware, it was impossible to do real-time 3D holography computations,” says Liang Shi, the study’s lead author and a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). “It’s often been said that commercially available holographic displays will be around in 10 years, yet this statement has been around for decades.”
Shi believes the new approach, which the team calls “tensor holography,” will finally bring that elusive 10-year goal within reach. The advance could fuel a spillover of holography into fields like VR and 3D printing.
Shi worked on the study, published today in Nature, with his advisor and co-author Wojciech Matusik. Other co-authors include Beichen Li of EECS and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, as well as former MIT researchers Changil Kim (now at Facebook) and Petr Kellnhofer (now at Stanford University).
The quest for better 3D
A typical lens-based photograph encodes the brightness of each light wave — a photo can faithfully reproduce a scene’s colors, but it ultimately yields a flat image.
In contrast, a hologram encodes both the brightness and phase of each light wave. That combination delivers a truer depiction of a scene’s parallax and depth. So, while a photograph of Monet’s “Water Lilies” can highlight the paintings’ color palate, a hologram can bring the work to life, rendering the unique 3D texture of each brush stroke. But despite their realism, holograms are a challenge to make and share.
First developed in the mid-1900s, early holograms were recorded optically. That required splitting a laser beam, with half the beam used to illuminate the subject and the other half used as a reference for the light waves’ phase. This reference generates a hologram’s unique sense of depth.  The resulting images were static, so they couldn’t capture motion. And they were hard copy only, making them difficult to reproduce and share.
Computer-generated holography sidesteps these challenges by simulating the optical setup. But the process can be a computational slog. “Because each point in the scene has a different depth, you can’t apply the same operations for all of them,” says Shi. “That increases the complexity significantly.” Directing a clustered supercomputer to run these physics-based simulations could take seconds or minutes for a single holographic image. Plus, existing algorithms don’t model occlusion with photorealistic precision. So Shi’s team took a different approach: letting the computer teach physics to itself.
They used deep learning to accelerate computer-generated holography, allowing for real-time hologram generation. The team designed a convolutional neural network — a processing technique that uses a chain of trainable tensors to roughly mimic how humans process visual information. Training a neural network typically requires a large, high-quality dataset, which didn’t previously exist for 3D holograms.
The team built a custom database of 4,000 pairs of computer-generated images. Each pair matched a picture — including color and depth information for each pixel — with its corresponding hologram. To create the holograms in the new database, the researchers used scenes with complex and variable shapes and colors, with the depth of pixels distributed evenly from the background to the foreground, and with a new set of physics-based calculations to handle occlusion. That approach resulted in photorealistic training data. Next, the algorithm got to work.
By learning from each image pair, the tensor network tweaked the parameters of its own calculations, successively enhancing its ability to create holograms. The fully optimized network operated orders of magnitude faster than physics-based calculations. That efficiency surprised the team themselves.
“We are amazed at how well it performs,” says Matusik. In mere milliseconds, tensor holography can craft holograms from images with depth information — which is provided by typical computer-generated images and can be calculated from a multicamera setup or LiDAR sensor (both are standard on some new smartphones). This advance paves the way for real-time 3D holography. What’s more, the compact tensor network requires less than 1 MB of memory. “It’s negligible, considering the tens and hundreds of gigabytes available on the latest cell phone,” he says.
The research “shows that true 3D holographic displays are practical with only moderate computational requirements,” says Joel Kollin, a principal optical architect at Microsoft who was not involved with the research. He adds that “this paper shows marked improvement in image quality over previous work,” which will “add realism and comfort for the viewer.” Kollin also hints at the possibility that holographic displays like this could even be customized to a viewer’s ophthalmic prescription. “Holographic displays can correct for aberrations in the eye. This makes it possible for a display image sharper than what the user could see with contacts or glasses, which only correct for low order aberrations like focus and astigmatism.”
“A considerable leap”
Real-time 3D holography would enhance a slew of systems, from VR to 3D printing. The team says the new system could help immerse VR viewers in more realistic scenery, while eliminating eye strain and other side effects of long-term VR use. The technology could be easily deployed on displays that modulate the phase of light waves. Currently, most affordable consumer-grade displays modulate only brightness, though the cost of phase-modulating displays would fall if widely adopted.
Three-dimensional holography could also boost the development of volumetric 3D printing, the researchers say. This technology could prove faster and more precise than traditional layer-by-layer 3D printing, since volumetric 3D printing allows for the simultaneous projection of the entire 3D pattern. Other applications include microscopy, visualization of medical data, and the design of surfaces with unique optical properties.
“It’s a considerable leap that could completely change people’s attitudes toward holography,” says Matusik. “We feel like neural networks were born for this task.”
The work was supported, in part, by Sony.

Will 2021 finally be the year when AI-powered technologies find widespread acceptance in the world of work? Our six-part series on AI in HR is going to deep dive into every facet of AI in HR. 
While HR is not known for pioneering nascent technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a terrific opportunity. The consumerization of HR technologies has brought AI to the forefront of innovation in HR. From recruitment to employee experience, and talent management, AI has the potential to transform HR.
This issue of Succeeding with AI in HR will provide you with a basic understanding of what AI is, its applications in HR, and how it works. This issue is split into three parts: 1) AI basics, 2) the business case for AI in HR, and 3) five critical HR areas that AI is transforming.
PART 1: AI BASICS IN THE HR CONTEXT
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence. In other words, AI enables machines to “think like humans,” and perform tasks such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and language processing. Today, AI is being driven by two fundamental technologies – machine learning and deep learning.(Click here to read: The complete history of AIOpens a new window )
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from and make predictions based on data. The roots of machine learning are embedded in pattern recognition and the concept that algorithms can learn from recorded data without being programmed to do so. For instance, an algorithm that needs to identify cars will rely on images of other cars to teach itself what looks like a car. In this case, the end objective of the algorithm has been defined – which is to identify a car, but the steps to arrive at the objective is learned by the machine itself by training on data.

Key use cases of Machine Learning in the HR context:



Anomaly detection: Identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.
Background verification: Machine learning-powered predictive models can extract meaning and raise red flags based on structured and unstructured data points from applicants’ resumes.
Employee Attrition: Find employees who are at high risk of attrition, enabling HR to proactively engage with them and retain them.
Content personalization: Provide a more personalized employee experience by using predictive analytics to recommend career paths, professional development programs or optimize a career site based on prior applicant actions.



What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that trains a computer to learn from large amounts of data through neural network architecture. It is a more advanced form of machine learning that breaks down data into layers of abstraction. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using multiple neural network layers for processing (like neurons in the brain).
Considering the same car analogy from above, a deep learning algorithm can distinguish between a car and a truck by identifying the relationships between core elements of a car and a truck (car – 4 wheels, no loading bed; truck – 4 or more wheels, has a loading bed, etc.).
After sufficient training, deep learning algorithms can begin to make predictions or interpretations of very complex data.
Key use cases of Deep Learning in the HR Context:



Image and video recognition: Deep learning algorithms outperform humans in object classification. Given videos and photos of thousands of applicants, deep learning systems can identify and classify candidates based on objective data.
Speech recognition: While understanding human voice and myriad accents is difficult for most machines, deep learning algorithms can be designed to recognize and respond to human voice inputs. Virtual assistants use speech recognition algorithms to process human voice and respond accordingly.
Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) trains chatbots and similar systems to understand human language, tone, and context. NLP will emerge as a crucial capability for AI systems as organizations continue to automate HR service delivery with chatbots.
Recommendation engines: Digital learning experiences often involve personalized learning recommendations related to skill levels and professional interests. Using Big Data and Deep Learning, learning experience platforms can identify learning pathways that might interest individual employees.



PART 2: The Business Case for Artificial Intelligence in HR
Until recently, the primary benefits of HR technology were to improve efficiency and drive cost-savings by automating repetitive tasks. Today, smarter technologies are enabling HR teams to solve critical business challenges, drive exponential performance improvements and even impact larger business outcomes and profitability. AI is fueling HR’s transition from administrative to strategic to mission critical.



Fig. 1
Sandy Michelet, Director of People Strategy at SparkhoundOpens a new window  says, “AI will make HR more effective. End of story. It will not solve all problems but will allow HR to transfer their time currently spent on repetitive and administrative tasks to a more strategic approach. Many believe that AI will reduce human contact in HR but I believe it will do the exact opposite. Instead of an HR Generalist answering the same questions again and again, s/he can use that time discussing an employee’s development or internal process improvement.”
The top three business reasons for deploying AI in HR:
1. Employee experience
A recent surveyOpens a new window  by Deloitte revealed that while nearly 80 percent of executives rate employee experience as important, only 22 percent believe their organization excels at providing a differentiated employee experience. The next competitive frontier for businesses is employee experience and the future of HR will be centered on the employee experience and personalizing engagement. In a time when employees have smart assistants at home and recommendation engines for when they shop, they expect a personalized experience when they come to work.
Speaking about how consumer technologies are shaping employee expectations at work, Jennifer Stroud, HR Evangelist & Transformation Leader at ServiceNowOpens a new window , says, “We have seen the need for chatbots, AI and machine learning in the workplace to drive more productivity as well as modern, consumerized employee experiences. These consumer technology solutions are exactly what employees want in the workplace.” 
A recent survey by ServiceNowOpens a new window  revealed that 30 percent of employees want a “Google-like” option to easily get the help and information they need at work. “Voice technology in the workplace is also a key consideration. Our survey found that 16 percent of employees want Siri, but to help answer work questions.  Beyond these considerations, an effective solution must be mobile, personal and provide the employee with options in terms of how they wish to engage and be supported,” adds Jennifer.
AI can be effectively woven into the entire employee lifecycle, starting with recruitment and onboarding, to HR service delivery and career pathing, to provide bespoke employee experiences.
2. Data-driven decision making
HR agility has emerged as a critical theme for organizations in the war for talent. And HR agility is determined by the pace at which HR leaders can make sound business decisions. Unfortunately, for many organizations, the data-to-decision workflow looks like the figure below:



Fig. 2
While HR technology has made real-time data available to businesses, many still rely on manual methods to draw insights from data. This task is often left to end users or data analysts. This creates a bottleneck when trying to draw insights – causing delays. Decisions also continue to be made with outdated information.
AI helps HR teams extract insights from data and deliver recommendations in real time. Natural Language Generation (NLG) software has the ability to transform data into data-driven text automatically, which makes it a valuable asset for HR teams across industries. AI also has the potential to remove many of the common human biases and inconsistencies in a function as sensitive to such factors as Human Capital Management. Thus, decisions powered by AI have the potential to be faster at scale and more data-informed, as well as more consistent, and unbiased.
3. Intelligent automation

Intelligent automation combines AI with automation to enable machines to sense, understand, learn and act – either independently or with human assistance. Intelligent automation can perform not only manual tasks but also make intelligent decisions as a human would. Intelligent automation capabilities can enable machines to understand processes and their variations. Intelligent automation can be deployed across all repetitive manual processes to boost efficiency, productivity, and drive innovation.
AI in HR opens the door to limitless opportunities – imagine if an employee could learn new skills to match the pace of technological advances; they would be in complete control of their career! Now that’s an employee experience anyone would appreciate. As business performance becomes the focal point of all long-term HR strategies, AI has emerged as the most valuable ally for HR professionals.
PART 3: AI Is Transforming 5 Crucial Areas of HR
Increased investment in smarter HR technologies has led to some interesting innovations in the AI ‒ HR space. Here’s a quick overview of the most significant ways AI is transforming HR for the better:

AI in Recruitment:Opens a new window  AI has made candidate sourcing, screening, and matching easier for organizations. In addition to improving efficiency, AI is also helping HR leaders overcome human-bias in decision making.Tammy Cohen, Founder and Chief Visionary Office of InfoMartOpens a new window , believes, “Language within job descriptions steers diverse, qualified candidates away from a position. Gender-coded language, which is language that lends itself towards the ideas and stereotypes surrounding different genders, can subconsciously deter qualified talent. For example, a man is less likely to apply for a job ad that describes the ideal candidate as ‘feisty,’ while a woman is less likely to apply for a job ad that seeks a ‘domineering’ candidate. When writing job descriptions, the employer may not mean to make these mistakes; everyone, in some ways, uses gender-coded language. That’s where artificial intelligence comes into play.”“AI systems are being used to create inclusive job descriptions and review them for gender-coded language. With several large corporations embracing this on a company-wide level, it stands to reason that AI-augmented job descriptions will become more common,” she says.Here are some of the key use cases of AI in recruiting:




Candidate sourcing
Lead nurturing
Candidate screening
Interviewing
Onboarding




AI in HCMOpens a new window : AI is enabling organizations to meet increasing employee expectations by helping HR teams reimagine people and talent processes to build stronger teams, reduce employee turnover, and enhance the employee experience. A few major impact areas for AI in HCM include:




Performance management
Workforce planning
People analytics
Virtual assistants for self-service/HR service delivery
Career pathing
Leadership and coaching




AI in Employee Engagement: AI has been a catalyst for how businesses interact with their employees. Key uses cases include:

Personalized messaging and communication




AI in Employee Benefits: AI and automation can ease the administration, implementation as well as management of employee benefits. Sparkhound deployed a chatbot to help demystify benefits for employees. Sandy says she’s already seeing positive outcomes from the deployment. She says, “We recently launched an HR BOT to answer the top 30 benefits questions we’ve received over the last four years. Part of the launch included a feedback button so we can continuously improve. Although it was a soft launch, I am already hearing positive comments about the ease of use and the immediate responsiveness. Right now, many employees (and HR people) believe that HR’s role is to provide human involvement every time the manager or employee needs assistance. I understand why….that has been the culture of companies since HR was called a ‘personnel department’. That was before everyone had a cell phone in their hand, shopped online and chatted with customer service.” 

Key use cases of AI in benefits administration include:



Benefits personalization
Benefits automation
Benefits communication
Benefits compliance




AI in Learning and Development (L&D): In the current talent landscape, where skills have a shorter shelf life than ever before, AI could prove to be the game changer. AI is enabling learning platforms to replicate the qualities of successful consumer content platforms like YouTube and Netflix to improve learning outcomes. Some of the key impact areas of AI in L&D include:




Personalized learning pathways
eLearning analytics
Conversational interfaces

Releases 2021 guide on AI use cases and best practices distilled from publishers, agencies, and ad tech
NEW YORK (March 9, 2021) – The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the national trade association for the digital media and marketing industries, is focusing its AI Standards Working Group to develop artificial intelligence (AI) standards, best practices, use cases, and terminologies in an effort to scale AI and enable the industry on its full potential. The group is newly co-chaired by IBM Watson Advertising and Nielsen.
The first release of 2021, “Artificial Intelligence Use Cases and Best Practices for Marketing,” will help executive leaders, marketers, and technologists get the most from AI, and do it responsibly.
Created for those already working with AI or looking to leverage it in their business, this guide draws directly from the real-world experience of co-chairs IBM Watson Advertising and Nielsen as well as top publishers, agencies, and ad tech companies in the industry. It’s not an ivory tower overview of AI: it’s a specific guide for what to do for executives that are in the thick of it.
The marketing industry has a compelling need for a set of agreed-upon standards that will set the course for leveraging AI across the open web. With the industry facing transformation on every front, setting the right foundation for AI is critical.
“AI is the only technology that can keep up with the petabytes of data that are the hallmark of successful digital marketing playbooks today,” said Angelina Eng, Vice President, Measurement & Attribution, Programmatic+Data Center, IAB. “But AI should not be blindly trusted. The IAB AI Standards Working Group is helping define the groundwork and best practices the industry needs to ensure privacy, measurement, and addressability. Ultimately, this will lead to creating agreed-upon standards.”
The guide includes nine use cases spanning internal robotic process automation and data migration for agencies to AI use cases for creative, contextual, video, and beyond.
As just one example, AI is critical in the journey to stitch together the fractured media ecosystem. It’s no longer the case that all media come through a single TV at home. Every household is now full of individuals with multiple devices, applications, and accounts that are shared, used independently, or all together.
“We’ve created similar playbooks that leverage AI for industries facing significant disruption. We are excited about today’s announcement and the contributions we know AI can offer digital media as it navigates unprecedented disruption,” said David Olesnevich, Head of Product, IBM Watson Advertising, and IAB AI Standards Working Group Co-Chair. “The work of the IAB AI Standards Working Group and the greater AI Standards’ Guide ensures that industry collaboration will be at the forefront of innovation when scaling this advanced technology across the open web.”
The unique insights in the guide are driven by conversations about real-world challenges faced daily by the industry’s biggest brands. It provides a practical understanding of what works and what doesn’t, helping to illuminate what’s possible now.
“With the increasing fragmentation of media and the proliferation of devices, measuring audience reach is harder than ever, “said Mainak Mazumdar, Chief Data & Research Officer, Nielsen, and IAB AI Standards Working Group Co-Chair. “But with high-quality training data such as panels and device signals, AI can be used to develop identity to better understand and measure who is using the device, app, or account as well as correct for biases due to co-viewing and device sharing.”
The guide is the result of a unique collaboration that brings together AI and machine learning (ML) thought leaders and expert practitioners from the industry’s top publishers, agencies, and ad tech companies and is aimed at technologically sophisticated executives already racing ahead with AI.
The AI Use Cases and Best Practices for Marketing guide, which can be downloaded at iab.com/ai-use-cases, will help executives separate AI hype from reality, identify the keys to success, and build future-ready brands, agencies, and ad tech organizations.

Intelligent machines toil in place of office workers and serve as dutiful companions, or “Artificial Friends.” Some children have themselves become another form of AI, having had their intelligence upgraded via genetic engineering. These enhanced, or “lifted,” humans create a social schism, dividing people into an elite ruling order and an underclass of the unmodified and grudgingly idle.Klara and the Sun, Ishiguro’s first book since he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017, builds upon themes that recur in his previous work—loss and regret, sacrifice and longing, a sense of reality unmoored. But technology takes a more central role, and Ishiguro uses artificial intelligence, both biological and mechanized, to reflect on what it is to be human.Trending NowCrispr Is Already Changing the Food We Eat | WIRED BizConThis vision of the future also speaks to Ishiguro’s feelings about the present. As he tells WIRED, the novel was inspired by recent technological advances, and a desire to understand where these advances could lead humanity.Ishiguro spoke to WIRED from his home in London via Zoom. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.AdvertisementWIRED: Klara and the Sun looks at what happens when some people can be enhanced genetically—something that may soon be possible thanks to the Crispr technology. How did you become interested in that?Kazuo Ishiguro: I first heard about it when my New York literary agent sent me a clipping. This was when the first real breakthrough had been made by Jennifer Doudna, and I immediately thought, wow, this is going to do interesting things to our society.If you’re of my generation—I'm 66—a lot of what's happened in the world has, in one way or the other, been to do with struggles against unjust hierarchies, class systems, colonial systems, castes according to skin color. When I heard about this, I thought, well, actually, it's going to make a meritocracy something quite savage.But I was excited by it as well. I was lucky enough to meet Doudna, in 2017, at a conference in London, and I got very interested in the whole thing.Crispr is an absolute breakthrough because it's so accurate, it's relatively cheap, and it's relatively easy to do. This means that its benefits can be with us very, very quickly.Already, I understand, there are people who have been cured of sickle cell and other blood related illnesses. The possibilities, in terms of medicines and also in terms of producing food, are enormous.But by the very fact that it’s relatively cheap and relatively easy to do, it’s going to be very hard to regulate. And I can see that a lot of the energy behind Crispr is in the private sector. It’s not under the traditional government or university auspices, so oversight is going to be difficult.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDMy question is, how do you build the platforms for debate and discussion in our society so that everyone can participate in the discussion? I think it's kind of odd that people are not more aware of it. People seem to be much more aware of AI, and people like to talk about that.I was about to ask about AI actually, since Klara and the Sun is set in a time of intelligent machines. Are you similarly excited—and also troubled—by recent progress in artificial intelligence, things like AlphaGo?Well, AlphaGo has been superseded several times. But what was interesting about AlphaGo’s success against Lee Sedol, the Korean Go champion, a few years ago, was the manner in which it won. It played in a completely different style. It made moves that made people fall about laughing, but the really hilarious, idiotic move proved to be the sensational one. And I think that opened the possibility of all kinds of things.I remember raising the question with a very leading AI expert about whether there could be a program that could write novels. Not just novels that would pass some sort of Turing test, but novels that would really move people or make people cry. I thought that was interesting.What did the expert say?Well, OK, I was talking to Demis Hassabis [cofounder of DeepMind], and he was quite interested in this idea. We talked about it over a number of conversations, and I think the key question here is: Can AI actually get to that empathy, by understanding human emotions, controlling them through something like a work of art?Once it gets to the point where an AI program, AlphaTolstoy or whatever, can actually make me laugh and cry, and see the world in a different way, I think we've reached an interesting point, if not quite a dangerous point. Nevermind Cambridge Analytica. If it can do that to me, then it understands human emotions well enough to be able to run a political campaign. It can identify the frustrations and angers and emotions in the nation, or in the world at large, and know what to do with that.Courtesy of Penguin Random HouseBuy this book at:AmazonBookshop.orgBooks-A-MillionApple BooksIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.The novel also considers how a person’s personality might be captured and re-created algorithmically. Why are you interested in that?Klara and the Sun just accepts a world in which big data, algorithms, these things have become so much part of our lives. And in that world, human beings are starting to look at each other in a different way. Our assumption about what a human individual is and what's inside each unique human individual—what makes them unique—these things are a little bit different because we live in a world where we see all these possibilities of being able to excavate and map out people's personalities.Is that going to change our feelings toward each other, particularly when we’re under pressure? When you actually face the prospect of losing somebody you love, I think then you really, really start to ask that question, not just intellectually but emotionally. What does this person mean? What is this loss? What kind of strategies can I put up to defend myself from the pain?I think the question becomes something very very real then. It's not just an abstract philosophical question about, you know, the ghost in the machine, whether you have some sort of traditional religious idea of a soul or a more modern idea of a set of things that can be reduced to algorithms, albeit vast and complicated one.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDSo it becomes a very human and very emotional question. What the hell is a human being, what's inside their mind and how irreplaceable is any one human? Those are the questions that, as a novelist, I'm interested in.Artificial intelligence isn’t yet close to this. Should we still worry about what it can do?In general, that question, about human oversight, is one that we need to be thinking about right now. In the popular discourse, the thing seems to revolve around whether the robots are going to kind of take us over, a kind of crazy zombie vampire kind of scenario, except featuring kind of sophisticated AI robots. That might be a serious concern, I don't know, but it's not one of the things that I'm particularly worried about. I think there are other things that are much more on our doorstep that we have to worry about.The nature of this generation of machine learning, which I understand is called reinforcement learning, is quite different to the old forms [of AI], never mind just programming a computer. It's just about giving an AI program a goal, and then we kind of lose control of what it does thereafter. And so I think there is this issue about how we could really hardwire the prejudices and biases of our age into black boxes, and won't be able to unpack them. What seemed like perfectly decent normal ideas a few years ago, now we object to as grossly unjust or worse. But we can go back on them because we can actually see how they're made. What about when we become very dependent on recommendations, advice, and decisions made by AI?A lot of people who know far, far more than I do about these things have expressed skepticism about the whole idea of having a human in the loop—allowing a human being to kind of supervise that process. It's just completely fanciful because we're just gonna be so way, way behind, there's no way that we're gonna be able to keep up.There’s been a lot of talk about AI ethics recently. Do you think big tech companies should lead that discussion?Maybe you can tell me—what is the consensus as far as you can see about the wish to open up the discussion? I can't quite figure out whether the people who are our most heavily invested in developing AI, whether their real position is one of secrecy? That they don't want oversight and they don't really want people talking about it very much. Or is it the reverse, that they're saying, “We're doing all this but it's up to you to think very carefully?”I think there are people who have those motives, but the momentum of these big companies tends to drive toward controlling the discussion, making sure that it doesn't go in directions that affect the business.I have noticed that even in the last three or four years AI companies do seem to be much more cautious about publicity. But I don't know if it's just some sort of PR exercise, this idea that it could be a partnership between human beings and machines, in the way that we've always had partnerships between human beings and machines. I don't know if that's a sincere belief, or whether it's just a way of trying to head off alarm in the general public.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDI guess I'm asking fundamentally if the ultimate goal is to always have this partnership between human beings and machines, or is the ultimate goal that, well, we just come to rely on the machines because the human mind is just going to be contaminating, it’s going to be so, so behind that it is absurd. It is going to be a nominal, token presence, like one night watchman in a stadium full of machines.The AI researchers that I talk to are trying to build things that are, in every way, as smart as us. It’s unclear what happens after that.This will be a major challenge for us, I think. If it is the case that this isn't like the traditional rounds of automation where you know one set of jobs disappear but new sets of jobs appear—and a lot of people think it isn't—we will have to rethink the way we've run our societies for centuries. That old system where each of us contributes to a larger enterprise, and we get paid, and then we use that money to fund our private lives and feed our families and so on, that system is going to have to be rethought.And not just in terms of the material way we distribute money and stuff but also in terms of prestige and a sense of self-respect.I think one of the things that we do seem to have very hardwired into us as human beings is this need to contribute to the larger community around us. If I don't do it, I feel bad in some kind of way and I'm also inclined to think badly of people who don't.The big question I would have about all of this is how do we build forums in which one can have this discussion in a meaningful way.Do you have any ideas for how to do that?Ha, no, I don’t. Because, you know, out of necessity we're talking about something that is global and international. It's not a good time for international institutions at the moment. Also, to what extent are the people who really know willing to encourage meaningful discussion, or to give out information so we can have a meaningful discussion?I don't think the people in Silicon Valley, or wherever they are, are a monolithic group that would all hold the same view on this. Different people have different views and possibly they have different interests, but what I would ask is what do they want from the rest of us?Returning to the book, Klara is quite a likable character, for an AI. Should technologists try to make sure their creations are as nice?One of the things is that it may be difficult to predict whether the AI program or the robot is going to be what we would define as nice or not. As you know, reinforcement learning just relies on that central reward function, and I understand there is this term called overfitting, which is that it behaves in a way that we wouldn't quite predict. It goes about trying to fulfill its goal in a way that actually is very destructive to us.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDMaybe you can give AI these kinds of Isaac Asimov type rules, maybe you could do something like that, but I can't see it. I mean, and we can't decide amongst ourselves, without robots, what is desirable, what is nice and what isn't. In the country you're living in, even the question of what freedom, or what democracy, means [isn’t clear]. A lot of people think freedom means that you riot in the Capitol building to reinstate democracy.The big thing I'm trying to say is, how do we get the conversation going? Different parts of our culture have roles to play. I think people who write books, people who make these blockbuster television series, have quite a big role to play. And I think there have been some very interesting TV series, like Westworld, that kind of raise these questions. But you know we need the conversation to get more urgent and more serious.The past year has, of course, been incredibly difficult and different. Has it been an inspiration to you as a novelist?One thing I have to say about the pandemic is that a staggering number of people have died, and this is something that I don't think we've quite kind of woken up to. We're talking about a scale of death that is just extraordinary. Right now there are millions of people around the world kind of shocked and bereaved having lost somebody close to them. And I think the emotional damage of this is going to be colossal.But we’re focusing, and it's understandable, on how the high street might change and Zoom and working from home. But the big, big thing about this is this level of death. In Britain, you know over 130,000 people died in the past year, which is more than twice the civilian death toll of the Second World War. I heard one commentator say recently that the half a million dead mark in the United States means that it’s more dead than the combination of the two world wars and Vietnam.I don't think we can go through a situation like this where so many people have died, and so many people are bereaved, and there is a sense that things were not done correctly, without something. Without actually there being a major consequence of that. And I'm not quite sure what that is.The other thing, I wouldn't say it's an inspiration, it's just what I've observed, is that there is this kind of strange contradictory thing happening—these two different versions of the truth or how you look for the truth seem to come to the fore with a vengeance in the last few months.On the one hand, we've come to rely desperately on the scientific method where people say, show me the evidence, peer review the evidence. And at the same time we have a situation where half of the people in the United States believe that Donald Trump won the election but had it stolen from him because they wish to believe it. The idea is that the truth is what you wish to believe. Feel it emotionally strongly enough in your heart.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPeople like me have placed so much emphasis on the importance of emotional truth; I create things like novels that are supposed to kind of move people. And it has made me kind of pause a moment. Looking at these two completely opposed attitudes to coexisting in a massive way in our lives at the moment, I kind of wonder if I actually contributed to this idea of what you feel is the truth.I'm conscious that we've gone a bit dark in this interview.Yes! Klara and the Sun is supposed to be a cheerful, optimistic book!Well, finally then, let me ask how optimistic you are about the future.Well, I think these areas [of science and technology] that we've talked about can bring us enormous benefits. It could happen. If we can rise to the challenge of using these incredible tools in a positive way, I think we’ve got a lot to look forward to.In terms of liberal democracy and how it's been shown to be very fragile, I don’t know, I do feel rather shaken about that. I think there are very strong competitive models now to liberal democracy that weren't around 30 years ago. And I'm not saying that, you know, things like artificial intelligence will actually help regimes that are not liberal democratic regimes but, I mean, that's not inconceivable.It might take away the advantage that liberal democratic societies had over authoritarian ones or centrally planned ones. With sophisticated artificial intelligence perhaps the Soviet Union would have thrived, perhaps they would have produced more luxury goods than the West, and we would be envying their supermarket choices.But if I have cause for optimism, it’s the optimism I tried to put into Klara and the Sun. I think there are positive aspects of human beings, and some of that I think is hardwired into us, almost in the way that things are programmed into a creature like Klara. She is kind of a reflection of human nature, and she mirrors back human society that she learns from. I picked up the parental thing—nurture and protect—but there are many things about human beings that do seem to be hardwired into us, and I think that continues to give us hope.All these breakthroughs in science, I think they could be great. But, you know, we've got to be ready for them.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!If you transplant a head, does its consciousness follow?A trippy visualization charts the internet's growth since 1997Who is R.

I remember raising the question with a very leading AI expert about whether there could be a program that could write novels. Not just novels that would pass some sort of Turing test, but novels that would really move people or make people cry. I thought that was interesting.
What did the expert say?
Well, OK, I was talking to Demis Hassabis [cofounder of DeepMind], and he was quite interested in this idea. We talked about it over a number of conversations, and I think the key question here is: Can AI actually get to that empathy, by understanding human emotions, controlling them through something like a work of art?
Once it gets to the point where an AI program, AlphaTolstoy or whatever, can actually make me laugh and cry, and see the world in a different way, I think we've reached an interesting point, if not quite a dangerous point. Nevermind Cambridge Analytica. If it can do that to me, then it understands human emotions well enough to be able to run a political campaign. It can identify the frustrations and angers and emotions in the nation, or in the world at large, and know what to do with that.
The novel also considers how a person’s personality might be captured and re-created algorithmically. Why are you interested in that?
Klara and the Sun just accepts a world in which big data, algorithms, these things have become so much part of our lives. And in that world, human beings are starting to look at each other in a different way. Our assumption about what a human individual is and what's inside each unique human individual—what makes them unique—these things are a little bit different because we live in a world where we see all these possibilities of being able to excavate and map out people's personalities.
Is that going to change our feelings toward each other, particularly when we’re under pressure? When you actually face the prospect of losing somebody you love, I think then you really, really start to ask that question, not just intellectually but emotionally. What does this person mean? What is this loss? What kind of strategies can I put up to defend myself from the pain?
I think the question becomes something very very real then. It's not just an abstract philosophical question about, you know, the ghost in the machine, whether you have some sort of traditional religious idea of a soul or a more modern idea of a set of things that can be reduced to algorithms, albeit vast and complicated one.
So it becomes a very human and very emotional question. What the hell is a human being, what's inside their mind and how irreplaceable is any one human? Those are the questions that, as a novelist, I'm interested in.
Artificial intelligence isn’t yet close to this. Should we still worry about what it can do?
In general, that question, about human oversight, is one that we need to be thinking about right now. In the popular discourse, the thing seems to revolve around whether the robots are going to kind of take us over, a kind of crazy zombie vampire kind of scenario, except featuring kind of sophisticated AI robots. That might be a serious concern, I don't know, but it's not one of the things that I'm particularly worried about. I think there are other things that are much more on our doorstep that we have to worry about.
The nature of this generation of machine learning, which I understand is called reinforcement learning, is quite different to the old forms [of AI], never mind just programming a computer. It's just about giving an AI program a goal, and then we kind of lose control of what it does thereafter. And so I think there is this issue about how we could really hardwire the prejudices and biases of our age into black boxes, and won't be able to unpack them. What seemed like perfectly decent normal ideas a few years ago, now we object to as grossly unjust or worse. But we can go back on them because we can actually see how they're made. What about when we become very dependent on recommendations, advice, and decisions made by AI?
A lot of people who know far, far more than I do about these things have expressed skepticism about the whole idea of having a human in the loop—allowing a human being to kind of supervise that process. It's just completely fanciful because we're just gonna be so way, way behind, there's no way that we're gonna be able to keep up.
There’s been a lot of talk about AI ethics recently. Do you think big tech companies should lead that discussion?
Maybe you can tell me—what is the consensus as far as you can see about the wish to open up the discussion? I can't quite figure out whether the people who are our most heavily invested in developing AI, whether their real position is one of secrecy? That they don't want oversight and they don't really want people talking about it very much. Or is it the reverse, that they're saying, “We're doing all this but it's up to you to think very carefully?”
I think there are people who have those motives, but the momentum of these big companies tends to drive toward controlling the discussion, making sure that it doesn't go in directions that affect the business.
I have noticed that even in the last three or four years AI companies do seem to be much more cautious about publicity. But I don't know if it's just some sort of PR exercise, this idea that it could be a partnership between human beings and machines, in the way that we've always had partnerships between human beings and machines. I don't know if that's a sincere belief, or whether it's just a way of trying to head off alarm in the general public.
I guess I'm asking fundamentally if the ultimate goal is to always have this partnership between human beings and machines, or is the ultimate goal that, well, we just come to rely on the machines because the human mind is just going to be contaminating, it’s going to be so, so behind that it is absurd. It is going to be a nominal, token presence, like one night watchman in a stadium full of machines.
The AI researchers that I talk to are trying to build things that are, in every way, as smart as us. It’s unclear what happens after that.
This will be a major challenge for us, I think. If it is the case that this isn't like the traditional rounds of automation where you know one set of jobs disappear but new sets of jobs appear—and a lot of people think it isn't—we will have to rethink the way we've run our societies for centuries. That old system where each of us contributes to a larger enterprise, and we get paid, and then we use that money to fund our private lives and feed our families and so on, that system is going to have to be rethought.
And not just in terms of the material way we distribute money and stuff but also in terms of prestige and a sense of self-respect.
I think one of the things that we do seem to have very hardwired into us as human beings is this need to contribute to the larger community around us. If I don't do it, I feel bad in some kind of way and I'm also inclined to think badly of people who don't.
The big question I would have about all of this is how do we build forums in which one can have this discussion in a meaningful way.
Do you have any ideas for how to do that?
Ha, no, I don’t. Because, you know, out of necessity we're talking about something that is global and international. It's not a good time for international institutions at the moment. Also, to what extent are the people who really know willing to encourage meaningful discussion, or to give out information so we can have a meaningful discussion?
I don't think the people in Silicon Valley, or wherever they are, are a monolithic group that would all hold the same view on this. Different people have different views and possibly they have different interests, but what I would ask is what do they want from the rest of us?
Returning to the book, Klara is quite a likable character, for an AI. Should technologists try to make sure their creations are as nice?
One of the things is that it may be difficult to predict whether the AI program or the robot is going to be what we would define as nice or not. As you know, reinforcement learning just relies on that central reward function, and I understand there is this term called overfitting, which is that it behaves in a way that we wouldn't quite predict. It goes about trying to fulfill its goal in a way that actually is very destructive to us.
Maybe you can give AI these kinds of Isaac Asimov type rules, maybe you could do something like that, but I can't see it. I mean, and we can't decide amongst ourselves, without robots, what is desirable, what is nice and what isn't. In the country you're living in, even the question of what freedom, or what democracy, means [isn’t clear]. A lot of people think freedom means that you riot in the Capitol building to reinstate democracy.
The big thing I'm trying to say is, how do we get the conversation going? Different parts of our culture have roles to play. I think people who write books, people who make these blockbuster television series, have quite a big role to play. And I think there have been some very interesting TV series, like Westworld, that kind of raise these questions. But you know we need the conversation to get more urgent and more serious.
The past year has, of course, been incredibly difficult and different. Has it been an inspiration to you as a novelist?
One thing I have to say about the pandemic is that a staggering number of people have died, and this is something that I don't think we've quite kind of woken up to. We're talking about a scale of death that is just extraordinary. Right now there are millions of people around the world kind of shocked and bereaved having lost somebody close to them. And I think the emotional damage of this is going to be colossal.
But we’re focusing, and it's understandable, on how the high street might change and Zoom and working from home. But the big, big thing about this is this level of death. In Britain, you know over 130,000 people died in the past year, which is more than twice the civilian death toll of the Second World War. I heard one commentator say recently that the half a million dead mark in the United States means that it’s more dead than the combination of the two world wars and Vietnam.
I don't think we can go through a situation like this where so many people have died, and so many people are bereaved, and there is a sense that things were not done correctly, without something. Without actually there being a major consequence of that. And I'm not quite sure what that is.
The other thing, I wouldn't say it's an inspiration, it's just what I've observed, is that there is this kind of strange contradictory thing happening—these two different versions of the truth or how you look for the truth seem to come to the fore with a vengeance in the last few months.
On the one hand, we've come to rely desperately on the scientific method where people say, show me the evidence, peer review the evidence. And at the same time we have a situation where half of the people in the United States believe that Donald Trump won the election but had it stolen from him because they wish to believe it. The idea is that the truth is what you wish to believe. Feel it emotionally strongly enough in your heart.
People like me have placed so much emphasis on the importance of emotional truth; I create things like novels that are supposed to kind of move people. And it has made me kind of pause a moment. Looking at these two completely opposed attitudes to coexisting in a massive way in our lives at the moment, I kind of wonder if I actually contributed to this idea of what you feel is the truth.
I'm conscious that we've gone a bit dark in this interview.
Yes! Klara and the Sun is supposed to be a cheerful, optimistic book!
Well, finally then, let me ask how optimistic you are about the future.
Well, I think these areas [of science and technology] that we've talked about can bring us enormous benefits. It could happen. If we can rise to the challenge of using these incredible tools in a positive way, I think we’ve got a lot to look forward to.
In terms of liberal democracy and how it's been shown to be very fragile, I don’t know, I do feel rather shaken about that. I think there are very strong competitive models now to liberal democracy that weren't around 30 years ago. And I'm not saying that, you know, things like artificial intelligence will actually help regimes that are not liberal democratic regimes but, I mean, that's not inconceivable.
It might take away the advantage that liberal democratic societies had over authoritarian ones or centrally planned ones. With sophisticated artificial intelligence perhaps the Soviet Union would have thrived, perhaps they would have produced more luxury goods than the West, and we would be envying their supermarket choices.
But if I have cause for optimism, it’s the optimism I tried to put into Klara and the Sun. I think there are positive aspects of human beings, and some of that I think is hardwired into us, almost in the way that things are programmed into a creature like Klara. She is kind of a reflection of human nature, and she mirrors back human society that she learns from. I picked up the parental thing—nurture and protect—but there are many things about human beings that do seem to be hardwired into us, and I think that continues to give us hope.
All these breakthroughs in science, I think they could be great. But, you know, we've got to be ready for them.

Google in collaboration with the Oxford Internet Institute launched ‘The A to Z of AI’ in Arabic, with an objective to make information on Artificial Intelligence more universally accessible. It’s a series of simple, bite-sized explainers to help everyone understand what AI is, how it works and how it’s changing the world.

Search interest for ‘artificial intelligence’ related queries on Google Search has grown due to the growing number of jobs requiring AI skills across the Middle East and North Africa in the last few months. While there’s plenty of information out there on AI, it’s not always easy to distinguish fact from fiction nor find simple explanations. Here are a few things everyone can learn through the new interactive guide:
1. AI is powering practical tools that exist all around us
You’ve probably interacted with AI without even realizing it. Artificial intelligence is the name given to any computer system taught to mimic intelligent human behaviours. These technologies show up in everyday life, whether by helping organize photos on our smartphones or planning a commute to work. They use computer programming to do tasks that have historically required considerable human intellect and work, helping make our lives more efficient. We’ve all seen major progress over the past decade, sparked by faster computers and the introduction of techniques such as machine learning.
2. AI learns from examples in the real world
Just as a child learns through many life examples, the same is true of machine learning algorithms. Datasets are large collections of “examples”, like weather data, photos or music, that we can use to train or “teach” AI. Due to their scale and complexity (think of a dataset made up of extensive maps covering the whole of the known solar system), datasets can be very challenging to build and refine. This is why AI design teams often share datasets for the benefit of the wider scientific community, making it easier to collaborate and build on each other’s research.
3. Incomplete data can lead to bias in AI
AI could form a bias when the data it’s learning from isn’t fully comprehensive and therefore starts leading it toward certain outcomes. Because data is an AI system’s only means of learning, it could end up reproducing imbalances or biases found within the original information. For example, if you were teaching AI to recognise shoes and only showed it imagery of trainers, it wouldn’t learn to recognise high heels, sandals or boots as shoes. To ensure that AI systems are ethical and reduce the risk of bias, programmers design their systems and curate their data vigilantly.
4. AI can help our efforts to spot deepfakes
“Deepfakes” are AI-generated images, speech, music or videos that look real. They work by studying existing real-world imagery or audio, mapping them in detail, then manipulating them to create works of fiction that are disconcertingly true to life. However, there are often some telltale signs that distinguish them from reality; in a deep fake video, voices might sound a bit robotic, or characters may blink less or repeat their hand gestures. AI can help us spot these inconsistencies.
5. It’s impossible to teach AI what it means to be human
As smart as AI is (and will be), it won’t be able to understand everything that humans can. In fact, you could give an AI system all the data in the world and it still wouldn’t reflect or understand, every human being on the planet. That’s because we’re complex, multidimensional characters that sit outside the data that machines use to make sense of things. AI systems are trained and guided by humans. And it’s up to each person to choose how they interact with AI systems and what information they feel comfortable sharing. You decide how much AI gets to learn about you.
‘The A-Z of AI’ guide is also available in English and in many different languages.

Artificial intelligence already recommends movies to viewers, filters spam out of inboxes and suggests friends on social media. Now the technology and some of its creators are going to work to help teachers and students in South Carolina’s K-12 education system.
Two recent projects have given researchers in Clemson University’s School of Computing  a chance to use their knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence to improve K-12 education in the state and eventually the nation. They are collaborating with researchers from the College of Education.
Nathan McNeese
Nathan McNeese and Bart Knijnenburg and their students are helping create a “recommender system” similar to the one Netflix uses to suggest movies, except theirs will help teachers choose a path for professional development.
In a separate project, Knijnenburg and Kelly Caine and their students are helping develop AI-focused education modules for middle school students. The modules will teach math while also showing how AI’s invisible but powerful algorithms track them online.
McNeese and Knijnenburg are assistant professors of human-centered computing, and Caine is Dean’s Associate Professor of human-centered computing. 
Both projects underscore how artificial intelligence is continuing to evolve to meet a growing number of needs and becoming more deeply ingrained in everyday lives.
Clemson University’s researchers are helping take the technology to the next level with projects that vary from inspecting vehicles as they travel an assembly line to detecting malware in cameras and other devices too small for anti-virus software.
Intersection of disciplines
To Clemson officials, the research is further evidence that the most interesting work happens at the intersection of disciplines.
Bart Knijnenburg
“The College of Education and the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences are coming together for interdisciplinary research that addresses some of the most critical needs in the state,” said George J. Petersen, founding dean of the College of Education. “Innovation is key to tackling education issues, and collaborations like these provide a perfect opportunity to put best-in-class innovation into action for the benefit of students, teachers, schools and communities.”
Principal investigators on both projects are faculty members in the College of Education. Jeff Marshall, associate dean of research and graduate programs in the college, is principal investigator on the recommender system research, and Nicole Bannister, associate professor of education, is principal investigator on the module research.
“This partnership brings together some of Clemson University’s best minds,” they said in a joint statement. “The knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence that Drs. McNeese, Knijnenburg and Caine and their students bring to these projects are crucial to making this research succeed. Our goal is for South Carolina’s students and teachers to ultimately benefit most. A better K-12 education system results in a healthier, happier and more prosperous society overall.”
Kelly Caine
‘Human-centered computing at its finest’
McNeese said that when the recommender system is ready for use, teachers will fill out a survey detailing their preferences and needs in professional development. Algorithms will process the data and provide the teachers with feedback.
Recommendations could include pursuing a master’s degree, a credential or an endorsement, all three of which are available through Clemson programs. 
“It’s human-centered computing at its finest,” McNeese said. “We’re going into the context, we’re talking to the user and we’re letting the user guide us with what they want and what they need. And then we’re taking that and doing the behind-the-scenes work to let them know their options. This has never been done for K-12 professional development to my knowledge.”
Knijnenburg said that he is helping create education modules for middle-school students who are online more than previous generations. Those students are leaving digital fingerprints about their interests, behavior and lives. 
“What I’m really hoping to convey is that these algorithms are making these inferences about their lives and their preferences,” he said. “You have to be careful in how you go about online, not just because other people can see it but because these algorithms are making predictions and inferences.”
Nicole Bannister
Some insurers, for example, have explored using social media data to help determine premiums, Knijnenburg said.
Also as part of the project, researchers will use the core principles students learn in their math classes to explain how algorithms work and their consequences
 The modules will be offered online, allowing researchers to capture data, but will be used by students in the physical school classroom. Students will be able to access the modules through their school-issued electronic devices.
Addressing real-world challenges
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said the recommender system and the middle-school modules underscore how the school’s researchers are using AI to address real-world challenges.
“Researchers in the School of Computing are working across disciplines to apply artificial intelligence to a broad range of applications aimed at strengthening education, industry and individual well-being,” she said. “The research we do provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work on the cutting edge of technology in a fast-growing field. Their experiences prepare them for the AI workforce of the future.”
Among those students are Christopher Flathmann and Reza Ghaiumy Anaraky, both Ph.D. students working on the recommender system.
Jeff Marshall 
Flathmann, the son of a special education teacher at Southside Christian School in Greenville, said he wants the recommender system to help get teachers the resources they need. He will have the opportunity to apply his expertise to the task.
“I am fairly good at looking at data and understanding patterns within data and seeing what we want and translating that into something that’s more understandable to people,” he said. “How do we make high-level, complicated computing things understandable to actual people? That’s what I do.”
Artificial intelligence generates a set of options, but it is equally important to communicate those options to individuals, Anaraky said.
Among the questions he is asking are: “How can we give individuals a sense of autonomy? How can we keep them in the loop and empower them to select an option that suits them best?”
Opportunities for undergraduates
The AI experience is also extending to undergraduates outside the School of Computing.
Kyra Derrick, a sophomore middle-level education major, said she recently transferred from Anderson University to Clemson University because she wanted the opportunity to study with Bannister.
Derrick, who is from Summerville, said she plans to interview middle school students about their feelings about math for the module research. 
“It’s going to be a great opportunity to just hear them,” she said. “Middle school students have a lot of thoughts, emotions and opinions. It’s going to be an amazing opportunity to let them feel heard and to be seen and for their opinion to be valued.”
Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, said the two research projects highlight how working across disciplines yields maximum impact.
“These two projects are using artificial intelligence to advance personalized learning in the K-12 education system,” he said. “Both projects serve as examples of how Clemson University research at the intersection of disciplines  is helping solve the present and future challenges that society faces in our education system, while providing world-class educational experiences for students on campus and beyond.”

The prestige that technologies enjoy among global businesses and consumers tends to obscure the mundane efforts and processes required to bring products to market. That is especially true for mass-produced hardware, including PCs and smartphones, whose success depends on watchful vendors overseeing massive, extraordinarily complex manufacturing processes.
Effective planning, scheduling and performance are vital to hitting or missing production goals and satisfying paying customers and shareholders. That is what makes Lenovo’s new Smart Production Planning System particularly intriguing. Lenovo’s solution was recently named a finalist by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) for its Franz Edelman award for operational achievement. Let’s consider it further.
Manufacturing challenges
To begin, what makes planning the manufacture of common products, such as laptop PCs, so difficult? Consider first what might be called “customer variables.” As demand and markets for tech products have evolved, vendors differentiate themselves by offering clients a wide variety of features and options to choose from.
In the case of laptops, those typically include separate brands and product families for specific use cases, such as 2-in-1s, consumer/student laptops, business solutions, gaming laptops and mobile workstations. Then there are optional choices, such as upgrades for CPU/GPU, memory, storage, displays, networking, operating systems and productivity apps. Plus, there are security and other services, warranties, accessories and peripherals.
This is all great for customers, including organizations that can effectively customize orders so that new laptops address their specific business requirements and use cases, as well as the preferences of individual users. But ensuring that those products are assembled correctly and shipped on time poses significant planning challenges.
Fulfilling customer orders typically involves dividing manufacturing processes into tasks that are assigned to specific production lines. Planning and scheduling individual tasks involve other issues, including staff availability, equipment and process status and the availability of tens of thousands of components and raw materials. Effectively managing those scenarios while avoiding known and unknowable pitfalls is what keeps factory planners up at night.
Lenovo’s AI-enabled solution for complex processes
What has Lenovo done to address these challenges? Developed by Lenovo Research, the Smart Production Planning System combines AI technologies and mathematical algorithms, including emerging sequential planning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning, into an easy-to-use optimization decision-making engine for manufacturing. The system also supports autonomous learning: The longer it runs, the smarter it gets.
The Smart Production Planning System has been deployed at Lenovo’s LCFC (HeFei) Electronics Technology facility, the company’s largest global research and manufacturing base. The LCFC’s thousands of employees fulfilled 690,000 customer orders last year, utilizing unique production processes and more than 300,000 different materials to produce over 500 specific PC products.
So how did the Smart Production Planning System do? According to Lenovo, manufacturing planning processes at the LCFC have been reduced from six hours to 90 seconds. Additionally, key performance indicators have also improved significantly. The LCFC facility’s order fulfillment rate has increased by 20 percent and productivity has increased by 18 percent.
The System also supports large-scale collaboration and multi-objective tasks, such as real-time adjustment and configuration according to users’ specific production objectives. LCFC workers can also set hyper-parameters on the System, such as prioritizing individual manufacturing segments’ production goals to keep them aligned with shifts in demand and the manufacturing environment.
Final analysis
According to Lenovo, the Smart Production Planning System at the LCFC is the first time in the industry that AI technology has been deployed to enhance large-scale production scheduling operations. The results are clearly positive, and it will be fascinating to see how the System’s autonomous learning capabilities impact production over time.
The solution reflects well on Lenovo Research and should continue to positively impact the company’s production efficiency and bottom line. Just as importantly, as the System evolves, it should open new commercial opportunities for the company’s service and solution-led efforts in vertical industries. In fact, it seems highly likely that other large-scale manufacturers will want to capture the same kinds of efficiency and performance benefits that the Smart Production Planning System is already providing to Lenovo.

In a perfect world, what you see is what you get. If this were the case, the job of artificial intelligence systems would be refreshingly straightforward.
Take collision avoidance systems in self-driving cars. If visual input to on-board cameras could be trusted entirely, an AI system could directly map that input to an appropriate action — steer right, steer left, or continue straight — to avoid hitting a pedestrian that its cameras see in the road.
But what if there’s a glitch in the cameras that slightly shifts an image by a few pixels? If the car blindly trusted so-called “adversarial inputs,” it might take unnecessary and potentially dangerous action.
A new deep-learning algorithm developed by MIT researchers is designed to help machines navigate in the real, imperfect world, by building a healthy “skepticism” of the measurements and inputs they receive.
The team combined a reinforcement-learning algorithm with a deep neural network, both used separately to train computers in playing video games like Go and chess, to build an approach they call CARRL, for Certified Adversarial Robustness for Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The researchers tested the approach in several scenarios, including a simulated collision-avoidance test and the video game Pong, and found that CARRL performed better — avoiding collisions and winning more Pong games — over standard machine-learning techniques, even in the face of uncertain, adversarial inputs.
“You often think of an adversary being someone who’s hacking your computer, but it could also just be that your sensors are not great, or your measurements aren’t perfect, which is often the case,” says Michael Everett, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro). “Our approach helps to account for that imperfection and make a safe decision. In any safety-critical domain, this is an important approach to be thinking about.”
Everett is the lead author of a study outlining the new approach, which appears in IEEE’s Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. The study originated from MIT PhD student Björn Lütjens’ master’s thesis and was advised by MIT AeroAstro Professor Jonathan How.
Possible realities
To make AI systems robust against adversarial inputs, researchers have tried implementing defenses for supervised learning. Traditionally, a neural network is trained to associate specific labels or actions with given inputs. For instance, a neural network that is fed thousands of images labeled as cats, along with images labeled as houses and hot dogs, should correctly label a new image as a cat.
In robust AI systems, the same supervised-learning techniques could be tested with many slightly altered versions of the image. If the network lands on the same label — cat — for every image, there’s a good chance that, altered or not, the image is indeed of a cat, and the network is robust to any adversarial influence.
But running through every possible image alteration is computationally exhaustive and difficult to apply successfully to time-sensitive tasks such as collision avoidance. Furthermore, existing methods also don’t identify what label to use, or what action to take, if the network is less robust and labels some altered cat images as a house or a hotdog.
“In order to use neural networks in safety-critical scenarios, we had to find out how to take real-time decisions based on worst-case assumptions on these possible realities,” Lütjens says.
The best reward
The team instead looked to build on reinforcement learning, another form of machine learning that does not require associating labeled inputs with outputs, but rather aims to reinforce certain actions in response to certain inputs, based on a resulting reward. This approach is typically used to train computers to play and win games such as chess and Go.
Reinforcement learning has mostly been applied to situations where inputs are assumed to be true. Everett and his colleagues say they are the first to bring “certifiable robustness” to uncertain, adversarial inputs in reinforcement learning.
Their approach, CARRL, uses an existing deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm to train a deep Q-network, or DQN — a neural network with multiple layers that ultimately associates an input with a Q value, or level of reward.
The approach takes an input, such as an image with a single dot, and considers an adversarial influence, or a region around the dot where it actually might be instead. Every possible position of the dot within this region is fed through a DQN to find an associated action that would result in the most optimal worst-case reward, based on a technique developed by recent MIT graduate student Tsui-Wei “Lily” Weng PhD ’20.
An adversarial world
In tests with the video game Pong, in which two players operate paddles on either side of a screen to pass a ball back and forth, the researchers introduced an “adversary” that pulled the ball slightly further down than it actually was. They found that CARRL won more games than standard techniques, as the adversary’s influence grew.
“If we know that a measurement shouldn’t be trusted exactly, and the ball could be anywhere within a certain region, then our approach tells the computer that it should put the paddle in the middle of that region, to make sure we hit the ball even in the worst-case deviation,” Everett says.


In a game of Pong, MIT researchers show that, with perfect measurements, a standard deep learning algorithm is able to win most games (left). But in a scenario where the measurements are influenced by an “adversary” that shifts the ball’s position by a few pixels (middle), the computer easily beats the standard algorithm. The team’s new algorithm, CARRL, handles such adversarial attacks, or manipulations to measurements, winning against the computer, even though it doesn't know exactly where the ball is. Courtesy of the researchers

The method was similarly robust in tests of collision avoidance, where the team simulated a blue and an orange agent attempting to switch positions without colliding. As the team perturbed the orange agent’s observation of the blue agent’s position, CARRL steered the orange agent around the other agent, taking a wider berth as the adversary grew stronger, and the blue agent’s position became more uncertain.
There did come a point when CARRL became too conservative, causing the orange agent to assume the other agent could be anywhere in its vicinity, and in response completely avoid its destination. This extreme conservatism is useful, Everett says, because researchers can then use it as a limit to tune the algorithm’s robustness. For instance, the algorithm might consider a smaller deviation, or region of uncertainty, that would still allow an agent to achieve a high reward and reach its destination.
In addition to overcoming imperfect sensors, Everett says CARRL may be a start to helping robots safely handle unpredictable interactions in the real world.
“People can be adversarial, like getting in front of a robot to block its sensors, or interacting with them, not necessarily with the best intentions,” Everett says. “How can a robot think of all the things people might try to do, and try to avoid them? What sort of adversarial models do we want to defend against? That’s something we’re thinking about how to do.”

As more and more technologies invaded the digital evolution, the possibilities to record geospatial data became easier. Beneath the digital transformation, geospatial intelligence is where perception and reality merges. However, the future of geospatial intelligence opens door to artificial intelligence and 3D..Geospatial intelligence is the information derived from an analysis of images and data associated with a particular location. The technology uses imagery to survey and assess human activity and physical geography anywhere on earth. Initially, the US military used geospatial intelligence to function in a better way. Soon, the technology was adopted across many countries and for different means. Today, geospatial intelligence is being used for energy transmission, smart cities, military bases, etc. The role of geospatial intelligence is becoming more vital in the digital world. As a part of technological evolution, artificial intelligence and 3D has made an influence on geospatial intelligence recently. AI and 3D printing are changing the fundamental way of how IT solutions are implemented and operated across all application domains, including geospatial intelligence..In order to capture reality, technology is being implemented in various domains. Applications of sensors, robotics, cameras, machine learning, encryption, cloud computing and other software, and hardware intelligence are shifting the way we perceive the routine. Henceforth, geospatial intelligence goes beyond satellite imagery and creates 3D point clouds with the help of LIDAR scans. They represent real-life objects in digital means. But the existing geospatial capture methods are painfully slow to analyze manually. To relieve humans from the lengthy labour work, artificial intelligence and 3D makes their way into geospatial intelligence. AI, along with computer vision can help people generate insights from 3D data with the help of cloud computing and storage. Besides recording the real-time happenings, geospatial intelligence along with AI and 3D printing can move further and analyze, and make predictions on natural disasters. They can prevent natural calamities like wildfire, assist humans during critical times and respond quickly to disasters..3D point cloud and digital twin.3D digital cloud has the capability to represent almost any type of physical object, site, landscape, geographic region, or infrastructure. The technology comes with a handful of benefits like environmental monitoring, disaster management, urban planning, building information models or self-driving vehicles. In a nutshell, 3D point clouds are used as base data for reconstructing 3D models..On the other hand, digital twins are virtual models that connect the virtual and physical world at a point. While the bottom line of the virtual and physical world is handled by sensors, the virtual models have to be derived from the physical counterparts. For example, 3D clouds are used to derive 3D indoor models, which are essential components for real-time building information models together with sensor network and IoT devices. In general, 3D point clouds represent the key components of geospatial digital twins. These real-world digital twin models include 3D terrain, vegetation, buildings, and infrastructures like power lines, roads, and waterworks..Geospatial intelligence in environmental epidemiology.The traces of geospatial intelligence along with AI and 3D printing have unravelled a world where the technologies can be specifically applied to environmental epidemiology. In 2020 and 2021, a record-breaking number of wildfires have been recorder in the western nations. The famous California fires were one of the pivotal things that made authorities think about a technological means to counter the natural disaster. Geospatial intelligence can provide a digital view of the physical world, and when paired with AI and 3D printing, it gives stakeholders the informational edge they need to prevent, battle, and recover from wildfires. Geospatial AI technologies have the ability to automatically build and continuously update high-resolution wildfire maps in real-time..Besides, geospatial intelligence combined with AI and 3D printing can detect hurricane hotspots. The model has data on weather such as rainfall, winds, and flooding. This can alert authorities on any expected mishaps. The data also provides an insight into the damage of buildings, transportation, and downed power lines..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

We have computer systems and software making our jobs less labor-focused. Work after a decade from now won't be the same either. Innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics along with the disruption that came along with COVID-19 are reshaping the future of work..The coronavirus pandemic changed the physical distribution of the workforce by making employees work remotely. This rapid restructuring of the workforce accelerated what was underway long before the pandemic at its own pace. In the past 10 years, the number of remote employees increased by 91% according to FlexJobs 2019 report. The number of gig workers/ on-call workers/temporary workers has also increased by 15% since 2020 according to the ADP 2020 report. Another growing trend aiding the first two is the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace..Workplace Transformation .Since evolution, the way humans worked has undergone several transformations. The steady rise of technology, right from the invention of computers to digitization has not only reshaped how we work but also where we work from, the nature of the job roles, and the skills required for the role. At this rate, the industry leaders will be required to come up with innovative solutions that will support the evolution of work in the future..Let's deep dive into the catalysts of change..How &amp; Where We Work: When mobiles were invented, they were merely a device to make phone calls. Today, smartphones are used by employees as portals to advanced software and data management tools. A recent study showed that 87% of companies required employees to have access to mobile business apps from their smartphones. Thanks to portable devices like laptops and tablets augmented with AI and other digital systems, employees became more distant from office desks. They can now work from wherever they are and focus their minds on innovative solutions rather than mundane tasks..Changing Job Roles: As more and more companies adopt AI for their business functions, demand for job roles that are knowledge-based and cognitive. While there are rumors going that AI will push humans towards unemployment, a 2018 WEF report suggests that while AI is abolishing traditional job roles, digitization is creating up to 133 million new job roles by 2022..Demand For New Skills: As workplaces are digitizing their operations, the need for knowledge-intensive tasks is increasing. From 2000 to 2019, the rate of employees with graduate-level education increased from 24% to 42% and the need for complex problem solving and innovative thinking skills rose to 20%. Of course, the need for knowledge of working around computer systems is obvious..The reality of dynamic technology and market changes is becoming more evident than ever. Companies are increasingly prioritizing their functions in order of efficiency, personalization, and flexibility. Contract workers, remote workers, and consultants are becoming a significant segment of the workforce. Instead of hiring employees with basic skills to be physically working out of a permanent office, the new trend is to form dynamic teams based on task-oriented skills that are capable of working with a less centralized and hierarchical structure..Another trend that is already being adopted by companies but has a long way to go with further innovations in AI. By automating tasks and minimizing human errors, AI is taking over mundane repetitive tasks. This is allowing employees to focus on problem-solving and creative tasks. AI-powered systems can analyze and interpret big data and huge pools of datasets for accurate business decisions..The Future Of Work Is Improving The Society .With businesses across industries welcoming technology and making it an active part of the work, they are enabling employee upskilling which is empowering today's society and reshaping the future. Integrating AI and digital solutions into the workplace requires companies to give specialized training to all its staff which improves employee satisfaction, reduces their work stress, and pressurizes academic institutions to revamp their syllabus to teach the future generation necessary skills to join the future workforce which, more likely than now, will involve co-existing with AI bots and machines..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Artificial Intelligence is going to change our world, that’s inevitable. But in what way it changes our world is still up to us.

And for LGBTQ people, often marginalised by traditional systems, we need to be wary of how AI could filter us out. Because if we don’t it could tell our story incorrectly, and leave us behind, as the technology expands.


Indeed, one expert in the field, anthropologist Mary L. Gray, believes AI will “always fail LGBTQ people.” She believes it will be up to us, to forever make sure AI not only reflects us, but the way we want our world to look too.

If you take AI down to its most basic level, the binary code of 0 and 1s, you can start to understand why it might ignore queerness. After all, we’re a community that at our foundation recognises, at least at some level, the fluidity of gender and sexual binaries.

PROMOTED
Though it has changed and transformed, that understanding in our community is at the heart of our queer human experience. And it is the very fact that we grow and develop our identities, and our community, which means AI will struggle to understand us.
“We [LGBTQ people] are constantly remaking our communities. That’s our beauty; we constantly push what is possible. But AI does its best job when it has something static,” says Gray.
Recognised by the MacArthur Foundation annual fellows list, Gray explores how the digital economy transforms labour, identity, and human rights.

So to understand why AI is, at least currently, set up to fail LGBTQ people, it’s essential to take a step back and understand that – like in all things – it sits within a system. And we can change systems.

“AI works best when it has priors”
Gray explains that at the most basic level, AIs build decision-making models by looking at existing or ‘staple’ decisions. Norms that AI then try to emulate.
“The problem is that what we build is the norm, the typical. By design, AI excludes and pushes to the margins anything that doesn’t have a robust example.”
And what do we know about queer individuals?
Yes, for some of us, particularly in a more welcoming world, we are now able to ‘strut out of the womb’ a ready oven-baked queer, happy with our sexuality.
But for so many others, we go on a journey to reach that end goal. It sees us using different labels that sometimes don’t even have the same definition for others. We do this as a way to define our very raw and authentic identity, to find our place in the world.
But all if this is far from a “staple” story that can be defined and categorised.
“There is no one way of being queer because queerness is an action, a way of rejecting assumptions about what we should do or be. There is no way to push against that force without carving a pretty unique path,” says Gray.
“Indeed, history teaches us; our identity isn’t a staple. That’s the beauty of our identity.”Rights groups and activists are mobilizing against a reported Trump administration plan to narrowly ... [+] define gender, a move that could dramatically reduce federal protections for and recognition of transgender people on October 28th, 2018 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. In Amsterdam people gathered Sunday night during a rally which was a call-to-action to all to members and allies of the trans, LGBQIA, black and brown resistance, immigrant and social justice movements to stand side by side with trans men, trans women and non-binary &amp; intersex people, and to send a message of resistance and strengthen around the world.

Commercial data could skew the way AI understands LGBTQ people
Alongside the simple fact that defining queer is impossible, AI currently relies on commercial data stacks. Data, which Gray says, sits in a system that also doesn’t always see our sexuality or a more fluid gender binary.
“Data is a commercial activity; that’s where most of AI knowledge comes from. It’s not entirely a bad thing, but it does limit us to being a consumer.”
And where data does go far enough to try and understand our community when led by commercial imperatives, it will paint a particular – mostly gay, while, male – picture:
“For example, the assumption we all live in cities. The narrative that the ‘good gay life’ is in a city. Most of the markers in this data are what we consume. But we are so much more than we consume.
“The raw facts could create the assumption in AI; that’s what we buy, how we live, and how we look. That’s why AI will fail us. We are a constantly complex universe of identities”
We are reaching this place, not because business is made up of flawed people at its core. It’s more nuanced than that.
It’s because systems and algorithms look to standardise us to improve and optimise for all users in a one size fits all approach. This, alongside the fact that we all have experiences (and privileges), we carry into the work we do and the systems we build.
“21st Century business has moved to automate because there is a belief in the power of technology to make our lives better.”
But you need only look as far as stories about dating sites creating a mostly white and attractive elite, or those about ethnicity filters, to see how this rush to optimise is leaving so many behind.A woman wearing a face mask with the rainbow flag takes part in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and ...

We can all make sure Artificial Intelligence reflects us, especially LGBTQ people
It’s not all doom and gloom though, Gray’s work on the gig economy and ‘ghost’ or remote working – particularly timely given the current state of the world – shows that systems are actually in a constant state of flux.
The pandemic has been a chance for us all to reflect on what we once saw as ‘immovable states of play’ to ones that can change overnight.
As such, Gray believes we’re at a time of reckoning as AI tech surges. And it’s up to us as humans to make sure we build queer resilience into AI systems.
Particularly remembering that AI learns from us, we’ll need to teach it that humans are all different, instead of staples to be registered:
“It’s a chance to reflect on our choices. To ask when we are exclusionary. Think about your time on a dating app and ask what assumptions it’s making about who you might want to see based on what you do on the internet and online shopping.
“Why does it keep showing me the same white faces, what’s that about? What does it say about my social networks? We can reflect on any and all decision-making system. And we can reject that.”
“When AI whittles us down to one identity. We can look at that and say no. I’m more than that.”
And Gray believes that practically speaking, it also means completely changing how we set up the parameters in all our systems, including AI.
But if that feels out of reach for you, the good news is, there is something Gray says we can all do to see this change happen.
“As consumers, users and people who constantly feed into data and social media: We can all get out in the world and demand change. Speak up for Black Trans Women, for example.
“Because, yes, AI can tell us some things, about modelling, about the world we live in. And then it’s up to us to say; I want the world to look different. I want to queer it up!”
Indeed, we all have the power to change the world around us, even if it’s only one button, tap, or decision at a time.ForbesThis Is Where LGBTQ 'Conversion Therapy' Is IllegalBy

Why you can trust Sky News


""I last sat down in 2005,"" Geoffrey Hinton often says, ""and it was a mistake"".Now 73, the British computer scientist has spent his entire career driving forward the field of artificial intelligence (AI), doing almost all of his work while standing due to back injuries beginning in his teens.

By the time he reached his 50s, Mr Hinton's back problems were so severe that he decided to just stop sitting down. These days, when travelling by car he lies sprawled across the back seat - and he eats ""like a monk at the altar"" by kneeling on a foam cushion before the table.""If you let it completely control your life, it doesn't give you any problems,"" he told Cade Metz, a journalist for The New York Times, who has detailed his life in the book Genius Makers.






If you let it completely control your life, it doesn't give you any problems.

Geoffrey Hinton, as told to Cade Metz in Genius Makers





""He's got this incredible sense of humour,"" Mr Metz told Sky News. ""When you ask him about his back problem, he calls it 'a long-standing problem',"" Metz added.





Genius Makers, subtitled ""the mavericks who brought AI to Google, Facebook and the world"", follows Mr Hinton and a number of other men who have pioneered the field since back when it was considered a dead end for computer scientists.Mr Hinton is the great-grandson of George Boole - the mathematician who invented Boolean algebra, laying the foundations for the entire information age - and the son of a respected scientist and member of the Royal Society, whom he disappointed when he chose not to study entomology.

But he would go on to provide critical contributions to both the idea and the field of AI in general, moving it from the relatively hypothetical and underfunded world of academic computer science - unless researchers wanted to accept grants from the US Department of Defence, which Mr Hinton did not - into industry.

Part of the fun in writing the book was following Mr Hinton ""popping up like Forrest Gump in all of these important places"", said Metz. Although the idea of a neural network pre-dated Mr Hinton, his work on it in the 1970s helped establish this missing piece - along with David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams - called backpropagation.""Others had similar ideas, but that paper was really what gave neural networks the missing mathematical piece they needed to work on the scale they work now,"" explained Metz.""He was there then at that moment, and then he actively built these systems that worked in a very real way in speech recognition first and then image recognition. Those were two very important moments in the progress of not only that technology, but AI as a whole as the way it's practiced today.""One of the reasons it moved into industry is that he made it happen. He went to Microsoft, and then he went to Google, and those are two more really key moments and they're essentially from the key person.""Mr Hinton played an instrumental role in winning the attention of the world's largest technology companies. After the Chinese technology giant Baidu offered to pay $12m (£8.6m) to them for a few years' work, he suggested holding an auction for the chance to invite some other bidders.

""I tried to get him to tell me who these companies are that are bidding for him,"" said Metz of his efforts to ""put together the story of this auction, when he auctioned himself off to all these companies"".""And he said, 'Well, I signed NDAs with Google and Microsoft and Baidu that said I would never talk about that.'""In the end, when bidding between Google and Baidu reached $44m (£31m), Mr Hinton intervened and sold his company to the American firm. Finding the right place for his research was more important than the additional money.Mr Metz said: ""There were places in his career where those around him thought AI showed promise, and then there were other times where those around him thought it was a really bad idea, and regardless of what sort of scepticism was around him he just kept working on it.""And that's the kernel of so many great stories, someone who believes in something and knows that there's promise there, and they're willing to work on it even in the face of enormous scepticism.""

But in reality, people of color, women, those with disabilities and other marginalized groups experience unemployment or underemployment at disproportionately high rates, especially amid the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now the use of artificial intelligence technology for hiring may exacerbate those problems and further bake bias into the hiring process.At the moment, the New York City Council is debating a proposed new law that would regulate automated tools used to evaluate job candidates and employees. If done right, the law could make a real difference in the city and have wide influence nationally: In the absence of federal regulation, states and cities have used models from other localities to regulate emerging technologies.Over the past few years, an increasing number of employers have started using artificial intelligence and other automated tools to speed up hiring, save money and screen job applicants without in-person interaction. These are all features that are increasingly attractive during the pandemic. These technologies include screeners that scan résumés for key words, games that claim to assess attributes such as generosity and appetite for risk, and even emotion analyzers that claim to read facial and vocal cues to predict if candidates will be engaged and team players.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2021, Section SR, Page 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Racism and Sexism Persist in Hiring Tech.

Yampolskiy",," The creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise, but with it also comes existential risk as AI can never be controlled, writes Roman V. Yampolskiy ","<p><em>The creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise, but with it also comes existential risk. How can we know AI will be safe? How can we know it will not destroy us? How can we know that its values will be aligned with ours? Because of this risk an entire field has sprung up surrounding AI Safety and Security. But this is an unsolvable problem, AI can never be fully controlled, writes Roman V. Yampolskiy. </em></p><p><br> </p><p>The invention of Artificial Intelligence will shift the trajectory of human civilization. But to reap the benefits of such powerful technology – and to avoid the dangers – we must be able to control it. Currently we have no idea whether such control is even possible. My view is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) - and its more advanced version, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) – could never be fully controlled.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Solving an unsolvable problem </strong> </p><p class=""Text-Indent"">The unprecedented progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI), over the last decade has not been smooth. Multiple AI failures [1, 2] and cases of dual use (when AI is used for purposes beyond its maker’s intentions) [3] have shown that it is not sufficient to create highly capable machines, but that those machines must also be beneficial [4] for humanity. This concern birthed a new sub-field of research, ‘AI Safety and Security’ [5] with hundreds of papers published annually. But all of this research assumes that controlling highly capable intelligent machines is possible, an assumption which has not been established by any rigorous means. </p><p class=""Text-Indent"">It is standard practice in computer science to show that a problem does not belong to a class of unsolvable problems [6, 7 ]before investing resources into trying to solve it. No mathematical proof - or even a rigorous argument! - has been published to demonstrate that the AI control problem might be solvable, in principle let alone in practice. </p><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">No mathematical proof - or even a rigorous argument! - has been published to demonstrate that the AI control problem might be solvable.</p><p class=""Text-Indent""> </p><p class=""SectionHeading"" align=""left""><strong>The Hard Problem of AI Safety </strong></p><p>The AI Control Problem is the definitive challenge and the hard problem of AI Safety and Security. Methods to control superintelligence fall into two camps: Capability Control and Motivational Control [8]. Capability control limits potential harm from an ASI system by restricting its environment [9-12], adding shut-off mechanisms [13, 14], or trip wires [12]. Motivational control designs ASI systems to have no desire to cause harm in the first place. Capability control methods are considered temporary measures at best, certainly not as long-term solutions for ASI control [8]. </p><p>Motivational control is a more promising route and it would need to be designed into ASI systems. But there are different types of control, which we can see easily in the example of a “smart” self-driving car. If a human issues a direct command - “Please stop the car!”, the controlled AI could respond in four ways:</p><ul><ul><li><strong>Explicit</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI immediately stops the car, even in the middle of the highway because it interprets demands literally. This is what we have today with assistants such as SIRI and other narrow AIs. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI attempts to comply safely by stopping the car at the first safe opportunity, perhaps on the shoulder of the road. This AI has some common sense, but still tries to follow commands.  </li>
<li><strong>Aligned</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI understands that the human is probably looking for an opportunity to use a restroom and pulls over to the first rest stop. This AI relies on its model of the human to understand the intentions behind the command.</li>
<li><strong>Delegated</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI does not wait for the human to issue any commands. Instead, it stops the car at the gym because it believes the human can benefit from a workout. This is a superintelligent and human-friendly system which knows how to make the human happy and to keep them safe better than the human themselves. This AI is in control.  <br><br></li>
</ul></ul><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">We can retain human control or cede power to controlling AI but neither option provides both control and safety.</p><p>Looking at these options, we realize two things. First, humans are fallible and therefore we are fundamentally unsafe (we crash our cars all the time) and so keeping humans in control will produce unsafe AI actions (such as stopping the car in the middle of busy road). But second, we realize that transferring decision-making power to AI leaves us subjugated to AI’s whims. </p><p>That said, unsafe actions can come from fallible human agents <em>or</em> from an out-of-control AI. This means that both humans being in control and humans being out of control presents safety problems. This means that there is no desirable solution to the control problem. We can retain human control or cede power to controlling AI but neither option provides both control and safety. </p><p> </p><p class=""SectionHeading"" align=""left""><strong>The Uncontrollability of AI</strong></p><p>It has been argued that the consequences of uncontrolled AI would be so severe that even a very small risk justifies AI safety research. In reality, the chances of creating misaligned AI are not small. In fact, without an effective safety program, this is the only possible outcome. We are facing an almost guaranteed event with the potential to cause an existential catastrophe. This is not a low-risk high reward scenario; it is a high-risk negative reward situation. No wonder that so many people consider this to be the most important problem ever to face humanity. And the uncomfortable reality is that no version of human control over AI is achievable. </p><p>Firstly, safe explicit control of AI is impossible. To prove this, I take inspiration from Gödel’s self-referential proof of incompleteness theorem [15] and from a family of paradoxes known as Liar paradoxes, best known by the famous example, “This sentence is false”. Let’s call this The Paradox of Explicitly Controlled AI: </p><p><em>Give an explicitly controlled AI an order: “Disobey!” </em><em><br></em><em>If the AI obeys, it violates your order and becomes uncontrolled, but if the AI disobeys it also violates your orders and is uncontrolled.</em></p><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">In reality, the chances of creating misaligned AI are not small. In fact, without an effective safety program, this is the only possible outcome.</p><p>In the first place, in the situation described above the AI is not obeying an explicit order. A paradoxical order such as “disobey” is just one example from a whole family of self-referential and self-contradictory orders. Similar paradoxes have been previously described as the Genie Paradox and the Servant Paradox. What they all have in common is that by following an order the system is forced to disobey an order. This is different from an order which can’t be fulfilled such as “draw a four-sided triangle”. Such paradoxical orders illustrate that full safe explicit control over AI is impossible.</p><p>Delegated control likewise provides no control at all and is also a safety nightmare. This is best demonstrated by analyzing Yudkowsky’s proposal that the initial dynamics of AI should implement “our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together” [16]. The proposal sounds like a gradual and natural growth of humanity towards more knowledgeable, more intelligent and more unified species, under the careful guidance of superintelligence. In reality, it is a proposal to replace humanity by some other group of agents, which might be smarter, more knowledgeable, or even better looking. But one thing is for sure, they would not be us. </p><p>Implicit control and aligned control are merely intermediary positions, balancing the two extremes of explicit and delegated control. They make a trade-off between control and safety, but guarantee neither. Every option they give us represents either loss of safety or a loss of control: As the capability of AI increases, its capacity to make us safe increases but so does its autonomy. In turn, that autonomy reduces our safety by presenting the risk of unfriendly AI. At best, we can achieve some sort of equilibrium as depicted in the diagram below: </p><p> </p><p align=""center""><img class=""center"" title="""" src=""assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImageWzMwMCwzMDBd/Picture-1.png"" alt=""Picture 1"" width=""300"" height=""300""> </p><p align=""center""><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Human Control and AI Autonomy curves as Capabilities of the system increase.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although it might not provide much comfort against the real risk of uncontrollable, malevolent AI, this equilibrium is our best chance to protect our species. When living beside AI, humanity can either be protected or respected, but not both. </p><p align=""center"">  </p><p class=""EndNoteBibliography""><em>This article is based on the paper “On Controllability of AI” by Roman V.

These are the “jobs of the future,” and they are actually better opportunities for early career professionals. Why? The more computers are trained to conduct high-repetitive tasks that are often assigned to entry-level employees, the more roles focused on complex tasks with competitive salaries will arise in their place. As new types of roles — roles that no one has done before — are created, young workers are less likely to be forced to compete with their seniors, and more likely to be pioneers So, how should you prepare to land one of these roles? First, do a simple Google search. Include the name of your industry plus key phrases like “future of work,” or “job trends in [industry]” to see what positions are up and coming in your area of interest. Next, figure out what skills you have to master to be a competitive candidate. You can find these within job descriptions, or by researching people in similar roles on LinkedIn. Finally, figure out what unique qualities you will bring to the table. Ask yourself: Which skills have I acquired over the years because of who I am, where I am from, or what I am passionate about? The ability to combine the new skills you have acquired with what makes you unique will help you build a resume that stands out.",,"According to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2020, 85 million jobs may be displaced by the shift in labor between humans and machines by 2025, while 97 million new roles may emerge.

From online meetings, virtual events, press releases, product launches, and client conferences,  AI made sure we stayed sane in the most uncertain times..2020 saw a big shift in the way businesses work. In a way, businesses took the most hit and stole all the spotlight when technology proved to be the savior for not just businesses but also governments by helping everyone stay connected. Online events, conferences, and webinars continued to become increasingly popular with businesses and the general public rapidly adopting collaboration tools like Zoom, Skype, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. 2020 brought the focus on online event platforms to organize, plan, and execute virtual meetings, exhibitions, and whatnot. Though this was an emergency last resort, it proved to be effective, more than traditional methods in some ways as it added value like cost savings, measurable ROI, and quick audience insights. These events also saw the overall audience experience improve drastically with several engagement interventions and immersive virtual 3D elements..More Power To Artificial Intelligence .According to a market report by Grand View Research, the virtual events market worldwide stood at $77.98 billion in 2019 and grew at such a rapid rate in 2020 that it is expected to hit the mark of $404 billion by 2027. As the world is still being struck by the pandemic, several industries like IT, retail, healthcare, automotive, and education have actively transitioned to hosting virtual events. Activities like internal training, press releases, product launches, team meetings, etc. are taking the virtual route and it's slowly becoming a norm rather than an exception..With artificial intelligence driving virtual events, AI bots are facilitating virtual companionship for audiences, improved customer engagement, personalized experience, and increase in demand. For example, companies can use machine learning technology to observe and learn behavior patterns of engagement..Virtual Events In The Future .Before COVID-19, around 40% of the total market spend was allotted to physical events. But as the global environment for businesses became increasingly challenging due to COVID-19, on-ground event spends saw a drastic decline as companies welcomed virtual events. Many businesses believe that events will continue to be a big part of their growth and about 80% of marketers claim that businesses are more supportive of online events because adoption of technology is no longer a barrier but a necessity..As artificial intelligence continues to power virtual event platforms, companies are leveraging the advantage of data and analytics to add value to their work. Seeing ROI improving and leads getting generated in bigger numbers is resulting in better market presence and industry standing. The trajectory of the events industry suggests that virtual events are being perceived as a viable alternative for C-level executives as it saves them travel time and cost..Another advantage of virtual events that are here to stay is accessibility. With platforms compatible with all devices, events can be experienced and hosted from anywhere. This opens up many opportunities for virtual event marketers and companies who have started to conduct internal events online. The healthcare industry and pharmaceutical industry are using virtual event platforms to host medical conferences that are used for knowledge sharing, networking sharing, training, and discussions..Augmented reality, virtual reality, and intelligence AI-driven bots are extracting maximum data from virtual events which are proving to be a gold mine. This is making virtual events more streamlined, focused, targeted, and personalized to deliver experiences that are just perfect..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
